This appeal followed denial of appellants\u2019 motion to set aside the judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 473.)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"> Appellants claim, for the first time on appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that they substantially complied with the rules governing rejection of arbitration awards, so that entry of judgment based upon that award was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">According to rule 1615(c) of the California Rules of Court, a judgment must be entered upon an arbitrator\u2019s award \u201cforthwith upon the expiration of 20 days after the award is filed if no party has, during that period, served and filed a <em>request for trial </em>as provided in these rules.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Rule 1616(a) provides that \u201cwithin 20 days after the arbitration award is <em>filed </em>with the clerk of the court, any party may request a trial in the superior court by filing with the clerk a <em>request for </em>trial....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Rules 1615(c) and 1616(a) are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>based upon section 1141.20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which directs: \u201cAn arbitration award shall be final if a request for a de novo trial is not filed within 20 days after the date the arbitrator files the award with the court.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Appellants concede that they did not strictly comply with either state or local rules of court, since their request for a \u201cTrial De Novo\u201d was not filed until March 20, 1980, 23 days after the arbitrator\u2019s award was filed with the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, they claim that their \u201cRejection of Arbitrator\u2019s Award,\u201d filed well within the 20-day period, substantially complied with legal requirements and should thus be deemed a sufficient assertion of their right to a trial after arbitration. Appellants call upon this court to apply the doctrine of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d to the de novo trial request requirements of section 1141.20 and rules 1615(c) and 1616(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Neither section 1411.20 nor rules 1615(c) and 1616(a) expressly provide for a rule of substantial compliance with statutory directives. Both the statute and court rules simply direct that a \u201crequest for trial\u201d must be filed within 20 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The local rules of the Santa Clara County Superior Court are more explicit; they require the party dissatisfied with an arbitration award to timely file (1) a request for trial; (2) a motion to restore the case to civil active list; and (3) an \u201cAt Issue Memorandum Certificate of Readiness.\u201d No provision is made for compliance which does not strictly satisfy these legal requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Appellants suggest, however, that application of a substantial compliance test is justified here, and we agree, finding authority for application of that test by analogy to other related areas of law\u2014as, for example, the claim filing requirements of the tort claims act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 900 et seq.) That act imposes specific requirements regarding the substantive content of a claim* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which must be presented to a public entity within 100 days after accrual of a personal injury or property damage cause of action. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2.) However, it is well-settled that \u201c[wjhere there has been an attempt to comply but the compliance is defective, the test of substantial compliance controls.\u201d. <em>(Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 183, 188 [165 Cal.Rptr. 29]; see also <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 456 [115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d 701, 76 A.L.R.3d 1223].) Since the function of the claims act is to apprise the governmental body of imminent legal action in order that it may investigate and evaluate the claim and, where appropriate, avoid litigation by settling meritorious claims our courts employ a test of substantial rather than strict compliance in evaluating whether a plaintiff has met its requirement. <em>(City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 464; <em>Elias </em>v. <em>San Bernardino County Flood Control Dist. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 70, 74 [135 Cal.Rptr. 621].) If a claim satisfies the purpose of the act without prejudice to the government, substantial compliance will be found. <em>(Elias </em>v. <em>San Bernardino Flood Control Dist. supra; Jamison </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 513, 518 [107 Cal.Rptr. 496].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Additional examples of judicial acceptance of substantial compliance with statutory standards abound, such as: the content of affidavits supporting a claim against the estate of a decedent pursuant to Probate Code section 705 <em>(United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>v. <em>Keck </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 828, 831 [171 P.2d 731]); a general plan adopted by a county according to state planning and zoning laws under Government Code section 65000 et seq. <em>(Camp </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334, 348 [176 Cal.Rptr. 620]); the requirements for service of summons upon a corporation in accordance with section 412.30 of the Code of Civil Procedure <em>(Cory </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 665, 667 [177 Cal.Rptr. 150]; <em>Schering Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 737, 741 [125 Cal.Rptr. 337]); the notice of completion required to shorten the time within which a claim of mechanics lien may be filed under Civil Code section 3093 <em>(Gary C. Tanko Well Drilling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dodds </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 588, 594-595 [172 Cal.Rptr. 829]); the written specification of reasons for granting a new trial pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 657 <em>(La Manna </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 413, 422 [118 Cal.Rptr. 761, 530 P.2d 1073]; <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Shandor </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 476 [87 Cal.Rptr. 443]); the notice requirements for a project determined to be exempt from the California. Environmental Quality Act with which a local public agency must comply under Public Resources Code section 21152 <em>(International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 265, 272-273 [171 Cal.Rptr. 875]); the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 587 for affidavits filed in support of an application by a plaintiff for entry of default <em>(Stevenson </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 315, 318 [156 Cal.Rptr. 499]); the affidavit requirements of section 685 of the Code of Civil Procedure imposed upon a spouse for recovery of support arrearages due beyond a period of 10 years <em>(Leiden </em>v. <em>Hudson </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 72, 75-76 [156 Cal.Rptr. 489]); and the content requirements of a notice of appeal (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1(a); <em>Estate of Roberson </em>(1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 267, 270 [250 P.2d 179]).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">While the Legislature has expressly declared that it intended mandatory arbitration to serve as a \u201csimplified and economical ... resolution of ... disputes\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1141.10, subd. (b)(1)), 1141.20 and Rules of Court 1615(c) and 1616(a) were added to provide that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>\u201cparty who is dissatisfied with the arbitration award is free to take the action to trial.\u201d <em>(Trump </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d 411, 415.) Accordingly, in our view the purpose of the 20-day limitation imposed by section 1141.20 and rules 1615(a) and 1616(a) is served by a combined form of notice which, in substance, promptly and adequately informs both the court and any adverse party of the intent to elect a trial de novo. <em>(City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 447, 456; <em>Gary C. Tanko Well Drilling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dodds, supra, </em>117 Cal.App.3d 588, 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">We find nothing in section 1141.20 or the applicable Rules of Court to indicate that only strict compliance will be tolerated. On the contrary, since the purposes and policies of the laws may be satisfied by substantial compliance, we adopt that test here. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 717, 722-723 [108 Cal.Rptr. 835, 511 P.2d 1187]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 500, 504 [126 Cal.Rptr. 652].)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\u201c\u2018Substantial compliance, as the phrase is used in decisions, means <em>actual </em>compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute,\u2019 as distinguished from \u2018mere technical imperfections of form.\u2019\u201d <em>(Camp </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334, 348 [176 Cal.Rptr. 620]; see also <em>Stasher </em>v. <em>Harger-Haldeman </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 23, 29 [22 Cal.Rptr. 657, 372 P.2d 649].)  Here, appellants' \u201cRejection of Arbitrator\u2019s Award\u201d sufficiently alerted both the trial court and respondents to appellants\u2019 election under Rules of Court 1615(c) and 1616(a) to take the case to trial. It was promptly filed and its intent was clear. We thus conclude that the rejection substantially complied with the rules governing a request for a trial after arbitration, making the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment erroneous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the superior court with directions to restore the cause to the civil active list pursuant to California Rules of Court rule 1616(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Racanelli, P. J., and Martin, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Appellants did not specifically raise this issue in the trial court; the- only issue presented there was the availability of a motion to set aside the arbitrator\u2019s award and judgment pursuant to section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Appellants would thus be precluded from raising this issue on appeal except that it presents a strict question of law based upon evidence presented to the trial court and contained in the record on appeal. Where a theory advanced for the first time on appeal \u201cpresents only a question of law arising from facts which are undisputed, appellate review is authorized.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mills </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 171, 175 [146 Cal.Rptr. 411]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 585, 588 [164 Cal.Rptr. 475].)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Here, all facts relating to the legal sufficiency of the \u201cRejection of Arbitrator\u2019s Award\u201d\u2014the document itself\u2014were presented to the court below and are contained in the record. Respondents have been given full opportunity to respond both factually and legally to the issue, but have elected to submit only the \u201cAgreed Statement\u201d\u2014which includes only respondents\u2019 \u201cMemorandum in Opposition to Set Aside Judgment\u201d filed with the trial court\u2014rather than a responsive brief. We will therefore consider the issue on appeal in light of the record presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Rule 1615(c) of the California Rules of Court provides: \u201cThe clerk shall enter the award as a judgment forthwith upon the expiration of 20 days after the award is filed if no party has, during that period, served and filed a request for trial as provided in these rules. Promptly upon entry of the award as a judgment the clerk shall mail notice of entry of judgment to all parties who have appeared in the case and shall execute a certificate of mailing and place it in the court\u2019s file in the case.

(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1(a); <em>Vibert </em>v. <em>Berger </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 65, 68 [48 Cal.Rptr. 886, 410 P.2d 390].) We do this despite the direction in Code of Civil Procedure section 1141.23 that an arbitrator\u2019s award entered in the judgment book \u201cis not subject to appeal .... \u201d This is so because section 1141.23 also declares that an arbitrator\u2019s award should be entered and given \u201cforce and effect as a judgment\u201d only \u201c[i]f there is no request for a de novo trial .... \u201d We have found the request for trial sufficient here, and thus conclude that appeal was properly taken from the erroneously entered judgment. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider appellants\u2019 claim that a motion to set aside a judgment entered upon an arbitrator\u2019s award is proper under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
