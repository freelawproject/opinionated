Cavalletto, George A. Cavalletto, Jr., and Pattie J. Cavalletto, are the owners and lessors of real property in Roseville, California. Defendant Carrows Restaurants, Inc. (Car-rows), leased the property in May of 1978 and commenced to build a restaurant. On August 9, 1978, Carrows entered into a construction contract with Frank V. Favaloro,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doing business as Roman West Construction. Favaloro, in turn, contracted with plaintiff Bentz Plumbing <em>&amp; </em>Heating (Bentz) to install the plumbing in the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The contract between Carrows and Favaloro provided for monthly payments to the prime contractor. It required that \u201c[l]ien waiver releases from all sub-contractors must be submitted before further payments are approved\u201d and prescribed the form of the waiver. As each application for payment was made by Favaloro, it was required to be accompanied by lien waivers for the work claimed in the previous application. After six progress payments had been made by Carrows, the relationship between it and the prime contractor broke down and the construction was finished by another contractor and new subcontractors. With three applications, Favaloro obtained lien waivers from Bentz acknowledging the receipt of $7,500, $4,000 and $3,000, respectively, and \u201cwaiv[ing] and releas[ing] any and all lien, or claim or right of lien on said above described building and premises on account of labor or materials, or both, furnished or which may be furnished by the undersigned .... \u201d On the lower portion of each waiver was a notation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>typed in by the prime contractor, giving directions for allocation of the amount of the waiver to different payment periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Although the lien waivers acknowledged receipt of $14,500 by Bentz, Bentz actually received $6,750 from Favaloro. The parties stipulated that Bentz is entitled to an additional $14,406.49. Defendants now contend that the trial court erred in ruling that Bentz\u2019s lien rights were \u201cnot impaired in any respect\u201d by the waivers. Bentz cross-appeals from the trial court\u2019s refusal to award prejudgment interest on the amount found to be due it. We uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling as to the lien waivers, but reverse the denial of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Civil Code section 3262 provides: \u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), neither the owner nor original contractor by any term of their contract, or otherwise, shall waive, affect, or impair the claims and liens of other persons whether with or without notice, and any term of the contract to that effect shall be null and void. [1i] (b) Neither the owner who is a natural person, nor the original contractor shall by any term of their contract, or otherwise, waive, affect, or impair the claims or liens of other persons whether with or without notice, except by their written consent and any term of the contract to that effect shall be null and void, if the contract is for the construction of any of the following: [H] (1) A single family dwelling or duplex. [It] (2) Improvements to a single family dwelling or duplex. [1\u00cd] (3) Improvements to real property upon which a single family dwelling or duplex is located, or is to be located, where the improvement is related to such residential use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Defendants urge us to read the statute as \u201cmerely precluding] the <em>owner </em>or <em>original contractor </em>from waiving or impairing the claims and liens of <em>other </em>persons by any term of their original contract, or otherwise.\u201d Nothing in the language of the statute, they contend, prevents a \u00bf\u00ab\u00bfcontractor from executing an \u201cindividual lien waiver[].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The construction urged by defendants would defeat the legislative purpose of the statute to protect lienholders against having to consent to impairment of their rights for lack of bargaining power. \u201c[T]he courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>have uniformly classified the mechanics\u2019 lien law as remedial legislation, to be liberally construed for the protection of laborers and materialmen.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) <em>(Connolly Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 803, 826-827 [132 Cal.Rptr. 477, 553 P.2d 637]; <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Bertelson </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 430, 432 [35 P.2d 318].)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Civil Code section 3262 was amended to its present form in 1972. (Stats. 1972, ch. 1319, \u00a7 1, p. 2627.) Prior to its amendment', it read: \u201cNeither the owner nor original contractor by any term of their contract, or otherwise, shall waive, affect, or impair the claims and liens of other persons whether with or without notice <em>except by their written consent </em>and any term of the contract to that effect shall be null and void.\u201d (Italics added.) (As added by Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, p. 2780, operative Jan. 1, 1971.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The italicized language was deleted by the 1972 amendment, making clear the Legislature\u2019s intent to preclude the impairment or waiver of liens by consent of the lienholder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>argument that section 3262 is limited to waiver provisions <em>within </em>the contract between the owner and contractor is belied by the statutory language. It says that neither the owner nor original contractor \u201cby any term of their contract, <em>or </em>otherwise,\u201d shall \u201caffect or impair\u201d a subcontractor\u2019s lien. (Italics added.) To require a subcontractor to consent to a lien waiver to secure payments due a prime contractor at the least \u201caffect[s]\u201d and probably \u201cimpair[s]\u201d the lien by the threat of resulting nonpayment to the subcontractor. As such, it was \u201cnull and void\u201d under Civil Code section 3262 and the lien waivers secured thereby are similarly invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Defendants alternatively claim that the averments of payment on the lien waivers estop Bentz from showing that it received less money in payment than was represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Before the 1972 amendment of Civil Code section 3262 it was settled that estoppel might be invoked against a liening subcontractor or materialman who, in order to induce payment from the owner, had given the contractor a waiver of lien, or a false receipt of payment, or a promise to look only to the contractor for his money. <em>(R. D. Reeder Lathing Co. </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 373, 378-379 [57 Cal.Rptr. 841, 425 P.2d 785] [contractor and subcontractor concealed the latter\u2019s existence to preclude owner from requiring a formal written lien waiver]; <em>Ware Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Sacramento Savings &amp; L. Assn. </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 398 [54 Cal.Rptr. 674] [subcontractor promised to look only to contractor]; <em>Jaekle </em>v. <em>Halton </em>(1938) 25 Cal.App.2d 706, 709-713 [78 P.2d 441] [materialman issued premature receipts].) Our research has uncovered no published decisions considering the effect of the 1972 amendment of Civil Code section 3262 on this rule.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The amendment was in response to this law. If we were to now hold that a subcontractor or materialman is estopped by its execution of a lien waiver we would entirely negate section 3262 as amended. Public policy, expressed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>that statute, precludes an owner from relying \u201creasonably\u201d upon such a waiver. Nor will the doctrine of equitable estoppel, \u201cwhich rests firmly upon a foundation of conscience and fair dealing\u201d <em>(City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Mansell </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 462, 488 [91 Cal.Rptr. 23, 476 P.2d 423]; fn. omitted), allow an application of the doctrine which turns on its head the legislative judgment that principles of \u201cfair dealing\u201d require that subcontractors and materialmen be protected from overreaching by owners and prime contractors intent on depriving them of their lien rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">We do not mean to denigrate the legitimacy of the owner\u2019s interest in knowing whether and how much subcontractors and materialmen with potential lien claims on his property have been paid by the prime contractor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We observe, however,, that there are several means of protecting their interests. The property owner may limit his lien liability to the measure of the prime contract price by recordation of the contract where a payment bond has been obtained by the prime contractor in an amount equal to 50 percent of the contract price. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3123, 3235, 3236.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The owner may himself, by purchase and recordation of a payment bond in like amount, secure priority over mechanics\u2019 liens. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3139; <em>Connolly Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 808.) Finally, defendants could have issued joint checks to pay for each subcontractor\u2019s work (i.e., checks made out to the prime contractor and the subcontractor or materialman as joint payees). Estoppel <em>may </em>be invoked against a subcontractor which endorses a joint check, on the ground that its inclusion as payee makes it clear that the maker of the check intends thereby to discharge his obligation to the subcontractor. <em>(Post Bros. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Yoder </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 1, 5-6 [141 Cal.Rptr. 28, 569 P.2d 133]; <em>Re-Bar Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 134, 136 [32 Cal.Rptr. 607]; see also Cal.

Bar Bull. 250, 254 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Bentz cross-appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of prejudgment interest (from Jan. 1, 1979, identified in the mechanic\u2019s lien as the date when the obligation became due) under Civil Code section 3287, which prescribes, in subdivision (a), such an award of interest where damages are \u201ccertain, or capable of being made certain by calculation .... \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although it is true that there was initially some dispute among the parties concerning the amount of work completed by Bentz under the contract, which was resolved by a stipulation at the commencement of the trial, we are persuaded that this case is analogous to situations where the party claiming to be entitled to prejudgment interest holds a liquidated contractual claim subject to an unliquidated setoff for defective performance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In such cases, it is settled that prejudgment interest should be awarded on the balance of the claim after deduction of the unliquidated setoff. <em>(Leaf </em>v. <em>Phil Rauch, Inc. </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 371, 376 [120 Cal.Rptr. 749]; <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Covell </em>(1933) 218 Cal. 622, 629 [24 P.2d 772, 89 A.L.R. 670]; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal.

Reynoso, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Favaloro did not appeal and made no appearance as respondent in this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Civil Code section 3262 is descended from a nearly identical provision enacted in 1885: \u201cIt shall not be competent for the owner and contractor, or either of them, by any term of their contract, or otherwise, to waive, affect, or impair the claims and liens of other persons, whether with or without notice, except by their written consent, and any term of the contract to that effect shall be null and void.\u201d (Former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1201, added by Stats. 1885, ch. 152, \u00a7 7, p. 146.) Before the enactment of this statute, there was a conflict in authority whether an owner and prime contractor could by a provision of their contract waive the rights of subcontractors and materialmen. (Compare <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Aubrey </em>(1863) 22 Cal. 566, 570-571 [subcontractor bound by contract] with <em>Whittier </em>v. <em>Wilbur </em>(1874) 48 Cal. 175, 177-178 [subcontractor not bound].) The conflict arose because of the general rule at that time that the rights of subcontractors and materialmen were subject and subordinate to the prime contract, so that lien rights were limited to the amount still owing the prime contractor when the liens were recorded. <em>(Renton </em>v. <em>Conley </em>(1874) 49 Cal. 185, 187-188; <em>Dingley </em>v. <em>Greene </em>(1880) 54 Cal. 333; 335-337.) The statute settled the conflict by requiring a lien waiver by the written consent of the subcontractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\">defendants concede that the object of the 1972 amendment was to protect subcontractors and materialmen from being forced to consent in writing to impairment of their lien rights in order to get the job or to get paid. It reflects an evident legislative judgment that, except in regard to some (single-family \u00f3r duplex) residential construction, the economic ability of owners and prime contractors to extract consent deprived subcontractors and materialmen of the protection which the mechanics\u2019 lien laws are intended to afford. To read the statute as defendants urge us to do would render the 1972 amendment a nullity. If owners and prime contractors are not prevented by the statute from extracting individual lien waivers from subcontractors and materialmen, nothing is gained by prohibiting what defendants admit is certainly covered by the statute\u2014securing consent to a provision in the prime contract waiving all lien rights. The same inequality of bargaining power will compel subcontractors to give their reluctant \u201cconsent\u201d to impairments of their rights where, as here, continued payments to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>prime contractor depend\" upon its obtaining and presenting lien waivers. This is precisely the situation at hand, as Bentz furnished the waivers upon Favaloro\u2019s representation that he needed them in order to obtain payment from Carrows.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b144-10\"><em>E.
