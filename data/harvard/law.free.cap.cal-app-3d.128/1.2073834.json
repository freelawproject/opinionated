(hereinafter Hazon) appeals from a judgment denying its petition for a writ of mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>commanding respondents City of Santa Monica, its mayor and city councilmen (all of whom are collectively hereinafter sometimes referred to as City) and respondent William Rome, the chief building officer (hereinafter Rome), to reinstate a building permit previously issued to Hazon or to issue a new building permit or, in lieu of doing either, to approve a final subdivision map submitted by Hazon without the necessity of Hazon fulfilling one of the conditions of tentative tract map approval that the dwelling units in the building be reduced in number from 14 to 10. Petitioners A.A.V. (hereinafter AAV), 828 Arizona Street Properties (hereinafter 828), and Natale and Juliette Urbano (hereinafter Urbanos) appeal from similar judgments denying their requested writs of mandate that would have compelled respondents to either issue building permits to them or, in lieu thereof, approve their respective final subdivision maps without the necessity of any of them complying with the tentative subdivision map approval condition that the number of dwelling units in each of their respective apartment buildings be reduced. Because common questions of law are involved in each appeal, the four separate appeals have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">On June 5, 1978, the planning commission of City approved a tentative subdivision map submitted by petitioner 828 for the condominium conversion of an 11-unit apartment building. The approval was conditioned upon, among other things, the reduction in the number of dwelling units from 11 to 9 together with various other conditions. Similar tentative tract map approvals containing similar conditions reducing the number of dwelling units in their apartment buildings that were being converted to condominiums were obtained by the Urbanos on February 5, 1979, by AAV on March 5, 1979, and by Hazon on March 19, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Qn April 9, 1979, City issued a building permit to Hazon to authorize the construction incident to reducing the number of units in its building. The next day, April 10, 1979, the Santa Monica City electorate adopted chapter XVIII to the Santa Monica City Charter known as the \u201cRent Control Charter Amendment\u201d (hereinafter RCCA) which prohibits removal of controlled rental units by demolition, conversion or other means without obtaining approval of such removal from the Santa Monica Rent Control Board (hereinafter RGB).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Thereafter, City enacted ordinance No. 1127 (CCS) on June 29, 1979, for the purpose of codifying, clarifying and implementing the rent control initiative into the new rent control law. Said rent control law contains provisions under which persons seeking vested right exemptions may apply for such through the new RCB.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Thereafter on July 2, 1979, respondent City issued a \u201cstop notice\u201d for work being done under the building permit previously issued to Hazon. The permit subsequently expired. According to the declaration of respondent Rome filed in this and other proceedings, it is the present policy of respondent City \u201cthat no new building permits for the purpose of combining units as part of a condominium conversion will be issued unless the Rent Control Board has given its approval, either through a removal permit issued under section 1803(t) of the Rent Control Act, or through a vested rights determination made pursuant to chapter 6 of the Board\u2019s rules and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Appellant Hazon filed acclaim for vested right determination with the RCB that was denied on July 19, 1979. Judicial review of that determination has never been sought. Petitioner Hazon made demand on respondent City to reinstate its building permit on January 2, 1980; said demand was denied and petitioner Hazon filed suit January 11, 1980. Hazon\u2019s tentative tract map expired March 18, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">None of the other three appellants ever obtained the building permits that were necessary to reduce the number of units in their respective apartment buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">The Urbanos applied to have their fin\u00e1l subdivision map placed on respondent City council\u2019s agenda for approval; such request was denied on November 14, 1979, and they were told to first obtain a removal permit from the RCB. RCB denied their vested right claim on January 8, 1980, and no judicial review was sought of such denial. Respondent Rome denied an application for a building permit on January 22, 1980, for lack of RCB approval. On February 4, 1980, the City planning commission denied the Urbanos\u2019 request for an extension of their tentative tract map which expired on February 5, 1980. On the same day the Urbanos filed their petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Petitioner 828\u2019s application for a one-year extension of its tentative tract map was approved on May 21, 1979, with the added condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>that it obtain RCB approval prior to filing its final tract map or else have established a legally recognized vested right. Thereafter its application for a building permit was denied on November 28, 1979, for lack of prior RCB approval. Thereafter 828 filed an application for vested right determination with the RCB but withdrew the application on January 10, 1980, the day that it was scheduled to be heard. Its petition was filed February 14, 1980; its tentative tract map expired May 20, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Appellant AAV applied for a building permit June 4, 1979. Respondent Rome denied said application on February 29, 1980, for lack of RCB approval. The record before us does not disclose whether appellant AAV ever applied to the RCB for either a removal permit or a vested rights determination. Said appellant filed its petition on February 4, 1980, the day its tentative tract map expired. AAV submitted to the trial court a declaration indicating that it had expended $35,000 in replacing, repairing or upgrading various components of the subject premises \u201cin anticipation of the approval of the condominium conversion application concerning the subject property and pursuant to the conditions of approval of tentative tract 36459, ...\u201d The trial court found that petitioners had expended said monies for cosmetic and minor repairs and painting of the existing building and swimming pool in anticipation of receiving and in reliance on tentative tract map approval, but that petitioners did not incur the major expense of reducing the number of existing units by almost one-third from 22 to 16, which reduction was required to fulfill the conditions imposed on the tentative tract map.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Issue on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">When a landowner holding a tentative tract map conditioned on reducing the number of dwelling units in a proposed condominium conversion is required by subsequently enacted legislation to obtain a permit from a newly created rent control board authorizing the removal of a controlled rental unit, is such requirement an impermissible impairment of the subdivision process? For the reasons hereinafter stated, we conclude it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Appellants\u2019 principal contention is that local government may not enforce subsequently enacted legislation to the possible detriment of a developer who is already the possessor of a tentative tract map.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Appellants rely on <em>Youngblood </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 644 [150 Cal.Rptr. 242, 586 P.2d 556], and <em>El Patio </em>v. <em>Permanent Rent Control Bd. </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 915 [168 Cal.Rptr. 276], for the proposition that the application of the subsequently enacted removal permit requirement to their projects constitutes the improper addition of a condition of approval to their respective final maps, which condition did not exist when their tentative maps were approved prior to adoption of the charter amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">In <em>Youngblood </em>the San Diego County Board of Supervisors approved a tentative subdivision map for one acre residential lots. Shortly thereafter, the board revised the land use element of the county general plan requiring two acre minimum lot sizes for the property in question. The Supreme Court in <em>Youngblood </em>held that the board acted properly in approving the final map of one acre lots on the grounds that the final map was required only to conform to the general plan in effect when the tentative map was approved. The court\u2019s reasoning was explained as follows: \u201cThe purpose of [Bus. &amp; Prof. Code] section 11549.6, as we perceive it, was to confirm that the date when the tentative map comes before the governing body for approval is the crucial date when that body should decide whether to permit the proposed subdivision. Once the tentative map is approved, the developer often must expend substantial sums to comply with the conditions attached to that approval. These expenditures will result in the construction of improvements consistent with the proposed subdivision, but often inconsistent with alternative uses of the land. <em>Consequently it is only fair to the developer and to the public interest to require the governing body to render its discretionary decision whether and upon what conditions to approve the proposed subdivision when it acts on the tentative map. Approval of the final map thus becomes a ministerial act once the appropriate officials certify that it is in substantial compliance with the previously approved tentative map. </em>(Italics added.) <em>(Great Western Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.3d 403, 411 ....)\u201d (22 Cal.3d at pp. 655-656.)</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">In <em>El Patio </em>the developer had obtained a tentative tract map before the rent control act was enacted. Thereafter, when the developer sought an extension of the tentative tract map which would otherwise have expired, the City granted such extension conditioned upon the landowner obtaining a \u201ccertificate of exemption or a removal permit or a determination of vested rights\u201d from the RCB prior to approval of the final tract map. In the course of its opinion, the <em>El Patio </em>court said: \u201cWe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>cannot disregard the provisions of Government Code sections 66473 and 66474 which indicate that a legislative body may not impose additional conditions once the tentative map is approved.\u201d <em>(El Patio </em>at p. 925.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Both cases are distinguishable from the facts before us. While it is true that the removal permit requirement did not exist when the tentative maps were approved, it is also true that the conditions of the tentative maps required reduction in the number of units. These reductions necessitated building permits, and were, therefore, subject to the requirement under general law and Building Code section 303(a) that appellants comply with laws in effect at the time of issuance of the building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The <em>El Patio </em>decision was a narrow one which expressly recognized the viability of police power-based regulations. <em>El Patio </em>merely follows <em>Youngblood </em>in holding that the City had to approve a final map where the property owner had complied with the conditions originally attached to the tentative map, which did not include rent control approval. (110 Cal.App.3d at p. 927.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The <em>El Patio </em>court clearly did not address the question of whether or not the developer there could actually proceed with the intended project. The court had before it a case involving an intended conversion to condominiums of an existing structure. No building permit was needed. The owner had sought a vested right determination from the board, but had failed because, inter alia, the City had refused to approve a final map, after having added rent control approval as a condition of an extension of the time limit on the tentative map.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The court was very careful to distinguish those cases upholding police power regulation in spite of tract map approvals, and to make clear the narrow scope of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The <em>El Patio </em>opinion differentiates the case of <em>Kappadahl </em>v. <em>Alcan Pacific Co. </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 626 [35 Cal.Rptr. 354], which holds that final subdivision map approval does not bind the police powers of the city with respect to future zoning changes. As to <em>Kappadahl, </em>the <em>El Patio </em>court stated: \u201cIn <em>Kappadahl, </em>long after the final map had been approved, a zoning change was made. The Court in <em>Kappadahl </em>rejected the contention that the final map is binding as to future zoning changes. As indicated in <em>Kappadahl, </em>the approval of a final map does not bind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the police power of the City. The City here, however, is acting contrary to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and <em>Kappadahl </em>is not authority for the proposition that a local agency can resort to the police power to circumvent the express provisions of the Subdivision Map Act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>110 Cal.App.3d at pp. 926-927.)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The <em>El Patio </em>court next discusses <em>Avco Community Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Coast Regional Com. </em>(1977) 17 Cal.3d 785 [132 Cal.Rptr. 386, 553 P.2d 546], which holds that a developer must comply with the laws in effect at the time a building permit is to be issued, even laws which have been enacted after application for the permit. In distinguishing <em>Avco, </em>the <em>El Patio </em>court said: \u201cThe same factor distinguishes the building permit cases [citation]. <em>If the City were asked to issue a building permit, the issues in this case would be different. However, here the building is completed and no building permit is needed. </em>Rather the City has attempted to impose an additional condition after approval of the conditional tentative map. (Italics added.) <em>(Id., </em>110 Cal.App.3d at p. 927.)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The court followed with this conclusion: \u201cAccordingly, our conclusion is extremely narrow in scope. We hold only that the City could not impose additional conditions after the conditional approval of the tentative map. <em>Nothing herein should be construed as a determination that the approval of a tentative map would allow a property owner to proceed without obtaining other permits which the City might impose if it were not relying upon the Subdivision Map Act </em>(See <em>Oceanic California, Inc. </em>v. <em>North Central Coast Regional Com. </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 57 ....)\u201d (Italics added.) <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">In effect the <em>El Patio </em>court stated that had a building permit been necessary under the circumstances of that case, <em>Avco </em>would have controlled and the requirement of the building permit would have been independently enforceable. Unlike the situation in <em>El Patio </em>where the city could only rely upon the extension sought for the tentative tract map under the map act as a peg for adding the condition that the developer comply with the new rent control law, here we are dealing with building permits and removal permits which have independent reasons for existence and which are applicable to all persons seeking to reduce the number of units in their buildings whether they be subdividers holding tentative tract maps or landlords seeking to increase the size of their dwelling units by reducing their number.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The <em>Avco </em>court rejects the concept that the issuance of a building permit is a purely ministerial nondiscretionary act in the following terms (p. 795): \u201cThe contention that Avco was entitled to a building permit because the county would have been compelled to issue it upon mere application has no merit. The Orange County Building Code (\u00a7 302(a)) provides that a building permit may not issue unless the plans conform not only to the structural requirements of the code but to \u2018other pertinent laws and ordinances.\u2019 This provision codifies the general rule that a builder must comply with the laws which are in effect at the time a building permit is issued, including the laws which were enacted after application for the permit. <em>(Brougher </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works </em>(1928) 205 Cal. 426, 435 [271 P. 487]; see <em>Russian Hill Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Permit Appeals </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 34, 39 [56 Cal.Rptr. 672, 423 P.2d 824]; cf. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works </em>(1925) 195 Cal. 477 [234 P. 381, 38 A.L.R. 1479]; and see cases collected in 50 A.L.R.3d 596, 602.) A landowner which has not even applied for a permit cannot be in a better position merely because it had previously received permission to subdivide its property and made certain improvements on the land.6\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Footnote 6 of the Avco case reads as follows: \u201c6. In <em>Aries Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>California Coastal Zone Conservation Com. </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 534 [122 Cal.Rptr. 315], the court applied the \u2018final discretionary approval\u2019 test in determining that a landowner had not acquired vested rights to develop its property. The commission had contended in the trial court and in its opening brief on appeal that a vested right could arise without a building permit if the government had approved a specific project and \u2018all final discretionary approvals\u2019 had been obtained. The court believed itself bound to decide the case on this theory because of the position the commission had adopted below and in its opening brief on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Following <em>Avco, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 785 which holds that a developer must comply with existing laws at the time he seeks his building permit, it can then be argued that the tentative maps require as one of their conditions that appellants comply with all applicable laws, including those subsequently enacted, which were pertinent to their particular projects. In that sense, the removal permit requirement was not an \u201cadditional\u201d condition but rather one which conceptually was included in the original conditions of the tentative map.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Appellants AAV and 828 argue that the City acted improperly as to them by granting their respective tentative tract map extensions condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>tioned upon their compliance, with the subsequently enacted RCL. Though such position is correct, it does not detract from the fact that neither appellant obtained the requisite building permits that were \u2022 proper conditions of their respective tentative tract maps.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In Hazon\u2019s case, additional support for the trial court\u2019s ruling is found in Hazon\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies by not taking permitted appeals to City\u2019s building department from a revocation of its building permit. (2 Cal.Jur.3d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 262 (and cases cited at p. 507 n. 86).)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">As to AAV, the record before us does not disclose that such petitioner sought a vested rights determination from the RGB. In the absence of such an application and denial, the trial court could not have properly considered appellant\u2019s petition as one for administrative mandamus because there was no administrative decision to review. Therefore, since AAV failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, the amount of its expenditures was irrelevant to the proceedings in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Thus we conclude that appellants did not demonstrate the existence of a mandatory and ministerial duty on the part of City to issue the building permits (or, in the case of appellant Hazon, to reinstate said permit), and that all petitions for writ of mandamus were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Files, P. J., and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 11, 1982, and the petition of appellants in Nos. 61773, 61787 and 61790 for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 22, 1982.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b21-10\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b22-8\">The applicable provisions of said amendment include the following: \u201cSection 1801.
