(Agency) and National Bonding and Accident Insurance Company (National) after requesting the court declare which party had primary coverage for an automobile involved in a collision. The pivotal issue is whether Insurance Code section 11580.9<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applies to a surety bond filed in compliance with the motor vehicle financial responsibility laws. For the reasons which follow we conclude it does not, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The automobile accident involved a car owned by Agency, rented and driven by John Cilmi, and one owned and operated by Marion Lockett. Cilmi and his wife sued Lockett because of personal injuries and property damage. Lockett and her passenger, Tes Marie Thompson, cross-complained for personal injuries and property damage. The Cilmis also filed uninsured motorist claims with their own automobile insurance carrier, Lumbermens, because Lockett was uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Cilmi had current insurance coverage with Lumbermens, while Agency had an automobile surety bond in the amount of $15,000 with National and was self-insured up to $100,000, after which it had \u201cexcess\u201d automobile insurance with Northeastern Fire Insurance Company of Pennsylvania. Consequently, Cilmi tendered defense of the cross-complaint to Lumbermens which, in a classic \u201cTinker to Evers to Chance\u201d move, tendered both the defense of the cross-complaint and the uninsured motorist claim to Agency. When Agency refused to play ball, Lumbermens filed the case at bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Lumbermens\u2019 policy contains the following hybrid pro rata and excess clause: \u201cIf the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by Part One of this policy the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the declarations bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; provided, <em>however, the insurance with respect to a temporary substitute automobile or non-owned automobile shall be excess over any other valid and collectible </em>insurance.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Lumbermens contends National\u2019s coverage under its financial responsibility bond is primary under section 11580.9, subdivision (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Sections 11580.8<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 11580.9<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> reflect a legislative effort to reduce the volume of disputes within this area of primary, excess or sole coverage litigation between the injured parties, insureds and insurers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number><em>(Transport Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Alo </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 143, 147 [173 Cal.Rptr. 394]; <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 521, 524 [149 Cal.Rptr. 562].) It applies to \u201cfirst-tier\u201d liability, as opposed to \u201csecond-tier\u201d responsibility. Within the former, it applies to basic liability coverage where indemnification for direct liability is contractually secured by the insured with the consequence the insurer has no right of reimbursement against the insured-tortfeasor or his estate. Likewise, it applies to one who has satisfied the financial responsibility laws by obtaining a certificate of self-insurance pursuant to Vehicle Code section 16053 (\u00a7 11580.9, subd. (g), superseding <em>Metro U.S. Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 678 [158 Cal.Rptr. 207] which held otherwise), thus declaring one\u2019s finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>cial ability to directly respond to potential vehicular liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, it does not apply to \u201csecond-tier\u201d liability where a party, i.e., a surety, becomes liable only following the establishment of liability on the part of its principal <em>and </em>the latter\u2019s failure to satisfy that liability. This follows since, by analogy, the bonded principal is nothing more than a \u201cself-insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A comparative review of the nature of a surety bond, filed in compliance with the motor vehicle financial responsibility laws, and basic liability insurance lends substantive support to this analysis.  A surety bond is not an insurance policy. <em>(Farmers Ins. Exch. </em>v. <em>Midwest Emery Frgt. Sys., Inc. </em>(1974) 298 Minn. 369 [215 N.W.2d 623, 626]; <em>Consolidated Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Allstate Insurance Company </em>(5th Cir. 1969) 411 F.2d 157, 160; 8A Appleman (1981) Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7 4913 at p. 511.) It represents nothing more than \u201can undertaking to indemnify a person, or the public, against losses resulting from acts of the principal. A surety guarantees payment up to the principal sum. But if losses occur, the surety may recover from its principal.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>It merely constitutes a guarantee the surety will assume the principal\u2019s liability only if the latter is unable to make full payment. It cannot be construed as providing any more, such as the requiring of the surety to undertake the defense or to immediately pay the settlement without the principal\u2019s default. <em>(Farmers Ins. Exch. </em>v. <em>Midwest Emery Frgt. Sys., Inc., supra, </em>215 N.W.2d 623, 626; <em>Consolidated Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Allstate Insurance Company, supra, </em>411 F.2d 157, 160; <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Peerless Ins. Co. </em>(1963) 27 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Ops.2d 293 [194 N.E.2d 154, 157].)  In other words, \u201c[a] liability insurance policy is written for the [financial] protection of the insured. However, a financial responsibility bond does not protect the principal by insuring him against liability. A financial responsibility bond is written for the protection of the motoring public, who may be injured by the principal. If the surety is compelled to make payment for damages caused by the principal, it has the right to seek reimbursement from the principal. The ... financial responsibility bond, in the present case, expressly provides for reimbursement by the principal. This fundamental difference between insurance and a financial responsibility bond compels this court to find that a financial responsibility bond is not insurance, as that term is used in ...

However, here, Lumbermens\u2019 policy includes an excess clause providing that insurance for a temporary substitute or nonowned automobile \u201cshall be excess over any other valid and collectible insurance,\u201d while National\u2019s surety bond is silent in this regard. Accordingly, we look to sections 11580.8 and 11580.9 for guidance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Section 11580.8 provides: \u201cThe Legislature declares it to be the public policy of this state to avoid so far as possible conflicts and litigation, with resulting court congestion, between and among injured parties, insureds, and insurers concerning which, among various policies of liability insurance and the various coverages therein, are responsible as primary, excess, or sole coverage, and to what extent, under the circumstances of any given event involving death or injury to persons or property caused by the operation or use of a motor vehicle.
