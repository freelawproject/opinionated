For the reasons that follow we affirm the lower court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In their first and third propositions of law, the defendants-appellants challenge the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Urbana Municipal Court to hear this declaratory judgment action. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss based upon the same arguments regarding subject-matter jurisdiction. The defendants then filed their answer and asserted counterclaims which alleged damages of fifteen thousand dollars. The counterclaims were dismissed without prejudice by the defendants before the plaintiff\u2019s answer could be filed, pursuant to Civ. R. 41(A)(1) and (C). The plaintiff in this action seeks only declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">A municipal court is a court of record which has the power to grant declaratory relief provided it has subject-matter jurisdiction over the underlying action. R.C. 2721.02; <em>State, ex rel. Foreman, </em>v. <em>Bellefontaine Municipal Court </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St. 2d 26, 28, 41 O.O. 2d 159, 160, 231 N.E. 2d 70, 71; see <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Tracy </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 363, 367, 6 OBR 416, 419, 453 N.E. 2d 661, 664. R.C. 1901.18 sets forth the subject-matter jurisdiction of the municipal courts. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">\u201c(A) Subject to the monetary jurisdiction of municipal courts as set forth in section 1901.17 of the Revised Code, a municipal court has original jurisdiction within its territory * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">\u201c(1) In any civil action, of <em>whatever nature or remedy, </em>of which judges of county courts have jurisdiction * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">R.C. 1901.17, referred to above, limits the subject-matter jurisdiction to \u201cthose cases where the amount claimed by any party, or the appraised value of the personal property sought to be recovered, does not exceed ten thousand dollars. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">Although defendants voluntarily dismissed their counterclaims, they argue that their damages would exceed ten thousand dollars should the plaintiff prevail and prevent the defendants from selling magazines such as those that are challenged in this action. Allegation alone is insufficient to divest a municipal court of jurisdiction based upon the amount of damages at issue unless the allegation is in a formal claim or counterclaim. Accordingly, the Urbana Municipal Court is not deprived of subject-matter jurisdiction upon this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Furthermore, R.C. 1901.20(A) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">\u201cThe municipal court has jurisdiction of the violation of any ordinance of any municipal corporation within its territory, * * * [exceptions omitted]. In all such prosecutions and cases, the court shall proceed to a final determination of the prosecution or case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">The action at bar does not fall within any of the exceptions set forth in R.C. 1901.20, nor does it violate any of the other general jurisdictional statutes concerning municipal courts. If the magazines challenged are declared obscene, then the defendants could be subject to prosecution for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>misdemeanor offense of pandering obscenity. U.C.C. Section 133.014 is virtually identical to R.C. 2907.36 in its provision that there will be only one judicial determination whether certain materials or performances are obscene. U.C.C. Section 133.014- provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201c(C) An action for a declaratory judgment pursuant to division (A) of this section shall not be brought during the pendency of any civil action or criminal prosecution, when the character of the particular materials or performances involved is at issue in the pending case, and either of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">\u201c(1) Either of the parties to the action for a declaratory judgment is a party to the pending case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201c(2) A judgment in the pending case will necessarily constitute res judicata as to the character of the materials or performances involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\u201c(D) A civil action or criminal prosecution in which the character of particular materials or performances is at issue, brought during the pendency of the action for a declaratory judgment involving the same issue shall be stayed during the pendency of the action for a declaratory judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">\u201c(E) The fact that a violation of sections 133.011 or 133.012 occurs prior to a judicial determination of the character of the material or performance involved in the violation, does not relieve the offender of criminal liability for the violation, even though prosecution may be stayed pending the judicial determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">For example, if a misdemeanor prosecution for pandering obscenity is initiated first, then that proceeding will determine whether the materials or actions at issue are obscene. That prosecution would take place in municipal court. Subsection (C) precludes a collateral attack in a declaratory judgment action. Likewise, subsection (D) provides that if a declaratory judgment action has been first initiated, then it cannot be collaterally attacked in a simultaneous proceeding. It would make no sense to allow the municipal court to determine whether material is obscene during a misdemeanor prosecution, but preclude such a determination in a declaratory judgment action. For all the above reasons, appellants\u2019 propositions of law concerning the alleged lack of subject-matter jurisdiction of the Urbana Municipal Court to hear this action are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Appellants in their seventh and eighth propositions of law assert that there is no case or controversy here, or if there is, this court should not render a declaratory judgment since it would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding. Appellants base this argument on the fact that a magazine is sold only for a limited period of time, and it is, in the normal course of business, removed from the market before all judicial proceedings can be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Such an argument, if accepted, would preclude a court from ever rendering a declaratory judgment as to whether a magazine is obscene. The determination of whether a magazine is obscene must be directed solely to each particular magazine at issue and procedural safeguards must be followed that are \u201cdesigned to focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.\u201d <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Search Warrant </em>(1961), 367 U.S. 717, 732. For example, \u201c[w]hile a single copy of a book or film may be seized and retained for evidentiary purposes based on a finding of probable cause, the publication may not be taken out of circulation completely until there has been a determination of obscenity after an adver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>sary hearing.\u201d <em>Fort Wayne Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Indiana </em>(1989), 489 U.S.____,____, 103 L. Ed. 2d 34, 51-52, 109 S. Ct. 916, 927. In other cases involving important First Amendment rights this court has held that a case or controversy is not moot if the issues involved are \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. The Repository, </em>v. <em>Unger </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 418, 420, 28 OBR 472, 474, 504 N.E. 2d 37, 39; <em>State, ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 165, 527 N.E. 2d 807, paragraph one of the syllabus. Such a situation exists here. While this proceeding can only determine whether the specific magazines at issue are obscene, and those magazines have long since been withdrawn from circulation, the rationale and the facts in this decision should provide guidance in other cases. Accordingly, this controversy is not moot and appellants\u2019 seventh and eighth propositions of law are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Appellants assert in their fourth proposition of law that the trial court erroneously admitted the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s lay witnesses in violation of Evid. R. 701, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">\u201cIf the witness is not testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">The wording of the Ohio rule is identical to Fed. R. Evid. 701. \u201cThe primary purpose of Rule 701 is to allow nonexpert witnesses to give opinion testimony when, as a matter of practical necessity, events which they have personally observed cannot otherwise be fully presented to the court or the jury.\u201d <em>Randolph v. Collectramatic, Inc. </em>(C.A. 10, 1979), 590 F. 2d 844, 846.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In an obscenity trial, the trier of fact must determine, among other factors, whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 15, 24. \u201c[T]he term \u2018average person\u2019 does not include any number of people, the majority, or a few, or some, but is a term connoting a composite or synthesis of the community.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Treatman </em>(C.A. 8, 1975), 524 F. 2d 320, 323. Qualitatively, the term average person does not mean the \u201cabnormal adult of noxious tendencies or the person of defective or subnormal mentality.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Beil, </em>v. <em>Mahoning Valley Distrib. Agency, Inc. </em>(C.P. 1960), 84 Ohio Law Abs. 427, 440, 169 N.E. 2d 48, 59. For purposes of the <em>Miller </em>test, the average person is one with average sex instincts. <em>Volanski v. United States </em>(C.A. 6, 1957), 246 F. 2d 842, 844.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>When the judge is the trier of fact in an obscenity case, the situation here, he must gauge the reaction of the community when and as if the \u201caverage person\u201d viewed the material. <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Reel of 35mm Color Motion Picture Film </em>(C.A. 2, 1974), 491 F. 2d 956, 958. Expert testimony on community standards is not required. See <em>Pinkus </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 293, 302.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The United States Supreme Court has stated that if the materials alleged to be obscene are placed into evidence, they \u201care the best evidence of what they represent\u201d and that expert testimony is not necessary to establish that they are obscene unless the materials are \u201cdirected at such a bizarre deviant group that the experience of the trier of fact would be plainly inadequate to judge whether the material appeals to the prurient interest.\u201d <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 49, 56, fn. 6 (citing <em>Mishkin </em>v. <em>New York </em>[1966], 383 U.S. 502, 508-510). If the materials alleged to be obscene are admitted into evidence, there is no need for lay witnesses to testify whether they think those materials are obscene. <em>Paris Adult Theatre I, supra, </em>at 56. See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(D. Md. 1980), 515 F. Supp. 818, 824, affirmed without opinion (C.A. 4, 1981), 661 F. 2d 917, certiorari denied (1981), 454 U.S. 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We must review the trial court\u2019s decision whether to admit evidence under Evid. R. 701 according to an abuse-of-discretion standard, which has been defined as connoting \u201cmore than an error of law or of judgment; it implies an unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable attitude on the part of the court.\u201d <em>Steiner </em>v. <em>Custer </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 448, 19 O.O. 148, 31 N.E. 2d 855, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">In reaching its decision, the trial court considered the testimony of all the witnesses, their interest in the case, their bias or prejudice, and their knowledge on the subject. There is no indication that the trial court simply counted the number of witnesses, or deferred solely to the opinions of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses who did testify, or based its decision on the theory that the community was simply against obscenity. Evid. R. 701 contemplates that the opinion testimony of the lay witness will be helpful. Undoubtedly, the trial judge thought that that was the case. Admission of such testimony was not required, but it was not an abuse of discretion to hear it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Loshin </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App. 3d 62, 67, 517 N.E. 2d 229, 234. Appellants\u2019 fourth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">Appellants\u2019 sixth proposition of law is that the appellate court did not make an independent review of the facts. We disagree. Further, we now proceed with our own independent review which addresses the appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>remaining arguments. Both the Ohio and the United States Constitutions protect freedom of speech.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cAll ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance \u2014 unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion \u2014 have the full protection of the guaranties [of the First Amendment], unless excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests.\u201d <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957), 354 U.S. 476, 484. Justice Brennan, writing for the majority in <em>Roth, </em>aptly stated that \u201c[s]ex, a great and mysterious motive force in human life, has indisputably been a subject of absorbing interest to mankind through the ages; it is one of the vital problems of human interest and public concern. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 487. Communication concerning sex is protected speech under the Ohio and United States Constitutions <em>unless </em>that communication meets the legal standard of obscenity. The definition of obscenity is a question of law and a legal term of art. <em>Hamling </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 87, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Obscenity is one of the categories of communication \u201cto which the majestic protection of the First Amendment does not extend because they \u2018are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc. </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 485, 504 (quoting <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>[1942], 315 U.S. 568, 572).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">However, courts have had great difficulty dealing with the persistent problems of defining obscenity. Justice Brennan, the author of the majority opinion in <em>Roth, </em>now maintains that no formulation adequately distinguishes obscene material from that protected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Several state supreme courts have turned to the unique provisions of their state constitutions to hold that no law can prohibit, punish or censor \u201cobscene\u201d speech \u201cin the interest of a uniform vision on how human sexuality should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>regarded or portrayed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1987), 302 Ore. 510, 525, 732 P. 2d 9, 18; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kam </em>(Hawaii 1988), 748 P. 2d 372. This court does not see any impediment in the Ohio Constitution to regulating communication that meets the legal definition of obscenity. The citizens of Ohio, and in this case, Urbana, through its elected city council, have manifested a strong desire that obscenity be regulated. Our role is to ensure that that regulation meets constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">An appellate court must conduct an independent review of the record in a First Amendment case \u201cto be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and to confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits in an effort to ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited.\u201d <em>Bose, supra, </em>at 505. In an obscenity case what appeals to \u201cprurient interest\u201d and what is \u201cpatently offensive\u201d are essentially questions of fact. <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 30. However, the jury or the trial court does not have unbridled discretion to determine these factual questions. They are confined to assessing whether materials depicted or described are \u201cpatently offensive \u2018hardcore\u2019 sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. No one is to be prosecuted for depicting or describing mere nudity. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 153, 161 (reversing the Supreme Court of Georgia\u2019s affirmance of a jury\u2019s finding that the movie \u201cCarnal Knowledge\u201d was obscene).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Urbana ordinances dealing with obscenity are nearly identical to the obscenity statutes, R.C. 2907.01 and 2907.31 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Burgun </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 354, 10 O.O. 3d 485, 384 N.E. 2d 255, this court held that the then current and nearly identically worded statute defining obscenity, R.C. 2907.01(F), must be read <em>in pari materia </em>with the requirements of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>since the requirements and examples in <em>Miller </em>are substantive constitutional law of First and Fourteenth Amendment magnitude. <em>Hamling, supra, </em>at 114. In accordance with such a synthesis the definition of obscenity in R.C. 2907.01(F) was held to be neither unconstitutionally overbroad nor void for vagueness. <em>Burgun, supra; Turoso </em>v. <em>Cleveland Municipal Court </em>(C.A. 6, 1982), 674 F. 2d 486, certiorari denied (1982), 459 U.S. 880. The same incorporation analysis which was followed in <em>Burgun </em>and approved in <em>Turoso </em>for R.C. 2907.01(F) applies with equal force to the current Urbana ordinance, U.C.C. Section 133.01(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The <em>Turoso </em>court set forth its analysis of how the <em>Miller </em>standard and the Ohio statute would interact. However, since there is some overlap between the provisions of the Urbana ordinance, the Ohio statute and the requirements of <em>Miller, </em>this opinion will set forth the analysis in an order different from that in <em>Turoso, </em>but will reach the same conclusion. The first step, and the one that is easiest to start with because of its objective nature, is to focus on the conduct requirement set forth in the second of the three guidelines in <em>Miller, </em>that is, whether the material or work \u201cdepicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, the sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law * * <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The <em>Miller </em>court went on to give two \u201cplain examples\u201d of what could be defined by state statute as sexual conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">\u201c(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">\u201c(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Those two examples are not exhaustive but indicative of the character of the acts which are subject to regulation. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1977), 431 U.S. 767, 773; <em>Janicki </em>v. <em>Pizza </em>(C.A. 6, 1983), 722 F. 2d 1274, 1276 (construing as constitutional the Toledo municipal ordinances which included the <em>Miller </em>examples of sexual conduct in addition to other examples of sexual conduct). The community standards determine if the descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct go so far beyond the customary limits of candor that they are patently offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">U.C.C. Section 133.01 parallels R.C. 2907.01 and provides the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">\u201c(A) \u2018Sexual Conduct\u2019 means vaginal intercourse between a male and female, and anal intercourse, fellatio, and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal and anal intercourse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\u201c(B) \u2018Sexual Contact\u2019 means any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\u201c(C) \u2018Sexual Activity\u2019 means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">After ascertaining whether the material, work, or performance concerns the sexual conduct defined by state or local ordinance which in turn is limited to the same sort of, but not necessarily the exact, conduct set forth in the two <em>Miller </em>examples, the trier of fact should then address whether the first prong of the <em>Miller </em>test is met, that is, whether \u201c \u2018the average person applying contemporary community standards,\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a- whole, appeals to the prurient interest.\u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">A \u201cprurient\u201d interest is not the same as a candid, normal or healthy interest in sex, rather it is a \u201c \u2018shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion * * * [which] goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters ***.'\u201d <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 487, fn. 20 (quoting the definition of the A.L.I. Model Penal Code, Section 207.10(2) [Tent. Draft No. 6, 1957]). U.C.C. 133.01(E) gives five definitions of when any material or performance is obscene, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">\u201cWhen considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary adults or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially susceptible group, judged with reference to that group, any material or performance is \u2018obscene\u2019 if any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">\u201c(1) Its dominant appeal is prurient interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">\u201c(2) Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting sexual activity, masterbation [sic], sexual excitement or nudity in a way that tends to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">\u201c(3) Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-17\">\u201c(4) Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way that inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without serving any genuine scientific, educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>tional, sociological, moral or artistic purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201c(5) It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual activity, masterbation [sic], sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality, or human bodily functions of elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such an interest is primarily of its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The U.C.C. ordinance incorporates the first and third tests of <em>Miller. </em>It also gives some additional explicit examples of conduct which would constitute the sort of sexual activity that would be in accord with the second example of the second test or prong of <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The third prong of the <em>Miller </em>test requires the material, work, or performance be such that when \u201ctaken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">This third prong is not to be determined by a reference to community standards, in this case Champaign County. \u201cThe proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary member of any given community would find serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value in allegedly obscene material, but whether a reasonable person would find such value in the material, taken as a whole.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 497, 500-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">A magazine must be looked at as a whole and not as a series of \u201cworks\u201d resulting in a \u201cvolume.\u201d <em>Penthouse Internatl.

The Supreme Court first used the \u201ctaken as a whole\u201d requirement as a substitute for the \u201cisolated excerpt approach\u201d in the 1957 <em>Roth </em>decision. <em>Roth, supra, </em>at 488-489. The inclusion of serious literary matter in significant proportions may preclude a finding that a magazine is obscene even though the magazine contains items, photographs for example, which standing alone would be found obscene under the <em>Miller </em>test. <em>Penthouse </em>v. <em>McAuliffe, supra, </em>at 1372. However, a quantitative counting of material is not the test. In <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 463, the Supreme Court affirmed a conviction wherein the trial court had determined that only four of fifteen articles in a particular magazine were obscene. The Supreme Court did not address the specific articles but based its decision upon the magazine\u2019s \u201ccharacteristics as a whole, including [its] editorial formats, and not upon particular articles contained, digested, or excerpted in [it].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, fn. 5. The \u201ctaken as a whole\u201d requirement is part of the first and third prongs of the <em>Miller </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">A magazine may contain explicit sexual conduct subject to prohibition under the second requirement of <em>Miller, </em>and a trier of fact may determine that the average person in that community would find that the magazine as a whole appeals to the prurient interest, and that characteristic is the principal appeal of the material. Nevertheless, the magazine would not be legally obscene if, under the objective third prong of <em>Miller, </em>the trier of fact also concluded that a reasonable person could find \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d The only exception is when there is a sham attempt to insulate obscene material with non-obscene material. If the intent is to appeal to prurient in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>terest then the mere insertion of other matter, irrelevant to the predominant theme of the material, will not prevent a determination that the material is obscene. \u201cThis would occur, for example, if the most obscene items conceivable were inserted between each of the books of the Bible.\u201d <em>Penthouse </em>v. <em>McAuliffe, supra, </em>at 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The requirements of <em>Miller </em>are cumulative and mandatory. They provide the analytical screen through which all challenged material must be filtered. If the Urbana ordinances defining obscenity and sexual conduct are construed in light of the requirements of <em>Miller, </em>they are constitutional as are the parallel Ohio statutes. <em>Burgun; Turoso, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We now turn to the challenged magazines.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The trial court ruled that Dr. Joe Scott, an assistant professor of sociology, was qualified as an expert in human sexuality, sociology and obscenity. Dr. Scott testified that all five magazines are considered in the magazine publishing trade as \u201cmale sophisticate\u201d magazines as opposed to \u201cexplicit\u201d magazines. The difference between the two categories is that explicit magazines show actual penetration, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthere is nothing left to the imagination.\u201d Dr. Scott testified that industry records show that approximately nine thousand adult male sophisticate magazines are sold each year in Champaign County. Within the \u201cadult male sophisticate\u201d category, there is a range of content, as is demonstrated by the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Courts are not bound by the magazine industry\u2019s determination of what is \u201cexplicit.\u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 25 states that \u201c[p]atently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or <em>simulated,\u201d </em>(emphasis added) may be subject to prohibition. The U.C.C. sections do not require that actual penetration be shown in order to find material obscene provided that all the other criteria are met. We hold that - actual penetration need not be shown in a photograph, for example, before the second test in <em>Miller </em>is satisfied. Accordingly, we hold that the industry practice of publishing photographs with a small black dot obscuring the actual contact between sexual organs and various orifices does not preclude a jury from finding representations of ultimate sexual acts or display of genitals to be patently offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">All five magazines contain either in the text, photographs, or their advertisements numerous depictions or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, cunnilingus, fellatio and sodomy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They therefore contain \u201csexual conduct\u201d as defined by U.C.C. Section 133.01(A) (R.C. 2907.01 [A]). Furthermore, the trial court and the court of appeals determined that the average person of Champaign County applying the contemporary standards of that community would find that each magazine as a whole appeals to the prurient interest. We do not disagree with that assessment. Finally, neither the magazines themselves nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>anything else in the record provides any basis to suggest that any reasonable person would find serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value in any of the magazines when taken as a whole. We do not discern any such value.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed and the plaintiff is granted the declaratory relief he requests: the January 1986 editions of \u201cJuggs,\u201d \u201cNugget,\u201d \u201cVelvet\u201d; the December 1985 edition of \u201cOui\u201d; and the March 1986 edition of \u201cBig Boobs\u201d are legally obscene under the Urbana ordinances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-6\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes and Res-nick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b161-7\">Douglas, J., concurs in the judgment and paragraphs two, three, four and five of the syllabus.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b161-8\">Sweeney and H.

But implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance. * * *\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">Yet even in <em>Roth, </em>the court stressed that \u201csex and obscenity are not synonymous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487. Thus sexually oriented matter which was not obscene had the full protection of the Constitution. <em>Roth </em>struggled to devise a test to distinguish constitutionally protected from unprotected sexual expression. Courts have continued to wrestle with these determinations for three decades, variously modifying the test, substituting new terms for old and even reversing some former declarations. These efforts have created a hopelessly muddled and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>fused body of law which provides little guidance to courts and fails to give notice to distributors and publishers as to what material may be outside constitutional protection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">One of the problems is that state efforts to ban obscenity have rested upon an unproven premise. The premise is that viewing sexually oriented material contributes to an increase in crime. This has not been established. Indeed, the opposite conclusion was reached in 1970 by the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, which was established by Congress to study and determine the actual effects of pornography upon persons exposed to it. The commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201cIn sum, empirical research designed to clarify the question has found no evidence to date that exposure to explicit sexual materials plays a significant role in the causation of delinquent or criminal behavior among youth or adults. The Commission cannot conclude that exposure to erotic materials is a factor in the causation of sex crime or sex delinquency.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography (1970) 27 (hereinafter \u201cReport of the Commission\u201d); see, also, R. Holmes, The Sex Offender and the Criminal Justice System (1983) 118-120.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The commission further noted that: \u201cOn the positive side, explicit sexual materials are sought as a source of entertainment and information by substantial numbers of American adults. At times, these materials also appear to serve to increase and facilitate constructive communication about sexual matters within marriage. The most frequent purchaser of explicit sexual materials is a college-educated, married male, in his thirties or forties, who is of above average socio-economic status. Even where materials are legally available to them, young adults and older adolescents do not constitute an important portion of the purchasers of such materials.\u201d Report of the Commission at 53. Other possible positive effects of pornography are that it may have therapeutic and educational value and that it may, for certain individuals, have a cathartic effect. Downs, The Attorney General\u2019s Commission and the New Politics of Pornography, 1987 American Bar Found. Research J. 641, 671-674.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Another difficulty in the obscenity case law lies with the application of terms such as \u201cprurient interest,\u201d \u201cpatently offensive,\u201d \u201ccontemporary community standards,\u201d \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,\u201d and the ultimate in colorful nonsense, \u201cI know it when I see it.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> How can what lies inexpressibly buried within the subjective eye of one supreme court justice guide any court or legislature where a determination of First Amendment limits must be made?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>In the present case, the majority has fastened its analysis to another of these meaningless phrases. \u201cFor purposes of the <em>Miller </em>test,\u201d the majority says, \u201cthe average person is one with average sex instincts.\u201d How, one wonders, does the majority, or any judge, identify this mythical person of \u201caverage sex instincts\u201d? If the majority really means \u201caverage,\u201d what is the universe of instincts to be averaged and what is the process by which that can be accomplished? To look critically at the language used in this and other obscenity cases is to see absurdity.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">What appeals to one person may offend another. Each individual\u2019s experiences and values will shape his opinion of what has merit, is patently offensive or is simply worthless but not obscene. This inherent subjectivity makes uniform analysis and application of the obscenity standard impossible. The commission recognized the subjective nature of the inquiry when it described responses to sexually oriented materials and whether the material was likely to be labeled obscene or pornographic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201cExtremely varied responses to erotic stimuli occur in the judgmental realm, as, for example, in the labeling of material as obscene or pornographic. Characteristics of both the viewer and the stimulus influence the response: For any given stimulus, some persons are more likely to judge it \u2018obscene\u2019 than are others; and for persons of a given psychological or social type, some erotic themes are more likely to be judged \u2018obscene\u2019 than are others. In general, persons who are older, less educated, religiously active, less experienced with erotic materials, or feel sexually guilty are most likely to judge a given erotic stimulus \u2018obscene.\u2019 There is some indication that stimuli may have to evoke both positive responses (interesting or stimulating), and negative responses (offensive or unpleasant) before they are judged obscene or pornographic.\u201d Report of the Commission at 26.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The commission noted also that individuals who want the most restriction on the availability of sexually oriented material tend to believe that others in the community agree, <em>whether or not this is true. Id. </em>at 33. Thus, the finding that certain material is obscene, based upon the testimony of a handful of community residents who testified that, in their opinion, the material is obscene and that others in the community hold this view, is without a solid base.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">A further problem is presented by the Urbana ordinance and other similar attempts to codify a definition of obscenity. Sexual conduct, under the Urbana ordinance, is broadly defined to include ordinary intercourse and even \u201ctouching of an erogenous zone of another.\u201d If such material arouses lust or appeals to the prurient interest, it may be banned. The problem is this. Sexual depiction which arouses lust is <em>not </em>necessarily obscene \u2014 even if obscenity is measured by an aesthetic or a dictionary definition. A statute does violence to the right of free expression under the Ohio Constitution and under the First Amendment when that statute is so murky that it operates to indiscriminately ban sexual depiction which arouses lust.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">It is time to re-examine the application of the First Amendment and Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution to obscenity cases. The harm caused by the expression under consideration should be the focus. Such a focus fits into a long-standing approach to First Amendment problems. One enjoys free speech, yes, but one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>may not shout \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theater (unless, of course, there is a fire).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">There are types of sexually explicit material which cause harm. Two examples are publications which utilize minors and publications which require the commission of a crime in order to produce them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Unlike the unproven effect of viewing pornography on the crime rate, there is evidence that the use of children in pornographic films and magazines injures their physical and psychological well-being. It has been determined that sexually exploited children are unable to develop healthy relationships in later life and that such children also tend to become sexual abusers as adults. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 747, 757-764. Thus, the state has a legitimate compelling interest in protecting children from sexual exploitation. The state may prevent the distribution and possession of child pornography as well as its production, because it is extremely difficult to stop child pornography at the production stage. <em>Ferber </em>at 759-761; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St. 3d 249, 525 N.E. 2d 1363; <em>State </em>v. <em>Meadows </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 43, 28 OBR 146, 503 N.E. 2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Another potential exception to the First Amendment is extremely violent sexually oriented material. Studies performed since 1970 indicate that material which combines sexually explicit depictions with extreme violence is correlated with aggressive attitudes and aggressive behavior against women, in a laboratory setting. Downs, <em>supra, at </em>658, 677-679, and studies cited therein. Thus, the state could, based upon sufficient evidence, regulate sexually oriented material which contains graphic violence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Restricting the audience for certain kinds of material may also be defensible. It is not my purpose to catalog the types of \u201charm\u201d that would take a publication out from under constitutional protection. Moreover, those determinations should first be made by the legislature. Such determinations may change and evolve in relation to the study and knowledge of the relationship between suspect material and harm. My point is that the law should be looking for the existence of \u201charm,\u201d not trying to define \u201cobscenity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">If viewing sexually oriented materials does not cause criminal behavior or harm and if criminal behavior is not required to produce the material, what is left? The residue are materials which offend some people \u2014 people who can choose to avoid them.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">In the case before us, no pernicious effect has been established with regard to the material. What has been shown is that the material is tasteless, designed to stimulate prurient interest, and, in a dictionary sense, is obscene. It is, in short, garbage. But, as Justice William 0. Douglas has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">\u201c* * * The First Amendment was designed to \u2018invite dispute,\u2019 to induce \u2018a condition of unrest,\u2019 to \u2018create dissatisfaction with conditions as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>are,\u2019 and even to stir \u2018people to anger.\u2019 <em>Terminiello </em>v. <em>Chicago </em>[1949], 337 U.S. 1, 4. The idea that the First Amendment permits punishment for ideas that are \u2018offensive\u2019 to the particular judge or jury sitting in judgment is astounding. No greater leveler of speech or literature has ever been designed. To give the power to the censor, as we do today, is to make a sharp and radical break with the traditions of a free society. <em>The First Amendment was not fashioned as a vehicle for dispensing tranquilizers to the people. </em>Its prime function was to keep debate open to \u2018offensive\u2019 as well as to \u2018staid\u2019 people. The tendency throughout history has been to subdue the individual and to exalt the power of government. The use of the standard \u2018offensive\u2019 gives authority to government that cuts the very vitals out of the First Amendment. As is intimated by the Court\u2019s opinion, the materials before us may be garbage. <em>But so is much of what is said in political campaigns, in the daily press, on TV. or over the radio. </em>By reason of the First Amendment \u2014 and solely because of it \u2014 speakers and publishers have not been threatened or subdued because their thoughts and ideas may be \u2018offensive\u2019 to some.\u201d (Emphasis added; footnote omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 15, 44-45 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The rights afforded by the Ohio Constitution are more specific and plainly authorize the expression of <em>any </em>sentiment on <em>any </em>subject so long as the expression does not cause harm.
