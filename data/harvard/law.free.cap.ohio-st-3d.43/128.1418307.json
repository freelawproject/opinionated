In the present case, we find that the commission properly applied R.C. 4123.59(B) in determining the amount of death benefits due appellant. Appellant thus has failed to establish a clear legal right to the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals denying a writ of mandamus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-14\">Holmes, Wright and H.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFB\">concurring. I concur in the majority opinion because <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>widow claimant is receiving the maximum compensation </em>provided by statute. Under R.C. 4123.59, the maximum compensation is based upon the <em>employee\u2019s </em>wage. It is not based on the statewide average weekly wage. The reference in the statute to statewide average weekly wage is for the purpose of putting a <em>cap </em>on the award or a floor under it. Thus the statewide average weekly wage can limit the amount of an award or it can set a minimum below which an award may not fall. The use of statewide average weekly wage serves only these two purposes. As the court of appeals recognized, eligibility for maximum compensation does not mean entitlement to the <em>cap </em>where the award, computed in accordance with the statute, is below the cap.</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-4\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b172-5\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmY\">dissenting. The widows lose again! Because the statute dictates that they should win, I dissent. There are at least two major problems with the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">First, a widow who is statutorily entitled to a specific award of compensation is being denied that award by strained statutory construction \u2014 when no construction is needed at all. The statute clearly provides for a substantially larger award for the widow. Second, the majority opinion ignores the only case pertinent to the issue (one recently decided by this court and relied upon by appellee Industrial Commission), <em>Zupp </em>v. <em>Youngstown Fire Dept. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St. 3d 202, 525 N.E. 2d 9, and avoids the problem by providing no case citation for the proposition presented. The reason for all this is obvious \u2014 the majority\u2019s position is indefensible as is the rationale of <em>Zupp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">At the time of his death, Robert Pickrel was receiving <em>total disability </em>compensation. At the time of Robert\u2019s death, Mary Pickrel, Robert\u2019s widow, was a <em>wholly dependent surviving spouse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In the body of the opinion, the majority quotes from R.C. 4123.59(B). If the majority had just read a little further in the <em>same </em>section, it would have discovered that the section contains additional provisions, one of which mandates payment to the widow of an amount equal to the <em>statewide </em>average weekly wage: \u201c* * * provided that when any claimant [Robert] is receiving <em>total disability </em>compensation at the time of death the <em>wholly dependent person </em>[Mary] <em>shall be eligible for the maximum compensation provided for in this section. </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">In not citing or discussing <em>Zupp, </em>the majority, at least, does not further perpetuate the fallacious \u201celigible\u201d argument <em>of Zupp. </em>In <em>Zupp </em>at 203, 525 N.E. 2d at 10, the majority interpreted \u201celigible\u201d to mean a prerequisite to consideration rather than a mandatory entitlement. Such a construction flies in the face of common usage as well as dictionary definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\u201cLegally or morally qualified\u201d is the definition of \u201celigible\u201d found in Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, Second College Edition (1976) 453. \u201cEntitled\u201d is the definition of \u201celigible\u201d found in Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1984) 404. \u201c[E]ntitled to something\u201d is the definition of \u201celigible\u201d found in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">To construe the word \u201celigible,\u201d as the court did in <em>Zupp, </em>and as the commission asks us to do in the case at bar, permits the commission to pick and choose between various dependent claimants as to who should get the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>maximum and who, being less favored, may get a lesser amount. Surely this cannot be the intention of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">When a person reaches the age of eighteen and properly registers to vote, that person becomes \u201celigible\u201d to vote. Short of having some disability because of a criminal conviction, that person is \u201centitled\u201d to vote, and if that person reaches the polls in time and signs the necessary record book, no one may revoke the entitlement to vote. Yet, in discussing such qualifications, we generally ask, \u201cAre you eligible to vote?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">I believe the widow-claimant herein is eligible and entitled to the maximum compensation allowable in accordance with the statute. That amount is the statewide average weekly wage which is the \u201cmaximum compensation provided for in this section.\u201d Since the majority reaches a contra conclusion, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-8\">Sweeney and Resnick, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
