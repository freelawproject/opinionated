However, we do not adopt the board\u2019s recommended sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">We do not condone respondent\u2019s actions, but we are impressed with the testimonials appended to respondent\u2019s brief describing his general good character and competence. We also believe that these were isolated incidents that are not likely to recur and that his clients\u2019 trust account was repaid so that no client was harmed. Furthermore, we were presented with respondent\u2019s offer of restitution to the guardianship. Therefore, we order his suspension from the practice of law for one year, but stay six months of that suspension on condition that respondent give satisfactory evidence to the Clerk of the Supreme Court that he has fully reimbursed the Gladys Roberts guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b124-14\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
