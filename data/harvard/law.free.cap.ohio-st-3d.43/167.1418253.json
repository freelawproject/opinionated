Westchester Estates, Inc., </em>v. <em>Bacon </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 42, 15 O.O. 3d 53, 399 N.E. 2d 81, paragraph one of the syllabus. An Industrial Commission order is subject to correction in mandamus only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>State, ex rel. Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47, 1 O.O. 2d 190, 139 N.E. 2d 41. An abuse of discretion occurs when the commission issues an order unsupported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 20, 31 OBR 70, 72, 508 N.E. 2d 936, 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The commission\u2019s award of temporary total disability compensation was \u201cbased on the medical reports of Dr. Gindin, Dr. Robert Turner, and Dr. Ronald Turner * * * [and] [r]eports in the 788842-22 file * * *.\u201d The commission agrees with the appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the Turner and Gindin reports are not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s order. The commission contends, however, that the reference to unspecified reports in claim No. 788842-22 is \u201csome evidence.\u201d This contention is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\"><em>State, ex rel. Mitchell, </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 481, 483-484, 6 OBR 531, 534, 453 N.E. 2d 721, 724, directed that commission orders \u201cspecifically state which evidence and only that evidence which has been relied upon [by the commission] to reach [its] conclusion.\u201d Under <em>Mitchell, </em>vague or ambiguous explanations are no longer acceptable. <em>Mitchell </em>indicated that this court would not search the record for \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision and stated that unclear commission decisions should be remanded for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">We recently reiterated <em>the Mitchell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ruling in <em>State, ex rel.
