MIMS\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this appeal, the Court considers whether Sheryl Denise Ricketts had standing to pursue a personal injury claim against Charlie Edward Strange after filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. The Court also considers whether the circuit court erred by denying her motions to correct a misnomer in her\n   complaint or substitute the bankruptcy trustee as the proper plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 3, 2012, Ricketts was involved in a motor vehicle accident. She visited her primary care physician later that day complaining of back and neck pain that was radiating into her head and causing a \"severe\" headache. A subsequent MRI revealed \"a small posterior disc protrusion at C7-T1.\" She received corticosteroid injections, participated in physical therapy, and was treated by a chiropractor. When these treatments proved unavailing, she elected to undergo surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 16, 2014, shortly before the statute of limitations expired, Ricketts filed a complaint in the circuit court alleging that Strange's negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the accident. Strange moved for summary judgment on the ground that Ricketts lacked standing to pursue her claim. He asserted that in September 2012, Ricketts filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Virginia. Strange argued that Ricketts's negligence claim was \"assertable only by the trustee in bankruptcy\" because she failed to properly exempt it from the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her bankruptcy petition, Ricketts was required to list her interests in personal property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(i). Question 18 of Schedule B directed Ricketts to identify any \"liquidated debts owed to [her] including tax refunds.\" Rickets responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Potential funds due to Debtor unknown at this time, including State &amp; Federal tax refunds, 9/12 interest in joint 2012 tax refund of approximately $9700 = $7274, debtor 1/2 interes[t] = $3638, possible garnishment funds, insurance proceeds, proceeds related to claims or causes of action that may be asserted by the debtor, any claim for earned but unpaid wages, and/or inheritance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Question 21 directed Ricketts to list \"[o]ther contingent and unliquidated claims of every nature, including tax refunds, counterclaims of the debtor, and rights to setoff claims.\" Ricketts marked, \"None.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On Schedule C, Ricketts was required to list the assets she \"claimed as exempt\" from the bankruptcy estate. She copied the assets listed under question 18 of Schedule B into Schedule C and alleged that these assets were exempt under Code \u00a7 34-4, Virginia's Homestead Exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The circuit court granted Strange's motion for summary judgment. It concluded that because Ricketts \"failed to disclose [her claim against Strange] with the requisite reasonable particularity under the circumstances,\" it \"remained part of the ... bankruptcy estate, [and was] assertable only by the trustee in bankruptcy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the time of the circuit court's ruling, the statute of limitations on Ricketts's claim had expired. Moreover, the statute had not been tolled because, without standing, Ricketts's suit was a legal nullity.\n   <em>\n    Kocher v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=282%20Va.%20113\">\n    282 Va. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=712%20S.E.2d%20477\">\n    712 S.E.2d 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 480-81 (2011) (\"[A]n action filed by a party who lacks standing is a legal nullity ... [and] has no tolling effect on the statute of limitations.\"). To avoid the statute of limitations bar, Ricketts moved, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-6, for the circuit court to \"amend the named plaintiff [in her pleadings] to [George McLean, the bankruptcy trustee], due to the misnomer.\" Alternatively,\n   Ricketts asked that McLean be substituted as the proper plaintiff pursuant to Rule 3:17. The circuit court denied the motions. Ricketts appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ricketts first argues that the circuit court erred by granting Strange's motion for summary judgment. She contends that she had standing to pursue her cause of action because she properly exempted it from the bankruptcy estate. \"In an appeal from a circuit court's decision to grant or deny summary judgment this Court reviews the application of law to undisputed facts de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v.

LEXIS 1683 at *10 (6th Cir.

She contends that her negligence claim was properly exempted because it falls within this language. The language, however, is overly general at best and boilerplate at worst. It provides no useful information that would lead the trustee to discover the claim against Strange.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41910,6125958\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/775/202/\">\n    775 F.2d at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that courts should discourage debtors from making \"excessively general claims in the hope that if omissions should be discovered, the debtors could argue that the omitted property was 'really' in some broadly worded category.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even if the above language was a sincere attempt to schedule her cause of action, it is listed in the wrong location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fossey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6103770\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/119/268/#p272\">\n    119 B.R. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272 (D. Utah 1990) (holding that a debtor failed to schedule a cause of action when he listed it in an incorrect location). At the time she filed her petition for bankruptcy, Ricketts had yet to initiate her negligence suit. Nevertheless, she claims that she disclosed this inchoate cause of action under\n   question 18 of Schedule B, which asks debtors to list \"\n   <em>\n    liquidated\n   </em>\n   debts owed to debtor including tax refunds.\" (Emphasis added). Ricketts conceded at oral argument\n   that it would have been \"proper\" to list it under question 21, which is reserved for \"[o]ther contingent and unliquidated claims of every nature.\" In response to question 21, however, Ricketts expressly marked, \"None.\" Thus, not only did she fail to properly schedule the cause of action with the requisite specificity, but under question 21, where the trustee would expect to find any such causes of action, she affirmatively represented that no such claim existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vucak v.

While there are no \"bright-line rules\" a debtor must follow to exempt a cause of action, the schedules must contain sufficient detail to lead the trustee to the claim ultimately asserted. Ricketts's schedules do not. Accordingly, the cause of action remained an asset of the bankruptcy estate, and the circuit court did not err by holding that Ricketts lacked standing to assert it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B. Motions to Amend\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ricketts also argues that the trial court should have granted her motion to amend the name of the plaintiff in her pleadings to correct a misnomer pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-6. Alternatively, she argues that the circuit court should have granted her motion to substitute George McLean, the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Trustee, as the proper plaintiff pursuant to Rule 3:17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   1.

The \"right person\" was McLean, but he was not incorrectly named. Rather, the \"wrong person,\" Ricketts, was named. This is not a misnomer.

Rule 3:17\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ricketts alternatively requested that the circuit court substitute McLean as the plaintiff pursuant to Rule 3:17, which states, \"[i]f a person becomes incapable of prosecuting or defending because of death, disability, conviction of felony, removal from office, or other cause, a successor in interest may be substituted as a party in such person's place.\" Rule 3:17(a). The Rule's language contemplates a plaintiff who was once capable of prosecuting a claim, but subsequently \"becomes incapable.\" It is therefore inapplicable to Ricketts, who has been incapable of prosecuting her claim since it was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Nevertheless, on brief, Ricketts relies on\n   <em>\n    Jacobson v.

Virginia National Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2068018\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/231/440/\">\n    231 Va. 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=344%20S.E.2d%20913\">\n    344 S.E.2d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). There, as here, the appellant relied upon\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   to argue \"that leave to amend should be liberally granted in furtherance of the ends of justice, and that even an amendment substituting a new plaintiff or defendant for an original party may be granted if the substituted party bears a real relation of interest to the original party and no new cause of action is introduced.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 442,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=344%20S.E.2d%20913\">\n    344 S.E.2d at 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the original plaintiff, Ricketts, lacked standing to bring the\n   suit, McLean could not be substituted as the proper plaintiff.
