Upon the hearing of the motion the defendant interposed the preliminary objection that an order for the examination of the defendant under section 873 of the Code of Civil Procedure and an order for the examination and inspection of books are distinct and independent proceedings and cannot be united under one order. This objection seems to be well taken. <em>(Lefferts v. </em>Brampton, 24 How. Pr. 257; <em>Havemeyer </em>v. Ingersoll, 12 Abb. Pr. [N. S.] 301.) An absolute order for an inspection of books is <em>improper. (Dick </em>v. Phillips, 41 Hun, 603; <em>Francis </em>v. Porter, 88 id. 325.) In a proper case under sections 872-and 873 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a witness may be required to produce books and papers as an adjunct to his oral examination and to refer to them for the purpose of making his examination effective. <em>(Drake </em>v. <em>Weinman &amp; Co., </em>12 Misc. Rep. 65 ; <em>Fenton </em>v, <em>Dempsey, </em>10 N. Y. St. Repr. 733.) But a proceeding for the inspection of books must be commenced by petition. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 805 ; <em>Dick </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra; Francis </em>v. Porter, <em>supra.) </em>The motion is granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
