This provision, argues the board, effectively restricts the right of the school board not to renew a limited contract of teaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-17\">The only requirement imposed upon the board found in this collective bargaining agreement is that of notification in writing of the reasons for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>nonrenewal in cases involving teachers who had been employed by the school system for five years or more. It was the view of the court of appeals, and it is our view, that this provision does not restrict the board\u2019s continued right to nonrenew for any reason it deems necessary. Accordingly, we hold that such provision is not in conflict with R.C. 3319.11. The provision only requires the board to inform the affected teacher of the reason for the nonrenewal. We conclude that the imposition of this obligation upon the board would, in many instances, provide the affected employee with information which might permit the employee to correct misinformation or remedy a professional problem pertinent to that particular employment, or could serve to assist the employee in correcting a problem which would enhance his or her professional status generally. The slight restriction upon the board\u2019s procedural right to nonrenew limited contracts is considerably^outweighed by the possible values of such information to the affected teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Finally, the appellants argue that by entering final judgment against them, the court of appeals exceeded the authority granted in App. R. 12 (B). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The trial court dismissed this cause pursuant to Civ. R. 12 (B)(6). In the trial court\u2019s opinion the contractual provision relied upon was unenforceable because it conflicted with R.C. 3319.11. App. R. 12 (B) authorized the court of appeals to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment. The court of appeals properly did so. However, App. R. 12 (B) does not \u201c* * * extend authority to the Court of Appeals beyond that granted the trial court.\u201d <em>Houk </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 77, 80 [63 O.O.2d 119].</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The court of appeals, erroneously relying on App. R. 12 (B), rendered final judgment as a matter of law for plaintiffs and held \u201cthat appellee\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement constituted a breach of said agreement, and that Appellant Hazel Tracy be, and hereby is, reinstated to her position prior to non-renewal and is further awarded an amount equal to her lost wages, with all attendant fringe benefits, for the period from her non-renewal to her reinstatement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">As the trial court was not empowered by Civ. R. 12 (B)(6) to enter final judgment against the movant, App. R. 12 (B) is not a vehicle for the court of appeals to so act. Therefore, the court of appeals improperly entered final judgment against the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-12\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
