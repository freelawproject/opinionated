Secondly, appellant argues that no tax liability has accrued as its customers purchase the proofs exclusively for uses specifically designated in R.C. 5739.01(E) as tax exempt. Finally, appellant contends that the transactions represent the rendition of non-taxable personal or professional services in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>which the tangible personal property transferred, <em>i.e., </em>the proofs, is inconsequential. R.C. 5739.01(B). For the following reasons, we dismiss each of appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">R.C. 5739.01(B) provided at the time of the assessment herein, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u201c \u2018Sales\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 include all transactions by which title or possession, or both, of tangible personal property, is or is to be transferred, or a license to use or consume tangible personal property is or is to be granted; * * * and include all transactions by which printed, imprinted, overprinted, lithographic, multilithic, blueprinted, photostatic, or other productions or reproductions of written or graphic matter are or are to be furnished or transferred; for a consideration in any manner, whether absolutely or conditionally, whether for a price or rental, in money or by exchange, and by any means whatsoever; * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Relying upon the principle <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>appellant urges that the General Assembly\u2019s failure to expressly include transactions in which reproduction proofs are to be transferred or furnished with those explicitly delineated as taxable in R.C. 5739.01(B) evinces the General Assembly\u2019s intent to exclude the former from taxation. Appellant, however, not only improperly construes \u201cinclud[ing]\u201d as it is used in the statute, but also ignores the presumption of taxability found in R.C. 5739.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Both the common and general statutory usage of the word \u201cincluding\u201d significantly discredit the providence of applying the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>to the instant action. Indeed, earlier this year, we rejected an interpretation of \u201cincluding\u201d identical to that presently advanced by appellant. In <em>In re Hartman </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St. 3d 154, 156, this court stated: \u201c \u2018Including\u2019 is a word of expansion rather than one of limitation or restriction.\u201d Therefore, the omission of transactions involving reproduction proofs from the chronicle of transfers following \u201cincluding]\u201d in R.C. 5739.01(B) cannot reasonably be read as a concerted attempt by the General Assembly to exclude such transfers from imposition of the sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">More importantly, however, R.C. 5739.02 renders the principle of <em>ex-pressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>completely inapposite in the present context. The statute reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">\u201cFor the purpose of the proper administration of sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code, and to prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all sales made in this state are subject to the tax until the contrary is established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Thus, the statute requires that a vendor overcome the presumption that the transfers in which he has engaged are taxable in order to avoid an assessment. Appellant\u2019s unsupported pronouncement that the General Assembly\u2019s failure specifically to provide for the taxability of the subject transactions precludes the levying of a sales tax assessment thereon hardly constitutes the probative evidence of non-taxability necessary to negate the presumption. Indeed, as this court stated in paragraph two of the syllabus in <em>National Tube </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Glander </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 407 [47 O.O. 313]: \u201cStatutes relating to exemption or exception from taxation are to be strictly construed, and one claiming such exemption or exception must affirmatively establish his right thereto.\u201d See, also, <em>May Company </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 6, 9; <em>Cooperative Pure Milk Assn. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 23, 24 [74 O.O.2d 417], Appellant has in no way met its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We thus hold that reliance solely upon the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>in construing R.C. 5739.01(B) is insufficient to overcome the presumption of taxability embodied in R.C. 5739.02 and shield a transaction from imposition of sales taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">For similar reasons appellant\u2019s contention that the transfers of reproduction proofs are exempt from sales taxation under R.C. 5739.01(E)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> must also fail. First, appellant, in contravention of R.C. 5739.03(B),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not timely secure the required certificates from its customers to support its claimed exemptions. Appellant responds, however, that such failure is, under the latter provisions of R.C. 5739.03(B), excused because its clients, particularly the advertising agencies, in purchasing reproduction proofs, are never subject to sales tax since the use to which they put the proofs is tax exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">This court would most willingly accept appellant\u2019s argument had appellant adduced, within the period permitted under R.C. 5739.03(B), sufficient proof that its customers\u2019 purchases of the subject goods were always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>tax exempt. Appellant, however, offered nothing beyond a self-serving, conclusory assertion of non-taxability to substantiate its claim. Having failed to submit the requisite exemption certificates, appellant was bound to do more than it did to overcome the exacting presumption of taxability found in R.C. 5739.02. <em>Union Metal Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 53 [67 O.O.2d 72]. Again, appellant mistakenly relied on a contention unsupported by evidence to meet its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Finally, appellant argues that, as it offers a professional service in which the transfer of tangible personal property is incidental, its transactions are tax exempt under R.C. 5739.01(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We must dismiss appellant\u2019s claim, however, as appellant failed to preserve this issue for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">R.C. 5717.02 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>for the appeal of the Tax Commissioner\u2019s determinations to the Board of Tax Appeals. As to the proper format for the statutorily mandated notice of appeal, R.C. 5717.02 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u201c* * * The notice of appeal shall set forth, or have attached thereto and incorporated therein by reference, a true copy of the notice sent by such commissioner to the taxpayer of the final determination complained of, and shall also specify the errors therein complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">It is axiomatic that when a right to appeal is conferred by legislative enactment, the statute\u2019s prescriptions must all be strictly complied with in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the appropriate appellate tribunal. <em>Lenart </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 110 [15 O.O.3d 152]; <em>Queen City Valves </em>v. <em>Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 579 [53 O.O. 430]; <em>American Restaurant &amp; Lunch Co. </em>v. <em>Glander </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 147 [33 O.O. 38]. In its notice of appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, appellant failed to raise its contention that it is a purveyor of professional-services whose business transactions are by law exempt from sales taxation. As the issue was never properly raised, the board had, and all subsequent reviewing bodies have, no authority to adjudicate the matter. Consequently, the issue of whether typesetters do indeed provide professional services within the context of R.C. 5739.01(B) is not before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, upholding appellee\u2019s sales tax assessment of appellant\u2019s reproduction proof transfers, being neither unreasonable nor unlawful, is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b119-11\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
