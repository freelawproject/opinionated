Appellants rely on <em>Columbus, ex rel. Willits, </em>v. <em>Creaman </em>(1971), 27 Ohio App. 2d 137 [56 O.O.2d 310], for their contention that a municipally owned water treatment plant is not within the purview of city charter Section 4-6. In <em>Willits, </em>the Court of Appeals for Franklin County was called upon to construe a Colum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>bus City Charter provision similar to the one in the present case. That court held in paragraph two of the syllabus, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u201cA provision in a city charter prohibiting a \u2018public utility\u2019 from enacting legislation of an emergency nature regulating the rate to be charged for its service does not apply to the increasing of sewer rates of a municipally owned utility by a city council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The court of appeals noted a distinction existed between privately and publicly owned public utilities in the Columbus City Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">No such distinction exists in the Charter of the city of Clyde. The charter makes no other mention of public utilities outside the bounds of Section 4-6. The court of appeals, in the present case, correctly pointed out that the language construed in <em>Willits </em>did not involve the words \u201cpublic utility service,\u201d but rather the words \u201cpublic utility.\u201d The use of the term \u201cpublic utility service\u201d connotes a broader spectrum of inclusion by the provisions of Section 4-6, in the present case, than by the charter provision construed in <em>Willits. </em>For these reasons <em>Willits </em>can be distinguished on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">This court expressed in <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Columbus </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 1 [67 O.O.2d 1], at paragraph two of the syllabus, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">\u201cA sewerage system owned and operated by a municipality for the benefit of its inhabitants is embraced within the term \u2018public utility\u2019 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">In light of the foregoing, this court finds that the term \u201cpublic utility\u201d includes both publicly and privately owned utilities. Applying this finding to Section 4-6, we conclude the terms of the section excluding ordinances dealing with the regulation of rates \u201cto be charged for public utility service\u201d from the provisions of an emergency ordinance must be honored. The right of referendum<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is a primary right of the citizenry of Ohio for the redress of their grievances against the governmental bodies which regulate their freedoms. As such, the right must be accorded the utmost protection, and any conflicts which arise concerning the availability of referendum, in relation to a particular ordinance, should be resolved in favor of preserving the right of referendum. In the present case, the court is compelled to interpret Section 4-6 as a conscious preservation of the right of referendum by the electorate of Clyde, which must be read in its literal sense, as a bar to the emergency passage of Ordinance No. 1981-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">As to appellants\u2019 argument that the ordinance is not a regulation of the utility rates, which is barred by Section 4-6, but a mere grant of power to the city manager to regulate rates in the future, this court agrees with the trial court that such argument is \u201c* * * really a distinction without a difference.\u201d Thus an action in mandamus is proper to compel the filing of the referendum petitions presented by appellees to appellant Scheer.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b381-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Celebrezze, C.J., W.

Chapter 731.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b381-7\">Locher, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">dissenting. The majority correctly states that the issue in this case is whether the Clyde City Council properly termed Ordinance No. 1981-68 as an emergency measure. The resolution of that issue hinges upon analysis of the following sentence: \u201cNo legislation involving the <em>levying of a tax, granting, renewing or extending a franchise or regulating the rate </em>to be charged for public utility service shall be passed as an emergency measure.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 4-6 of the Clyde Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">In order to understand that provision, it is essential to read its language in context. That is, this section of the charter excludes three legislative areas from the \u201cemergency measure\u201d category: taxation, franchising utility services to private entities and utility regulation. Each of these necessarily involves governmental supervision of private sector activities. The city cannot tax itself. Likewise, the city cannot establish a franchisor-franchisee relationship with itself. Most importantly for this case, a city cannot regulate its own activities. Rather, the term \u201cregulating\u201d connotes a relationship in which one entity has a superior position over another.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">On its face, therefore, Section 4-6 of the charter prohibits emergency measures which would affect private interests only.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of this provision is, therefore, strained. This results from reading the words \u201cpublic utility\u201d out of context.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">For example, the majority cites <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Columbus </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 1 [67 O.O.2d 1] (paragraph two of the syllabus), as supportive of its position. Yet, the majority fails to quote paragraph two of the syllabus in its entirety: \u201cA sewerage system owned and operated by a municipality for the benefit of its inhabitants is embraced within the term \u2018public utility\u2019 <em>in Sections U and 6 of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) What the majority fails to mention is that Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution deals exclusively with municipal corporations and their powers \u2014 including home rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Section 4 of Article XVIII empowers municipalities to own and operate utilities. Section 6 of Article XVIII establishes criteria for the sale of the \u201csurplus product\u201d of a municipal utility. In that context, therefore, the <em>Britt </em>court\u2019s construction of the term \u201cpublic utility\u201d is sensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">Conversely, the Revised Code contains a definition of \u201cpublic utility\u201d which would serve appellants\u2019 purpose: \u201c \u2018Public utility\u2019 means every one as defined in divisions (A)(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), and (14) of section 4905.03 of the Revised Code, including all telephone companies, but excepting * * * <em>such other public utilities as are owned or operated by any municipal corporation </em>* * (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4911.01 (A). That provision is part of a chapter which establishes the consumers\u2019 counsel. The con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>text, therefore, determines the meaning of \u201cpublic utility\u201d in each of these examples. Basic principles of construction require, therefore, that we consider the common meaning of the term \u201cpublic utility\u201d and its context in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The court of appeals quoted in its opinion a definition of \u201cpublic utility\u201d which appeared in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (Rev. 4 Ed. 1968), as being supportive of its conclusion that the words \u201cpublic utility\u201d include municipal operations. Yet, the primary definition of \u201cpublic utility,\u201d which now appears in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979), at 1108, states: \u201cA <em>privately owned and operated business </em>whose services are so essential to the general public as to justify the grant of special <em>franchises </em>for the use of public property or of the right of eminent domain, in consideration of which the owners must serve all persons who apply, without discrimination. It is always a virtual monopoly.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Therefore, the majority\u2019s result and analysis fail for two reasons. First, as demonstrated above, the language in question pertains solely to private entities. A municipality cannot tax itself or franchise with itself or <em>regulate </em>itself. The context in which the language \u201cregulating the rate to be charged for public utility service\u201d appears clearly requires that we confine its application to legislation affecting private interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Second, the term \u201cpublic utility\u201d in common usage is limited to \u201cprivately owned and operated\u201d providers. In the context of a sentence dealing with taxation, franchising and regulating, the only sensible meaning to give to the term \u201cpublic utility\u201d is that which is most commonly accepted and connoting private ownership and operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Accordingly, I would reverse the court of appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
