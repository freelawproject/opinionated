Furthermore, the cross-appellee asserts that the defense of assumption of risk remains as a total bar to recovery in an action in negligence despite the enactment of the Ohio comparative negligence statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In prior cases, this court has described the defense of assumption of risk as follows: \u201c \u2018* * * (1) consent or acquiescence in (2) an appreciated or known (3) risk * * *. The practicalities of proof require that the defense of assumption of the risk also be applicable where the risk is so obvious that plaintiff must have known and appreciated it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Deffet Rentals </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 86, 89 [20 O.O.3d 71]; <em>Wever </em>v. <em>Hicks </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 230, 234 [40 O.O.2d 203]. See, also, <em>Briere </em>v. <em>Lathrop Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 166 [51 O.O.2d 232],</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Until today, Ohio law has consistently recognized a distinction between assumption of risk and contributory negligence. See, <em>e.g., Masters </em>v. <em>New York Central RR. Co. </em>(1947), 147 Ohio St. 293 [34 O.O. 223]; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Toledo Terminal RR. Co. </em>(1950), 152 Ohio St. 463 [40 O.O. 485]; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Cleveland Hockey Club </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 225 [47 O.O. 147]; <em>Centrello </em>v. <em>Basky </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 41 [57 O.O. 77]; <em>Wever, supra; DeAmiches </em>v. <em>Popczun </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St. 2d 180 [64 O.O.2d 106]; <em>Benjamin, supra. </em>In <em>Wever, </em>this court specifically rejected an argument \u201cthat the defense of assumption of the risk is not conceptually different from the defense of contributory negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Although this court distinguished the defenses of assumption of risk and contributory negligence, it was also recognized in the above cases that in many instances the doctrines overlap and that both defenses may exist under the same facts. As first stated in <em>Masters </em>v. <em>New York Central RR. Co., supra, </em>at 301:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u201cIncidentally,\u2019 there are situations where the defenses of assumption of risk and contributory negligence will overlap. The plaintiff\u2019s conduct in accepting the risk may itself be unreasonable, because the danger is out of all proportion to the interest which he is seeking to advance * * *. In all such cases, both defenses are available to the defendant. * * * In working out the distinction, the courts have arrived at the conclusion that assumption of risk is a matter of knowledge of the danger and intelligent acquiescence in it, and that to the extent that this can be found recovery will be denied; while contributory negligence is a matter of some fault or departure from the standard of reasonable conduct, however unwilling or protesting the plaintiff may be. * * * The two may coexist, or either may exist without the other. * * *\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Under the prior cases, the overlap in these doctrines posed no problems because in practice it did not matter whether the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was denominated as assumption of risk or contributory negligence, since both stood as absolute bars to a plaintiff\u2019s recovery. However, now, under R.C. 2315.19, if a plaintiff\u2019s conduct constitutes both contributory negligence and assumption of risk, continued adherence to the differentiation of the doctrines can lead to the anomalous situation where a defendant can circumvent the comparative negligence statute entirely by asserting the assumption of risk defense alone. We do not believe that the General Assembly intended such a result in its enactment of R.C. 2315.19, and for this reason, we must revise our prior pronouncements on the doctrine of assumption of risk in view of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">This court has recognized the need to reevaluate the application of the defense of assumption of risk in light of the comparative negligence statute, see <em>Benjamin, supra, </em>at page 90, footnote 5; however, considerations of ripeness, among other things, prevented us from reaching the issue at that time. Now, with the issue squarely in front of us, we hold that the defense of assumption of risk is merged with the defense of contributory negligence under R.C. 2315.19. The conduct previously considered as assumption of risk by the plaintiff shall be considered by the trier of the fact under the phrase \u201ccontributory negligence of the person bringing the action\u201d under R.C. 2315.19, and the negligence of all parties shall be apportioned by the court or jury pursuant to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Our holding in this respect is in accord with the well-reasoned approach in other jurisdictions which have merged assumption of risk and contributory negligence after adoption of a comparative negligence statute which was silent on the defense of assumption of risk. See <em>McConville </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1962), 15 Wis. 2d 374, 113 N.W. 2d 14; <em>Colson </em>v. <em>Rule </em>(1962), 15 Wis. 2d 387, 113 N.W. 2d 21; <em>Gilson </em>v. <em>Drees Bros. </em>(1963), 19 Wis. 2d 252, 120 N.W. 2d 63; <em>Springrose </em>v. <em>Willmore </em>(1971), 292 Minn. 23, 192 N.W. 2d 826; <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Redding Construction Co. </em>(1973), 83 Wash. 2d 86, 515 P. 2d 821; <em>Farley </em>v. <em>M M Cattle Co. </em>(Tex. 1975), 529 S.W. 2d 751; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(Me. 1976), 354 A. 2d 398; <em>Wentz </em>v. <em>Deseth </em>(N.D. 1974), 221 N.W. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>101; <em>Brittain </em>v. <em>Booth </em>(Wyo. 1979), 601 P. 2d 532; <em>Sunday </em>v. <em>Stratton Corp. </em>(1978), 136 Vt. 293, 390 A. 2d 398; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Sherburne Corp. </em>(1979), 137 Vt. 310, 403 A. 2d 278; <em>Kopischke </em>v. <em>First Continental Corp. </em>(Mont. 1980), 610 P. 2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In addition, two jurisdictions which judicially adopted comparative negligence, also judicially merged assumption of the risk with contributory negligence. <em>Li </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1975), 13 Cal. 3d 804, 119 Cal. Rptr. 858, 532 P. 2d 1226; <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Dorta </em>(Fla. 1977), 348 So. 2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The foregoing merger of assumption of risk with contributory negligence is not intended to merge that category of assumption of risk known as \u201cexpress\u201d assumption of risk. Express assumption of risk would arise where a person expressly contracts with another not to sue for any future injuries which may be caused by that person\u2019s negligence. This view is in accord with the decisions of other jurisdictions which have merged assumption of risk with contributory negligence. See <em>Gilson, supra; Springrose, supra; Lyons, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Additionally, our merger of the two doctrines is not intended to merge that type of assumption of risk defined as \u201cprimary assumption of risk,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which concerns cases where there is a lack of duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. This type of assumption of risk is typified by the baseball cases where a plaintiff is injured when a baseball is hit into the stands. This standard was stated in dicta in the case of <em>Cincinnati Base Ball Club Co. </em>v. <em>Eno </em>(1925), 112 Ohio St. 175, 180-181, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u201cThe consensus of * * * opinions is to the effect that it is common knowledge that in baseball games hard balls are thrown and batted with great swiftness, that they are liable to be thrown or batted outside the lines of the diamond, and that spectators in positions which may be reached by such balls assume the risk thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">With respect to the issue of whether the grant of summary judgment in favor of the landlord Ceccardi was proper, we hold that summary judgment here was improper, and thus, we affirm the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">In <em>Shroades </em>v. <em>Rental Homes </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 20, 25-26 [22 O.O.3d 152], this court stated that \u201cR.C. 5321.04 imposes duties on the landlord to make repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition. * * * A violation of a statute which sets forth specific duties constitutes negligence <em>per se. </em>* * * However, in addition to negligence <em>per se, </em>proximate cause for the injuries sustained must be established. * * * Also it must be shown that the landlord received notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the defective condition of the rental premises, that the landlord knew of the defect, or that the tenant had made reasonable, but unsuccessful, attempts to notify the landlord.\u201d (Citations omitted.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">We agree with the court of appeals that a factual question exists for the jury concerning the cause of the injury. This means that a determination must be made as to whether the tenant\u2019s act of using the stairs broke the causal connection between the landlord\u2019s negligence <em>per se </em>and the injury sustained. This determination depends upon whether the intervening act of the tenant was reasonably foreseeable to the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In view of our holding that the defense of assumption of risk merges with the defense of contributory negligence under R.C. 2315.19, we further hold that in an action for personal injuries to a tenant proximately caused by a violation of a landlord\u2019s statutory duty under R.C. 5321.04, the landlord is negligent <em>per se, </em>and assumption of risk is not available as an absolute bar to a tenant\u2019s claim for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Based on the foregoing, we reverse the appellate court\u2019s determination that the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk do not merge under the comparative negligence statute, R.C. 2315.19. We affirm the court of appeals in reversing the summary judgment of the trial court, in that factual issues exist regarding causation and reasonable foreseeability, and that the landlord\u2019s defense of assumption of risk does not bar a tenant\u2019s claim for recovery, and we remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\n<em>Judgment reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-4\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.

I am in agreement with the court of appeals that the recently enacted comparative negligence statute, R.C. 2315.19, does not specifically, nor by implication, merge the affirmative defense of assumption of the risk into such comparative negligence law as it specifically does so merge contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Historically, it has been recognized in Ohio, as elsewhere, that the doctrines of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk are <em>not </em>synonymous. See <em>DeAmiches </em>v. <em>Popczun </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St. 2d 180 [64 O.O.2d 106]; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Higgins </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St. 2d 239 [43 O.O.2d 368]; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Toledo Terminal RR. Co. </em>(1950), 152 Ohio St. 463 [40 O.O. 485]; <em>Masters </em>v. <em>New York Central RR. Co. </em>(1947), 147 Ohio St. 293 [34 O.O. 223],</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Each doctrine is a separately pleaded affirmative defense, and each has its own legal characteristics. As defined in Ohio, assumption of the risk requires three elements: \u201cOne must have full knowledge of a condition, such condition must be patently dangerous to him; and he must voluntarily expose himself to the hazard.\u201d <em>Briere </em>v. <em>Lathrop Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 166, 174-175 [51 O.O.2d 232], Contributory negligence, however, has been defined as a departure from the standard of reasonable care regardless of how unwilling and protesting the plaintiff may be. <em>DeAmiches </em>v. <em>Popczun; Dunn </em>v. <em>Higgins; Masters </em>v. <em>New York Central RR. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">In view of the distinction between the two concepts, the decisions have recognized that assumption of the risk is based on venturousness and requires a subjective standard for evaluation while contributory negligence is based on carelessness and is objectively evaluated. <em>DeAmiches </em>v. <em>Popczun, supra. </em>Furthermore, it has been recognized that the defenses are not mutually exclusive but both may be asserted in the same litigation. <em>DeAmiches </em>v. <em>Popczun; Dunn </em>v. <em>Higgins; Wever </em>v. <em>Hicks </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 230 [40 O.O.2d 203]; and <em>Masters </em>v. <em>New York Central RR. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">R.C. 2315.19, being in abrogation of common law, must be strictly construed, and because that statute refers only to the defense of contributory negligence the argument for merger of the defense of assumption of the risk is without legislative or statutory support.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The preamble of this statute gives ample testimony to the specific legislative intent in the enactment of such new law, and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">\u201cTo enact section 2315.19 of the Revised Code to substitute a form of comparative negligence for the common law doctrine of contributory negligence in the determination of the right of recovery and amount of damages in negligence actions.\u201d (Am. S.B. No. 165, 138 Ohio Laws, Part _,_,)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>As to precedents in other states, continued recognition of the doctrine of assumption of the risk has been given where statutory comparative negligence has been adopted. We may look for precedent to the states of Rhode Island, Nebraska, South Dakota and Arkansas, which have retained the doctrine of implied assumption of the risk as an absolute bar to a plaintiff\u2019s claim in negligence despite the enactment of comparative negligence statutes in their jurisdictions. <em>McPherson </em>v. <em>Sunset Speedway, Inc. </em>(C.A. 8, 1979), 594 F. 2d 711 (applying Nebraska law); <em>Capps </em>v. <em>McCarley &amp; Co. </em>(1976), 260 Ark. 839, 544 S.W. 2d 850; <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Brichacek </em>(1974), 191 Neb. 457, 215 N.W. 2d 888; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Providence Hockey Club, Inc. </em>(1977), 119 R.I. 70, 376 A. 2d 329; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Lennox Co-op Assn. </em>(S.D. 1981), 307 N.W. 2d 863; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Gregg </em>(1958), 77 S.D. 406, 92 N.W. 2d 654. In these jurisdictions, the two defenses are treated as separate and independent, which historically has been the case in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The question of merger was extensively discussed in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Providence Hockey Club, Inc., supra, </em>where the court specifically rejected the argument that assumption of the risk is merely a variant of contributory fault, as follows at pages 76-77:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u201cIn our understanding, then, contributory negligence and assumption of the risk do not overlap; the key difference is, of course, the exercise of one\u2019s free will in encountering the risk. Negligence analysis, couched in reasonable man hypotheses, has no place in the assumption of the risk framework. When one acts knowingly, it is immaterial whether he acts reasonably. The postulate, then, that assumption of the risk is merely a variant of contributory fault, is not, to our minds, persuasive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Providence Hockey Club, Inc., </em>at page 76, set forth quite clearly the different policies behind the respective doctrines of defense, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u201cAs we have defined assumption of the risk, the concern is with <em>knowingly </em>encountering the danger. This is to be contrasted with <em>negligently </em>encountering a risk in falling victim, at one time in our legal history, to the defense of contributory negligence. It seems to us one who \u2018sees, knows, understands and appreciates\u2019 what he is doing, <em>D Andrea </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra </em>[(1972), 109 R.I. 479, 287 A.2d 629], is worlds apart from one who unwittingly and unsuspectingly falls prey to another\u2019s negligence. In the former instance the plaintiff can be said to have consented to the possibility of harm, whereas in the latter; situation he has failed to assess accurately his situation and the ramifications of his own action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">I am in agreement with the Rhode Island Supreme Court\u2019s assessment that these defenses are independent, distinct, and based upon conceptually different grounds. As stated, they have been historically held to be so, and the legislature, in the enactment of the comparative negligence statute, intended that they remain so.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">It is my position, unlike the majority here, that the defense of assumption of the risk remains available to a landlord in an action against him for personal injuries allegedly resulting from a breach of his obligations under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Landlords and Tenants Act of 1974. Absolutely nothing should be read into that Act which would abrogate or deny a landlord his common-law defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Applying the doctrine of assumption of the risk to the facts of this case, the plaintiff should be barred from recovery from this landlord. The record shows that there were three separate entrances to the dwelling: the front, side and back. Of these three separate means of ingress arid egress to the dwelling, Anderson testified that only the front entrance was in an unsafe condition. One of the steps of the front entrance to the dwelling, according to Anderson\u2019s deposition, originally had a small hole in it. The hole became larger, ultimately reaching approximately eighteen inches in length. Anderson testified that he repeatedly complained of the unsafe condition, felt that the step was unsafe, and further admitted that it was sufficiently unsafe that he was rather concerned about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Anderson continued to use the front steps to the premises despite the availability of two other means of ingress and egress to the building. Ultimately, the very step as to which he testified he had complained of and understood to be unsafe gave way underneath him. Anderson further deposed that the same unsafe condition he had previously complained of to the appellant was the cause of his fall in September 1980, upon which this action is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">I submit that the deposition testimony of the appellee conclusively demonstrates that he voluntarily exposed himself to a known and appreciated risk. In his own deposition testimony he had actual knowledge of the particularly unsafe condition which caused his injuries. He appreciated the risk as he was personally concerned about his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-8\">Locher, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
