The second question is whether appellant\u2019s typewriters are exempt from taxation under the packaging exception contained in R.C. 5739.02 (B)(15). The final issue is whether the Board of Tax Appeals properly refused to rule on appellant\u2019s contention that it was entitled to a production exemption with respect to its typewriters.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>R.C. 5739.01, at the time of the assessment, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"A-a\">\u201c(E) \u2018Retail sale\u2019 and \u2018sales at retail\u2019 include all sales except those in which the purpose of the consumer is:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u201c(2) * * * [T]o use or consume the thing transferred * * * directly in making retail sales * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">U* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u201c(P) \u2018Making retail sales\u2019 means the effecting of transactions wherein one party is obligated to pay the price and the other party is obligated to transfer title to or possession of the item sold, but it does not include the delivery of items thereafter nor the preliminary acts of promoting or soliciting the retail sales other than the distribution of printed matter which displays or describes and prices the item offered for sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Pursuant to R.C. 5741.02 (C)(2), the exemptions from the sales tax in R.C. Chapter 5739 are also applicable to the use tax levied pursuant to R.C. Chapter 5741.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The Tax Commissioner has adopted guidelines to aid in interpreting the \u201cdirect use in retail sales\u201d exemption contained at Ohio Adm. Code 5703-9-24, which at the time relevant herein provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">\u201cTangible personal property which is to be used or consumed directly in making retail sales, may, when purchased by a person engaged in making retail sales, be purchased under a claim of exemption. Articles subject to such claim include show cases, equipment and shelves used to display merchandise for sales; store furniture and fixtures; supplies and equipment used in consummating retail sales; equipment for use or consumption in storing or preserving goods and merchandise in the sales area; and printed matter which displays or describes and prices the item offered for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">\u201cThis exemption does not apply to equipment used for general heating of the sales area, to fuels for such equipment, to any other supplies not used directly in making retail sales or not specifically used in storing or preserving goods and merchandise in the sales area, to delivery equipment, nor to items used to promote or solicit retail sales. Examples of items to which the exemption would not apply include lumber, wall board and similar items used as partitions whether in the retail rooms, display windows or elsewhere; janitor and cleaning supplies, fans, decorative items, items used in offices, stock or delivery rooms, outside signs, trucks or equipment used to deliver merchandise sold at retail, and advertising materials other than printed matter which displays or describes and prices the item offered for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">\u201c \u2018Sales area\u2019 means any area in which retail sales are customarily made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">Initially, appellant contests the Board of Tax Appeals\u2019 finding that the pharmacy is not a \u201csales area.\u201d Appellant contends that the pharmacy qualifies as a \u201csales area\u201d because \u201c[t]he pharmacy is the place where the pharmacist makes the sale.\u201d The board rejected this contention, concluding that the pharmacy and its associated equipment were not used \u201cdirectly in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>making retail sales.\u201d The board stated that \u201c* * * [t]his Board views the pharmacy area as a private work place necessary for a pharmacist\u2019s use in preparation of a final product for sale. The fact that the area and the items contained therein may be deemed essential, necessary, required or facilitative in the overall operation of the pharmacy cannot convert an indirect use into a direct use. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Appellant also contends that the board\u2019s finding that the pharmacy is not a \u201csales area\u201d is inconsistent with its decision in <em>Hilton Hotels Corp. </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(July 31, 1962), BTA No. 48023. Therein, the board held that the shelves holding liquor behind a bar were \u201cused directly in making retail sales.\u201d The board did not specifically address the issue of whether the area behind the bar was a \u201csales area\u201d in <em>Hilton Hotel </em>and, therefore, appellant\u2019s reliance <em>cm Hilton Hotel </em>regarding its applicability to a \u201csales area\u201d question is misplaced. This court has consistently held that it \u201c* * * will not overrule board findings of fact which are based on sufficient probative evidence. R.C. 5717.04; see <em>Emery Industries </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 34 [72 O.O.2d 19]; <em>Highlights for Children </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 186 [4 O.O.3d 379]; <em>Hawthorn Mellody </em>v. <em>Lindley, supra, </em>[(1981), 65 Ohio St. 2d 47 (19 O.O.3d 234)] at page 49.\u201d <em>Southwestern Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 417, 421 [21 O.O.3d 261]. In light of this standard of review, the board\u2019s determination that the pharmacy is not a \u201csales area\u201d is not unreasonable or unlawful. Accordingly, we do not disturb the board\u2019s determination that the refrigerators in appellant\u2019s pharmacies were not \u201cequipment for use or consumption in storing or preserving goods and merchandise in the sales area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The board did consider the <em>Hilton Hotel </em>case in determining whether pharmacy shelving could be exempted as \u201cshowcases, equipment and shelves used to display merchandise for sale.\u201d The board distinguished <em>Hilton Hotel, </em>noting that in a bar, a customer may select from the liquor displayed on the bar\u2019s shelves, whereas in a pharmacy, a customer may not select his purchase from a display of drugs on the shelf. A customer may only purchase what is authorized by prescription. The pharmacy shelving contains bulk amounts of pharmaceuticals from which the pharmacist prepares the prescription that is sold. For these reasons, the pharmacy shelving does not \u201cdisplay merchandise for sale\u201d and the board\u2019s decision is not unreasonable or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Appellant also argues that the lumber used to elevate the pharmacy, pharmacy shelving, tables, cabinets and prescription files are either \u201cstore furniture and fixtures\u201d or \u201csupplies and equipment used in consummating retail sales,\u201d under Ohio Adm. Code 5703-9-24. As the Board of Tax Appeals noted, the regulation must be read in conjunction with the statute which requires the items exempted to be used \u201cdirectly\u201d in making retail sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The board found that the shelves were used for the \u201cconvenience, benefit and accommodation of the pharmacist\u201d and that the tables, cabinets and prescription files were several steps removed from the actual sale. This find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ing is not unreasonable in view of the narrow construction given the \u201cdirect use\u201d exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The board determined that the lumber used to elevate the pharmacy was essentially used to emphasize certain floor space and not used directly in making retail sales. This is consistent with Ohio Adm. Code 5703-9-24, which states that lumber used for partitions is not exempt. This court reached the same conclusion with respect to materials for walls used as partitions in <em>Federated Department Stores </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 1 [74 O.O.2d 1].</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Appellant contests the assessment of typewriters used to type prescription labels for several reasons. First, appellant argues that the typewriters are directly used in making retail sales because typewritten labels are required by law for each prescription it sells. This argument is without merit. The typewriters are not used \u201cdirectly\u201d in making a retail sale and the fact that the label is required by law does not affect that determination. Addressing a similar argument with respect to property which, by statute, was required to be used in mining operations, the court held in <em>Fyr-Fyter Co. </em>v. <em>Glander </em>(1948), 150 Ohio St. 118 [37 O.O. 432], at paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u201cThe fact that certain items of tangible personal property are required by law in mines or mining operations does not in and of itself exempt or except from taxation the sale or use of such items for such purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">This rationale applies with equal force to the case at bar. That appellant\u2019s typewriters are used to prepare labels required by law does not in and of itself exempt the typewriters from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Appellant next argues that the typewriters are exempt under the packaging exemption in R.C. 5739.02 (B)(15) which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\u201cSales to persons engaged in any of the activities mentioned in division (E)(2) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code, of packages, including material and parts therefor, and of machinery, equipment, and material for use in packaging tangible personal property produced for sale, or sold at retail. Packages include bags, baskets, cartons, crates, boxes, cans, bottles, bindings, wrappings, and other similar devices and containers and \u2018packaging\u2019 means placing therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">To qualify for an exemption under this statute the property must be a \u201cpackage,\u201d \u201cmaterial or parts therefor,\u201d or equipment used for placing property for sale in a package. The board\u2019s conclusion that the typewriters in question do not fit into these categories is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Appellant further argued before the board that the typewriters were exempt as property used in the production of a prescription for sale under R.C. 5739.01 (E)(2). The board refused to consider this argument because appellant had not specified a claim of entitlement to an exemption as a producer in its notice of appeal. The board may not consider any error not specified in the notice of appeal. <em>Lenart </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 110 [15 O.O.3d 152]; <em>Gochneaur </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 59 [75 O.O.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>142], Appellant contends this error was specified by the following paragraphs of its notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">\u201c2. The Tax Commissioner erred in failing to delete or subtract out purchases of typewriters and typewriter materials as required by law to make pharmacy sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u201c3. The Tax Commissioner erred in failing to delete or subtract out purchases of typewriters as equipment used in assembling a pharmaceutical package for sale, as applicable to the tax years in issue under O.R.C. Sec. 5739.02 (B)(15).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Throughout its appeal, appellant claimed entitlement to exemption as a retailer. The general language of paragraph two above is insufficient notice that appellant also sought a production exemption. Similarly the fact that R.C. 5739.02 (B)(15) refers to R.C. 5739.01 (E)(2) (which contains, <em>inter alia, </em>the production exemption and retailing exemption) does not entitle appellant to claim an exemption for property used in production.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In its final proposition of law, appellant challenges the assessment with respect to the information centers and sign mounts. R.C. 5739.01 (P), provided that \u201c[mjaking retail sales\u201d did not include \u201c* * * the preliminary acts of promoting or soliciting the retail sales other than the distribution of printed matter which displays or describes and prices the item offered for sale.\u201d This is repeated in Ohio Adm. Code 5703-9-24. The information centers and sign mounts are not printed matter, but only hold printed matter describing and pricing items for sale. Thus, the board did not err in determining that the information centers and sign mounts \u201cthemselves do not display or describe the item offered for sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b211-10\">Locher, Holmes and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b211-11\">Locher, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3g\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. Although I fully endorse the court\u2019s treatment of most of the issues presented in the case at bar, I cannot join with it in upholding the Board of Tax Appeals\u2019 decision concerning the taxability of appellant\u2019s typewriter purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">Federal law, <em>i.e., </em>Section 352 (e), Title 21, U.S. Code, mandates that certain information on prescription labels be typewritten. Thus, appellant, if it is legally to make pharmaceutical sales, must have a typewriter. The typewriters which appellant employs in its operation are used exclusively to type the labels and, thereby, comply with the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">R.C. 5739.01 (E) provided, in pertinent part, that: \u201c \u2018Retail sale\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u2018sales at retail\u2019 include all sales except those in which the purpose of the consumer is * * * (2) * * * to use or consume the thing transferred * * * directly in making retail sales * * Curiously, the court finds that appellant\u2019s typewriters are not used or consumed \u201cdirectly\u201d in making retail sales. What could be of more direct use in making a retail sale, however, than an item which, if not used, would preclude the very consummation of the sales transaction? In the context of the case at bar, but for the typewriters, there could be no legal sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Notwithstanding the decision in <em>Fyr-Fyter Co. </em>v. <em>Glander </em>(1948), 150 Ohio St. 118 [37 O.O. 432], it is not only a violation of both the explicit language and the intent of R.C. 5739.01 (E) but also works a patent and fundamental injustice to assess appellant, as the majority does today, for purchasing an item which the lawful conduct of his profession necessitates. Consequently, I must dissent from that portion of the court\u2019s opinion which finds appellant\u2019s purchase of typewriters to be a taxable event.</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-5\">Holmes and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
