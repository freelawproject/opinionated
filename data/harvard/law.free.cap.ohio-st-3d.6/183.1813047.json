If the school district was not appellant\u2019s employer, however, then appellee may not invoke the statutory immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">This court considered a related issue in <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>MacGregor Co. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 89 [31 O.O.2d 141], and <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Central Terminal Warehouse </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 173 [10 O.O.3d 342]. <em>Daniels </em>and <em>Campbell </em>involved claims brought by employees of temporary labor agencies against the customers of these agencies. This court held in both cases that the claimants were employees of the agencies\u2019 customers even though the customers, at whose places of business the claimants suffered their injuries, made no direct payments to or paid workers\u2019 compensation premiums for the claimants. In <em>Campbell, </em>at page 176, we found that \u2018\u2018there existed an implied contract of hire between * * * [the agency\u2019s customer] and appellant [the claimant], whereby appellant in effect authorized * * * [the agency] to offer his services for hire, and * * * [the customer], by approving the referral, accepted appellant\u2019s offer.\u201d The implied contract rationale of <em>Campbell </em>applies with equal force to the case at bar. Appellant authorized NYC to offer his services for hire, and Crestview, by approving the referral, accepted appellant\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Appellant contends that he had no employer-employee relationship with Crestview because his wages were paid by NYC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under <em>Daniels </em>and <em>Campbell, </em>however, payment alone is not the critical inquiry. Rather, our previous cases have looked not to the source of compensation but to \u201c \u2018the right to control the manner or means of performing the work * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daniels, </em>at page 94, quoting <em>Behner </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1951), 154 Ohio St. 433 [43 O.O. 360], paragraph one of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Campbell, </em>at page 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Appellant argues that NYC actually controlled him on the job, first, because appellant could only engage in a limited range of activities pursuant to federal and state regulations and, secondly, because NYC was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>make regular inspections of the job site to ensure that program participants complied with all applicable rules.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The actual work performed by appellant, however, was assigned and directed by school district employees, including appellee. Even if NYC maintained ultimate control by retaining the power to remove CETA workers from a job site, Crestview exercised immediate control of appellant while he was at work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">While there are no reported Ohio cases dealing with this precise issue, a recent Pennsylvania case, <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Old Lycoming Township </em>(1981), 286 Pa. Super. 339, 428 A. 2d 1358, considered this question. In <em>Keller, </em>the executrix of a deceased CETA worker, who had been killed while working on a township project, brought wrongful death and survivor actions against the township. The court held that the township enjoyed workers\u2019 compensation immunity notwithstanding the fact that another agency had paid the decedent\u2019s wages and workers\u2019 compensation premiums. In <em>Keller, </em>the township\u2019s role was analogous to the school district in the case at bar and an entity named Service, Training, and Education Programs (\u201cSTEP\u201d) functioned as did NYC herein. The court addressed the control question as follows at pages 350-351:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u201cHere, it was the township, and not the federal government or any agency managing CETA programs, such as STEP, that directed the installation of the sewer line and controlled the operations at the worksite where Harold Keller was injured. The township could most directly affect the risks of accidents at the worksite. While STEP also assumed an interest in the safety and other work conditions of CETA workers, it had neither the power nor the responsibility to direct the installation of the sewer line. It could not, for instance, tell Keller\u2019s co-workers what ditches to dig, or how to dig them. What it could do was to impose limited sanctions on employers for not complying with its requests. Thus, if an employer did not comply with its directives, it could terminate the worksite as a place where CETA workers could work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In the instant case NYC, like STEP in <em>Keller, </em>\u201ccould terminate the worksite as a place where CETA workers could work,\u201d and \u201cimpose limited sanctions,\u201d but NYC did not direct appellant in his day to day activities at work or control the operations at the worksite.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The <em>Keller </em>court, moreover, made the following observation relating to the goals of the CETA program:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u201c* * * our decision is consistent with accomplishing the purposes of CETA, namely, to \u2018provide job training and employment opportunities for the economically disadvantaged, unemployed, and underemployed persons.\u2019 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 801. The obvious reason the federal government undertook to pay the wages and other costs \u2014 including the cost of workmen\u2019s compensation insurance \u2014 was to make it inexpensive for potential employers, such as Old Lycoming Township, to hire a CETA worker. We agree with the lower court that subjecting such employers to actions at common law would inhibit the CETA workers\u2019 employment opportunities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">CETA was designed to do more than provide disadvantaged persons with disposable income. A direct subsidy or welfare payment could serve that function. Congress, however, intended that participation in the CETA program would offer eligible employees a meaningful work experience, thereby inculcating sound work habits and a work ethic. If this court adopted appellant\u2019s theory of liability, we would effectively subvert the governmental goals underlying CETA insofar as the imposition of civil liability would discourage potential employing agencies, be they school districts as in the case at bar or townships as in <em>Keller, </em>from participating in federal employment programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-8\">W.

Comm. </em>(1935), 129 Ohio St. 589 [3 O.O. 9], for the proposition that a contract for hire requires payment by the employer to the employee. <em>Daniels </em>and <em>Campbell </em>necessarily modified <em>Coviello </em>because in neither of the temporary employee cases did the employer make direct payments to the employees. Moreover, <em>Coviello </em>is factually distinguishable, arising in the context of a claim made by an independent contractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\"> Appellee notes that these contentions are \u201cinconsistent with the allegations of \u2018personal control\u2019 in their argument under their first proposition of law [regarding the inapplicability of sovereign immunity].\u201d At one point appellant argues that appellee \u201cassumed personal responsibility for Ted Yandriest\u2019s individual safety and personally direct his activities * * At another point, however, appellant asserts that \u201cthere is no evidence * * * to show that Crestview exercised any control over Ted Vandriest\u2019s work activities.\u201d The tension between these positions is manifest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\"> Darryl Eyster, Project Director of the city of Mansfield, who oversaw the general operations of NYC, stated in his deposition, however, that \u201cwe [NYC] can\u2019t force the job site <em>per se </em>to keep a person working that they would choose to not have working.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b220-11\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ari\">concurring. This case raises two issues, each of which may serve as an independent grounds for decision. First, the court is faced with the question of whether a superintendent of schools has sovereign immunity from suit based upon an assertion that his direct negligence caused injuries. Second, there is a question whether the superintendent in this case is immune from suit under R.C. 4123.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">Turning to the second issue first, R.C. 4123.74 provides that an employer who complies with the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is not liable for damages as a result of occupational disease or injury. See, also, R.C. 4123.741 (fellow employees\u2019 immunity). In <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>MacGregor Co. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 89 [31 O.O.2d 141], this court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">\u201cWhere an employer employs an employee with the understanding that the employee is to be paid only by the employer and at a certain hourly rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>to work for a customer of the employer and where it is understood that the customer is to have the right to control the manner or means of performing the work, such employee in doing that work is an employee of the customer within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act; and, where such customer has complied with the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, he will not be liable to respond in damages for any injury received by such employee in the course of or arising out of that work for such customer. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">This decision was reaffirmed by the court in <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Central Terminal Warehouse </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 173 [10 O.O.3d 342]. Thus, this court has adopted a right to control test to determine whether a \u201cloaned servant\u201d is an employee of the party to whom he was loaned. Here, there is no question that the appellee did have the right to control the appellant. Indeed, the whole thrust of appellant\u2019s suit is that appellee was negligent in his control of appellant. Therefore, I am in agreement with the majority that based upon this court\u2019s holdings in <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Central Terminal Warehouse </em>and <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>MacGregor Co., supra, </em>the judgment of the court of appeals that the appellee was immune from suit under workers\u2019 compensation law should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Second, the discretionary or administrative acts of a superintendent of a local school district should not be distinguished from the acts of other public officers, administrators, or officials, and they, in carrying out their official acts, should be held immune from liability for alleged negligent acts, in the absence of a showing of malicious or willful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">R.C. 3319.01 provides, in pertinent part, that, \u201cThe superintendent of a * * * school district shall be the executive officer for the board. * * *\u201d The sovereign function that Midlem performed was indeed an official one of making executive and administrative discretionary determinations for the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">In the case of <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Hosmer </em>(1975), 48 Ohio App. 2d 51 [2 O.O.3d 37], affirmed in 46 Ohio St. 2d 273 [75 O.O.2d 323], the court of appeals set forth the differing status as to the liability of a superintendent to that of a teacher who directly may have negligently acted toward a student, as follows at page 53:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">\u201cWith the exception of the <em>Hall </em>case and <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1974), 39 Ohio Misc. 5 [67 O.O.2d 104], a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court decision following <em>Hall, </em>extensive research has failed to disclose any other decision in any jurisdiction extending the doctrine of sovereign immunity to teachers. On the other hand it has been consistently held in all cases dealing with the subject that governmental immunity from suit for negligence extends to the officers of boards of education and school districts but not to their employees * * * <em>ff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">Also in this regard, the holding in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1972), 32 Ohio App. 2d 297 [61 O.O.2d 396], at 302, may be noted as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">\u201cThere is also the general rule that school and school district officers are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>not liable for torts committed by them in the performance of their duties involving the exercise of judgment and discretion, nor are they liable for the negligence of their employees in the absence of any statutory provision imposing such a liability. School officials, teachers and employees are liable for malicious or deliberate harm or injury to other persons. 48 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 163, Schools, Section 249.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The doctrine of sovereign immunity should be continued as it would relate to superintendents of school systems in Ohio who, in the performance of their official functions, are exercising administrative acts of a discretionary nature which should not be held to the tests for liability sounding in negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Accordingly, I concur that the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-7\">Locher, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b222-8\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWR\">dissenting. The keen perception of the equal rights of the working man exhibited by Justice James Celebrezze in his dissent has led him to a just result with which I fully concur. That intuitive grasp of justice made it easy to analyze and assemble the facts in this case and with unassailable logic to reach the correct conclusion, namely, that the city of Mansfield, and not Crestview (nor defendant Midlem), is Vandriest\u2019s employer. Therefore, the defendant is not immune from suit under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\"><em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Central Terminal Warehouse </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 173 [10 O.O.3d 342], and <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>MacGregor Co. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 89 [31 O.O.2d 141], upon which this court today relies to buttress its rush to an unjust result, are so factually different from the <em>Vandriest </em>case as to be not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The factor distinguishing <em>Campbell </em>is that, there, defendant Central was the employer of plaintiff, and plaintiff \u201cclearly was in the service of Central.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. By contrast, here, no employer-employee relationship existed between plaintiff and Crestview, nor did any exist between plaintiff and Superintendent Midlem. Plaintiff was working for the city of Mansfield, not for Crestview or for defendant Midlem.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">In <em>Campbell, </em>\u201c[m]oreover, there existed an implied contract of hire between Central and appellant <em>* * *.\u201d Id. </em>at 176. In the case at bar, no contract, express or implied, existed between Vandriest and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">In <em>Campbell, \u201c* </em>* * <em>Central did pay Hour Man a certain sum which covered the reimbursement of appellant for his services.\u201d Id. </em>Neither Crestview nor defendant Midlem <em>paid </em>plaintiff Vandriest, directly or indirectly, <em>anything </em>for his services. Through the city of Mansfield Neighborhood Youth Corps, plaintiff was a mere unpaid volunteer of his services to Crestview and defendant Midlem. An unpaid volunteer of services cannot be part of any contract of hire.

P. Celebrezze, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFm\">dissenting. Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an employee-employer relationship between Ted and Crestview cannot exist, unless there is an express or implied contract of hire. As this court held in <em>Coviello </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1935), 129 Ohio St. 589 [3 O.O. 9], paragraph five of the syllabus, \u201c[i]t is impossible to have a \u2018contract for hire\u2019 without an obligation that the person denominated the employer pay the person employed.\u201d Hence, for the reasons set out below, I respectfully dissent, because it is my opinion that there was no express or implied contract of hire between Ted and Crestview.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Ted was working in a summer youth employment program sponsored by the federal government and administered by the city of Mansfield through its Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC). The city of Mansfield carried Ted\u2019s name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>on its payroll and made contributions to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund on Ted\u2019s behalf. The contributions to the fund were made on the city of Mansfield\u2019s account, and the workers\u2019 compensation claim eventually filed and approved for Ted named the city of Mansfield as the employer. NYC contacted Crestview about providing work experience for Ted. In exchange for Crestview\u2019s work experience, NYC provided Crestview with Ted\u2019s labor, free of charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The point to be stressed is that Crestview did not pay Ted any part of his wages. Moreover, Crestview did not directly or indirectly make any contribution to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund on Ted\u2019s behalf. Furthermore, Crestview did not assert any of the rights an employer normally has under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the right to notice of a hearing on a claim and the right to challenge or appeal a decision), nor did it incur any of the detriments associated with the payments of claims (risk payment of higher premiums) in this case, because it could not do so. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Central Terminal Warehouse </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 173, 178-179 [10 O.O.3d 342] (dissenting opinion). Hence, the only logical conclusion one can reach is that the city of Mansfield, and not Crestview, is Ted\u2019s employer. Consequently, since Crestview is not Ted\u2019s employer, Midlem is not entitled to the co-employee immunity afforded under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. I would, therefore, re.verse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
