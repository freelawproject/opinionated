The Hall China Co., </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1962), 120 Ohio App. 374 [27 O.O.2d 304].\u201d The court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Hall China </em>was incorrect. That decision does not require a claimant to prove injurious exposure at the last place of employment. The court therein held that <em>an </em>injurious exposure was a prerequisite to the allowance of an occupational disease claim; and that proof of such exposure with the last employer was a sufficient basis for the award even though other employments may have contributed to the occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Though the basis for the court of appeals\u2019 decision was erroneous, it is well-recognized that mandamus does not lie where the relator has an adequate remedy at law. R.C. 2731.05; <em>State, ex rel. Cleveland, </em>v. <em>Calandra </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 121, 123 [16 O.O.3d 143]; <em>State, ex rel. Benton, </em>v. <em>C. &amp; So. O. Elec. Co. </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St. 2d 130, 132 [43 O.O.2d 238].</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The order complained of herein involves appellant\u2019s right to participate in the fund and is thus appealable under R.C. 4123.519. Currently pending are two appeals pursuant to R.C. 4123.519, wherein all of the issues raised herein can be adjudicated. Appellant\u2019s concern that the failure to name the appropriate employer will defeat her appeal is unfounded. The right at issue in the appeal is the right to participate in the state fund and not a claim directed against a particular employer. The appeal proceeding is a trial <em>de novo </em>and the Civil Rules apply. By discovery and joinder, the proper employers can be ascertained and made parties, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">For the reason that appellant has an adequate remedy at law by way of appeal, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
