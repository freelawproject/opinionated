For the following reasons, we conclude that the trial court was correct in making these awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">In reaching this conclusion, our first consideration is whether a fraudulent conveyance existed upon which to base the damages. Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>contend that the transfer of warehouse customer accounts was not a conveyance within the meaning of R.C. Chapter 1336.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">A fraudulent conveyance is defined in R.C. 1336.07 as: \u201cEvery conveyance made and every obligation incurred with actual intent, as distinguished from intent presumed in law, to hinder, delay, or defraud either present or future creditors, is fraudulent as to both present or future creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The term \u201cconveyance\u201d is defined in R.C. 1336.01(B) which provides that: \u201c \u2018Conveyance\u2019 includes every payment of money, assignment, release, transfer, lease, mortgage, or pledge of tangible or intangible property, and also the creation of any lien or encumbrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Applied to this situation, the pertinent language is \u201ctransfer * * * of tangible or intangible property * * The question is whether the warehouse accounts, which were transferred, are tangible or intangible property. The court of appeals noted that Interstate\u2019s long-term customers produced a steady income and that many became customers of Mid-American and Express when Interstate ceased operations. Thus, the customer accounts provided a potentially valuable resource to Mid-American and Express and come within the statutory language of \u201ctangible or intangible property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The trial court concluded that: \u201cThe decision to wind down was made in light of and to avoid the Locafrance judgment.\u201d The court quoted the following resolution of Interstate\u2019s board of directors: \u201cWhereas, Locafrance U.S. Corporation, has obtained a judgment against this Company for substantial damages and for the replevin of a considerable number of forklift trucks and other equipment necessary for the continued conduct of the operations of the company in Toledo, and * * *. Resolved, that in view of the judgment of replevin and damages obtained against this company by Locafrance U.S. Corporation * *</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Therefore, the facts meet the statutory requirements in R.C. 1336.07 for a fraudulent conveyance. The customer accounts are a conveyance, within the definition set forth in R.C. 1336.01(B), and were conveyed with actual intent to hinder creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Appellants contend that if a fraudulent conveyance occurred, the statutes do not allow for punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Furthermore, they maintain that the facts do not warrant sustaining such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees are not specifically authorized by R.C. 1336.09 or 1336.10, the remedy sections in R.C. Chapter 1336.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>However, the courts below found that R.C. 1336.11 broadens the scope of the Act to permit the application of the law of fraud which allows such awards in appropriate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The court of appeals relied on <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Summer &amp; Co. </em>(1968), 17 Ohio App. 2d 58 [46 O.O.2d 73], for this conclusion. R.C. 1336.11 was construed as permitting the trustee in bankruptcy to rely on common-law remedies when an insolvent corporation transferred property.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">R.C. 1336.11 provides that, \u201c[i]n any case not provided for in sections 1336.01 to 1336.12, inclusive, of the Revised Code, the rules of law and equity including the law merchant, and in particular the rules relating to the law of principal and agent, and the effect of fraud, misrepresentation, duress, or coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, or other invalidating cause shall govern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The appellate court\u2019s construction of R.C. 1336.11, which allowed the application of common-law remedies not set forth in this statute, is reasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Otherwise, the purpose of this section is questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Public policy supports this interpretation of the statute. \u201cThe purpose of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act is primarily for the benefit of creditors, not grantees. It is a remedial statute and a liberal construction should be given it to accomplish its purpose of giving speedy relief against a fraudulent debtor.\u201d <em>Running </em>v. <em>Widdes </em>(1971), 52 Wis. 2d 254, 259, 190 N.W. 2d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Because the action herein is not specifically provided for in either of the remedy sections, R.C. 1336.11 allows that the rules of law and equity may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>govern. We hold that common-law remedies, including the law of fraud, may be applied when appropriate in fraudulent conveyance cases pursuant to R.C. 1336.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Previous case law has established that punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees are permissible in cases of fraud involving malicious and intentional conduct. The requirements for punitive damages were set forth in paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Columbus Finance </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 178 [71 O.O.2d 174], as follows: \u201cIn an action for wrongful execution, actual malice, fraud or insult on the part of the wrongdoer must be shown in order to justify an award of punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The court defined actual malice, at page 184, to include \u201c \u2018intentional, reckless, wanton, wilful and gross acts which cause injury to persons or property.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Detling </em>v. <em>Chockley </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St. 2d 134,138 [24 O.O.3d 239], this court also stated that actual malice signifies, <em>inter alia, </em>intent, deliberation or a willful design to do another injury. Thus, recent pronouncements of this court are consistent in defining malice to include intentional or deliberate behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Moreover, the court in <em>Detling, supra, </em>stated, at page 136, that, \u201c[t]he rationale for allowing punitive damages has been recognized in Ohio as that of punishing the offending party and setting him up as an example to others that they might be deterred from similar conduct: \u2018The principle of permitting damages, in certain cases, to go beyond naked compensation, is for example, and the punishment of the guilty party for the wicked, corrupt, and malignant motive and design, which prompted him to the wrongful act.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Applying these principles to the case <em>sub judice, </em>Interstate ceased operations and transferred its accounts to two successor corporations with essentially the same business, employees and facilities. The trial court found that Interstate\u2019s decision to wind down was designed, in part, to avoid the Locafrance judgments against it. Thus, the record indicates that Interstate\u2019s actions were willful, intentional and deliberate as required by this court\u2019s definition of malice for an award of punitive damages. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence of malice to warrant imposition of punitive damages. Alternatively, Interstate\u2019s conduct, by definition of a fraudulent conveyance set forth in R.C. 1336.07, constitutes a fraud, as required by <em>Howard, supra, </em>for an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Considering the facts in this case, punitive damages are appropriate to deter the delinquent judgment debtor from attempting to avoid paying the judgments. Setting aside the conveyance and other remedies set forth in R.C. 1336.10 and 1336.11 would not be a sufficient deterrent to discourage appellants and other debtors from making fraudulent conveyances to avoid creditors. Without punitive damages as a deterrent, the purpose of the Fraudulent Conveyance Act would be severely weakened.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Furthermore, this court has concluded that, \u201c[i]f punitive damages are proper, the aggrieved party may also recover reasonable attorney fees.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Howard, supra, </em>at 183. Therefore, we find that punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees were properly awarded by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b237-6\">W. Brown, Sweeney, Pryatel, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P.

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania stated that: \u201cAs this act does not specify a particular course of procedure, that previously existing and any necessary modification thereof, may be adopted, in order to enable the one attacking the \u2018conveyance\u2019 to obtain the rights accorded by the statute.\u201d <em>Schline </em>v. <em>Kine </em>(1930), 301 Pa. 586, 591, 152 A. 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-19\">We recognize that punitive damages have not been allowed in fraudulent conveyance actions in some other jurisdictions. The Colorado Supreme Court refused to allow punitive damages and concluded that its statute allows only for the voiding of a conveyance. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Kaiser </em>(1967), 164 Colo. 206, 433 P. 2d 772. C.R.S. 1963, 59-1-17, a part of the Colorado statute of frauds, provided that fraudulent conveyances \u201cshall be void.\u201d Compared to Colorado\u2019s single remedy, Ohio\u2019s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act is more comprehensive and provides several remedies.
