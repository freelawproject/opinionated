Rose Hill Burial Park, </em>v. <em>Moser </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 13, 14. Appellant submits that the accident report, the subject of this appeal, is privileged; and that appellee\u2019s orders violate R.C. 2317.02 (A) and Civ. R. 26 and were therefore unauthorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Civ. R. 26 (B)(3) allows \u201c* * * discovery of documents * * * prepared in anticipation of litigation * * * only upon a showing of good cause therefor.\u201d The existence of a Civ. R. 26 (B)(1) \u201cprivilege\u201d as well as Civ. R. 26 (B)(3) \u201cgood cause\u201d are discretionary determinations to be made by the trial court. Appellee argues that such determinations are reviewable only on appeal. <em>State, ex rel. Staton, </em>v. <em>Common Pleas Court </em>(1965), 5 Ohio St. 2d 17 [34 O.O.2d 10].</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Whether appellee made a correct or incorrect determination, however, is not the issue before this court. Prohibition is a preventive, not a corrective, remedy. <em>State, ex rel. Stefanick, </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 102, 104 [50 O.O.2d 265]. It may not be invoked to prohibit the trial court judge\u2019s exercise of discretion where that judge had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the person. <em>State, ex rel. Staton, </em>v. <em>Common Pleas Court, supra, </em>at 22. It is undisputed that appellee had jurisdiction to hear the case and discretion to rule on matters concerning discovery. Appellant may seek review of appellee\u2019s discovery rulings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Appellee\u2019s orders were not unauthorized by law. Appellant also has an adequate remedy at law by way of appeal. Prohibition cannot be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>State, ex rel. Crebs, </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 51, 52 [67 O.O.2d 61]. The judgment of the court of appeals dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-14\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
