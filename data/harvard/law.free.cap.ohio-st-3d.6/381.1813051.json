In arguing against the issuance of the writ, respondent maintains that adequate notice of the assessments was never accomplished as required by R.C. Chapter 6131 and, therefore, the time to institute an appeal under R.C. 6131.25 has never commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The record indicates that all applicable notices connected with the single county ditch improvement were sent to, and received by, ODOT\u2019s District No. 2 office in Bowling Green, Ohio. It was the established practice of that office to handle all matters connected with single county ditch improvement projects, including inspecting engineering plans, objecting to proposed assessments, attending final hearings and, most importantly, initiating appeals in accordance with R.C. 6131.25 through direct contact with the office of the Attorney General. The district office had, in fact, been in direct contact with the Attorney General\u2019s office regarding objections to the final assessments levied herein, and an appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that ODOT received adequate notice of the final assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Respondent argues, in the alternative, that the subject assessments are disproportionate to the benefits conferred by the ditch improvement project. However, this contention raises precisely the same issue allowed to be raised in an appeal to the court of common pleas under R.C. 6131.25.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Thereunder, upon receiving notice of the assessment, any property owner who claims that the assessment levied against his property is excessive, or not in proportion to the benefits received, may perfect an appeal to the court of common pleas within twenty-one days from the date of the final order of the county commissioners. R.C. 6131.26. Inasmuch as respondent failed to appeal from relator\u2019s July 30, 1979 final order approving the subject assessments, the manner in which those assessments was computed cannot now be properly considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Since the board of county commissioners\u2019 order has thus become binding upon respondent, the only question remaining is whether a writ of mandamus is appropriate to compel payment of the amount assessed pursuant to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">It is well-settled that \u201c[i]n order for a writ of mandamus to issue, this court must find that relator has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>that respondent is under a clear legal duty to perform the requested act, and that relator has no plain and adequate remedy at law.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Heller, </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 6, 7 [15 O.O.3d 3]; <em>State, ex rel. Harris, </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 41, 42 [8 O.O.3d 36]; <em>State, ex rel. National City Bank, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Education </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St. 2d 81, 84 [6 O.O.3d 288].</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Relator\u2019s clear legal right to the relief requested, and respondent\u2019s clear legal duty to perform the act requested, are apparent from a reading of the provisions of R.C. Chapter 6131. First, that R.C. Chapter 6131 contemplates assessments against the state where its highways are benefited by single county ditch improvements cannot be challenged. The General Assembly has specifically authorized boards of county commissioners to approve assessments associated with single county ditch improvements and levy \u201c[s]uch part of the assessment as is found to benefit state roads or highways * * * against the state * * *.\u201d R.C. 6131.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Second, R.C. Chapter 6131 explicitly sets forth a detailed procedure to be followed in the event that an appeal of the assessment is not taken.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This procedure was fully complied with by the relator in the instant action. As a result, a clear legal duty attaches on ODOT to pay the assessment as issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Finally we reject respondent\u2019s argument that an adequate remedy at law exists because an action for damages against the state lies in the Court of Claims. In R.C. 6131.25 <em>et seq., </em>the General Assembly has specifically provided a comprehensive scheme whereby any interested owner may challenge a final order by a board of county commissioners approving assessments in conjunction with single county ditch improvement projects. R.C. Chapter 2743 was not meant to implicitly repeal these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Relator\u2019s complaint thus satisfies the three prerequisites necessary for the issuance of a writ of mandamus. Because respondent failed to appeal the county ditch assessments in accordance with R.C. 6131.25 <em>et seq., </em>and relator adequately complied with the procedures set forth in R.C. Chapter 6131, this court hereby issues a writ of mandamus compelling respondent to pay to relator county ditch assessments totalling $23,919.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-10\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.

Upon completion of the contract, the county auditor is required to transmit to the director of any department, office or institution of the state of Ohio, affected by an improvement, the assessments so levied, and payment then becomes due to the county treasurer under R.C. 6131.43.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
