Kronenberger-Fodor Co., </em>v. <em>Parma </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 222 [63 O.O.2d 362], a case involving zoning regulations, the syllabus provides that \u201c* * * where a constitutional process of appeal has been legislatively provided, the sole fact that pursuing such process would encompass more delay and inconvenience than seeking a writ of mandamus is insufficient to prevent the process from constituting a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\u201d See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Cinnamon Lake Utility, </em>v. <em>Pub. Util Comm. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 79, 80 [70 O.O.2d 165.]</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">Although relator-appellant asserted in his complaint filed in the court of appeals that there was currently pending in the Cleveland Municipal Court a complaint for injunction to close down the businesses operated on the premises for failure to secure permits and that he had no adequate remedy at law, and further asserts in argument in his brief filed herein, that no final order has been issued in the matter from which an appeal can be taken, he does assert in his complaint that the permits were in fact denied. We conclude that relator had a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law by way of appeal from the denial of permits previously sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">Relator also sought a writ of mandamus for the issuance of further legally applied for permits in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">\u201c* * * The function of mandamus is to compel the performance of a present existing duty as to which there is a default. It is not granted to take effect prospectively, and it contemplates the performance of an act which is incumbent on the respondent when the application for a writ is made. * * *\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>State, ex rel.
