The first is whether the commission unlawfully or unreasonably provided Toledo Edison with an additional quartile increment in its cost of common equity based on the perceived increased risk to investors occasioned by <em>CEI. </em>The second issue is whether the commission\u2019s continued amortization of the depreciation reserve deficiency violated R.C. 4909,15.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">The first question is controlled by our recent decision in <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 111 (hereinafter <em>\u201cCEI II\u201d), </em>which considered a virtually identical cost of equity increment granted to the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (hereinafter \u201cCEI\u201d). In <em>CEI II, </em>OCC made the same argument that it advances herein, namely that the enhanced cost of equity actually represents a return on the cancelled plants, which return this court specifically disallowed in <em>CEI. </em>We addressed this argument in <em>CEI II </em>at page 115 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">\u201cConsumers\u2019 Counsel contends that consideration of the increased risk found to arise from our decision in <em>CEI </em>when calculating return on common equity violates the holding that ratepayers not pay for the terminated units. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The determination of the rate, however, was based on empirical data presented by the company\u2019s rate of return witnesses, which testimony was considered relevant to that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u201cR.C. 4909.15 (A)(2) requires the commission to determine a fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility. The question whether a decision of this court may have so increased the perceived risk to investors as to require a higher rate of return on common equity is one the commission may consider as a factor in its decision. We do not find the commission\u2019s action in this regard \u2018so clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension or mistake or willful disregard of duty\u2019 and accordingly, find no error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In the instant case the cost of equity determination \u201cwas based on empirical data,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>the First Boston Electric Utility Index and the Standard and Poor\u2019s 22 Electric Utility Index, as interpreted by the expert witnesses. This evidence is sufficient to support the commission\u2019s decision to allow an incremental risk adjustment just as it was in <em>CEI II. </em>Therefore, we reject OCC\u2019s contention that the commission allowed Toledo Edison an unreasonable or unlawful cost of common equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We now turn to the second issue, which involves the propriety of the commission\u2019s continued amortization of the depreciation reserve variance. \u201cA \u2018depreciation reserve\u2019 is an accounting technique whereby a fund is built up from annual contributions, as an item of expense of operation, over a period of time representing the service life of a public utility plant to offset and to equal in value the ultimate total loss through use of the utility property so that at the end of such service life the depreciation reserve fund will replace the property so worn out by the various factors of depreciation.\u201d <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 107 [42 O.O 186], paragraph three of the syllabus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A depreciation reserve variance, either an underaccrual or overaccrual, results when the booked depreciation reserve differs from the theoretical reserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In the instant case we are confronted with an underaccrual that the commission first recognized in <em>Re Toledo Edison, supra. A </em>depreciation study completed in 1975 indicated that Toledo Edison had a depreciation reserve deficiency. Toledo Edison submitted the results of the depreciation study in its 1976 rate case. The commission approved the amortization of the approximately $20 million underaccrual after finding that Toledo Edison had \u201cpresented testimony indicating that the reserve deficiency has been created as a result of reduced useful lives and the existence of projected negative salvage values for certain items of its property. The record does not suggest any deliberate understatement of depreciation expense. The company has had depreciation studies and updates performed four times within the past fifteen years and has employed rates consistent with the results of such studies throughout the period.\u201d 17 P.U.R. 4th, at page 442. The commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>determined that \u201camortizing the variance over a specific period of time, not to exceed the remaining life of the property * * * [was] preferable to revision of otherwise proper accrual rates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The amortization of the depreciation reserve deficiency was not challenged in the 1976 case or in the two other Toledo Edison rate cases immediately preceding the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">OCC bases its challenge to the continued amortization of the depreciation reserve variance on <em>CEI. </em>OCC contends that \u201cthe present or future recovery in rates of any past depreciation reserve shortfall or deficiency by a public utility is unlawful under section 4909.15, Ohio Revised Code.\u201d To support this contention OCC characterizes the depreciation reserve variance as a \u201cpast loss\u201d analogous to the loss sustained by CEI in the cancelled plants venture. This characterization is the basis of OCC\u2019s assertion that \u201c[t]he depreciation reserve deficiency herein is a <em>past loss </em>incurred <em>prior </em>to the test period that is <em>not </em>a cost of the test period <em>or </em>future utility service\u201d (emphasis <em>sic), </em>and hence an improper item of expense under the ratemaking statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">OCC\u2019s reliance on the \u201cpast loss\u201d discussion in <em>CEI </em>is misplaced. A principal factor in our decision in <em>CEI </em>was the nature of the expenditures at issue. We stated at page 164 that \u201c[w]e seriously question whether the General Assembly contemplated that the commission would treat the type of expenditures controverted herein as costs under R.C. 4909.15(A)(4). The now terminated nuclear plants represented a major capital investment that ultimately would have been included in the rate base under R.C. 4909.15(A)(1), had the projects not been cancelled. It is our opinion that R.C. 4909.15(A)(4) is designed to take into account the normal, recurring expenses incurred by utilities in the course of rendering service to the public for the test period. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u201cThe extraordinary loss sustained by CEI in connection with the terminated nuclear plants cannot be transformed into an ordinary operating expense pursuant to R.C. 4909.15(A)(4) * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Thus, in <em>CEI </em>this court reversed the commission for its transformation without statutory authorization of a \u201cmajor capital investment,\u201d which had never provided any service to the utility\u2019s customers, into an item of expense. We are confronted with no such transformation in the case at bar because depreciation, unlike unbuilt generating facilities, is a \u201ccost to the utility of rendering the public utility service.\u201d For this reason the case at bar and <em>CEI </em>are distinguishable. This conclusion does not, however, end our inquiry. We must now consider whether the amortization of the depreciation reserve deficiency \u201crepresents] the type of anomalous condition for which inclusion of costs not incurred during the test period would be permissible.\u201d <em>Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 91, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">OCC, as previously noted, strenuously argues that the amortization in question amounts to rate recognition of a \u201cpast loss.\u201d A more accurate characterization of this amortization is to define it as a pre-test year adjustment, subject to the same type of analysis we have used in cases involving post-test year adjustments. In <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>(1981) , 67 Ohio St. 2d 372 [21 O.O.3d 234] (hereinafter <em>\u201cEOG\u201d); Ohio Water Service Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St. 3d 1; and <em>DP&amp;L, supra, </em>this court held that post-test-year adjustments for wage increases negotiated between the respective utilities and their employees \u201cwould violate the test-year concept embodied in R.C. 4909.15.\u201d <em>EOG, </em>at page 374. The post-test-year wage adjustment cases have not, however, established as an \u201cabsolute rule,\u201d <em>Ohio Water Service, </em>at page 3, that \u201conly expenses incurred during the test period may be included in awarding a rate increase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To the contrary, \u201cwe [have] acknowledged * * * that the test-year data are not immutable and have upheld appropriate exceptions in previous cases * * *.\u201d <em>DP&amp;L, </em>at page 95. For example, in <em>Bd. of Commrs. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1982) , 1 Ohio St. 3d 125, this court affirmed an order of the commission allowing the Dayton Power &amp; Light Company (hereinafter \u201cDP&amp;L\u201d) to recover additional expenses incurred in a post-test-year line clearance program ordered by the commission. Moreover, some expenses are recoverable pursuant to statute irrespective of test-year considerations. See, <em>e.g., DP&amp;L, </em>paragraph one of the syllabus (construing R.C. 4909.161), and at pages 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">A depreciation reserve is an expense item specifically contemplated by statute. R.C. 4905.18 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u201cEvery public utility shall carry a proper and adequate depreciation or deferred maintenance account, whenever the public utilities commission, after investigation, determines that a depreciation account can be reasonably required. The commission shall ascertain, determine, and prescribe what are proper and adequate charges for depreciation of the several classes of property for each public utility. * * * The charge for depreciation shall be such as will provide the amount required over the cost and expense of maintenance to keep the property of the public utility in a state of efficiency corresponding to the progress of the art or industry. The commission may prescribe such changes in such charges for depreciation as it finds necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The commission effectively determined in 1976 that Toledo Edison\u2019s depreciation reserve would not provide \u201cthe amount required * * * to keep the property of the public utility in a state of efficiency corresponding to the progress of the art or industry\u201d and, pursuant to statute, prescribed changes, including the amortization controverted herein. The link between the statutory authority and the requested adjustment is stronger in the instant case than in <em>Bd. of Commrs. </em>While R.C. 4905.06, cited in <em>Bd. of Commrs., </em>contains general language authorizing the commission to act \u201cfor protection of the public safety,\u201d R.C. 4905.18 speaks directly to depreciation charges and changes therein and R.C. 4909.15 (D)(1), a part of the rate-making section, states that the commission is to give \u201cdue regard * * * to the necessity of making reservation out of the income for * * * depreciation * * *\u201d in fashioning rates. If the line clearance adjustment in <em>Bd. of Commrs. </em>was proper then the depreciation adjustment at issue herein, which has a firmer statutory basis, is proper as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>In our view, R.C. 4905.18 and 4909.15 must be read <em>in pari materia </em>if the legislative intention underlying the former statute is to be given effect. Accordingly, we hold that the amortization of the depreciation reserve deficiency is a permissible adjustment to Toledo Edison\u2019s expenses and affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., Cook, Sweeney, Holmes, C.

Util. Comm. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 153 [21 O.O.3d 96], dismissed in 455 U.S. 914 <em>(\u201cCEI\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">In <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 111, 116 <em>(\u201cCEI II\u201d), </em>I expressed my dismay because that decision marked \u201c* * * the second time that the majority of this court ha[d] turned its back on <em>CEI. </em>See <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 22 <em>(\u2018Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>[1982]\u2019).\u201d 4 Ohio St. 3d, at 117. Today\u2019s decision is, therefore, the <em>third </em>time that the majority of this court has departed from <em>CEI </em>by allowing Toledo Edison to recover <em>via </em>an increased cost of common equity what <em>CEI </em>prohibited by means of amortization. I can only conclude that what I viewed as an \u201cabject retreat\u201d in <em>CEI II </em>has become a stampede. <em>CEI </em>is a noteworthy precedent which we should follow. The majority of this court, however, has reduced <em>CEI </em>to an inconvenient citation which is distinguished summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated in my dissent in <em>CEI II, </em>4 Ohio St. 3d, at 116-117,1 dissent from the holding of the majority allowing Toledo Edison to increase its cost of common equity based on the perceived increased risk to investors which is attributed to <em>CEI.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">That portion of the majority opinion which affirms the commission\u2019s manipulation of the cost of common equity disregards the holding of <em>CEI. </em>In addition, the majority\u2019s treatment of the requested amortization of a \u201cdepreciation variance\u201d ignores the <em>rationale </em>of <em>CEI. </em>That is, the cornerstone of the <em>CEI </em>analysis is this court\u2019s traditional recognition of the test-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>year concept. \u201cIt is our opinion that R.C. 4909.15 (A)(4) is designed to take into account the normal, recurring expenses incurred by utilities in the course of rendering service to the public for the test period.\u201d <em>CEI, </em>67 Ohio St. 2d, at 164 (footnote omitted). See, also, <em>Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 91, 106-107 (Locher, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u201cThe extraordinary loss sustained by CEI in connection with the terminated nuclear plants cannot be transformed into an ordinary operating expense pursuant to R.C. 4909.15 (A)(4) by commission fiat. The commission\u2019s statement that \u2018[cancellation does not create a past loss, but gives rise to a current cost\u2019 is unpersuasive. Under this rationale we question whether there could ever be a \u2018past loss\u2019 the return of which would not be recoverable in future ratemaking proceedings notwithstanding the commission\u2019s assertion to the contrary.\u201d <em>CEI, </em>67 Ohio St. 2d, at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">I disagree, therefore, with the majority\u2019s summary dismissal of <em>CEI </em>as authority controlling the issue of amortization of depreciation variance. A closer examination of the issues and testimony reveals the flaws in the majority approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">For example, the majority merely mentions that the depreciation variance at issue is the difference between the \u201cbooked\u201d and \u201ctheoretical\u201d depreciation reserves. The definition of these terms, however, is important to an understanding of the real issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u201cBooked\u201d depreciation is the original allowance for depreciation. \u201cTheoretical\u201d depreciation is the proposed allowance. By definition, therefore, there will be a difference between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">As acknowledged by one of Toledo Edison\u2019s own witnesses in this case, amortizing that difference transforms the customary whole life depreciation method \u2014 which is the original service life estimate \u2014 into the remaining life method. The commission itself has already disapproved of the remaining life approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u201cFrom a legal standpoint, remaining life is on something less than solid ground. This Commission has previously been presented with proposed depreciation accrual rates utilizing remaining life rates and has rejected such rates primarily because we found it would be unfair to make present and future ratepayers \u2018pay for the past inadequacy\u2019 of past depreciation rates. See, <em>e.g., Dayton Power &amp; Light Co., </em>Case No. 79-372-GA-AIR, Opinion and Order, May 7, 1980, at p. 14. We also believe that the implications of <em>C&amp;SOE </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. </em>Comm.(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 175 [18 O.O.3d 389] [dismissed in 452 U.S. 933] and <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 153 [21 O.O.3d 96] address this issue. Although these decisions are not on all fours factually with the instant case, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements with respect to the impropriety of recovering past losses through present and future rates can certainly not be ignored. Of particular interest is the fact that the Court did not view the reasonableness or prudence of the initial decision, be it the Commission\u2019s, as in <em>Columbus and Southern, supra, </em>or management\u2019s, as in <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel, supra, </em>to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>material to the question of whether the loss occasioned thereby could be recognized through future rates. Here, the present accrual rates were fixed by the Commission based on the best evidence available at the time. <em>The fact that the estimate of service lives has now changed does not justify charging the present ratepayers for this past misallocation. \u201d In re General Telephone Co. </em>(April 26, 1982), case No. 81-383-TP-AIR, <em>et al., </em>at page 26. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The commission\u2019s own words, therefore, condemn the result which the majority affirms. Furthermore, a minority of this court has already recognized the inequity of permitting utilities to manipulate depreciation figures to increase rates. See <em>Duff v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 367, 382 [10 O.O.3d 493] (Locher, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Therefore, the commission erred by failing to rule coincident with the testimony of its own staff witness:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u201cQ Would you agree that the amount of depreciation reserve deficiency does not represent costs to the Company of providing electric service during the test year, or during the time period when the rates set in this case will be in effect?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\"><em>U* * </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u201cA * * * It clearly represents a catch-up of a past underaccrual which was found in 1975, and if anything, it just reflects <em>the past misallocation of depreciation expense </em>prior to 1975. So it therefore <em>does not affect the actual cost during the test year </em>at all, no.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Accordingly, I dissent from the majority opinion <em>in toto </em>because the majority continues to erode the holding, and ignore the reasoning, of <em>CEI.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
