Appellant\u2019s contention is devoid of merit. R.C. 4123.53 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">\u201cAny employee claiming the right to receive compensation may be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>quired by the industrial commission to submit himself for medical examination at any time, and from time to time, at a place reasonably convenient for such employee, and as may be provided by the rules of the commission. * * * If such employee refuses to submit to any such examination or obstructs the same, his right to * * * receive any payment for compensation theretofore granted, shall be suspended during the period of such refusal or obstruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The statute is clear and unambiguous, specifically authorizing the commission to require any claimant seeking benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to submit to a medical examination \u201cat any time, and from time to time\u201d at the risk, <em>inter alia, </em>of forfeiting the right to receive compensation theretofore granted. Moreover, the statute contains no reference whatsoever that an appeal from an order of a district hearing officer operates to suspend the commission\u2019s jurisdiction to order claimants to submit to medical examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Implicit within appellant\u2019s argument is an invitation that this court insert the following phrase into the statute: \u201cBut no medical examination shall be conducted while a claimant\u2019s appeal is pending before a regional board of review or the Industrial Commission.\u201d We categorically reject this invitation since it is well-settled that when a statute is free from ambiguity this court will not, under the guise of judicial interpretation, \u201c* * * delete words used or * * * insert words not used [within a statute].\u201d <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St. 2d 125, 127 [49 O.O.2d 445]; <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 24, 28 [53 O.O.2d 13]; <em>Bernardini </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 1, 4 [12 O.O. 3d 1]; <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Torrence </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St. 3d 69, 70; <em>Ohio Assn, of Pub. School Emp. </em>v. <em>Twin Valley Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 178, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Appellant further contends that she was not afforded a hearing and the opportunity to present evidence prior to the commission\u2019s February 17, 1982 order, in accordance with R.C. 4123.515. This precise issue was rejected by this court in <em>State, ex rel. Eltra Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 96, 99 [65 O.O.2d 245], wherein it was concluded that \u201c* * * R.C. 4123.515 * * * [relates] to the initial determination by the bureau of the validity or allowability of a claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The subject order was not issued by a district hearing officer regarding the initial determination of the validity or allowability of a claim. Instead, the order was issued by the commission <em>after </em>the initial determination of appellant\u2019s claim, in view of her repeated refusal to consent to a psychological examination. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s reliance on R.C. 4123.515 is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Parenthetically, we wish to emphasize that a review of the entire record fails to disclose any assertion or explanation on appellant\u2019s behalf setting forth a single reason as to her inability to attend the June 15, 1981 medical examination. Nonetheless, if appellant has sought to proffer an explanation, she could have submitted a motion to the commission in accordance with Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Adm. Code 4121-3-16 (B). Thereafter, appellant could have requested a special hearing in conformity with Ohio Adm. Code 4121-3-09 (C). Neither avenue, however, was pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b329-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
