The record before us indicates that when testifying at the evidentiary hearing conducted by the juvenile court, appellants skillfully avoided admitting that which seemingly may not be denied. The record, however, is abundantly clear that the private, independent, and surreptitious placement of the minor child in the instant case was only accomplished through a total derogation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">The procedure for independently placing a child for adoption is plainly and succinctly set forth in R.C. 5103.16, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">\u201cNo child shall be placed or received for adoption or with intent to adopt unless placement is made by a county welfare department having a child welfare division, county children services board, the department of public welfare, an organization authorized to place children for adoption under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>certificate of the department of public welfare, or custodians in a foreign state or country, or unless <em>all of the following criteria are met:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u201c(A) Prior to the placement and receiving of the child, the parent or parents of the child have personally applied to, and appeared before, the probate court of the county in which the parent or parents reside, or in which the person seeking to adopt the child resides, for approval of the proposed placement specified in the application and have signed and filed with the court a written statement showing that the parent or parents are aware of their right to contest the decree of adoption subject to the limitations of section 3107.16 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u201c(B) The court, after an independent investigation of the proposed placement, conducted as provided in section 3107.12 of the Revised Code, and after completion of the investigation has determined that the proposed placement is in the best interests of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u201c(C) The court has approved of record the proposed placement.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Although R.C. 5103.16 is not part and parcel of the adoption statutes, it is in substance an adoption statute. As such, R.C. 5103.16 is necessarily in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Musart Society </em>(P.C. 1956), 72 Ohio Law Abs. 46, 50; <em>In re Wedl </em>(P.C. 1952), 65 Ohio Law Abs. 231, 236. See <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Anonymous </em>(1981), 108 Misc. 2d 1098, 1102, 439 N.Y. Supp. 2d 255. Further, because the provisions authorizing adoptions are purely statutory, strict compliance with them is necessary. <em>In re Privette </em>(1932), 45 Ohio App. 51, 52; <em>Anonymous, supra. </em>The intent of the legislature in enacting R.C. 5103.16 was to provide some measure of judicial control over the placement of children for adoption which is not conducted under the auspices of a statutorily recognized and authorized agency. That measure of judicial control is accomplished by having the parents of the child personally appear before the proper probate court for approval of the placement and adoption. <em>In re Harshey </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App. 2d 157, 163 [69 O.O.2d 165]. \u201c \u2018The integrity of this [statutory] process is an absolute necessity.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Adoption of Daniel C. </em>(1982), 115 Misc. 2d 130, 453 N.Y. Supp. 2d 572, 575. Otherwise, children could be sold to the highest bidder and shuffled around like objects on an auction block.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Appellants assert that they did not represent appellee or the father in this matter, even though appellee and the father approached appellants for their professional assistance in the placement of their son for adoption. The record does reveal, however, that appellants proceeded with the placement of the child knowing full well that neither of the child\u2019s parents had petitioned the probate court in the county where they resided or in the county where the allegedly prospective adoptive parent or parents resided<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for an independent placement of their son pursuant to R.C. 5103.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Further, appellants knew that a probate court had not made a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tion that the placement was in the best interests of the child<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that no probate court had of record approved the proposed placement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even though appellee was a minor when she signed her original consent to the placement, surrender, and proposed adoption of her son, said consent would have been valid if it had been executed before the probate court judge or an authorized deputy or referee of the probate court as contemplated by statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See R.C. 5103.16. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that appellants did not represent appellee and the father in the placement of their son, appellants nevertheless proceeded with and facilitated said placement in violation of R.C. 5103.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">With this background, we now proceed to address appellants\u2019 arguments. Appellants contend in their first proposition of law that since it is unrefuted that they do not have nor did they have at the time the habeas corpus petition was filed, physical control or custody over the minor child, it was error for the court to direct the issuance of the writ against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Initially, we recognize that a petition for writ of habeas corpus shall specify, <em>inter alia, </em>the name of the person illegally confined and in whose behalf the petition is brought, the name of the person who is confining the individual in whose behalf the petition is brought, and if known, the place where that individual is so illegally restrained or confined. R.C. 2725.04. As a general rule, the respondent in a habeas corpus petition is the person who holds custody and is able to physically produce the person who is allegedly being illegally restrained. See <em>Santa Clara Pueblo </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 49, 59; <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. App. 1980), 386 So. 2d 613, 614; <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Nord </em>(1968), 78 N.M. 717, 437 P. 2d 716; <em>In re Striker </em>(1956), 101 Ohio App. 455. In order for the writ to properly issue, it is essential that the petition specify the person by whom the individual in whose behalf the writ is sought is being allegedly illegally restrained. <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Booker </em>(Ala. 1978), 362 So. 2d 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We must emphasize, however, that R.C. 2725.04 provides that if the name of the person who is the custodian of an illegally restrained person is unknown, such person may be described by an assumed appellation. This was precisely the procedure utilized in the instant case. The petition for the writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of habeas corpus named appellants and \u201cJane Doe, <em>the </em>unknown custodian of the minor child * * *,\u201d as respondents. Such petition is not, therefore, fatally defective on its face. Cf. <em>In re Calhoun </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St. 2d 15, 18 [1 O.O.3d 10].</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">At the hearing conducted by the juvenile court, appellee and the father testified that they relinquished possession of the child to appellants at their law office. Appellants admitted the delivery of the child and further testified that the child was subsequently delivered to the allegedly prospective adoptive parents whose name and address appellants refused to disclose. From appellants\u2019 testimony, it becomes obvious that appellants were inextricably involved in the illegal and surreptitious placement of the child. Appellants procured from appellee certain documentation, offered advice and consultation to appellee and father, and facilitated the placement of the child. Appellants\u2019 involvement was most certainly active rather than passive. Appellants are the last known persons to have knowledge of the whereabouts of the child. The only other persons to have any knowledge of the child\u2019s present address and location are those unknown allegedly prospective adoptive parents. It was only through appellants\u2019 direct involvement that the illegal placement of the minor child was obtained by the allegedly prospective adoptive parent or parents. See <em>Nguyen Da Yen </em>v. <em>Kissinger </em>(C.A. 9, 1975), 528 F. 2d 1194, 1202-1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The United States Supreme Court commented in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 286, 291-292, regarding habeas corpus relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u201c* * * The scope and flexibility of the writ [habeas corpus] \u2014 its capacity to reach all manner of illegal detention \u2014 its ability to cut through barriers of form and procedural mazes \u2014 have always been emphasized and jealously guarded by courts and lawmakers. The very nature of the writ demands that it be administered with the initiative and flexibility essential to insure that miscarriages of justice within its reach are surfaced and corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u201cAs Blackstone phrased it, habeas corpus is \u2018the great and efficacious writ, in all manner of illegal confinement.\u2019 * * * [T]he office of the writ is \u2018to provide a prompt and efficacious remedy for whatever society deems to be intolerable restraints.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\"><em>H* </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u201cThere is no higher duty of a court, * * * than the careful processing and adjudication of petitions for writs of habeas corpus, for it is in such proceedings that a person in custody charges that error, neglect, or evil purpose has resulted in his unlawful confinement and that he is deprived of his freedom contrary to law. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">To permit appellants to prevail would be tantamount to the highest court in this state placing its <em>imprimatur </em>upon the core injustice created by appellants\u2019 actions. The juvenile court determined that a child placement in contravention of law had occurred and recognized that appellants were the only persons who presently knew the location of the child. That court noted appellants\u2019 entanglement in facilitating the illegal custody resulting from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>unlawful placement. Because of the urgency of the requested relief and in light of the extraordinary circumstances of this case, this court holds that the juvenile court correctly issued the writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Appellants, in their second proposition of law, contend that they should not be compelled to disclose the names and addresses of their alleged clients, asserting that this information is protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The historical development and background of the attorney-client privilege is thoroughly discussed in Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion in <em>Spitzer </em>v. <em>Stillings </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 297, and we, therefore, need not repeat that discussion here. The Ohio Legislature has codified the common-law attorney-client privilege in R.C. 2317.02, which states in pertinent part: \u201cThe following persons shall not testify in certain respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u201c(A) An attorney, concerning a communication made to him by his client<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in that relation or his advice to his client; but the attorney may testify by express consent of the client, or if the client is deceased, by the express consent of the surviving spouse or the executor or administrator of the estate of such deceased client; and if the client voluntarily testifies, the attorney may be compelled to testify on the same subject;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Absent the express consent of appellants\u2019 alleged clients, we must determine whether their names and addresses fall under the umbrella of communications made to appellants during the attorney-client relationship or in appellants\u2019 advice to their clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">This court stated in <em>In re Martin </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 87, 103 [25 O.O. 225], which statement was reaffirmed in <em>Waldmann </em>v. <em>Waldmann </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 176, 178, that it is well-settled that the burden of showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>testimony sought to be excluded under the doctrine of privileged attorney-client communications rests upon the parties seeking to exclude it. Further, it must be shown that the communications claimed as privileged are connected with and related to the matter for which the attorney had been retained. See Annotation (1967), 16 A.L.R. 3d 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In most instances, the client\u2019s name or identity \u201cis not one of the facts about which the client seeks legal assistance; the legal advice will in no way depend on whether the client\u2019s name is Jones or Smith.\u201d Saltzburg, Communication Falling Within the Attorney-Client Privilege (1981), 66 Iowa L. Rev. 811, 821. If a case falls plainly within the reason and spirit of R.C. 2317.02 (A), its principles shall apply even though a client\u2019s name and address may not, in most circumstances, be within the strictures of R.C. 2317.02 (A). <em>Waldmann, supra, </em>at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\"><em>Waldmann </em>was a domestic relations case where the confidentiality of the client\u2019s address was necessary to protect the client\u2019s safety. See <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Brennan </em>(1980), 281 Pa. Super. 362, 422 A. 2d 510. Our use of limiting language regarding the applicability of the attorney-client privilege to a client\u2019s name and address<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in <em>Waldmann </em>implicitly, if not explicitly, illustrates our belief that \u201c[i]n the determination [of] whether a communication by a client to an attorney should be afforded the cloak of privilege, \u2018 \u201cmuch ought to depend on the circumstances of each case.\u201d \u2019 [Citations omitted].\u201d <em>In re Jacqueline F. </em>(1979), 47 N.Y. 2d 215, 222, 391 N.E. 2d 967. It has been held that the attorney-client privilege only exists to aid in the administration of justice. <em>Brennan, supra, </em>at 372. Necessarily, then, it may not be said that our holding in <em>Waldmann </em>affords the cloak of privilege to a client\u2019s name and address in all cases under all circumstances. With the above principles in mind, we proceed with our analysis of whether, under the circumstances presented by the case <em>sub judice, </em>the names and addresses of appellants\u2019 alleged clients should be given the cloak of protection afforded by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">We are persuaded by the rationale and holding in two New York cases which we believe to be dispositive of the issue with which we are now confronted. In <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Anonymous </em>(1969), 59 Misc. 2d 149, 298 N.Y. Supp. 2d 345, a child was born out of wedlock to a nineteen year old mother who had made arrangements for the child\u2019s adoption with an anonymous couple prior to the child\u2019s birth. After surrendering her child, the mother sought her child\u2019s return through habeas corpus proceedings, naming the couple\u2019s attorney, together with the anonymous couple, as respondents. Attorney-respondent asserted the attorney-client privilege and refused to reveal his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>clients\u2019 identity. The court, in directing the attorney-respondent to disclose his clients\u2019 identity, simply stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u201cNo legitimate reason has been urged upon this court except the bare claim of confidentiality of the clients\u2019 identity which would require this court to respect the claim of confidentiality. On the contrary, the only purpose served by respecting this claim of confidentiality would be to frustrate this court\u2019s legitimate processes and concern for the welfare of the child.\u201d <em>Anonymous, supra, </em>at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In <em>Tierney </em>v. <em>Flower </em>(1969), 32 A.D. 2d 392, 302 N.Y. Supp. 2d 640, a child, was born out of wedlock to a minor woman. The child\u2019s mother and maternal grandfather consulted with an attorney regarding placement and adoption of the expectant child prior to the child\u2019s birth. Upon leaving the hospital, the mother delivered her child to a man and a woman in the hospital parking lot. She did not know the identity of the couple, but was advised by the attorney that they would be in a beige automobile. More than a year later, the child\u2019s mother informed the attorney that she desired the return of her child. The attorney consulted with his clients, instructing them to refuse the mother\u2019s request and to refrain from revealing their identity or the location of the child. Subsequently, the child\u2019s mother filed a habeas corpus petition in which the attorney was named the respondent as the only person with knowledge of the identity of the child\u2019s custodian. The clients were named on the petition as \u201cJohn Doe\u201d and \u201cMary Doe.\u201d The petition was served only upon the attorney. Further, at the time the petition was filed, the status of the alleged adoption proceedings could not be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">At the hearing, the attorney continually refused to reveal his clients\u2019 identity, but admitted that they did indeed have possession of the child. The <em>Tierney </em>court emphatically commented at 395-396:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u201cIn our opinion, there is no competent reason why the Supreme Court [appellate division] should uphold the claim of confidential relationship between the appellant and his clients to the point of sealing their identity where the safe and proper custody of a child is involved, particularly where, as at bar, the infant is out of the custody of his mother and is not lodged in the custody of persons who have any legal authorization for their assumption of control over the infant. The Supreme Court\u2019s overriding concern with the welfare of the infant as a ward of the court overbalances any interest of technical claim on the appellant\u2019s part with respect to th\u00e9 confidential relationship between him and his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u201cWe reject the appellant\u2019s contention that the cases in which disclosure of the names and addresses of clients was required or restricted to situations in which the attorney-client relationship exists in the very litigation where disclosure is sought and that such case law has no application at bar where the attorney is not representing any client but appears and contests as a principal. The disclosure of the client\u2019s identity is required where, as at bar, injury would result to the proper administration of justice \u2018immeasurably greater than the benefit that would enure to the relation of attorney and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>client.\u2019 * * * The seal of secrecy between attorney and client is to be preserved \u2018in the aid of a public purpose to expose wrongdoing and not * * * to conceal wrongdoing.\u2019 * * * \u2018[T]he veil [of privilege is removed] from the client\u2019s name when the attorney\u2019s assertion of a privilege is a cover for cooperation in wrongdoing.\u2019 [Citations omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">We, therefore, conclude that when the peculiar factual environment and the egregious circumstances of the instant case are properly considered in light of our holding regarding the attorney-client privilege in <em>Waldmann, supra, </em>the names and addresses of appellants\u2019 alleged clients are not entitled to the cloak of protection afforded by the attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b300-7\">Celebrezze, C. J., W. Brown, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b300-8\">Re snick, J., of the Sixth Appellate District, sitting for Sweeney, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-11\"> See R.C. 5103.16 (A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\"> See R.C. 5103.16 (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\"> See R.C. 5103.16 (C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\"> Although not raised by the parties, we parenthetically note that even though the child was born out of wedlock, since the minor child\u2019s name is stated as being Bobby Lee Nash, Jr., it appears that Nash, Sr., must have signed the child\u2019s birth certificate as provided in R.C. 3705.14, legitimized the child pursuant t\u00f3 R.C. 2105.18, or at least acknowledged the child in a writing sworn to before a notary public prior to the placement of the child in the allegedly prospective adoptive parents\u2019 custody. In any of these events, it readily appears that Nash, Sr.\u2019s consent is also necessary before the child, Nash, Jr., can be adopted. R.C. 3107.06; <em>Caban </em>v. <em>Mohammed </em>(1979), 441 U.S. 380. We make this observation since R.C. 3705.14 provides that \u201c[a] child born out of wedlock shall be registered by the surname of the mother * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Also, we further note that both the juvenile court and the court of appeals determined that Ms. Lemley\u2019s consent was given under duress. See <em>In re Hua </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 227, 232 [16 O.O.3d 270], Therefore, Ms. Lemley\u2019s consent is necessarily invalid. <em>Hua, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\"> Another consideration in affirming the trial court\u2019s issuance of a habeas corpus writ to appellants is the possible, if not probable jurisdictional quagmire which likely could arise in the instant case. Although unknown, the present location of the minor child could very well be in a state other than Ohio, and if the juvenile court had not acted as it did, this unlawful placement would, in effect, have received judicial approval. If by chance the location of the child is outside of this state, then arguably, an Ohio court would be without authority to issue a writ to its physical custodian ordering the return of the child. However, those most closely involved with this unlawful placement, namely appellants, are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b297-12\"> R.C. 2317.021 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">\u201cAs used in division (A) of section 2317.02 of the Revised Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">\u201c \u2018Client\u2019 means a person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other association that, directly or through any representative, consults an attorney for the purpose of retaining the attorney or securing legal service or advice from him in his professional capacity, or consults an attorney employee for legal service or advice, and who communicates, either directly or through an agent, employee, or other representative, with such attorney; and includes an incompetent whose guardian so consults the attorney in behalf of the incompetent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-15\">\u201cWhere a corporation or association is a client having the privilege and it has been dissolved, the privilege shall extend to the last board of directors, their successors or assigns, or to the trustees, their successors or assigns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-16\">\u201cThis section shall be construed as in addition to, and not in limitation of, other laws affording protection to communications under the attorney-client privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b298-11\"> This court\u2019s holding in <em>Waldmann, supra, </em>at 177-178, was much narrower than the holding in the appellate decision in <em>In re Heile </em>(1939), 65 Ohio App. 45 [18 O.O. 274], where the appellate court stated at 49:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\u201c* * * where the [attorney-client] privilege exists, it includes the protection of the name and address of the client.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\"> <em>Waldmann </em>v. <em>Waldmann </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 176 [2 O.O.3d 373], distinguished.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
