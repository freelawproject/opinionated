Celebrezze, Jr., </em>attorney general, and <em>Mr. John C.

While the issue in <em>Henry </em>involved the construction of R.C. 2901.02(B) and its specific designation of aggravated murder as a capital offense, as well as any offense for which the death penalty may be imposed, such construction is also valid in the instant case and the offenses of which appellant was convicted under former R.C. 2901.01 were capital offenses independent of whether the death penalty may be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Accordingly, appellant has failed to demonstrate a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, and the judgment of the court of appeals, denying the writ, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b250-9\">Holmes, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b250-10\">Holmes, J., concurring. Although I dissented in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>I concur here upon the basis of <em>stare decisis.</em></judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
