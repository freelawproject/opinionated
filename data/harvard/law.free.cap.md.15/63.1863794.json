Because it authorizes and empowers the trustees therein named, as soon as conveniently may be, to sell and dispose of, by public auction, or at private sale, so much and such parts of the stock in trade, property and estate by said deed conveyed, as are in their nature saleable, for the most money that the same will produce in ready money, or on such terms of credit as the said trustees may approve.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-8\">2nd. Because it authorises the trustees to sell the property <em>by </em>retail, or in parcels, as they may deem eligible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>3rd. Because, by the terms of the deed, the trustees are not accountable for any loss or damage which shall or may happen in and about the management or disposal of the trust estate, unless the same shall be occasioned by their wilful neglect or default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">4th, Because no notice was by the deed required to be given to creditors to file their releases, although the filing of such releases within sixty days is, by the deed, made essential to the right of creditors- to come in among the preferred creditors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">5th. Because the deed provides for the payment, as a preferred debt, of whatever rent was due at the date thereof, or should thereafter become due, on the store or warehouse ' on Baltimore street, rented by the grantor, until the stock in trade conveyed by the deed should be sold and disposed of by the trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">6th. Because the said deed hinders, delays and defrauds creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-8\">The court (Lee, J.) refused to give this instruction, and to this refusal the plaintiff excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-9\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, O. J., Eccleston and Tuck, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-10\"><em>Frederick W. Brune, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOp\">argued that this deed was void:</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-11\">1st. Because the power of sale given to the trustees is not a clear direction to sell the entire trust subject, <em>but only so much and such parts thereof \u25a0 as are in their nature saleable; </em>thus leaving a portion of the trust subject undisposed of, which would belong to the grantor as a resulting trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-12\">2nd. Because if the power of sale should be construed to be a direction to sell and dispose of the whole trust subject, except the debts and claims, it is a direction to sell at private sale, as well as by public auction, and in parcels or by retail, and upon such terms of credit as the trustee shall approve.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-13\">3rd, Because this power of sale is extended and conferred; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>upon tlie executor or administrator of the surviving trustee, and is not required to be exercised until said parties can <em>conveniently do so; </em>and by these and other provisions, such as that directing the payment, out of the trust property, of the rent which should accrue upon the warehouse of the grantor until the stock in trade should be disposed of, a delay in making the sales is authorised by the deed <em>beyond what is necessary for the purposes of the trust, and a gradual disposition of the trust properly, </em>at private sale, upon such terms as the trustees may approve, expressly permitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-5\">4th. Because the deed was intended to convey, and only conveys the <em>personal </em>property of the grantor, and does necessarily and without any reservation whatever to himself, plainly and affirmatively appearing on the face of the deed, convey absolutely <em>all </em>his property, <em>real </em>and <em>personal, </em>and a <em>fee-simple </em>in his lands, if he had any, but only a <em>life estate </em>therein, and at the same time grants preferences and requires releases from his creditors, under the penalty of a postponement of their right to participate in the property conveyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-6\">In support of these positions, reference is made to 3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>11, 38, 39, <em>Green vs. Trieber; Ibid., </em>40, 48, 51, 52, <em>Sangston vs. Gaither. </em>8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>426, <em>Malcolm vs. Hodges. 7 Md. Rep., </em>391, 393, <em>American Exchange Bank vs. Inloes, </em>and same case in 11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>182. 11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>380, <em>Rosenberg vs. Moore. </em>14 <em>Md.

Battee </em>and <em>Levin Gale </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-9\">1st. The deed provides that the trustees shall, as soon as conveniently may be, dispose of the property, for the most that it will bring in ready money or on such terms of credit as they shall approve,- and further that the trustees shall pa,y the rent of the store theretofore occupied by the grantor until the stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>of goods shall be disposed of in pursuance of the deed. From these two provisions the appellant seeks to draw the conclusion that the deed is void: 1st because it allows a sale on credit; and 2nd, because it authorises a sale of the property by retail or in parcels. Without granting the second reason, the appellees insist, that these provisions only give to the trustees a reasonable and sound discretion in the exercise of their duties, which it was proper they should have. 11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>184, <em>American Exchange Bank </em>vs. <em>Inloes; </em>13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>179, <em>Maennel vs. Murdoch; </em>13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>538, 566, <em>Berry vs. Matthews.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-5\">2nd. Another objection is, that by the terms of the deed, the trustees are not liable for loss or damage to the estate unless occasioned by their wilful default. ' To meet this objection, the appellees refer to and rely upon 13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>175, 180, <em>Maennel vs. Murdock; </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>133, <em>McCall vs. Hinkley; </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>473, <em>Kettlewell vs. Stewart.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-6\">3rd. A third objection is, that the deed gives a preference to such creditors as shall release within sixty days, but makes no provision for notice to the creditors. To this objection the appellees answer, that all the deeds requiring releases which have been before this court are similar in terms, in reference to this provision, and that not one of them contains a clause requiring notice to be given to creditors. The recording of the deed, which is necessary to give it validity, is <em>notice to all the world, and especially to auditors and others interested in the property. 8 Gill, </em>473, <em>Kettlewell vs. Stewart; </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>132, <em>McCall vs. Hinkley; </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>250, <em>Williams vs. Banks; </em>13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>493, <em>Cooke\u2019s lessee vs. Kell.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-7\">4th. Another objection, which was not urged in the court below, but now presented for the first time, upon the authority of <em>Barnitz vs. Rice </em>and <em>Rosenberg vs. Moore, </em>is, that the deed does not upon its face convey <em>all </em>the property of the grantor, <em>real </em>as well as <em>personal, </em>and but a life estate in his land, if he had any. To this the appellees reply that the terms of this deed are unlike those in the cases referred to, and that it does embrace all the grantor\u2019s property of every description. The terms <em>\u201cestate of every kind and description\u201d </em>are the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>most comprehensive that could be used, and are clearly sufficient to pass real estate, and in such a deed as this it is not necessary that the word \u201c <em>heirs\u201d </em>should be used in order to pass <em>a, fee-simple </em>in land. 9 <em>Gill, </em>262, <em>Spessard, et al., vs. Rohrer, et. al. </em>In the case of <em>Malcolm vs. Hodges, </em>8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>419, the same words were held sufficient to pass ail the grantor\u2019s property, <em>real </em>as Well as <em>personal.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b79-5\">Le Grand, <em>C. </em>J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQS\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">This is an attachment. The debt, and a sufficiency of funds in the hands of the garnishees to pay it, are not denied. The defence, is, that on the 16th day of December 1854, the defendant, Lewis A. Muncks, executed a deed to the garnishees of his property, for the payment of his debts, in reply, the plaintiff contends that this deed is void, and asked the court below to so instruct the jury, which the court refused to do. Upon the validity of the deed depends the decision of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In its premises, or recital, it declares, that the said Lewis A. Muncks \u201chath granted, bargained and sold, assigned, conveyed, transferred and made over, and by these presents doth grant, bargain and sell, assign, transfer, convey and make over, unto the said Qtho W. Eiche\u00edberger and Jacob Trust, and the survivor of them, and the executors and administrators of such survivor, all and singular the goods, Wares, merchandise, stock in trade, chattels, property <em>and estate of every kind and description belonging to the said Lewis A. Muncks, </em>and all debts, sum and sums of money, books of account, claims, and other things due, owing <em>and belonging </em>to the said Lewis A. Muncks, and all <em>his estate and interest </em>therein.\u201d In the <em>habendum </em>of the instrument it is said, that the grantees are \u201cto have and to hold all the said estate and property, stock in trade, chattels and effects, debts, claims and sums of money hereby mentioned to be conveyed, transferred and assigned, unto the said parties hereto of the second part, and the survivor of them, and the executors and administrators of such survivor, in <em>trust </em>and \u25a0confidence,\u201d &lt;fcc\u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The reasons assigned in argument why the deed should be considered void, are somewhat different from those urged at the trial below. It is urged before this court, that the deed was, and is, void, because it was intended to convey, and only conveys, the personal property of the grantor, and does not necessarily convey all his property, real and personal, and not a fee-simple interest in his lands, if he had any. This objection was not embraced in the instruction refused by the court, but had it bedn we do not think it should have availed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In construing deeds of trust in favor of creditors; this court has, on more occasions than one, said; that the deed, on its face, must convey <em>all </em>the property of the grantor, and that the. deed must be interpreted by its own language: <em>Rosenberg &amp; Blondheim vs. </em>Moore, 11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>381. The question then is, does this deed convey <em>all </em>the estate, real and personal, of the grantor? We are of opinion it does do so. In the premises the grant is, of his \u201c estate of <em>every kind </em>and <em>description. \u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In the case of <em>Budd vs. Brooke, et al., </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>235, thfe the court holds the following language, which is conclusive of question: \u201cThe technical meaning of the word\u2018premises,\u2019 in a deed of conveyance, is everything which precedes the habendum, and it is in the premises of a deed that the thing is really granted,\u201d Speaidng of the case then before them; the court proceeds to say: \u201cAccording to our construction of the grant, made by the premises, i-t is in direct conflict with that contained in the <em>habendum </em>Both cannot prevail. One must overrule the other. Which takes precedence, is the question? In our opinion, the limitations contained in the <em>habendum </em>must be rejected, and the estates given in the premises must prevail. In 2 <em>Lomax\u2019s Dig., </em>188, it is stated, that \u2018where there are two clauses in a deed, of which the latter is contradictory to the former, then the former shall stand.\u2019 And at page 215, of the same book, it is said, that \u2018where the <em>habendwn </em>is repugnant and contradictory to the premises, is is void, and the grantee shall take the estate :given in tire premises. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A4t\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>(Decided February 27th, 1860.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The objection that there are no words of inheritance in the deed, is fuliy answered by the case of <em>Spessard and others vs. Rohrer and others, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>261, in which it was decided that, in a deed of trust, conveying property for the payment of the debts of the grantor, the omission of the words, <em>uand his heirs,\u201d </em>did not have the effect of confining the grant to personalty, but where the intent to convey <em>all </em>the property of the grantor was manifest, a fee-simple in realty also passed, by implication, under the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">All the other exceptions to tlie deed, with the exception of the one which declares against its validity because it does not require notice to be given to the creditors, arc answered by the case of <em>Maennel et al., vs. Murdock et al., garn. of Falconer &amp; Haskell, </em>13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>164. In regard to notice, the recording is, in the <em>absence of fraud, </em>sufficient. <em>Williams vs. Banks, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., 250. Cooke\u2019s lessee vs. Kell, </em>13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>493. Perceiving nothing erroneous in the ruling of the court we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
