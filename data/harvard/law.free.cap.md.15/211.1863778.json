The plaintiff then offered in evidence the bond, the execution of which was admitted, and the record in the attachment suit, the defendant reserving exceptions to certain portions of said record. The plaintiff'further offered in evidence the sworn statement of Henry <em>W. </em>Archer, which, it was agreed should be admitted in evidence as if proved on the stand, subject, however, to all legal exceptions as to the competency of all or any portions thereof. The defendant objected to a portion of this statement, upon the ground stated in the opinion of th.is court, but the court (Lee, J.) overruled this objection and admitted it with the qualification also stated in the opinion of this court. To this ruling the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\"><em>2nd Exception. </em>The defendant then objected to the admissibility, in evidence, of a copy of the receipt set forth in the record of the attachment suit, showing payment of the amount of the judgment by Stephenson; on the ground that the same was not the best evidence of the fact of such payment having been made, and was therefore inadmissible to prove such payment. This objection the court overruled and admitted the record as evidence of payment, and to prove that the plaintiff, Stephenson, had paid said judgment, and to this ruling the defendant excepted. (This exception was abandoned in argument in this court.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">. <em>3rd Exception. </em>Further evidence was offered on'the part of the defendant, showing that the attachment was issued by Tome in October 1853, and that judgment, <em>by default, </em>was obtained thereon against Stephenson, as garnishee, on the 17th of November 1854, at the November Term of the circuit court for Harford county, and further tending to show that after-May 1853, and up to the date of the judgment obtained by Tome against Stephenson, as garnishee, neither Stephenson nor the defendant, Creamer, owed Adams, the defendant in the attachment, any moneys. The defendant also offered in evidence an agreement between the plaintiff and himself, dated the 24th of September 1853, by which Creamer cove<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>nanted and agreed to sell the land in question, to Stephenson \u2022upon certain terms and conditions, which need not be more particularly stated than to say, in certain contingencies, it provided for a bond of indemnity by Creamer against the claim of Pheuix, bu! makes no mention of any claim of Tome. Other evidence was also offered, on the part of the defendant, which need not be stated more particularly than appears in the following primers, which were then asked by the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">1st.

If the jury believe from the evidence, that the plaintiff and defendant entered into the written contract of the 24th of September 1853, on the day of its date, and that afterwards, in October 1853, Tome issued an attachment against Adams, and caused it to be laid in the hands of Stephenson, as garnishee, and that Stephenson, neither at that time nor afterwards, had in his hands any moneys of Adorns, nor owed him any; and that afterwards, on the 3rd of December 1853, Stephenson' requested and obtained from the defendant the bond of indemnity sued on, and required to be inserted therein a special provision to indemnify him against said attachment claim o\u00ed Tome, and that at the very time of requiring this clause to be inserted, and down to the 17th of November 1854, inclusive, he, Stephenson, knew be held no moneys of Adams and owed him nothing, and well knew the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>in that attachment could not recover judgment against him except through his own default in failing to appear to the attachment and plead to the same, and that Stephenson failed to appear thereto and suffered judgmeut to go against him for want of such appearance, and failed to notify the defendant, Creamer, of said judgment, after the same had been obtained, and for eighteen months afterwards, and that neither Creamer nor his counsel had .any knowledge of such judgment until about the time of the institution of this suit, and that Stephenson, on or about the 8th of September 1856, without any execution or threat of execution having been had or made against him, paid said judgment, then that these facts are evidence from which the jury may find that Stephenson did not pay said money in good faith but by collusion between himself and Tome, and if the jury shall so find, then the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">5th.

The bond was the only legal evidence of the contract between the parties, and conversations held at the same time of its execution were inadmissible as evidence, because the sole effect of such evidence must have been to prove a parol agreement, inconsistent with the legal purport of the bond itself. The bond is to be construed by the court. It showed that the attachment suit was to be <em>resisted by </em>Stephenson, at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>own cost and charge , whereas the parol agreement, sought to be proven, was to the effect that that suit was to be <em>resisted by Creamer, </em>and at his cost and charge.

By the qualification added to the fourth prayer, the court, besides engrafting upon the bond a parol agreement inconsistent therewith, which was entirely erroneous, was further in error, because the question of fraud or collusion was one solely for the decision of the jury, upon consideration of <em>all </em>the facts of the case, but the court undertook to select part only of the facts, and to say that these, if believed, would \u2022relieve the case from any inference of fraud. 7 <em>Gill, </em>367, <em>Richards &amp; wife vs. Swan, et al. </em>1 <em>Md.

The instruction granted by the court is .liable to the same objection urged under our first point.

The plaintiff below expressly disavowed any intention to use the evidence objected to in the first exception, for the purpose of varying the contract contained in the bond, but claimed that it was admissible, among other things, for the purpose of doing away with the inference of fraud, which the defendant contended should be drawn from the fact that the judgment in the attachment suit was obtained by default. For this purpose, the evidence was perfectly competent as well as in general explanation of the circumstances of the case. The bond did not. impose any obligation whatever upon Stephenson, and, so far as his obligations were concerned, it was competent to prove, by parol or other evidence, the nature, character, and extent of these obligations. 5 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., 157, <em>McCreary vs. McCreary. 4 Wash.

The granting of the first three prayers, and the instruction given by the court, gave to the defendant all the law to which he was entitled. The court\u2019s instruction, particularly, fully and fairly submitted to the jury all the questions proper for them to consider. The fourth prayer was obnoxious to the objection of separating a limited portion of the evidence, and submitting that to the jury as the basis on which to find fraud, and was calculated to mislead and embarrass the jury, and the qualification added tended to relieve the case from that embarrassment. 10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>67, <em>Wilson vs. Smith. </em>13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>348, <em>Chew vs. Beall. </em>The <em>fifth </em>prayer was properly rejected because the judgment obtained against Stephenson, in the attachment suit, was a sufficient legal requirement upon him to pay, and it was unnecessary, and would have been improper, for him to wait for an execution, which would have only added costs. 1 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>497, <em>Mayor &amp; C. C. of Balto. vs. Hughes</em>.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Le Grand, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeT\">delivered ibe opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">This action was brought by the appellee against the appellant on a bond, given by the appellant, for the indemnification of the appellee, under the following circumstances: Stephenson (the plaintiff below) purchased land from Creamer (the defendant). A person, of the name of Tome, having obtained judgment against a person, named Adams, from whom Creamer had previously purchased this land, an attachment, on the judgment recovered by Tome against Adams, was issued and laid in the hauds of Stephenson, and also on the lands. The design of the attachment was, to affect any interest which Adams might have in the lands, or the pro \u25a0 ceeds. Stephenson and Creamer being anxious to complete the purchase, it was agreed between them that Stephenson should pay the purchase money and take a title, upon Creamer giving a bond to indemnify him against these attachments and certain other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Tire bond of indemnity is dated the 3rd day of December 1853. After reciting certain facts and agreements, it proceeds to declare that Creamer is to \u201cindemnify and save harmless the said Stephenson against all and singular the claims aforesaid, and against all <em>costs and reasonable </em>charges <em>to </em>which he may be subjected in resisting said claims, and shall refund to said Stephenson all such sums of money as he, the said Stephenson, may be legally required to pay on account of said claims, or upon other liens upon the land aforesaid, or the purchase money therefor, which may have originated since the date of the said Adam\u2019s purchase thereof, from,\u201d&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The plaintiff, to sustain his case, gave in evidence the bond of the defendant, the judgment in the attachment suit and proof of the payment of the amount by Stephenson; and then offered, in evidence a statement of H. W. Archer, Esq. To the admissibility of the following portion of it the defendant excepted, viz: \u201cAt the same time Creamer, (the time when the bond was delivered to Archer for Stephenson,) inquired what amount he might be held liable for upon such bond, in regard to the same attachment, and was told by me, that, if Tome obtained judgment, he would have to pay the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Ill at Stephenson might be compelled to pay, including his costs and expenses, as provided in the bond, but that if the attachment was defeated, he would only have to pay Stephenson\u2019s expenses, which would probably be nothing more than the fees which Stephenson might have to pay his attorney; Creamer objected to Stephenson\u2019s employing counsel at his expense, and <em>I recollect distinctly that it ivas understood that Creamer would have ike case defended by his own </em>counsel, <em>which appeared lo me very </em>proper, <em>as he alone was interested, in the result; </em>and, as I was counsel for Tome, it would have been impossible for me to have appeared or acted, for either Stephenson or Creamer, in the attachment ca.se.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ae0\">The objection of the defendant was placed upon the ground, that, by the introduction of the testimony, \u201cit was sought thereby to prove a parol understanding, wholly different and inconsistent with the legal purport of the bond offered in evidence, and that the bond itself must constitute the only evidence of what the contract was between the parties, and that its legal effect could not be varied by any parol agreement or explanation which might be supposed to accompany and explain it.\u201d The plaintiff <em>expressly disclaimed any such purpose </em>in the offer, and declared that the evidence was offered <em>to slum that the plaintiff had acted in good faith in reference to the said attachment suit, and to rebut any presumption of fraud that might be contended </em>for, <em>as arising out of the judgment in the attachment suit having been obtained by </em>default, and, generally, for any other purpose in the cause which <em>\u201cdid not vary the purport of the bond. </em>\u2019 \u2019 The court overruled the objection of the defendant, and allowed the evidence to go to the jury with the qualification, <em>\u201cthat the same should not be allowed to qualify or vary the legal purport or effect of the bond.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">There can be no doubt that is not admissible to vary or contradict a written agreement by parol; but no such effort was made in this case; so far from it, such was expressly prohibited by the court and disclaimed in the offer. And although the law interdicts such variance or contradiction, it. admits- of the introduction of parol evidence in the case of a la~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tent ambiguity, <em>(McColloch vs. Girard, </em>4 <em>Wash. C. C., 290,) </em>or to prove anjr collateral, independent fact,\u201eabout which the agreement is silent. The case of <em>McCreary vs. McCreary, 5 Gill &amp; Johnson, </em>147, fully sustains the ruling, of the Superior court on this exception. That was an action of debt to recover the amount of a single bill, and the plaintiff pleaded, by way of set-off, a claim for various articles sold and delivered, and upon the trial, proved a lease of land by him <em>to </em>the plaintiff, in which the plaintiff covenanted to pay the defendant a certain annual sum for life, and to pay all claims and demands existing against the defendant at the date of the lease. The defendant also proved an appraisement, made at the request of the parties, of various articles of personal property, (which the appraisers certified the plaintiff was to take as his properly at the valuation,) that such articles were delivered to the plaintiff at the valuation, and that the\u00b0Iease, appraisement and delivery were made at the same time. The plaintiff then proposed to prove a verbal agreement between him and defendant, that the value of this property should be applied by the plaintiff to the payment of the outstanding debts of the defendant. The county court rejected the evidence, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision, and held, that as the appraisers\u2019 certificate did not show in what manner the property valued was to be paid for, parol evidence was admissible to ascertain the fact; adopting the rule as stated in Philips\u2019 evidence, that \u201cthough an ambigiuity apparent on tire face of a written instrument cannot be explained by extrinsic evidence, yet, where a question arises, as to the general intention of the parties, concerning which the instrument is not decisive, it has been held that proof of independent facts, collateral to the instrument, may be pro-* perly admitted.\u201d And in <em>Dorsey vs. Eagle, </em>7 <em>Gill &amp; Johnson, </em>331, it is said: \u201cIt is a well settled principle of law, that parol evidence may be given of collateral and independent facts, which tend to support a deed, provided it is not offered to vary the agreement, and is consistent with the deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Now the language of the contract in this case is -wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>silent as to the <em>'manner </em>or <em>means </em>to be employed <em>\u201cin resisting'1'1 </em>the claims referred to. There is nothing inconsistent with, or contradictory to this language, in the proof of the independent fact as to how and through whose agency the resistance was to be -made. We think the court was not in error.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A1J\">(Decided March 21st, 1860.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The second exception of the defendant is abandoned, The third exception relates to the prayers offered on behalf of the defendant. Of the five instructions asked, the first three were granted, the fourth and fifth, as presented, were rejected, but the fourth, with a qualification, was granted. The second exception having been abandoned, the only point of the fourth prayer is, that from the facts enunciated in it the jury might find, that the payment made by the plaintiff was not in good faith, but in collusion with Tome. The argument urged in support of this prayer rests on this idea: that the judgment ought not to have been paid until <em>after </em>execution, and that having been paid without execution, the defendant is in nowise responsible to refund the amount. To this reasoning we do not assent, nor docs the law give it any support. It was the judgment which fixed the liability. Had Stephenson withheld payment until execution was levied, Creamer very reasonably might have complained of such unnecessary accumulation of costs. If there was no other reason to ratify the rejection of the defendant\u2019s fifth prayer, the abandonment of his second exception in this court would be sufficient. The prayer, among other things, leaves it to the jury to find that Adams was not a creditor of either Stephenson or Creamer. The judgment in the attachment suit established the indebtedness of Stephenson, as garnishee, and precluded all further question in regard to the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We do not perceive any valid objection .to the instruction given by the court.
