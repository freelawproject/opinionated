That the court below erred in admitting' the witness,Tonge, the acceptor of the draft, to testify in regard to the letter written by him to the appellant, the drawer of the draft, in relation to its dishonor, and also in permitting the copy of said letter, without notice to produce the original, and mutilated, as it appears, by the blank left in it, to have been, to be read to 'the jury as evidence. 1st. Because Tonge was not the <em>agent </em>of the endorsee, the holder, to inform the acceptor of the dishonor of the draft; and 2nd, because, having written without authority, his letter was not evidence. 8 <em>Wheat., </em>326, <em>Nicholls vs. Webb. </em>11 Wheat., 431, <em>Mills vs. Bank of U.

That the-notice must come from the holder, or his agent, and not from a mere stranger, and though this rule is qualified to the extent that the notice will be sufficient if it comes from <em>a party to the bill, </em>yet this qualification is limited in this particular, viz., the notice must come from some party to the bill, who can, by receiving payment from the party notified, give him an immediate remedy on the bill. The <em>acceptor </em>does not hold the bill and cannot give such remedy, and notice from him is, therefore, insufficient. 2 <em>Camp., </em>177, <em>Stewart vs. Kennett.

That even if the copy of the letter from Tonge is evidence, there is no proof of its ever having been mailed. The witness proves that <em>he had no recollection that the letter was mailed by him, or that it was mailed at all. </em>And, although he proves it was the custom of his clerk to mail letters from his office, there is no proof, <em>by the clerk, </em>that he mailed the letter referred to, the clerk not having been examined. 3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>474, <em>Flack vs. Green.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">4th.

That <em>any party </em>to a hill may give the notice, and it has been expressly decided that an <em>acceptor </em>may do it. The rule, as stated by Judge Story, is this: \u201cThe notice will be sufficient, although not given by the holder, or his agent, if it comes from some person who holds\u2019 the bill when it is dishonored, <em>or </em>who is a party to the bill, <em>or </em>who would, on the same being returned to him, and after paying it, be entitled to require reimbursement thereof.\u201d <em>Story on Bills, sec. </em>404. <em>Chilly on Bills, 527, </em>and <em>cases </em>there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-8\">2nd. The <em>press-copy </em>of the letter from this acceptor was admissible in evidence. The rule of evidence that excludes a <em>copy </em>is because there is <em>belter evidence </em>behind, but in this case there could be no better evidence than a <em>press-copy </em>\u2014 it is in fact a <em>duplicate-original.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-9\">3rd. The defendant's second prayer was properly refused. If it refers to the protest, the defendant had the benefit of it by the granting of his <em>first </em>prayer. If it refers to the proof of mailing the letter, it could not be granted, for the court could not say there was <em>no siifficienl </em>evidence of notice, if there was <em>any evidence </em>tending to show that fact. The <em>custom </em>of the commercial house in which the letter was written was evidence from which the jury might infer that the letter was duly mailed. 7 <em>Gill, </em>216, <em>Bell vs. Hagerstown Bank. </em>Again, the fact, as testified to by Tonge, that he had correspondence and conversations with the defendant in reference to the non-payment of this draft, and that the defendant never complained that he had no notice of its dishonor, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>.evidence from which the jury might infer he had received such notice, and especially that he had received the letter informing him of the protest. There can be no valid objection to .the letter by reason of the <em>blan/c </em>in it; for it certainly gave him notice that the draft had not been paid, and had been protested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\">4th. The <em>third </em>and <em>fourth </em>prayers of the defendant, if objectionable on no other ground, were certainly properly rejected for the reason that they require the jury to find notice <em>by </em>mail, as the <em>only mode </em>in which notice .could be given. This is not law, for there are other modes of giving notice than by mail.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b164-6\">Tuck, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2s\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">This is an action of <em>assumpsit </em>by the endorsee against the \u25a0drawer of a bill of exchange. The questions for consideration relate to the notice of dishonor of the bill; and these are: 1st, whether such notice, if in due time, from the acceptor to the drawer, binds the latter in an action against him? 2nd, whether the letter in this case is not sufficient, notwithstanding the imperfections of the copy? 3rd, whether there <em>}S </em>evidence that the letter was mailed?</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Treating the first of these propositions with reference to the purposes for which the law requires notice to parties to bills of exchange, there would seem to be no reason to doubt the sufficiency of notice from the acceptor. A prudent man would need no more authoritative information than a letter from the party, primarily liable, that, being due and payment demanded, the bill had been dishonored. It was once held that no party could give a valid notice, unless he Avas the holder at time. <em>Tindal vs. Brown, </em>1 <em>Term </em>Rep., 167. Rut this doctrine after having been follotved in other cases <em>(Ex-parte, </em>Barclay, 7 <em>Ves,, </em>597; <em>Stewart vs. Kennett, 2 Camp,, </em>177) was expressly overruled in the case of <em>Chapman vs. Keane, </em>3 <em>Adol. &amp; Ellis, </em>193, (30 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>69,) in which most of the preA\u00daous decisions Avere retdeAved. Nothing can be more emphatic than the language of Lord D.epman, in pronouncing judgment. After referring to <em>Tindal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>vs. Brown, </em>and <em>Ex-parte Barclay, </em>he says: \u201cNotwithstanding these high authorities, it is clear, from <em>Jameson vs. Swinton, 2 Camp., </em>373; <em>Wilson vs. Swabey, </em>1 <em>Stark., N.P. C., </em>34; and also from the learned treatises on bills of exchange, that the contrary doctrine has prevailed in the profession, and we must presume\u2019 a contrary practice in the commercial world. \u2022 It is universally considered that the party entitled, as holder, to sue upon the bill, may avail himself of notice given in due time by any party to it. * \u00b0 * We are now compelled to determine whether the case of <em>Tindal vs. Brown, </em>as to this point, be good law. We think that it is not. \u201d This case has been so generally accepted by the profession, that we may consider the doctrine there announced as the established law. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>527. <em>Story on Bills, sec. </em>304. <em>Byles on Bills, 225. 15 Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>231.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">But it is contended here, that the notice must come from some party to the bill, who can, by receiving payment from the party notified, give him an immediate remedy on the bill, and that, as the acceptor does not hold the bill, and cannot give such remedy, the doctrine of the above case does not apply. It is true that it was so decided in <em>Stewart vs. Kennett, 2 Camp., </em>177, and the same, perhaps, may be inferred from oilier cases; but, we cannot doubt that all such were virtually overruled by <em>Chapman vs. Keane; </em>as well as by other decisions. In <em>Jameson vs. </em>Swinton, 2 <em>Camp., </em>373, where the notice was not given by the holder of the bill, but by his immediate endorser, who had received notice, the court said: \u201cThe drawer or endorser is liable to all subsequent endorsers, if he had due notice of the dishonor of the liill from any person who is a party to it. Such a notice must serve all the purposes for which the giving of notice is required. The drawer or endorser is authoritatively informed that the bill is dishonored; he is enabled to take it up, if he pleases, and may immediately proceed against tile acceptor or prior endorsers.\u201d There is, besides, express authority ontbe very question before us. In <em>Shaw vs. Croft, M. S., </em>1793, cited in <em>Chilly on Bills, </em>527, Lord Kenyon lield, that notice by the' acceptor to the drawer was sufficient; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>same point was ruled by Lord Ellenborougb in <em>Rosher vs. </em>Kieran, 4 <em>Camp., </em>87, where the drawer was notified by a letter from the acceptor, stating, \u201cthat he had not been able to pay it, and that it was then in the hands of the plaintiffs.\u201d We are not aware that these cases have been expressly overruled, or even questioned, except in 3 <em>Wendell, </em>173, <em>Chanvine vs. Fowler, </em>where the bill had not been accepted, and of course the point could not arise, and, on which it may be observed, that the learned judge, in quoting <em>Chittyon Bills, </em>has undoubtedly misstated his doctrine, by using <em>and </em>for <em>or,. </em>(see page 179.) Park, B., also, in <em>Harrison vs. Ruscoe, </em>15 <em>Mees. Welsby, </em>231, where the question was not presented in the case before him, said, that the rule as to notice excluded notice, given by an acceptor, who never could sue himself on taking up the bill. He disposes of the cqses where the point was presented and expressly decided, by adopting a suggestion in <em>Bayley on Bills, ch. </em>7, <em>sec. </em>2, that perhaps the acceptor had a special authority to do so. But the reports of these decisions furnish no pretence for any such supposition. They are express rulings on the very point, without any qualification, and appear to have been recognized by the elementary writers. From an examination of the question, we are of opinion, that this branch of the law-merchant is correctly stated in <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>527, where it is said: \u201cIt suffices if notice be given, after the bill is dishonored, by any person who is a party to the bill, or who would, on the'Same being returned to him, and. after paying it, be entitled to require reimbursement, and such notice will in general enure to the benefit of all the antecedent parties, and render a further notice from any of those parties unnecessary, because it makes no difference who gives the information, since the object of the notice is that the parties may have recourse to the acceptor. \u2019 \u2019 This, however, must be taken with the qualification, elsewhere stated, that a stranger to the bill cannot give the notice. 2 <em>Camp., </em>177. Any party may do so, by which is meant, any person whose name appears on the bill. <em>Flack vs. Green, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>474. It has been also decided (14 <em>Mass., </em>116) that a drawee who has not accepted\u2018cannot notify the parties.*</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Upon the second inquiry, <em>we </em>are of opinion, that the letter from the acceptor to the drawer conveyed sufficient intelligence of the dishonor of the bill. The blank is clearly not the result of a design to keep back part of the letter, but owing to some defect in the letter-press copy. The part omitted does not appear to have any connection with the fact of non-payment and notice, except in excuse for the writer\u2019s failure to pay the bill. Whether wo attempt to supply words for the blank, or treat the copy in evidence as a true transcript of an imperfect letter, received by the defendant with tile blank in it, its effect must bo the same. It was impossible for \u00a1he drawer not to have known from it that the bill was unpaid, and that it had been protested by the holder for the purpose of holding the parties liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We think, however, that the evidence offered for the purpose of showing that the letter had been mailed, was not legally sufficient. The fact was to be found by the jury from the custom prevailing in the counting-room of the writer; but compliance with the custom had not been fully proved. The person whose duty it was to deposit letters in the post-office should have been called, or his absence accounted for. A similar question arose in <em>Bell vs. Hagerstown </em>Bank, 7 <em>Gill, </em>216, where the law was fully discussed. We perceive no sufficient ground for applying different rules to banks and commercial houses. The object here is, to arrive at a particular fact, not by express proof, that the very thing was done, but by a train of circumstances from which the inference of the fact was to be drawn, and we think there ought to bo no defect ill the chain of evidence. The case of <em>Flack vs. Green, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>474, cannot serve the appellant, as is explained in <em>Bell vs. Hagerstown Bank.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">.It follows, as the result of these views, that the letter was properly admitted in evidence; but, as there was not sufficient proof of its having been sent to the office, the second prayer, which embraces that point, was improperly refused. The ruling of \u00a1be court below on the third, fourth and fifth .prayers, was also correct. The third and fourth required .a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>modo of transmitting notice which, according to the proof, was not necessary, and, as to the fifth, there was no question on the pleadings to authorize such an instruction.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Auz\">(Decided February 24th, 1860.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
