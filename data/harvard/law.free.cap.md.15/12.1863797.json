Marriott'1s </em>case in 9 <em>Md.

M. </em>Gill, for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac\">argued:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">1st. That it was the duty of the appellants to prevent any nuisance in the public streets, and if by such nuisance (of which the authorities had notice in time to remove it, and failed to do it in a reasonable time) any injury has been done, the appellants are responsible therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">2nd. That the appellants, having undertaken to provide, for compensation to be paid them, the water for the use of the people of Baltimore, and having undertaken to lay the main pipes through the streets and through which the water was to flow, and having authority to prevent any person from tapping these main pipes and connecting therewith lateral pipes, were hound, where such permission is granted and such lateral pipes laid, to cause this to be done so as to prevent any nuisance in the streets therefrom, and to prevent the streets from being made dangerous to parties using them, and if the city authorities failed and neglected, to perform such duty, a responsibility results therefrom.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-8\">3rd. The instruction granted by the court below was correct and put the case upon the true ground. The hole or ditch in the street had been left open for three or four weeks before the injury \u2014 bad been negligently left open and made the use of the street dangerous, and the appellants or theif agents knew of this and might have secured the same by due and proper care, so that it would not have been dangerous at the time of the injury, and having failed to do their duty in the premises, the appellants must necessarily be responsible, it being proved that there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiffs or their agents. The case of <em>The Mayor &amp; C. C. of Balto. vs. Marriott, </em>9 <em>Md. Rep., </em>160, decides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>eve'iy question involved in the present case, and is conclusive In favor of the plaintiffs\u2019 right of action and the liability of the -defendants.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b24-5\">Le Grand, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The question involved in this case is <em>res adjudicata </em>in this 'State. The action was brought to recover damages for an injury done to a horse, occasioned by the digging of atrench, or hole, in Garden street-, ih'th'e city of Baltimore, into which 'the horse of the 'plaintiffs fell, and Was thereby so crippled as to 'become Worthless-. There is no dispute as to the facts. The trench was dug opposite to a house on the street by the owner thereof, for the purpose of inserting his private pipe into the main pipe belonging to the city and running along the centre of the street, with the view of drawing water from thence and conducting it to his own premises. The trench in question w-as filled up -with earth, and the paving stones placed upon it, but in such manner that by reason of the snow and wet, the ground was so soft that the \"horse, while in a cart hauling a load of c\u00fcal-, sanie .into it and there sustained the injury. There was no evidence going to show, or from which the jury oould infer; any want of caution or care on the part of .the driver -at the time of the accident, but, on the contrary., the evidence went to prove that the appearance of the place, where -the trehch had been, was such, as to conceal the danger of any attempt to pass across it.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">By the agr\u00e9enient of the parties; the Acts of Assembly applicable -to the city of Baltimore; and the -ordnances of the latter, are to be taken as part of the record in this case. Under' these, the city has full authority to remove nuisances from its streets. The arrangement by Which lateral pipes are inserted into the main pipe in the centre of the street, is as follows: the officers of the corporation, for an established charge paid -to it; bore a hole in the main pipe and the rest of the work is done by the person into whose premises the water is to be conducted; .the necessary excavation, filling up -and paving being also done by the oWner of the property. \u25a0But these responsibilities imposed upon the property owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>do not relieve the corporation from the obligation, under its charter, to keep the public highways within its limits free from nuisance and in a condition to be safely travelled. In the present case the performance of their duty was wholly neglected for nearly a month, and, as a consequence of such neglect, the accident happened, and the liability of the city, in the absence of fault .on the part of the plaintiffs, all ached and became complete. In the case of <em>The Mayor &amp; C. C. of Balto. vs. </em>Marriott, 9 <em>Md. Rep., </em>174, in commenting on the clause in the charter of the city of Baltimore, which provides that the corporation \u201cshall have full power and authority to enact and pass all laws and ordinances necessary to preserve {he health of the-city, and <em>to prevent nuisances,\u201d </em>the court declare it to be -\u201ca well settled principle, that when a statute confers a power upon a corporation, to be exercised for the public good, the exercise of the power <em>is not merely discretionary but imperative, </em>and the words \u2018power and authority,\u2019 in such case, may be construed <em>duty </em>and obliga:<em>tion. </em>\u2019 \u2019 And in accordance with this doctrine, which was sustained both by reason and authority in that case, the corporation was held liable for an injury occasioned by a person falling on the ice which was allowed to accumulate on the pavement. The same principle applies to the case ndwbeforeus, and we think the court, in the instruction which it gave to the jury, correctly-stated the law, and required of them to find every fact essential to the'plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery. The law having been. properly laid before the jury, the appellants cannot successfully complain of the action of the court in regard to any of the other propositions submitted to it. <em>The Mutual Safety Insurance Co. vs. </em>Cohen, 3 <em>Gill, </em>459.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A4\">(Decided January 26th, 1860.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
