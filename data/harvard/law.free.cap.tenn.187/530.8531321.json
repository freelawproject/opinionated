In each of these violations the plaintiff in error was found guilty and fined for violating the law, i. e., selling unstamped liquor and selling beer without a license. Fines were paid by the plaintiff in error for each of these violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The plaintiff in error\u2019s only defense to the petition for contempt is that he has already been prosecuted criminally for the same acts which are now charged as contempt of the injunction above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The contrary to this contention has been definitely held by this Court in <em>Ricketts </em>v. <em>State, </em>111 Tenn. 380, 77 S. W. 1076, and in <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>State, </em>160 Tenn. 599, 28 S. W. (2d) 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The mandates of a court must be obeyed. When they are disobeyed it becomes the duty of the court to punish for contempt. The court must do this to uphold the respect due such mandates. The dignity and efficiency of a court requires that its orders be obeyed and a failure to obey requires punishment in accord with the gravity and wilfulness of the disobedience.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">When one is enjoined from committing certain illegal acts a commission of these acts subjects the offender to a criminal prosecution and a prosecution for contempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>for violating the court order. This is not in effect double punishment. One is a punishment for violating a law while the other is for violating a court order. A court mandate or order would be a nullity if the violator could say I have paid a fine for a criminal violation and am, therefore, not subject to the order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">For the reasons given the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-6\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
