Thompson, pro se.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b234-5\">Gene Donofrio, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, David Thompson, appeals from a Carroll County-Common Pleas Court judgment granting a divorce between him and defendantappellee, Diane Thompson, and finding Florida to be the home state of the parties\u2019 children.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 2} The parties were married on July 5, 1985. Seven children were born as issue of the marriage: Deborah (d.o.b. 11/17/92); Jeremiah (d.o.b. 3/13/96); Gabrielle (d.o.b. 5/9/97); Sarah (d.o.b. 6/4/98); Noah (d.o.b. 11/11/99); Lucas (d.o.b. 1/9/02); and Victoria (d.o.b. 10/13/03).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">{\u00b6 3} Sometime in 2005, appellee left Ohio with the children. It is unclear exactly where appellee went initially. But it appears that she and the children spent some time in Texas before moving to Florida. By November 2007, appellee and the children were living in Florida, where they have remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant filed a complaint for divorce on November 4, 2008. In the complaint, he sought custody of the parties\u2019 children. At the time, he was unaware of where appellee and the children were living.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">{\u00b6 5} On December 22, 2008, a letter was received by the Carroll County Clerk of Courts from Legal Services of North Florida stating that it was representing appellee in a dissolution action filed in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">{\u00b6 6} On June 24, 2009, a copy of a document filed in a Florida court was file-stamped and made a part of the record in this case. The document was titled Verified Ex-Parte Motion for Temporary Injunction to Prevent Removal of Minor Child(ren) and Request for Confidential Filing of Address. In this document, appellee requested that the Florida court issue a temporary injunction to prevent the removal of the children from its jurisdiction and allow her to file her address confidentially. In support of her requests, appellee asserted that she feared for her safety and the children\u2019s safety. She detailed an extensive history of domestic violence by appellant. This is the only document in the record filed by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court proceeded with the divorce hearing. Appellee did not appear, nor did an attorney appear on her behalf. The trial court heard testimony from appellant, his mother, and his sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">{\u00b6 8} The court made the following findings in its judgment entry granting appellant a divorce from appellee. Appellee removed the children from Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sometime during 2005, and they have not since returned. Since November 2007, appellee and the children have resided in Okaloosa County, Florida. Pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, the children\u2019s home state is Florida. Therefore, the court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over the children nor issue any order with respect to the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on July 24, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 10} Appellee has failed to file a brief in this matter. Therefore, we may consider appellant\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if appellant\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain that action. App.R. 18(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant raises a single assignment of error, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion and committed an error of law when it failed to find that the home state for the children was the state of Ohio and when it failed to award custody of the children to the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant argues that the trial court should have found Ohio to be the children\u2019s home state and awarded custody to him. He points out that the evidence demonstrated that appellee removed the children from Ohio in 2005 and failed to disclose their whereabouts to him. Appellant alleges that appellee did not enroll the children in school or obtain a job, so as to avoid being located by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">{\u00b6 14} The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (\u201cUCCJEA\u201d) was enacted in 1997 to address interstate recognition and enforcement of child-custody orders. R.C. 3127.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">{\u00b6 15} A trial court\u2019s decision to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to the UCCJEA is a matter within its discretion. <em>Rodriguez v. Frietze, </em>4th Dist. No. 04CA14, 2004-Ohio-7121, 2004 WL 3001067, at \u00b622. Thus, we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision on this matter absent an abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law; it implies that the trial court\u2019s judgment is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">{\u00b6 16} The record does not identify any prior custody orders in this case. As set out in R.C. 2111.08, because appellant and appellee were married, they had equal rights to the custody of their children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe wife and husband are the joint natural guardians of their minor children and are equally charged with their care, nurture, welfare, and education and the care and management of their estates. The wife and husband have equal powers, rights, and duties and neither parent has any right paramount to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>right of the other concerning the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the minor * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">{\u00b6 18} Because the parties had equal rights to the care and custody of the children and because there was no previous order concerning the children\u2019s custody, this case involved an initial custody determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 3127.15 deals with a court\u2019s jurisdiction to make initial custody determinations under the UCCJEA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(A) Except as otherwise provided in section 3127.18 of the Revised Code, a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial determination in a child custody proceeding only if one of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(1) <em>This state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, </em>or <em>was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding </em>and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(2) A court of another state does not have jurisdiction under division (A)(1) of this section or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the basis that this state is the more appropriate forum under section 3127.21 or 3127.22 of the Revised Code, or a similar statute of the other state, and both of the following are the case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(a) The child and the child\u2019s parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant connection with this state other than mere physical presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(b) Substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training, and personal relationships.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(3) All courts having jurisdiction under division (A)(1) or (2) of this section have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(4) No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in division (A)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-13\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(B) Division (A) of this section is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-14\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(C) Physical presence of, or personal jurisdiction over, a party or a child is not necessary or sufficient to make a child custody determination.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">{\u00b6 29} Pursuant to R.C. 3127.01(B)(7), a child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d is \u201cthe state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding the commencement of a child custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>proceeding and, if a child is less than six months old, the state in which the child lived from birth with any of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 30} Based on the above, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Florida, and not Ohio, is the children\u2019s home state. Therefore, once it made that decision, it did not have jurisdiction to make an award as to their custody. None of the conditions specified in R.C. 3127.15(A) for making an initial custody determination exist here. The children have not resided in Ohio since sometime in 2005. Since November 2007, they have resided with appellee in Florida. Appellant did not commence the divorce proceedings until November 4, 2008. By this time, the children had not resided in Ohio for three years and had resided in Florida for at least the previous 12 months. Thus, Ohio was not the children\u2019s home state on the day appellant commenced the divorce action, nor was Ohio their home state within six months of the commencement of the divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 31} Finding no Ohio case on point, appellant relies on two out-of-state cases, <em>Sams v. Boston </em>(1989), 181 W.Va. 706, 384 S.E.2d 151, and <em>Gruber v. Gruber </em>(2001), 141 Md.App. 23, 784 A.2d 583, in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>Boston, </em>the Supreme Court of Appeals for West Virginia held that when children have been abducted to and concealed in another state by one of the parents, the children\u2019s original state remains their \u201chome state\u201d for a reasonable period of time under the circumstances. Id., 384 S.E.2d at 162. And in <em>Gruber, </em>the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland held that \u201cdeception directly resulting in the establishment of home state jurisdiction is reprehensible conduct that may be \u2018so objectionable that a court in the exercise of its inherent equity powers cannot in good conscience permit that party access to its jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d Id., 784 A.2d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">{\u00b6 33} One significant difference exists between the cited cases and the present case. In <em>Boston </em>and <em>Gruber, </em>courts in both states entered orders relating to custody, neither one deferring to the other or finding that it did not have jurisdiction. In the case sub judice, however, the trial court found that it did <em>not </em>have jurisdiction to enter a custody order. And under our standard of review, this was a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">{\u00b6 34} One case from this district also lends some guidance here. In <em>In re Sklenchar, </em>7th Dist. No. 04-MA-55, 2004-Ohio-4405, 2004 WL 1874572, the father moved to Alabama with the parties\u2019 children. Eight months later, the mother, who was still in Ohio, filed a motion for custody. The father later filed a divorce complaint in Alabama. The Alabama court granted the father a divorce and granted him custody of the children. Subsequently, the trial court in Ohio determined that it did not have jurisdiction over the children and that the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>had already been adjudicated in Alabama. The mother appealed, arguing in part 'that Ohio, not Alabama, was the home state.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 35} In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, this court pointed out that the parties had equal rights to their children and the father\u2019s relocation to Alabama was not contrary to any Ohio order. In fact, there was never an Ohio custody order in place. Id. at \u00b6 49, 52. We also noted that the father had had physical custody of the children for several years and the mother did not request custody or visitation until eight months after the father and children moved to Alabama. Id. at \u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 36} In <em>Sklenchar, </em>there was no custody order in place, and appellee\u2019s move to Florida was not against any Ohio court order. Additionally, as was the case in <em>Sklenchar, </em>appellee here has had physical custody of the children since she left appellant in 2005. And it was not until November 2008 that appellant filed the divorce action seeking custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 37} Appellant testified at the divorce hearing that he was unaware of the fact that appellee was going to leave Ohio with the children. And he testified that he tried to locate them but was unsuccessful. However, he also admitted that once he received an address for them in Florida, he never attempted to go there to visit his children or track them down. And he offers no explanation why he waited three years to initiate any attempt to seek custody or visitation with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 38} Given the above considerations, we cannot conclude that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably in determining that it did not have jurisdiction to issue a custody award in this case. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 39} For the reasons stated above, the trial court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-11\">Waite and DeGenaro, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
