Wise, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Mark D. Tennant, appeals the decision of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, which granted appellee Melissa F. Martin-Auer\u2019s motion to modify child support. The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">{\u00b6 2} On April 16, 2001, the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, issued a judgment entry of parentage concerning the minor child K.M., born to appellee in 1999. The court therein accepted appellant\u2019s acknowledgement of paternity of K.M. and established a parenting-time schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">{\u00b6 3} On December 11, 2001, the court issued a judgment entry setting appellant\u2019s child support obligation at $456.88 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-16\">{\u00b6 4} In early 2007, appellee relocated with the child to the nation of Germany. No notice of relocation was provided to the court. Appellant responded with several motions to the court, including a request to reallocate parental rights and a motion for contempt due to appellee\u2019s alleged denial of visitation prior to the move to Germany.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>{\u00b6 5} On June 1, 2007, a magistrate\u2019s decision was filed, which found appellee in contempt for attempting to restrict appellant\u2019s parenting times and continued the matter of determining the appropriate support amount. On August 8, 2007, a judgment entry was filed approving the magistrate\u2019s decision and granting appellant long-distance parenting times in accordance with Licking County\u2019s Loc.R. 19. The matter of child support was deferred for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">{\u00b6 6} On June 17, 2008, a magistrate\u2019s decision was filed in which the court allowed a $2,500 deviation in support due to the travel cost to Germany for visitation, resulting in a support obligation of $62.63 per month. This magistrate\u2019s decision was journalized into a judgment entry filed on July 10, 2008, in which the court stated: \u201cIt would be unjust and unreasonable and not in the best interest of the child to require the second petitioner to pay the guideline amount of support given the child\u2019s relocation to Germany. * * *. This deviation is determined to be fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the child.\u201d After allowing for the deviation, child support was set at $62.63 per month, plus processing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">{\u00b6 7} On March 9, 2009, appellee filed a motion to modify child support. On March 31, 2009, the motion was heard by a different magistrate. On August 3, 2009, the magistrate issued a decision that, inter alia, removed the court\u2019s previously granted support deviation. The magistrate found that although appellant had set aside money in a savings account to travel to Germany, he could not secure consecutive days off from his employer to exercise his parenting time. Therefore, the magistrate recommended that the deviation factor be removed and that appellant pay full guideline support of $429.60 per month. In addition, the magistrate did not impute any income to appellee on the support worksheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">{\u00b6 8} After obtaining transcripts, appellant filed objections on September 4, 2009. Appellant submitted three specific objections to the court: (1) the deviation factor should not have been removed, (2) appellee\u2019s income should have been imputed at the Ohio minimum wage, and (3) the court should have set a specific parenting time schedule. Appellee did not respond to the objections. On September 17, 2009, an opinion of the court was filed that denied the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">{\u00b6 9} The court\u2019s decision was journalized into a judgment entry filed on October 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">{\u00b6 10} On November 3, 2009, appellant filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He raises the following five assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201cI. Because the party that violated the relocation law carries the financial burden to return the child to the jurisdiction of the court for parenting time, the trial court abused its discretion in removing a child support deviation where said party moved the child out of the United States without notice or permission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cII. Because a motion to modify support cannot be used as a substitute for an appeal, the trial court abused its discretion in removing a child support deviation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIII. The trial court abused its discretion in not making any specific parenting time orders or arrangements considering the circumstances of long distance travel, thereby effectively cutting appellant off from any visitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIV. The trial court abused its discretion by not imputing any income to appellee on the child support worksheet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">I and II</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">{\u00b6 15} In his first and second assignments of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in removing the downward deviation of his child-support obligation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 541 N.E.2d 1028, the Ohio Supreme Court determined that the abuse-of-discretion standard is the appropriate standard of review in matters concerning child support. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Furthermore, as an appellate court, we are not the trier of fact. Our role is to determine whether there is relevant, competent, and credible evidence upon which the factfinder could base his or her judgment. <em>Cross Truck v. Jeffries </em>(Feb. 10, 1982), Stark App. No. CA-5758, 1982 WL 2911. The trier of fact is in a far better position to observe the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and weigh their credibility. See, e.g., <em>Taralla v. Taralla, </em>Tuscarawas App. No. 2005 AP 02 0018, 2005-Ohio-6767, 2005 WL 3484130, \u00b6 31, citing <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 3119.22 provides that if the court deviates from the child-support guidelines, it shall enter in the journal the amount of child support calculated pursuant to the basic child-support schedule and the applicable worksheet, plus its determination that the amount would be unjust or inappropriate and would not be in the best interest of the child, and findings of fact supporting its determination. See also <em>Marker v. Grimm </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 139, 601 N.E.2d 496, paragraph three of the syllabus. A trial court abuses its discretion if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>it orders a deviation that is not supported by findings of fact journalized in the record. <em>Moore v. Moore, </em>Guernsey App. No. 09 CA 21, 2010-Ohio-2499, 2010 WL 2225592, \u00b6 86, citing <em>DePalmo v. DePalmo </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 535, 538, 679 N.E.2d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant first argues that the trial court should not have removed its earlier downward deviation, which had been granted due to visitation travel costs, emphasizing that appellee had taken the child to Germany without filing a relocation notice with the court and without any discussion or agreement with appellant to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant directs us to <em>Kemp v. Kemp, </em>Stark App. No. 2009CA00035, 2009-Ohio-6089, 2009 WL 3838256, in which we found a deviation for travel costs to be within the court\u2019s discretion when the child had been relocated from Ohio. Appellant also cites <em>Corple v. Corple </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 31, 702 N.E.2d 1234, which involved a mother\u2019s appeal of an order that she be required to transport the minor child from Tennessee to East Liverpool, Ohio, every time the child had a three-day weekend from school. Although <em>Corple </em>does not technically discuss the issue of deviation from the child-support worksheet, the court reasoned that \u201c[i]t is not unreasonable for appellant to assume responsibility for the increased travel obligations arising from her relocation * * Id. at 36, 702 N.E.2d 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">{\u00b6 20} In the case sub judice, the trial court rationalized that appellant should not receive a lower support obligation based on travel requirements that were not being actualized. We are not persuaded that Kemp and Corple require reversal of this decision reached by the trial court. Moreover, under these circumstances, the added strain between the parents resulting from appellee\u2019s overseas move need not be remedied by lessening the child\u2019s financial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">{\u00b621} Appellant secondly contends that the trial court erroneously allowed appellee to obtain a modification, suggesting that this was the equivalent of allowing a motion to be used as a substitute for an appeal. However, in DePalmo, the Ohio Supreme Court held that in a cas\u00e9 where a support order already exists, the only test for determining whether child support shall be modified is the 10 percent threshold set forth in R.C. 3113.215(B)(4) (now R.C. 3119.79). In the case sub judice, the new support figure of $429.60 per month is clearly more than 10 percent greater than the amount of child support required to be paid under the prior order of $62.63 per month (see R.C. 3119.79(A)). We thus find no error in the trial court\u2019s finding of a change in circumstances warranting a modification of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ill</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">{\u00b6 23} In his third assignment of error, appellant maintains that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to modify the parties\u2019 parenting-time (visitation) orders. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant essentially asserts that because the trial court modified the child-support order, \u201cit must make a reciprocal modification of the parenting time order.\u201d Appellant provides no statutory or case authority for this assertion, which is inconsistent with the principle in Ohio that child-support obligations are separate and distinct from visitation issues. See, e.g., <em>Porter v. Ferrall, </em>Portage App. No. 2002-P-0109, 2003-Ohio-6685, 2003 WL 22931383, \u00b6 22, citing <em>Davis v. Davis </em>(1988), 55 Ohio App.3d 196, 563 N.E.2d 320. Furthermore, the record before us indicates that appellant did not file a motion to review parenting time in response to appellee\u2019s motion to modify child support. Under the invited-error doctrine, a party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error that he himself invited or induced. <em>He v. Zeng, </em>Licking App. No. 2003CA00056, 2004-Ohio-2434, 2004 WL 1077912, \u00b6 13, citing <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 493, 709 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">{\u00b6 25} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">{\u00b6 26} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in faffing to impute income to appellee on the child-support worksheet. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">{\u00b6 27} The imputation of income is a matter to be determined by the trial court based upon the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Rock v. Cabral </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 108, 616 N.E.2d 218, paragraph one of the syllabus. A determination with respect to these matters will be reversed only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. Id. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore, 5 </em>Ohio St.3d at 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">{\u00b628} R.C. 3119.01(C)(5) defines \u201cincome,\u201d for purposes of calculating child support, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(5) \u2018Income\u2019 means either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-12\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(a) For a parent who is employed to full capacity, the gross income of the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-13\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(b) For a parent who is unemployed or underemployed, the sum of the gross income of the parent and any potential income of the parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>{\u00b6 32} In turn, R.C. 3119.01(0(11) defines \u201cpotential income\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c \u2018Potential income\u2019 means both of the following for a parent who the court pursuant to a court support order, or a child support enforcement agency pursuant to an administrative child support order, determines is voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(a) Imputed income that the court or agency determines the parent would have earned if fully employed as determined from the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(i) The parent\u2019s prior employment experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(ii) The parent\u2019s education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(iii) The parent\u2019s physical and mental disabilities, if any;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-10\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(iv) The availability of employment in the geographic area in which the parent resides;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-11\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(v) The prevailing wage and salary levels in the geographic area in which the parent resides;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-12\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(vi) The parent\u2019s special skills and training;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-13\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(vii) Whether there is evidence that the parent has the ability to earn the imputed income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-14\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(viii) The age and special needs of the child for whom child support is being calculated under this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-15\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(ix) The parent\u2019s increased earning capacity because of experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-16\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c(x) Any other relevant factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-17\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(b) Imputed income from any nonincome-producing assets of a parent, as determined from the local passbook savings rate or another appropriate rate as determined by the court or agency, not to exceed the rate of interest specified in division (A) of section 1343.03 of the Revised Code, if the income is significant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">{\u00b6 46} It appears from the record that the trial court was reluctant to impute income to appellee in the absence of further proof of wage rates in Germany and currency conversion rates between the two nations. As such geographically based information is part of the statutory criteria for the imputation of income, we are unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-19\">{\u00b6 47} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-20\">{\u00b6 48} For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, Licking County, Ohio, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-21\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Gwin, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b810-5\">Hoffman, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-10\">.

Hoffman, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4p\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">{\u00b6 49} I concur in the majority\u2019s analysis and disposition of appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">{\u00b6 50} I generally concur in the majority\u2019s analysis and disposition of appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error. My only disagreement concerns the figures used by the majority to determine in \u00b6 21 whether the 10 percent threshold test has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">{\u00b6 51} I believe that the appropriate comparison as to whether a 10 percent deviation exists should be between the new guideline amount and the previous guideline amount, not the previous deviated amount. In the case sub judice, the previous guideline amount established in the July 10, 2008 support order was $270.97 per month. When comparing that amount to the present guideline amount, the 10 percent threshold test is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">{\u00b6 52} That is not to suggest that the failure to incur the travel expenses that precipitated the previous downward deviation, standing alone, cannot be considered in determining whether the 10 percent threshold has been satisfied. Such a fact can and should be considered in arriving at the new guideline amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">{\u00b6 53} In the case sub judice, not only did appellant fail to incur the anticipated travel expenses that had resulted in the downward deviation from the prior guideline amount, but also appellant\u2019s income had significantly increased. As does the majority, I find that the 10 percent threshold has been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">{\u00b6 54} I concur in judgment only as to the majority\u2019s disposition of appellant\u2019s third assignment of error. I am not convinced that child-support obligations are necessarily separate and distinct from visitation issues. The case sub judice serves as a case in point as the original downward deviation was based upon expenses anticipated to be incurred in exercising visitation. There may exist other visitation circumstances that would justify deviation from the child-support guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A3S\">.
