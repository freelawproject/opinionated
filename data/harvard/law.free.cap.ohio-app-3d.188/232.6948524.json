Powell, filed October 2, 2009. On July 21, 2007, Powell, who resided in Florida, was cited by the Fairborn Police Department for obstructing official business, criminal trespass, and voyeurism. Powell pleaded not guilty in Fair-born Municipal Court. On January 22, 2008, Powell filed a \u201cPlea of Not Guilty by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Reason of Insanity, and Suggestion of Incompetency to Stand Trial.\u201d Following a psychological examination, the trial court determined Powell competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 2} On June 9, 2008, when the matter was set for trial, Powell entered a plea of guilty to the charge of voyeurism, in violation of R.C. 2907.08(A), a misdemean- or of the third degree, in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining charges against him. The following exchange occurred at the hearing after Powell pleaded guilty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I would like to say, your Honor, I take full responsibility for my actions. I didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm. I guess the problem, I\u2019m dealing with it, and I\u2019m taking control of it now. I will continue to treat it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cTHE COURT: * * * Just so the record is clear, Ms. Deeds, the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney is here. Ms. Deeds, I know that you passed over some information as to definitions for sexual predators, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cMS. DEEDS: Your Honor, there have been some changes since \u2014 I\u2019m not sure when the changes were. They are fairly recent. Generally, I know in the municipal arena, there is not a requirement to register. There hadn\u2019t been a requirement to register unless there was a child victim. However, now, this Voyeurism misdemeanor comes under the heading of a Tier I offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Barbato, do you agree or disagree with that interpretation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cMR. BARBATO: My understanding of the registration requirements are, that it\u2019s either under the Tier I statute' \u2014 or it\u2019s either under the Tier I list of offenses or it is not. I don\u2019t have the schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cTHE COURT: It is stated as a Tier I. It lists specifically that Section 2907.08, which is the Voyeurism. Have you discussed that with your client at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cMR. BARBATO: No. Maybe while you\u2019re reviewing the statute there, I might take a minute to talk to him about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cTHE COURT: We\u2019ll go off the record for a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-15\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cTHE COURT: We\u2019re back on the record. Mr. Barbato * * * I know you\u2019ve had a chance to talk to Mr. Powell. Did that change anything for today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-16\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cMR. BARBATO: Thank you, you Honor, for giving me that opportunity. Mr. Powell tells me, he is prepared to go forward with his plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand, Mr. Powell, you\u2019ll be labeled as a sex offender? You would have a duty to register and report to the sheriff of the county where you reside. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 16} The municipal court sentenced Powell to two years of unsupervised probation and designated him a Tier I sex offender. Powell signed an \u201cExplanation of Duties to Register as a Sex Offender or a Child Victim Offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 17} On March 12, 2009, the court issued an entry terminating Powell\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">{\u00b6 18} On April 28, 2009, Powell filed a pro se \u201cPetition for Relief of Sexual Offender Classification.\u201d On June 17, 2009, Powell filed an \u201cAddendum to 1st Petition,\u201d also pro se, that is further entitled, \u201cMotion for Post-Conviction Relief,\u201d in which Powell asserted among other things that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that he was not subject to the classification and registration requirements of Senate Bill 10 (\u201cS.B. 10\u201d). According to Powell, a violation of R.C. 2907.08(A) was a \u201cregistration-exempt sexually oriented offense prior to S.B. 10.\u201d On July 10, 2009, the trial court issued a judgment entry deeming Powell\u2019s filings to be \u201ca request to vacate defendant\u2019s plea,\u201d and a hearing was held on August 4, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">{\u00b6 19} At the hearing, Powell was represented by new counsel, and he argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his plea hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Powell gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. * * * Rion, Rion and Rion told me from day one that all my charges were misdemeanors and * * * it would be my first conviction, the only thing I would probably get is Probation and a fine. I came here for the initial plea, and I believe it was Keri who was here, and she told me that the Prosecutor agreed to drop Voyeurism if I pled to Obstruction of Justice (sic) and Criminal Trespass. She also told me that because all of them are misdemeanors and it can\u2019t get any worse, she recommended me to keep on going, to try to get a dismissal on some type of mental health docket. So, because she is my attorney, I said, Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThen, I came back up here * * * I believe it was January 22nd for another hearing. And this time * * * nobody showed up. Me and my wife were standing out here for about two hours, and somebody came up to us and said we can go home because Rion, Rion and Rion filed some kind of document. So, me and my wife was leaving, and I called Rion, Rion and Rion up to ask them what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>was going on, and they said they filed some kind of paperwork so I could take a psychological evaluation, to see if I have some kind of sexual addiction. And I said, Okay, because they was doing it to see if I could get a mental docket and try to get the charges dismissed. And I said, Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cBut when I came back over to take the psychological evaluation, the doctor told me I was there to see if I was competent to stand trial, which, to me, didn\u2019t make any sense. I thought they were my attorneys. I thought maybe it is proper procedure. I didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cSo the third time we came up here, it was Matt Barbato, and I was talking to him in the lobby and just briefly going over my case. He didn\u2019t know anything about it. He told me the same thing. They are all misdemeanors; I\u2019ll probably get Probation and a fine. It is my first conviction; I\u2019ll probably get Probation and a fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThen, he came to me and said the Prosecutor said she agreed for Voyeurism and she would drop the other two charges. I asked him, What would happen. He said probably just Probation and a f\u00edne. I could live with that, if that was the only case. But we came in here and I pled to the charges, and that\u2019s when the Judge told me I have to register as a sex offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cNow, Rion, Rion and Rion were my attorneys for 11 months. That was the first time I even heard about this. I\u2019m not originally from Ohio, so I\u2019m thinking, if I pay an attorney, they should tell me everything about my case. I\u2019m from Florida. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cSo, I was devastated when the Judge said I had to register as a sex offender, because I couldn\u2019t believe it. At the end, Matt Barbato, he told me, It\u2019s still a misdemeanor. After I do my probation, I can wait a year and have everything cleared. At that time, I\u2019m thinking, Okay, maybe a year, year and a half, I could probably deal with that. So I went back home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cAfter I start doing my own research, I found out, no, you got to wait 15 years. That is something totally different than waiting a year. Throughout the whole entire case, for the whole 11 months, through my own research, a lot of things Rion, Rion and Rion didn\u2019t tell me that they should have. There\u2019s a lot of things that, from the initial plea, I would have took the initial plea if they would have told me, If you take Voyeurism, you have to register as a sex offender. That is something totally different than Probation and paying a fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe military said, okay, they agreed, it\u2019s only a misdemeanor, you can keep your military career. But when I had to register as a sex offender, they was like, No, we can\u2019t have officers on the sex offender registry. So I got discharged from the military * * * I come here and I have people coming up to me thinking I\u2019m a rapist, and that\u2019s not the case. I would never hurt anybody. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>And from somebody thinking I\u2019m a rapist, I mean that really affected me and that hurt me a lot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">{\u00b6 29} On August 12, 2009, Powell filed a \u201cMemorandum in Support of Motion to Vacate Judgment (re transcript of 6/9/08),\u201d and the state filed memorandum contra. Powell filed a second memorandum on August 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 30} On August 31, 2009, the trial court issued a judgment entry overruling Powell\u2019s request to vacate his plea. The court determined in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cDefendant argues that he was not properly represented and that his counsel was ineffective. Defendant does acknowledge that a conviction for the offense of voyeurism does require registering as a sex offender for 15 years. However, he argues that he did not know that at the time of pleading and sentencing due to ineffective counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe Court notes that prior to the acceptance of defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the Court inquired of the defendant as to whether he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s advice and the defendant indicated, \u2018yes.\u2019 The Court further inquired as to whether defendant understood that by pleading guilty it was a complete admission of guilt to the charge. Defendant again stated, \u2018yes.\u2019 The Court acknowledges that prior to the plea it did not advise the defendant of the labeling of defendant as a sexual offender or of his duty to register. However, during the sentencing portion that was discussed and the Court allowed defendant extra time to talk with his attorney while the court also reviewed the new requirements. Upon returning to the courtroom, defendant\u2019s counsel thanked the Court for giving him the opportunity to discuss the matter with his client and informed the Court that defendant wished to go forward with his plea. The Court specifically asked the defendant, \u2018Do you understand, Mr. Powell, you will be labeled as a sex offender? You would have a duty to register and report to the sheriff of the county where you reside. Do you understand that?\u2019 And the defendant replied, \u2018yes.\u2019 Also, the same day defendant signed a form entitled \u2018Explanation of Duties to Register as a Sex Offender or Child Victim Offender, Duties commencing on or after January 1, 2008.\u2019 This form specifically explained that defendant would be labeled as a Tier I sex offender, a fact which the Court also advised defendant. * * * Defendant signed and dated the form June 9, 2008. Taking in tandem all notice requirements signed by defendant on the day of sentencing as well as the Court allowing defendant time to talk to his counsel about the sex offender status, the Court finds the defendant has not met his burden of establishing manifest injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">{\u00b6 33} Powell asserts one assignment of error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cAppellant\u2019s conviction for voyeurism included elements of ineffective assistance of counsel, miscarriage of justice, manifest injustice, and bad faith. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Sentenced as sexual offender was in violation of the U.S. Constitution Art. 1, Sec. 9 and 10, the Ohio Constitution, Article III, Sec. 28, and R.C. 2950.011.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 35} While Powell appeals from the denial of his petition to vacate his plea, he makes other arguments in his brief that are not contained in the above assigned error. For example, in addition to his arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel and his improper classification, Powell asserts that the statute prescribing the statute of limitations for a legal-malpractice action is vague and that the victim herein did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. These arguments are not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cCrim.R. 32.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c 'A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe distinction between presentence and post-sentence motions to withdraw pleas of guilty or no contest indulges a presumption that post-sentence motions may be motivated by a desire to obtain relief from a sentence the movant believes is unduly harsh and was unexpected. The presumption is nevertheless rebuttable by showing of a manifest injustice affecting the plea. @A \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d comprehends a fundamental flaw in the path of justice so extraordinary that the defendant could not have sought redress from the resulting prejudice through another form of application reasonably available to him or her.\u2019 <em>State v. Hartzell </em>(Aug. 20, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17499[, 1999 WL 957746]. The movant has the burden to demonstrate that a manifest injustice occurred.\u201d <em>State v. Brooks, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23385, 2010-Ohio-1682, 2010 WL 1511492, \u00b6 6-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cWe review the alleged instances of ineffective assistance of trial counsel under the two prong analysis set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, and adopted by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. Pursuant to those cases, trial counsel is entitled to a strong presumption that his or her conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688[, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674]. To reverse a conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel, it must be demonstrated that trial counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that his errors were serious enough to create a reasonable probability that, but for the errors, the result of the trial would have been different. Id. Hindsight is not permitted to distort the assessment of what was reasonable in light of counsel\u2019s perspective at the time, and a debatable decision concerning trial strategy cannot form the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>basis of a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21957, 2008-Ohio-493, 2008 WL 344149, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 40} S.B. 10 amended the sex offender registration and notification requirements set forth in R.C. Chapter 2950, and it became effective January 1, 2008. S.B. 10 implemented a three-tiered system in which a sex offender\u2019s classification is determined based upon the offense of conviction. Currently, a \u201c \u2018Tier I sex offender/child-victim offender\u2019 means * * * a sex offender who is convicted of, pleads guilty to, has been convicted of, or has pleaded guilty to any of the following sexually oriented offenses: (a) A violation of section * * * 2907.08 * * * of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 2950.01(E)(1)(a). R.C. 2950.04(A)(2) provides, \u201cRegardless of when the sexually oriented offense was committed, each offender who is convicted of, plead guilty to, has been convicted of, or has pleaded guilty to a sexually oriented offense shall comply with the * * * registration requirements described in divisions (A)(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">{\u00b6 41} The version of R.C. Chapter 2950.01 in effect at the time of Powell\u2019s offense, however, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(D)

registration-exempt sexually oriented offense, if a court does not issue an order under section 2950.021 * * * of the Revised Code that removes the presumptive exemption and subjects the offender who was convicted of or pleaded guilty to the offense to registration under section 2950.04 of the Revised Code and all other duties and responsibilities generally imposed under this chapter upon persons who are convicted of or plead guilty to any sexually oriented offense other than a presumption registration-exempt sexually oriented offense * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 52} R.C. 2950.021, which was repealed by S.B. 10, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c(A) If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to, * * * any presumptive registration-exempt sexually oriented offense, the court that is imposing sentence on the offender for that offense * * * may determine, prior to imposing the sentence or making the disposition, that the offender should be subjected to registration under section 2950.04 of the Revised Code and all other duties and responsibilities generally imposed under this chapter upon persons who are convicted of or plead guilty to any sexually oriented offense other than a presumptive registration-exempt sexually oriented offense * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c(B) If a court determines under division (A) of this section that an offender who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a presumptive registration-exempt sexually oriented offense should be subjected to registration under section 2950.04 of the Revised Code and all other duties and responsibilities generally imposed under this chapter upon persons who are convicted of or plead guilty to any sexually oriented offense other than a presumptive registration-exempt sexually oriented offense * * * all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c(1) The Court shall issue an order that contains its determination and that removes the presumptive exemption from registration for the sexually oriented offense, shall include the order in the offender\u2019s sentence * * * and shall enter the order in the record in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c(2) Regarding an offender, the presumptive exemption from registration is terminated, and the offender is subject to registration under section R.C. 2950.04 of the Revised Code and all other duties and responsibilities generally imposed under this chapter upon persons who are convicted of or plead guilty to any sexually oriented offense other than a presumptive registration-exempt sexually oriented offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">{\u00b6 57} Finally, R.C. 2950.011 provides, \u201cExcept as specifically provided to the contrary in sections 2950.02 to 2950.99 of the Revised Code, all references in any of those sections to \u2018sexually oriented offense\u2019 include, in addition to the violations specified in division (A) of section 2950.01 of the Revised Code on and after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>January 1, 2008, any sexually oriented offense, as that term was defined in section 2950.01 of the Revised Code prior to January 1, 2008, that was committed prior to that date <em>and that was not a registration exempt sexually oriented offense, </em>as that term was defined in that section prior to January 1, 2008.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">{\u00b6 58} Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we conclude that a manifest injustice is shown. Powell testified that this was his first conviction, and the victim herein was not a minor. Powell received ineffective assistance of counsel in that he was not advised that voyeurism was a registration-exempt sexually oriented offense, absent a separate order by the court removing the presumptive exemption. Further, the record is unrebutted that counsel for Powell, who was ill-prepared, misled Powell by advising him that the registration was subject to expungement within a brief period. Finally, the trial court erred in designating Powell a Tier I sex offender subject to registration without first complying with R.C. 2950.021. Accordingly, prejudice is demonstrated. Powell\u2019s plea is hereby vacated, and the matter is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-6\">Fain and Kline, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b275-7\">Roger L.
