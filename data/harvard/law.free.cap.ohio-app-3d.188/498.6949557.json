All counts carried a specification that Keeney had previously been convicted of burglary. After a bench trial, Keeney was acquitted of rape and one count of felonious assault. He was found guilty of one count of felonious assault and was sentenced to eight to 15 years\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>{\u00b6 2} In 1996, the Ohio legislature enacted Am.Sub.H.B. No. 180 (\u201cMegan\u2019s Law\u201d), which rewrote Ohio\u2019s sex-offender registration statutes contained in R.C. Chapter 2950. Megan\u2019s Law became effective in 1997. Pursuant to Megan\u2019s Law, offenders who had committed a sexually oriented offense that was not registration-exempt were labeled a sexually oriented offender, a habitual sexual offender, or a sexual predator based upon the crime committed and the findings made by the trial court at a sexual-offender classification hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 3} Under the Megan\u2019s Law\u2019s version of R.C. 2950.01(D)(3), felonious assault was a sexually oriented offense when it was committed \u201cwith a purpose to gratify the sexual needs or desires of the offender.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Former R.C. 2950.09(C)(1) provided, \u201cIf a person was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a sexually oriented offense prior to January 1, 1997, if the person was not sentenced for the offense on or after January 1, 1997, and if, on or after January 1, 1997, the offender is serving a term of imprisonment in a state correctional institution, prior to the offender\u2019s release from the term of imprisonment, the department of rehabilitation and correction shall determine whether to recommend that the offender be adjudicated as being a sexual predator.\u201d The department of rehabilitation and correction was required to notify the trial court of its recommendation that an offender be labeled a sexual predator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court could deny the recommendation without a hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the court found that the offender was not a sexual predator, the court was required to determine whether the offender was a habitual sexual offender.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An offender who had committed a sexually oriented offense but was not classified as a sexual predator or a habitual sexual offender was designated a sexually oriented offender by operation of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 4} On July 13, 2001, the trial court entered an order in Keeney\u2019s criminal case captioned \u201cEntry Finding Defendant Is Not a Sexual Predator; Finding Defendant Is Not a Habitual Sex Offender.\u201d The entry stated, \u201cThis matter came before this Court for sexual predator determination to be made pursuant to Section 2950.09. Based on the information provided by the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Corrections, and without a hearing, the Court hereby determines that [Keeney] IS NOT a sexual predator.\u201d The court also determined that Keeney had no prior conviction for a sexually oriented offense and, therefore, that he was not a habitual sexual offender. At some point, presumably upon his release from incarceration, Keeney was instructed by \u201cthe State of Ohio\u201d to register under former R.C. Chapter 2950 annually for ten years as a sexually oriented offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">{\u00b6 5} In 2007, the General Assembly enacted Am.Sub.S.B. No. 10 (\u201cSenate Bill 10\u201d) to implement the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. Senate Bill 10 provides that offenders who have committed sexually oriented offenses that are not registration-exempt are to be placed in tiers based solely on the offense committed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under Senate Bill 10, felonious assault is a sexually oriented offense when it is committed with a sexual motivation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An offense is committed with a sexual motivation when it is committed with the purpose to gratify the sexual needs or desires of the offender.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 6} Keeney was notified that he had been reclassified under Senate Bill 10 as a Tier III sex offender and that he was required to register with the local sheriff every 90 days for life.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Keeney filed an R.C. 2950.031(E) petition to contest his reclassification, challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 10. He also filed an R.C. 2950.11(F)(2) motion for immediate relief from the community-notification provisions. The trial court overruled Keeney\u2019s constitutional challenges to Senate Bill 10 and denied his R.C. 2950.031(E) petition. The court granted Keeney\u2019s R.C. 2950.11(F)(2) motion, exempting him from the community-notification provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 7} Keeney has appealed, raising six assignments of error that challenge the constitutionality of Senate Bill 10. Keeney first argues that he was acquitted of rape and, therefore, that the offense of felonious assault for which he was convicted in 1986 did not contain a \u201csexual motivation\u201d element. Keeney argues that his felonious assault did not qualify as a sexually oriented offense because there was never a finding that his crime had been committed with a sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>motivation. Because he has never been convicted of a sexually oriented offense, Keeney argues, he cannot be required to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 2950.01(B)(1) defines \u201csex offender\u201d as a person who has been convicted of a sexually oriented offense. Felonious assault is a \u201csexually oriented offense\u201d only when it is committed with a sexual motivation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether an assault was committed with a sexual motivation, i.e., whether it was committed with a purpose to gratify the sexual needs or desires of the offender, is a question of fact that depends for its resolution on the circumstances surrounding the offense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A hearing may be required where there is an issue of fact as to whether an offense was committed with a sexual motivation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The burden is on the state to prove by clear and convincing evidence that an offense was committed with a sexual motivation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 9} At the hearing on Keeney\u2019s R.C. 2950.031(E) petition, the state argued that the entry of July 13, 2001, constituted a finding by the previous trial court that Keeney was a sexually oriented offender and, therefore, that he had committed felonious assault with a sexual motivation. In overruling Keeney\u2019s R.C. 2950.031(E) petition, the trial court accepted the state\u2019s argument and found that the previous trial court had found Keeney to be a sexually oriented offender. But the entry of July 13, 2001, did not constitute a determination by the previous trial court that Keeney was a sexually oriented offender or that his offense was committed with a sexual motivation. The entry merely stated that Keeney was not a sexual predator or a habitual sexual offender. It made no statement as to whether Keeney was a sexually oriented offender or whether his offense had been committed with a sexual motivation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 10} A review of the record reveals that there has never been a judicial determination that Keeney\u2019s offense was committed with a sexual motivation. No hearing was held to address the question whether Keeney committed his crime for the purpose of gratifying his sexual needs or desires. The record before this court does not indicate that Keeney has been convicted of a sexually oriented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>offense. Therefore, he is not required to register as a sex offender under R.C. Chapter 2950.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">{\u00b6 11} The assignments of error are sustained solely for the reasons set forth in this decision. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and Keeney is hereby discharged from any duty to register as a sex offender under R.C. Chapter 2950.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b537-6\">Sundermann and Hendon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-15\">.
