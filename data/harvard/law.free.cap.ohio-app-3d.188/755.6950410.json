For the reasons that follow, the trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">{\u00b6 2} Guy and Linda Hocker were divorced in 2001 after 26 years of marriage. Mr. Hocker worked at Delphi during much of the marriage. With respect to the division of retirement benefits, the final judgment and decree of divorce provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-11\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c15. <em>RETIREMENT. </em>A Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) will issue to the Delphi Investment Security Plan (ISP) through Fidelity Investments wherein the Wife will receive one-half <em>Qk) </em>of the amount as of September 13, 2001, as well as any interest and accretions thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-12\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cFurther, a second QDRO will issue to the Delphi Personal Savings Plan (PSP), also managed by Fidelity Investments, wherein the Wife will receive one-half <em>Qk) </em>of the value of the PSP as of September 13, 2001, as well [sic] any interest and accretions thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-13\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cFurther, a QDRO will issue to the Plan Administrator at Delphi for the Husband\u2019s Retirement Plan, as well as any interest and accretions thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe formula that shall be utilized in said QDROs shall be as follows: The Wife shall receive one-half <em>($) </em>of the years of marriage (26 years) divided by the years of service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">{\u00b6 7} The decree also provided that Mr. Hocker would receive one-half of the amount vested in Mrs. Hocker\u2019s 401(K) plan as of September 13, 2001, and that Mr. Hocker would cooperate in Mrs. Hocker\u2019s purchase of a life insurance policy on his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">{\u00b6 8} A stipulated qualified-domestic-relations order was approved by the trial court on April 15, 2003. The QDRO provided that Mrs. Hocker (the alternate payee) would receive 50 percent of the marital portion of Mr. Hocker\u2019s (the participant\u2019s) \u201caccrued benefits\u201d under the retirement plan. However, the Delphi pension-plan administrator subsequently rejected the QDRO on the ground that the administrator could not understand the amount of benefits to be paid to Mrs. Hocker. Mrs. Hocker submitted a second QDRO, which Mr. Hocker refused to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">{\u00b6 9} In September 2004, Mrs. Hocker filed a motion for clarification of the divorce decree, particularly whether her interest in Mr. Hocker\u2019s retirement benefits included a share of supplemental benefits, such as early retirement and survivorship benefits. The magistrate held a hearing, at which Mr. Hocker testified that he understood that Mrs. Hocker would receive one-half of his basic retirement benefits, and Mrs. Hocker testified, in essence, that half of Mr. Hocker\u2019s supplemental benefits should have been included in her benefits. The magistrate refused to allow certain testimony from John Bosse, a financial consultant who had been hired by Mr. Hocker and who had drafted the original QDRO, as to the parties\u2019 discussions during the divorce proceedings about Mr. Hocker\u2019s retirement plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">{\u00b6 10} The magistrate sustained Mrs. Hocker\u2019s motion to clarify the final judgment and decree of divorce and ordered Mrs. Hocker to prepare an amended QDRO \u201cwhich will specify and divide all of [Mr. Hocker\u2019s] accrued defined pension benefits, including basic and supplemental benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">{\u00b6 11} Mr. Hocker filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, but the trial court overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. In April 2007, Mr. Hocker filed his first notice of appeal. <em>Hocker v. Hocker, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21559.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">{\u00b6 12} In his first appeal, Mr. Hocker challenged the modification of the QDRO because the trial court had failed to reserve jurisdiction to do so, and he challenged the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow Bosse to testify about the parties\u2019 negotiations prior to agreeing on the terms of the final divorce decree. We agreed with his arguments in part and rejected them in part. <em>Hocker v. Hocker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>171 Ohio App.3d 279, 2007-Ohio-1671, 870 N.E.2d 736. With respect to the clarification of the prior order, we held that <em>\u201ca </em>trial court has broad discretion to clarify ambiguous language * * * by considering the intent of the parties and the equities involved.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 25, citing <em>Gearhart v. Gearhart </em>(Nov. 19, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17725, 1999 WL 1043894. Thus, we concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in finding that the original QDRO language was ambiguous as to whether it included early retirement benefits, interim benefits, and survivor benefits and had acted within its authority to sustain the motion for clarification, to conduct hearings on the parties\u2019 intent, and to make an equitable division of the pension. Id. at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 13} We also concluded, however, that the trial court had erred in excluding Bosse\u2019s testimony, because it was not offered to prove or disprove the validity of Mrs. Hocker\u2019s claim. Rather, it was offered to assist the trier of fact in assessing the value of the pension and whether, equitably and intentionally, it included supplemental benefits, and to explain why a life insurance policy on Mr. Hocker\u2019s life was proposed during the divorce negotiations. (Mr. Hocker claimed that Mrs. Hocker \u201cforfeited\u201d her claim to survivor benefits and early retirement subsidies in exchange for a life insurance policy he \u201cagreed to create\u201d for Mrs. Hocker, although Mrs. Hocker was to pay for the policy.) We affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 14} After the matter was remanded, Mr. Hocker filed a motion to correct a clerical error, pursuant to Civ.R. 60(A). He contended that the provision in the divorce decree which provided that he would cooperate with the purchase by Mrs. Hocker of a life insurance policy on his life had been negotiated in exchange for any right of Mrs. Hocker to be designated as the beneficiary of survivorship benefits payable under the Delphi retirement plan. He sought to have the trial court correct the judgment to reflect this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 15} Mrs. Hocker filed a motion in limine to limit the testimony at a new hearing to that offered by Bosse, whose testimony Mr. Hocker had sought to offer at the prior hearing, and to exclude the testimony of Jeffrey Slyman, Mr. Hocker\u2019s attorney in the divorce proceedings. The magistrate reviewed the record of the proceedings and heard Bosse\u2019s testimony. The magistrate issued the requested order in limine with respect to Slyman\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 16} After considering Bosse\u2019s testimony, the magistrate concluded that it was not entitled to significant weight:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cMr. Bosse\u2019s recollection of the parties\u2019 negotiations in 2001 may be somewhat suspect. Although the divorce negotiations took place in 2001, the within hearing was six years later. The claim by Mr. Bosse that the parties agreed to divide <em>only </em>[Mr. Hocker\u2019s] \u2018accrued benefits\u2019 and not his \u2018total benefits\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>is not supported by the transcript of the hearing or the original QDRO prepared by Mr. Bosse one year later. The question is whether or not Mr. Bosse\u2019s recollections are more accurate six years following the negotiations than one year following negotiations. The issue here is not a mathematical or typographical error. This involves a substantive change in the QDRO document originally prepared by Mr. Bosse. According to [Mr.] Bosse, the issue of \u2018accrued\u2019 vs. \u2018total\u2019 benefits was discussed in detail and at length by the parties and their counsel. Yet, the agreement read into the record and acknowledged by both counsel and parties never defined the pension benefits as \u2018accrued\u2019 benefits. It is the finding of this magistrate that Mr. Bosse\u2019s testimony has not resulted in further clarification of the parties\u2019 motives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 18} The magistrate also found that the discussion of a life insurance policy had had no bearing on the pension negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 19} Mr. Hocker filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision in June 2008 and supplemental objections, with leave of court, in October 2008. These objections challenged the magistrate\u2019s decision not to allow Slyman to testify at the hearing, the substance of the decision about pension benefits, and the magistrate\u2019s refusal to \u201ccorrect\u201d the record regarding the purpose of the life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court \u201cthoroughly and independently reviewed the record,\u201d overruled Mr. Hocker\u2019s objections, and filed a decision and judgment consistent with the magistrate\u2019s conclusions. The trial court found that Bosse\u2019s recollections six years after the final hearing on the complaint for divorce were not supported by the evidence and that there was \u201cno credible evidence to support the allegation that the original QDRO did not reflect the agreement of the parties.\u201d The court concluded that all of Mr. Hocker\u2019s benefits from Delphi, including basic and supplemental benefits, should be divided equally in proportion to the term of the marriage. The court also found \u201cno support for the allegation that the [life insurance] policy was a \u2018trade\u2019 for the relinquishment by [Mrs. Hocker] of total benefits under the Delphi pension plan.\u201d The court ordered that an amended QDRO be filed in accordance with its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">{\u00b6 21} Mr. Hocker appeals, raising three assignments of error, which we will address in an order that facilitates our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">{\u00b6 22} The third assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s failure to grant appellant\u2019s motion to correct clerical error constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Mr. Hocker contends that the parties\u2019 agreement in the initial divorce proceedings, which was read into the record by Mrs. Hocker\u2019s attorney, demonstrated that \u201cin lieu of [Mrs. Hocker\u2019s] being entitled to receive any portion of the survivor annuity payable under the Delphi Retirement Plan she would instead be entitled to purchase a term life insurance policy on [Mr. Hocker\u2019s] life.\u201d By contrast, the final judgment and decree of divorce provided that Mrs. Hocker would be allowed to own a life insurance policy on Mr. Hocker \u201cto protect [her] interest in spousal support,\u201d that Mr. Hocker would cooperate in completing documents and physical examinations for this purpose, and that Mrs. Hocker would pay for the policy. Mr. Hocker claims that the trial court should have \u201ccorrected\u201d the judgment to clarify the purpose of the life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b6 25} Mr. Hocker relies on the following statement by Mrs. Hocker\u2019s attorney at the divorce hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe Wife is going to buy a policy, a term life insurance policy on the husband\u2019s life. He will \u2014 has signed up for the application today. He will cooperate, and take the physical. It is \u2014 because we can\u2019t do the SBP, because that one case came out. This is in order to insure that she receives her share of his retirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 27} Mr. Hocker claims that \u201cSBP\u201d refers to \u201c \u2018Survivor\u2019s Benefit Plan,\u201d \u201ca term used by the military retirement system but which has also come to be used by some as shorthand for survivor annuities paid pursuant to private pension plans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">{\u00b6 28} Civ.R. 60(A), upon which Mr. Hocker\u2019s motion was based, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cClerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time on its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cCiv.R. 60(A) permits a trial court, in its discretion, to correct clerical mistakes which are apparent on the record, but does not authorize a trial court to make substantive changes in judgments. * * * The term \u2018clerical mistake\u2019 refers to a mistake or omission, mechanical in nature and apparent on the record which does not involve a legal decision or judgment.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Litty v. Leskovyansky </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 97, 100, 671 N.E.2d 236; <em>Blust v. Lamar Advertising of Mobile, Inc., </em>183 Ohio App.3d 478, 2009-Ohio-3947, 917 N.E.2d 373, at \u00b6 20. Such \u201centries are limited in proper use to reflecting what the court actually decided, not what the court might or should have decided or what the court intended to decide.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Steiner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 158, 164, 656 N.E.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>{\u00b6 31} In a case cited with approval in <em>Leskovyansky, </em>the Ninth District Court of Appeals wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe basic distinction between clerical mistakes that can be corrected under Civ.R. 60(A) and substantive mistakes that cannot be corrected is that the former consists of \u2018blunders in execution\u2019 whereas the latter consists of instances where the court changes its mind, either because it made a legal or factual mistake in making its original determination, or because, on second thought, it has decided to exercise its discretion in a different manner.\u201d <em>Londrico v. Delores C. Knowlton, Inc. </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 282, 623 N.E.2d 723; <em>Blust </em>at \u00b6 21-22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">{\u00b6 33} Civ.R. 60(A) is not an appropriate means for the type of \u201ccorrection\u201d in the record that Mr. Hoeker sought. Mr. Hocker\u2019s motion required the trial court to interpret the parties\u2019 intent and the statement that was read into the record. Such a change cannot be fairly characterized as a \u201cmechanical\u201d correction that does not involve a legal decision or judgment. Civ.R. 60(A). What was meant by the attorney\u2019s reference to an \u201cSBP\u201d and her statement indicating that the parties \u201ccan\u2019t do the SBP\u201d is not apparent. Moreover, it is unclear how a life insurance policy which, according to the final decree, was to be paid for by Mrs. Hoeker, would \u201cinsure that she receives her share of his retirement.\u201d In other words, the attorney\u2019s statement on which Mr. Hoeker relies does not demonstrate what the parties intended to accomplish through the purchase of the life insurance policy or that the language contained in the divorce decree misrepresented the agreement of the parties. Therefore, a motion to clarify pursuant to Civ.R. 60(A) was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">{\u00b6 34} The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">{\u00b6 35} The first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s refusal to permit Jeffrey Slyman to testify constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">{\u00b6 37} Mr. Hoeker contends that on remand, the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of his original divorce attorney, Jeffrey Slyman, regarding the intent of the parties with respect to supplemental benefits and a life insurance policy on Mr. Hocker\u2019s life naming Mrs. Hoeker as the beneficiary. Mr. Hoeker claims that the trial court failed to appreciate the interplay between the life insurance and survivor benefits and that it should have permitted his former attorney to testify about the parties\u2019 negotiations on this point. Mr. Hoeker also argues that the trial court\u2019s statement that Slyman\u2019s proffered testimony on the issue \u201cwould not alter the court\u2019s decision\u201d indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>that \u201cthe trial court chose to ignore such proffered testimony without stating why.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">{\u00b6 38} In our prior opinion, we found that the trial court had abused its discretion in excluding Bosse\u2019s testimony for the following reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cBosse\u2019s testimony was not being offered to prove the liability for or validity of the claim that [Mrs. Hocker] was entitled to one-half of [Mr. Hocker\u2019s] retirement benefits. The parties did not dispute this fact. Instead, the testimony was being offered to assist the trial court in assessing the value of the pension, i.e., whether equitably and intentionally it included early-retirement and/or interim supplemental benefits. Furthermore, the question why a life insurance policy on [Mr. Hocker\u2019s] life was proposed during the divorce negotiations was at issue. We believe that the parties were entitled to offer evidence of their negotiations demonstrating their motives for that action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">{\u00b6 40} On remand, the magistrate permitted Mr. Hocker to call Bosse, but did not permit Mr. Hocker to call his former attorney, Slyman, to testify about any negotiations on supplemental benefits and life insurance. In the order granting Mrs. Hocker\u2019s motion in limine with respect to Slyman\u2019s testimony, the magistrate did not elaborate on her reasons for not permitting him to testify. In the trial court\u2019s judgment, however, which overruled Mr. Hocker\u2019s objection to the in hmine ruling, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c[Mr. Hocker] argues that the magistrate erred by granting [Mrs. Hocker\u2019s] motion in limine to exclude the testimony of Attorney Jeffrey Slyman. Mr. Slyman was defendant\u2019s attorney of record at the time of the final hearing [in the initial divorce proceedings]. The court finds that the hearing on remand was specifically targeted to clarify the testimony of [Mr. Hocker\u2019s] expert witness, Mr. Bosse. Attorney Slyman represented [Mr. Hocker] throughout the proceedings. He [Slyman] did not object or clarify the record during the September 13, 2001 hearing. Attorney Slyman continued to represent [Mr. Hocker] up to the appearance of attorney Stone in this matter.\u201d (Stone began to represent Mr. Hocker two months after our remand.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">{\u00b6 42} In our view, the trial court\u2019s decision on remand to hear only Bosse\u2019s testimony and to exclude additional testimony as to the parties\u2019 motives during their negotiations was inconsistent with our conclusion that \u201cthe parties were entitled to offer evidence of their negotiations demonstrating their motives.\u201d However, the trial court\u2019s confusion about our intent on remand was rendered harmless by the fact that it considered the proffer of Slyman\u2019s testimony and by its conclusion that his testimony would not have altered the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">{\u00b6 43} A proffer is, by definition, an offer of evidence. If error is predicated upon a ruling which excludes evidence (such as Slyman\u2019s testimony), the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>stance of the evidence must be made known to the court by offer. Evid.R. 103(A)(2). \u201cThe purpose of requiring the proponent of the excluded evidence to make an \u2018offer of proof or \u2018proffer\u2019 regarding the evidence is to allow a reviewing court to determine whether the proponent of the evidence has been prejudiced by its exclusion.\u201d <em>Baird v. Gillispie </em>(Jan. 21, 2000), Miami App. No. 99-CA-12, 2000 WL 43493.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">{\u00b6 44} Mr. Hocker\u2019s attorney proffered that Slyman would have testified to the following (and we would assume that this is a version most favorable to Mr. Hocker, since it was proffered by him and not subject to cross-examination):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cMr. Slyman himself personally had conversations with Deborah Schram [Mrs. Hocker\u2019s attorney] on matter or what the parties would agree to or not agree to. Specifically with regard to the issues of early retirement subsidy, the survivor benefits as those two issues related to Mr. Hocker\u2019s General Motors defined benefits pension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cMr. Slyman had in that same context discussions with Mrs. Schram regarding related issues of spousal support and the issue of cohabitation and that specifically for purposes of reflecting or going to the issue of intent of the parties Jeff Slyman specifically told Deb Schram and Deb Schram agreed and expressed agreement directly to Jeff Slyman that her client was not going to be receiving any portion of the survivor benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cThat the intention was her client would not refuse any share of the early retirement supplement and that statements were made in the context of Jeff disclosing to Ms. Schram that he had evidence that had been gathered by a private investigator with regards to Mrs. Hocker\u2019s cohabitation, and if the matter went to trial there was a risk as communicated to Ms. Schram that the evidence would support no award of spousal support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cAnd in exchange for not presenting that evidence the agreement was as I\u2019ve stated that Miss Hocker would not receive any share of the survivor benefits and she would not receive any share of the early retirement supplement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-10\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cAdditionally in relation to Mrs. Hocker waiving her interest in the early retirement supplement and the conversations had including Mr. Bosse and Jeff Slyman regarding their agreement of the supplemental benefits information that is not part of the pension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cAnd getting back to how this ties into the spousal support. If Mr. Hocker were to retire early and receive the supplement, of course, that would be income to him that would be a factor at that time if he attempted to reduce his spousal support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-12\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cAnd that for all of these reasons Ms. Schram agreed and the agreement was expressed in the presence of Mrs. Hocker that she was not going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>receive any portion of the survivor benefits and not going to receive any portion of the early retirement supplements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cAnd Jeff would also confirm that the request at one point in the negotiation was that Mr. Hocker cooperated in permitting Mrs. Hocker to purchase a life insurance policy that would take the place of any survivor benefits. Of course, that policy would have had to be purchased and paid for by Mrs. Hocker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cLastly, Jeff would testify that when Ms. Schram made the comments that she did on the record that are reflected in what we have identified as a Joint Exhibit the transcript of what was read into the record that day and the final hearing of this he believed those statement she made were consistent with the agreements and the statements that had been made on the outside of the court and that specifically he interpreted her reference to by the SBP \u2014 that\u2019s an acronym as referenced to the survivor benefits \u2014 that everyone had agreed Mrs. Hocker was waiving any interest in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c * * * As part of those discussions about the evidence on cohabitation and spousal support and the overall agreement there were also discussions about the appraisal of the marital residence, that Jeff was of the opinion was too high and that there would have been some litigation involving that had the matter gone to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cAnd in exchange for the agreements that were being made or concessions that were being made with regard to the survivor benefits and with regard to the early retirement supplements that \u2014 that Mr. Hocker would not pursue any attempt to lessen the amount of equity that he was receiving in the real estate. And that\u2019s it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">{\u00b6 58} Although the court overruled the objections, including to the magistrate\u2019s exclusion of Slyman\u2019s testimony, it did conduct an independent review of the evidence and record as required by Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d). In doing so, the trial court considered Slyman\u2019s testimony, as reflected by its finding that \u201cthe proffered testimony would not alter the court\u2019s decision.\u201d The court\u2019s comments reflect its view that because Slyman \u201cdid not object or clarify the record\u201d in 2001 when the agreement was read into the record, his testimony many years later that the agreement did not accurately express the parties\u2019 intentions was not entitled to significant weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">{\u00b6 59} Moreover, it appears to us that Slyman\u2019s proffered statements about the parties\u2019 negotiations contradicted or expanded upon the agreement that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>presented to the court, although Slyman had stated on the record at the original hearing that the agreement that had been read into the record was accurate. For example, pursuant to the agreement that was read into the record, spousal support was subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the court and \u201cshall be subject to change upon the Wife\u2019s cohabitation with an unrelated adult male who helps provide for her support.\u201d This language, which Slyman made a point of including when the parties read their agreement into the record, contradicts Slyman\u2019s claim, in the proffered testimony, that Mr. Hocker waived his right to use Mrs. Hocker\u2019s alleged cohabitation against her in exchange for her waiver of survivorship rights. In fact, under the terms of the agreement, Mrs. Hocker\u2019s spousal support could still be subject to change due to cohabitation with another man. The trial court reasonably concluded that had testimony consistent with the proffer been offered at the hearing, the testimony would not have altered its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">{\u00b6 60} Under this assignment of error, Mr. Hocker also faults the trial court for not explaining why it chose to \u201cignore\u201d the proffered testimony. As stated above, the court did not ignore the proffered testimony, but rather read and considered it, albeit not to the end sought my Mr. Hocker. Resolution of the conflicting evidence was a matter for the trial court, which was in the best position to evaluate the evidence and assess the credibility of witnesses; a trial court is not required to explain why it weighs some factors or testimony more heavily than others, and an appellate court should not second-guess a trial court\u2019s factual determination unless there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>Rock v. Cabral </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 108, 112, 616 N.E.2d 218; <em>Aldo v. Angle, </em>Clark App. No. 09-CA-103, 2010-Ohio-2008, 2010 WL 1819085, at \u00b6 33. An abuse of discretion implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. We cannot find that Mr. Hocker has been prejudiced by the manner in which Slyman\u2019s testimony was considered, and we are unpersuaded that the trial court abused its discretion in weighing the evidence as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">{\u00b6 61} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">{\u00b6 62} Mr. Hocker\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s interpretation of the language of the final decree as awarding to appellee a portion of the early retirement and/or interim supplemental pension benefits constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">{\u00b6 64} Mr. Hocker contends that the trial court should have credited the evidence that the parties had not intended to include \u201cearly retirement supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>ments, interim supplements, or temporary benefits\u201d in the QDRO, because Bosse\u2019s testimony on these points was \u201cunrefuted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">{\u00b6 65} The trial court was in the best position to determine whether a final divorce decree and QDRO needed clarification in order to equitably divide a party\u2019s retirement benefits. <em>Gearhart, </em>supra; <em>Hocker, </em>171 Ohio App.3d 279, 2007-Ohio-1671, 870 N.E.2d 736, at \u00b6 24. A trial court has broad discretion to clarify ambiguous language in a separation agreement by considering the intent of the parties and the equities involved. <em>Gearhart, </em>supra, citing <em>Weller v. Weller </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 173, 179, 684 N.E.2d 1284. Absent an abuse of discretion, that factual determination will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Rock, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 112, 616 N.E.2d 218. \u201c[A]n abuse of discretion most commonly arises from a decision that was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Lee, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 791, 2007-Ohio-4542, 876 N.E.2d 1312, at \u00b6 11. Decisions are unreasonable if they are not supported by a sound reasoning process. <em>AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">{\u00b6 66} Mr. Hocker asserts that Bosse\u2019s testimony was \u201cunrefuted\u201d and that the trial court erred in concluding that the divorce decree did not accurately reflect the parties\u2019 negotiations or did not equitably divide their property. This claim disregards the trial court\u2019s role in assessing the credibility of the evidence. The trial court reasonably relied on the language of the parties\u2019 original agreement and the QDRO that was prepared therefrom by Bosse only one year after the parties\u2019 divorce as a more reliable reflection of the parties\u2019 agreement than Bosse\u2019s or Slyman\u2019s recollections \u2014 six or more years later \u2014 of the parties\u2019 discussions. The trial court reasonably gave significant weight to the language adopted by the parties at the time of the divorce. Moreover, based on the evidence presented, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the provision permitting Mrs. Hocker to purchase a life insurance policy did not offset her right to a share of survivorship benefits, especially insofar as Mrs. Hocker had to purchase the insurance policy with her own money.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">{\u00b6 67} Similarly, even considering and crediting Slyman\u2019s testimony, the trial court could have reasonably questioned the claim that Mrs. Hocker had waived her right to survivorship benefits because Mr. Hocker threatened to present evidence of cohabitation at the hearing. As discussed above, the final judgment gives the trial court continuing jurisdiction over spousal support and provides that it can be modified if Mrs. Hocker cohabitates with another adult male. The trial court\u2019s continuing ability to modify spousal support if Mr. Hocker raises the issue of cohabitation casts doubt on his claim that Mrs. Hocker exchanged her interest in a share of his survivorship benefits to avoid the presentation of evidence on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>{\u00b6 68} The trial court has broad discretion to clarify ambiguous language, and in doing so, it must start with the words the parties chose to use and the record they chose to make. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to be persuaded by Mr. Hocker\u2019s evidence that Mrs. Hocker had waived any claim to his supplemental pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">{\u00b6 69} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">{\u00b6 70} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b802-8\">Fain and Willamowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b802-9\">John R.
