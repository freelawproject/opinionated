For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">{\u00b6 2} On January 29, 2009, appellant was indicted on multiple counts of rape, gross sexual imposition, and sexual battery. The charges were alleged to have occurred from 2001 to 2008 and involved appellant\u2019s live-in girlfriend\u2019s daughter, \u201cA.W.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u201d who was 11 years old when the alleged incidents began. In 2008, the victim gave birth to appellant\u2019s child. On February 4, 2009, appellant entered a not-guilty plea to all the counts in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">{\u00b6 3} On June 2, 2009, appellant filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence relating to the DNA sample provided by appellant. Appellant argued that because the DNA results were not relevant to Counts I through VIII, reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>to the test results would be prejudicial. Alternatively, appellant filed a motion to separate the trial on Counts I through VIII from Counts IX and X. On June 29, 2009, the trial court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 4} On June 30, 2009, appellant filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence relating to appellant\u2019s April 1, 2009 polygraph examination. Appellant argued that although the polygraph was stipulated to, his former counsel improperly agreed to \u201cmultifaceted, confusing and misleading questions.\u201d The state opposed the motion, asserting the clear language of the stipulation and arguing that the questions were not confusing and were reviewed and agreed upon prior to testing. The Polygraph Agreement and Stipulation provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c5. The above-named polygraph examiner shall be permitted if called as a witness by the State of Ohio or by the defendant to testify at any criminal trial * * * as an \u2018expert\u2019 regarding all aspects of the test administered, and such testimony shall be offered and received as evidence in the trial without objections of any kind by any party to this Agreement except as to the weight of evidence it is to be given * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 6} The polygraph test questions provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c1. While living in the trailer on County Road E, did you permit or allow [A.W.] to fondle your penis with her hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c2. While living in the trailer on County Road E, did you put your penis in [A.W.]\u2019s mouth or vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c3. While living in the house on County Road 9, did you knowingly or intentionally have sex with [A.W.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c4. While living in the house on County Road A, did you knowingly or intentionally have sex with [A.W.]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">{\u00b6 11} On July 22, 2009, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">{\u00b6 12} On September 25, 2009, four days before the commencement of the trial, appellant filed a motion requesting funds for a private investigator, a motion to exclude references to the accuser as \u201cvictim,\u201d and a motion for emergency funds for fees and to hire expert witnesses. Appellant also filed motions to appear at trial in civilian clothing and without restraints. Further, appellant filed a motion requesting a hearing pursuant to <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, arguing that the methodology used in the polygraph examination was unreliable and led to \u201cmisleading and unreliable results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motions for funds for a private investigator, to refrain from referring to the accuser as \u201cvictim,\u201d and for funds to hire an expert witness. The court granted appellant\u2019s motions to appear in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>civilian clothing and without restraints. The <em>Daubert </em>hearing was held, out of the hearing of the jury, on the second day of trial prior to polygraph examiner Larry Silcox\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 14} On September 29, 2009, the trial commenced. A summary of the evidence presented is as follows. Williams County Sheriffs Deputy Monica Herman testified that on October 22, 2008, she received a call from the Edgerton Police Department about an alleged rape/molestation case that reportedly occurred outside the Edgerton city limits. Deputy Herman stated that three females had delivered a letter that the victim, A.W., had written to her ex-boyfriend explaining that she had been molested from the age of 11. Herman briefly spoke with A.W.; A.W. was \u201cedgy\u201d and just wanted to get her son and leave the area for the night. Deputy Herman went to A.W.\u2019s mother\u2019s and appellant\u2019s house to pick up the child; according to Herman, appellant stated, \u201c[T]hanks for ruining my place to live\u201d and that he was \u201ctired of being accused.\u201d Herman acknowledged that when she spoke with A.W., she could remember only three specific instances of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 15} Williams County Sheriffs Deputy Shaun Fulk testified that he spoke with appellant about the allegations. Appellant denied having a sexual relationship with A.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 16} Polygraph examiner Larry Silcox testified that he had conducted appellant\u2019s April 1, 2009 polygraph examination. Silcox explained that the pretest interview includes a careful review of the test questions. Silcox stated that appellant was asked four questions relating to various locations and sexual activities allegedly involving the victim. According to Silcox, appellant\u2019s answers were deceptive as to three of the four questions. After reviewing the test results, appellant continued to deny engaging in sexual contact with A.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 17} During cross-examination, Silcox was extensively questioned about the form of the questions. Specifically, Silcox was asked about the compound nature of the questions and the fact that a polygraph examination requires a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer, not a narrative answer. Silcox was also questioned about an article from the American Polygraph Association that criticized the use of compound questions during a polygraph examination. However, Silcox stressed that he reviewed the questions \u201cin detail\u201d with appellant prior to the testing to make certain that he understood them.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 18} The parties entered into a stipulation regarding the chain of custody\u2014 i.e., the collection, storage, and delivery, of the evidence obtained for DNA analysis. Julie Cox, a forensic scientist at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, testified that she performed DNA tests on saliva swabs taken from appellant, appellant\u2019s son, A.W., and A.W.\u2019s child. Cox stated that her findings were that appellant could not be excluded as the father of A.W.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>child. Statistically, the probability that appellant is the child\u2019s father is 99.9999 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">{\u00b6 19} A.W. testified that appellant moved in with her mother, sister, and brother when she was six months old. When A.W. was four years old, appellant\u2019s son moved in with them. A.W. explained that she called appellant \u201cDad\u201d and that he was in charge of the rulemaking and discipline of the children in the household. A.W. testified regarding the dates and locations of the incidents. Typically, she could remember dates only in relation to where they lived at the time. A.W. testified that the incidents began when she was ten years old and that they consisted of her placing her hand on appellant\u2019s penis, placing her mouth on appellant\u2019s penis, and sexual intercourse. Appellant also put his mouth on her vagina; A.W. stated that this occurred approximately five times.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 20} A.W. testified that during the years that she shared a bedroom with her sister, approximately one to two times per month, appellant would come into her bedroom and take her to the living room or his bedroom. They would then engage in the above-mentioned sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 21} A.W. testified that in 2006, she had her own bedroom, and the incidents increased to three to four times per week. A.W. testified that from fall 2007 through spring 2008, the incidents had decreased because she was pregnant. She stated that' appellant had intercourse with her the night before her labor was to be induced.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 22} During cross-examination, A.W. admitted that during the years of the alleged abuse, she never had any medical issues or reports from school that she had been sleepy or lethargic during the day. A.W. also acknowledged that she could only remember a few specific instances of abuse; she later testified that she \u201cblocked most of it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 23} A.W. was also questioned regarding a possible motive to fabricate the allegations. Appellant and AW.\u2019s mother wanted her to break up with a boyfriend with whom she was having a sexual relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant testified that he did not rape or molest A.W. Appellant stated that the only sexual contact he had with A.W. was when her son was conceived. According to appellant, he was asleep on the couch and woke up being \u201cstimulated\u201d by A.W. Appellant admitted to having intercourse with A.W. and stated that he was \u201cvery wrong in not stopping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 25} Regarding the polygraph examination, appellant stated that the questions were confusing and that he was not sure whether they were directed at where he was living or whether he had done certain sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 26} During cross-examination, appellant agreed that his girlfriend\u2019s children looked to him as a father figure. Appellant admitted that he never discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>with either the police or the polygraph examiner the fact that he had had a consensual sexual contact with A.W. Appellant explained that he was being accused of rape and molestation and vehemently denied those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant\u2019s wife and his son testified that they were never aware of any suspicious activity between appellant and A.W. Appellant\u2019s son testified that from age 12 through high school, he was consistently up around 3:00 a.m. to get something to eat. Appellant\u2019s son did acknowledge that he was with his mother every other weekend and half the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 28} Following the trial, the jury found appellant guilty of six of the ten counts in the indictment. Appellant was acquitted of two counts of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition. Appellant was convicted of one count of rape and five counts of sexual battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 29} On October 26, 2009, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape and five years of imprisonment for each count of sexual battery. The sentences were ordered to be served consecutively. Appellant was also designated a Tier III sex offender. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 30} Appellant now raises the following four assignments of error for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cI. Trial counsel for defendant/appellant provided ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cII. The trial court erred in denying the request of defendant/appellant for a polygraph expert and emergency funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cIII. The trial court erred by allowing the expert testimony of the polygraph operator for the State of Ohio following the <em>Daubert </em>hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cIV. The trial court erred by manifesting a bias in favor of the State of Ohio and against defendant/appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">{\u00b6 35} In appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, he argues that his trial counsel was ineffective by filing untimely pretrial motions, by failing to request that a juror be removed for cause, by stipulating to the admission of the DNA evidence, by failing to object when the victim testified that appellant \u201cwhipped\u201d her with a belt and \u201csmashed\u201d encyclopedias in her face, and by failing to object to testimony and evidence regarding the polygraph examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">{\u00b6 36} At the outset, we note that the standard for determining whether a trial attorney was ineffective requires appellant to show (1) that the trial attorney made errors so egregious that the trial attorney was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed appellant under the Sixth Amendment and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced appellant\u2019s defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 686-687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. In essence, appellant must show that his trial, due to his attorney\u2019s ineffectiveness, was so demonstrably unfair that there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different absent his attorney\u2019s deficient performance. Id. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 37} Furthermore, a court must be \u201chighly deferential\u201d and \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d in reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A properly licensed attorney in Ohio is presumed to execute his duties in an ethical and. competent manner. <em>State v. Hamblin </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 153, 155-156, 524 N.E.2d 476. Debatable strategic and tactical decisions may not form the basis of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 85, 656 N.E.2d 643. Even if the wisdom of an approach is debatable, \u201cdebatable trial tactics\u201d do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Clayton </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 48-49, 16 O.O.3d 35, 402 N.E.2d 1189. Finally, reviewing courts must not use hindsight to second-guess trial strategy and must keep in mind that different trial counsel will often defend the same case in different manners. <em>Strickland, </em>supra at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 152, 689 N.E.2d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 38} Appellant first argues that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to file timely pretrial motions. In support, appellant cites <em>State v. Yates, </em>166 Ohio App.3d 19, 2006-Ohio-1424, 848 N.E.2d 917, where the court found that trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to timely file a motion to suppress. In <em>Yates, </em>the motion to suppress was orally made on the date of trial. It is undisputed that the information needed to file the motion was available months prior to trial. Id. at \u00b6 7. The court specifically found that had the motion been timely filed, it would have been granted. Id. at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 39} Appellant contends that as in <em>Yates, </em>trial counsel had 154 days from his entry of appearance until the start of the trial to file motions for an investigator and for emergency funds to hire a polygraph expert. Appellant asserts that this delay cannot be considered sound trial strategy. Although we agree that the motions were tardy, we cannot say that the delayed filing prejudiced appellant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 40} First, appellant\u2019s stated reason for requesting an investigator was to \u201clook into the circumstances surrounding the charged offenses.\u201d In order to obtain an expert witness at state expense, a defendant must demonstrate more than a mere possibility that an expert will provide assistance. <em>State v. Evans, </em>153 Ohio App.3d 226, 2003-Ohio-3475, 792 N.E.2d 757, \u00b6 14, citing <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 328, 738 N.E.2d 1178. \u201cAt a minimum, the indigent defendant must present the trial judge with sufficient facts which will demonstrate a particularized need for the expert requested.\u201d <em>Evans </em>at \u00b6 14. Appellant clearly failed to demonstrate a particularized need for an investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 41} In addition, appellant faded to demonstrate this need with regard to a polygraph expert, as discussed later. Further, appellant\u2019s request for a medical and a behavioral expert were not supported by a showing of a particularized need.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 42} Appellant next asserts that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to request that a potential juror be excused for cause. Crim.R. 24 provides that a juror may be excused for cause where, among other things, the juror \u201cis possessed of a state of mind evincing enmity or bias toward the defendant.\u201d However, no juror will be dismissed \u201cif the court is satisfied, from the examination of the juror or from other evidence, that the juror will render an impartial verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 43} In the present case, a potential juror, S.E., indicated that her daughter had been molested by her stepbrother. S.E. stated that she did not know about the abuse for several years; S.E. stated that wished that she had known so she \u201ccould have protected her daughter.\u201d S.E. did state that she has no anger toward the stepson, that he went through counseling, and that he is now a very successful individual. S.E. further stated that she would not be \u201coverly harsh\u201d in judging appellant and that she would be able to follow the law and the judge\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 44} Upon review, we find that appellant\u2019s trial counsel could have reasonably presumed that S.E. would not have been excused for cause. Counsel then used a preemptory challenge to excuse her. Appellant has further failed to demonstrate how using a peremptory challenge to dismiss S.E. prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 45} Appellant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective by agreeing to stipulate to the admission of the DNA evidence without requiring the state to prove the chain of custody. We agree with the state\u2019s contention that such a stipulation could have reasonably been tactical in nature. The DNA evidence was a key piece of evidence, one that appellant tried to bar from the trial by filing a motion in limine. It is likely that trial counsel did not wish to belabor or prolong the testimony regarding the DNA test and its results.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 46} Next, appellant- argues that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to object to A.W.\u2019s testimony that on two occasions, appellant whipped her with a belt, and on one occasion, he \u201csmashed\u201d encyclopedias in her face. Appellant contends that the testimony was \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d and not relevant to the charges. We disagree. As the state correctly notes, the sexual-battery counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>required the state to prove that appellant was a person \u201cin loco parentis\u201d with A.W. Thus, appellant was questioned regarding whether she referred to appellant as \u201cdad\u201d and what his role was in running the household, including with respect to discipline. Further, as to the rape counts, the state was required to prove that appellant forced A.W. to submit to sexual conduct by force or threat of force. Thus, appellant\u2019s method of discipline was relevant to A.W.\u2019s perception of the alleged events.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 47} Finally, appellant lists multiple additional instances of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, including failing to object to \u201copinion\u201d testimony of the polygraph expert, failing to object to the admission of the polygraph charts that counsel had not received prior to trial, failing to object to the report prepared after the polygraph examination, and failing to object when the DNA stipulation was read into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 48} Regarding the polygraph expert, as set forth above, the stipulation clearly provided for the admission of his testimony. Further, a <em>Daubert </em>hearing was held prior to Silcox\u2019s testimony. The polygraph charts and report were also a part of the stipulation. Lastly, the DNA stipulation had been signed by the parties and discussed in detail. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the above evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 49} Based on the foregoing, we find that even assuming trial counsel made any errors, the errors did not prejudice appellant. Counsel clearly represented appellant as vigorously as possible. In fact, appellant was acquitted of four of the ten counts in the indictment. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 50} In appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for a polygraph expert and emergency funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c[D]ue process, as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, requires that an indigent criminal defendant be provided funds to obtain expert assistance at state expense only where the trial court finds, in the exercise of its sound discretion, that the defendant has made a particularized showing (1) of a reasonable probability that the requested expert would aid in his defense, and (2) that denial of the requested expert assistance would result in an unfair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 150, 694 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 52} In his motion, appellant argues that a polygraph expert was necessary in order to dispute the complex nature of the questions. Appellant asserted that an expert was required to \u201cadequately challenge the test and call the test results into question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 58} At the conclusion of the <em>Daubert </em>hearing, the trial court stated that it would give trial counsel substantial leeway during the cross-examination of Silcox to question him regarding the compound nature of the questions. Counsel was even permitted to introduce and question Silcox regarding a learned treatise. Appellant has not demonstrated that an expert witness would have provided any additional assistance. Further, as stated above, the motion was filed just days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 54} Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for funds to obtain a polygraph expert. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 55} In appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred by allowing the state to present the expert testimony of the polygraph operator following the <em>Daubert </em>hearing. We first note that a trial court\u2019s ruling to admit or to exclude evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 182, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343; <em>State v. Smith, </em>6th Dist. No. L-05-1350, 2007-Ohio-5592, \u00b6 43. \u201c \u2018 \u201c[A]buse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 56} In <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 687 N.E.2d 735, the Supreme Court of Ohio adopted the <em>Daubert </em>analysis, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cIn evaluating the reliability of scientific evidence, several factors are to be considered: (1) whether the theory or technique has been tested, (2) whether it has been subjected to peer review, (3) whether there is a known or potential rate of error, and (4) whether the methodology has gained general acceptance. Although these factors may aid in determining reliability, the inquiry is flexible. The focus is \u2018solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 611-612, 687 N.E.2d 735, quoting <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">{\u00b6 58} First, as quoted above, the parties entered into a stipulation that Silcox was permitted to be called as an expert witness by the state of Ohio. Such a stipulation is expressly provided for in <em>State v. Souel </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 123, 7 O.O.3d 207, 372 N.E.2d 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 59} During the <em>Daubert </em>hearing, state\u2019s exhibit No. 14, Silcox\u2019s curriculum vitae, was submitted to the court for review. Silcox proceeded to testify regarding the methodology used during a polygraph examination. The court specifically asked Silcox whether his testing procedures followed and implement<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ed \u201cthe most current and up-to-date steps and techniques to insure the highest possible accuracy.\u201d Silcox responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 60} Based on the foregoing, we cannot say that the trial court erred when it permitted Silcox to testify. The reliability of the testing procedure was established. Whether or not the results were accurate was an issue to explore during trial. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 61} Appellant\u2019s fourth and final assignment of error asserts that the trial court erroneously demonstrated a bias in favor of the state during trial. Pursuant to Evid.R. 611(A), the trial court has discretion in controlling the flow of the trial, including the \u201cmode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.\u201d Further, during a jury trial, a court must maintain the appearance of impartiality. <em>Mentor-on-the-Lake v. Giffin </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 441, 449, 664 N.E.2d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 62} Because the trial court has the authority to control the flow of trial, an appellate court will not reverse on issues relating to the court\u2019s actions during trial absent an abuse of discretion. Id. at 448, 664 N.E.2d 557. Moreover, the failure to object to such alleged errors waives all but plain error. <em>State v. Watson, </em>3d Dist. No. 14-09-01, 2009-Ohio-6713, 2009 WL 4894663, \u00b6 41, citing <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 586, 590, 731 N.E.2d 1149. \u201cNotice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>State v. Witcher, </em>6th Dist. No. L-06-1039, 2007-Ohio-3960, 2007 WL 2216952, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 63} In the present case, appellant objects to several dialogues that took place during trial. We will examine each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 64} During voir dire, the following exchanges occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 65} \u201c[Mr. Maassel:] Dr. Brown, what would happen if somebody accused you of a crime? How would you react to something like that? Something that in your mind know that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cMr. Brown: If I did the crime I would plead guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cMr. Maassel: But in your mind if you know that things, that you were innocent and if the facts alleged were just terrible \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean to single you out, sir\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>{\u00b6 68} \u201cThe court: Every defendant who appears in this courtroom, regardless of whether they are ultimately innocent or ultimately guilty, have an absolute right to have representation by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cAnd, Mr. Maassel will not be testifying in this case, nor will any of the lawyers be testifying in this case as a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cNow let\u2019s proceed on to the next topic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 71} Next, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cMr. Conklin: All I needed to discuss was the very last question, did I want my clone up here [in the jury box] if I\u2019m over there [at the defense table]. And it would be no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cMr. Maassel: And why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cMr. Conklin: Cause if I\u2019m guilty I wouldn\u2019t want to meet me out by the car. If I\u2019m guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cThe court: It was your question Mr. Maassel!\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">{\u00b6 76} Reviewing these two exchanges, we cannot say that the court expressed any improper bias. In the first instance, the trial court was merely stressing that the defendant had the right to counsel, that trial counsel\u2019s statement was not testimony, and that counsel did not have the right to testify in the matter. Next, the court was commenting on the potential juror\u2019s response to counsel\u2019s question posed to all jurors as to whether they would feel comfortable if they were a juror in a trial against him or herself. Admittedly, it was an odd question.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">{\u00b6 77} Next, appellant disputes various comments made by the trial court during the <em>Daubert </em>hearing. We first note that the hearing was held outside of the presence of the jury. The court did express that the jury was waiting for the trial to resume for the day and that the court wanted to move the hearing along. This certainly falls within Evid.R. 611. The trial court also indicated that it understood the compound-question issue and that it would give trial counsel substantial leeway during cross-examination of Silcox.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">{\u00b6 78} Appellant cites multiple instances during which the trial court either asked counsel to ask a question or asked counsel whether what was stated was, in fact, a question. Again, from the context of the testimony, it appears that the court was simply attempting to move the questioning along. The court also, on a few occasions, attempted to keep the questions on topic. Appellant also complains about a few instances during which the state objected to testimony, and the objection was sustained. Reviewing the transcript, we note that the trial court also sustained objections made by appellant\u2019s trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>{\u00b6 79} After careful review of the entire trial transcript, we cannot say that the trial court manifested any particular bias in favor of the state and against appellant. In fact, during appellant\u2019s testimony, he was permitted to answer questions in nearly a narrative form. Further, during the state\u2019s cross-examination of appellant, the court stated: \u201cI remind the jury, the defendant has a right not to speak and a right to remain silent.\u201d Accordingly, we find that appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 80} We therefore find that appellant was not prejudiced or prevented from having a fair trial, and the judgment of the Williams County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b396-7\">Osowik, P.J., and Singer, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-15\">.
