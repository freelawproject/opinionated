Appellate counsel submitted Fain\u2019s appeals consistent with the procedure set forth in <em>Anders v. </em>California.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In affirming Fain\u2019s convictions, we necessarily concluded that Fain had entered his guilty pleas knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. By his knowing, voluntary, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>intelligent guilty pleas, Fain waived his proposed challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to assign this matter as error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 3} Nor can appellate counsel be said to have been ineffective in failing to assign as error trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness in \u201cfailing to investigate or to submit reversible errors which would have rendered a different outcome.\u201d Fain does not specify what trial counsel\u2019s investigation would have disclosed or what \u201creversible errors\u201d his trial counsel neglected to \u201csubmit.\u201d And the record does not otherwise demonstrate a reasonable probability of success had appellate counsel advanced this assignment of error on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 4} Finally, Fain argues that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that his sentence was \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d Fain was convicted of trafficking in cocaine and having a weapon under a disability and was given \u201cagreed\u201d sentences. As part of his sentences, Fain\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for both offenses. But R.C. 2923.13 did not authorize the trial court to suspend Fain\u2019s driver\u2019s license as part of his sentence for having a weapon while under a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 5} Since the trial court improperly imposed a three-year driver\u2019s license suspension for that offense, that portion of the sentence was contrary to law. Accordingly, Fain\u2019s motion to reopen his appeals has merit. And since the suspension was contrary to law,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we vacate the driver\u2019s license suspension imposed by the trial court for the weapons-under-disability conviction. This ruling does not affect the three-year suspension that the trial court properly imposed for Fain\u2019s drug-trafficking conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 6} And removal of the suspension is Fain\u2019s only remedy \u2014 he is not entitled to a new sentencing hearing. A defendant is entitled to a new sentencing hearing if the sentence he received is void.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A sentence is void when it does not contain a statutorily mandated term, like postrelease-control notification.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>driver\u2019s license suspension is not a \u201cstatutorily mandated term\u201d akin to postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">{\u00b6 7} The Ohio Supreme Court has recently emphasized the fact that there are limited circumstances under which a sentence will be considered void. In <em>State v. Joseph, </em>the court addressed the issue whether the failure to inform a defendant of mandatory court costs renders a sentence void in the way it would if there is an omission related to postrelease control.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It does not. The court noted that \u201c[t]he civil nature of the imposition of court costs does not create the taint on the criminal sentence that the failure to inform a defendant of postrelease control does. Nor does the failure to inform a defendant orally of court costs affect another branch of government. It affects only the court and the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 8} In this case, the imposition of a duplicative driver\u2019s license suspension did not create the same concerns about the sentence that a failure to inform the defendant of postrelease control would have. Nor does it affect another branch of the government. The Bureau of Motor Vehicles will still be suspending Fain\u2019s license for three years as a result of the trafficking conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 9} This conclusion is buttressed by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s most recent case to address the issue. <em>State v. Anthony </em>involved one count of attempted felonious assault and one count of having a weapon while under a disability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Anthony was sentenced to seven years in prison and given a driver\u2019s license suspension.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Supreme Court held that the suspension was not proper, because the use of a motor vehicle was not integral to the crime itself.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court concluded by stating that \u201cR.C. 4507.16(A)(1)(b) was improperly invoked and that the court of appeals erred in upholding the revocation of Anthony\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and <em>reinstate appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s </em>license.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 10} In conclusion^ we grant Fain\u2019s motion to reopen his appeal and modify his sentence for the weapon-under-a-disability conviction, striking the three-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>driver\u2019s license suspension. Having so modified the sentence, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Judgment affirmed as modified.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-5\">Hendon, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b570-6\">Cunningham, P.J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\">. <em>State v.

But I dissent from its judgment to the extent that it here decides the reopened appeals. And I disagree with its disposition of the reopened appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">{\u00b6 12} The majority grants Fain\u2019s App.R. 26(B) application to reopen his appeals based on appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in failing to assign as error the unauthorized driver\u2019s license suspension and then proceeds to decide the assignment of error. It concludes that under current Ohio Supreme Court jurisprudence, the unauthorized license suspension did not render Fain\u2019s sentence \u201cvoid\u201d and that Fain\u2019s \u201cremedy\u201d is, therefore, limited to the \u201cremoval of the suspension.\u201d And it enters judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">{\u00b6 13} Thus, the majority accedes to the mandate of App.R. 26(B)(5) and grants Fain\u2019s application to reopen his appeals. But it does not afford Fain counsel and the process provided by App.R. 26(B) and other relevant Appellate Rules. Instead, it exercises the authority conferred upon a court of appeals deciding a direct appeal<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and \u201cmodif[ies]\u201d Fain\u2019s judgment of conviction by \u201cstriking\u201d the unauthorized license suspension. This the court may not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>{\u00b6 14} This matter is before us not on direct appeal, but on Fain\u2019s App.R. 26(B) application to reopen his direct appeals. In 1992, in <em>State v. </em>Mumahan,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Supreme Court sought to fill a procedural void by providing a \u201cmeans for enforcing [the] right to effective counsel at the appellate level,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> when appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness had not been discovered until after the time had expired for reconsideration by the court of appeals or for a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A year later, in the wake of,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and with the purpose of superseding,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> its decision in <em>Mumahan, </em>the court adopted App.R. 26(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 15} In applying App.R. 26(B), the Supreme Court has declared, and this court has acknowledged, that App.R. 26(B) \u201ccreates a special procedure\u201d by which an appellant may \u201cvindicate\u201d his right to the effective assistance of appellate counsel.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The rule was \u201cspecifically designed\u201d to provide a \u201cseparate\u201d and \u201cspecialized\u201d \u201ccollateral postconviction proceeding[]\u201d for challenging the outcome of an appeal, based on a claim that appellate counsel had been ineffective in prosecuting the appeal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 16} As the rule\u2019s drafters noted, App.R. 26(B) contemplates a \u201ctwo-stage [reopening] procedure. The first stage involves a threshold showing for obtaining permission to file new appellate briefs\u201d in a reopened appeal.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, during the first stage, an \u201cappellate court\u2019s mandate in addressing a timely filed application for reopening is to determine whether [a] \u2018genuine issue\u2019 exists\u201d as to appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and if so, to grant reopening.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 17} For purposes of the reopening procedure\u2019s \u201csecond stage,\u201d the rule requires the court to appoint counsel to represent an indigent applicant.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Neither the state Constitution nor the federal Constitution requires that counsel be appointed for an indigent applicant either to pursue reopening or to prosecute a reopened appeal.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Ohio has chosen to provide for the appointment of counsel for an indigent defendant in a reopened appeal.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> And the \u201csecond stage\u201d events demonstrate why.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 18} The reopening procedure\u2019s second stage, after an appeal has been reopened and after counsel has been appointed, \u201cproceed as on an initial appeal in accordance with [the Appellate Rules].\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Specifically, the second stage involves new counsel filing appellate briefs and supporting materials, taking action to have the record transmitted to the court of appeals<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and advocating on the applicant\u2019s behalf at oral argument or at an evidentiary hearing \u201cif the court of appeals determines that an evidentiary hearing is necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 19} Although during the second stage a reopened appeal generally \u201cproceeds as on an initial appeal[,] * * * the court may limit its review to those' assignments of error and arguments not previously considered.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus, in a reopened appeal, the appellant in his brief and the court in its review are constrained by considerations of res judicata, but are not limited to those claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness deemed \u201ccolorable\u201d in the first stage of the reopening procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 20} Fain, in the reopening procedure\u2019s first stage, established a genuine issue as to whether he has a colorable claim of his appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[a] substantive review of the claim is an essential part of a timely filed App.R. 26(B) application.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> But different standards of review govern the court\u2019s exercise of its authority to reopen an appeal<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and its authority to decide the reopened appeal.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> And the matters to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>decided in the reopened appeal may extend beyond the matters decided in reopening the appeal.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Consequently, a court\u2019s determination that an App.R. 26(B) claim is colorable is not determinative of the court\u2019s ultimate disposition of a reopened appeal. And by the terms of App.R. 26(B), a court has no authority to dispose of a reopened appeal before the applicant has been afforded counsel and the process provided under the Appellate Rules and before the adversarial process has been brought to bear on the matters advanced in the reopened appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 21} Only at the close of the second stage, only after Fain has been afforded counsel and the process provided by the Appellate Rules, and only upon a \u201cfinding] that the performance of appellate counsel was deficient and [that Fain] was prejudiced by that deficiency,\u201d may this court \u201cvacate its prior judgment and enter the appropriate judgment,\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> i.e., a judgment authorized by R.C. 2953.07 and 2953.08(G)(2).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Therefore, I would not, at this juncture, finally decide the reopened appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 22} The majority, in finally deciding the appeals, concludes that the unauthorized license suspension did not render Fain\u2019s sentence \u201cvoid.\u201d And based on that conclusion, it enters judgment \u201cmodifying]\u201d the judgment of conviction by \u201cstriking\u201d the unauthorized license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 23} I agree with the majority that the ultimate disposition of Fain\u2019s appeals might turn upon the issue of whether his sentence was void. But I disagree with its conclusion that the sentence was not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 24} Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>State v. Jordan</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>State v. Bezak,</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the majority acknowledges that \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to a new sentencing hearing if the sentence he received is void\u201d and that \u201c[a] sentence is void when it does not contain a statutorily mandated term, like postreleasecontrol notification.\u201d But the majority insists that Fain\u2019s sentence was not void, because \u201ca driver\u2019s license suspension is not a \u2018statutorily mandated term\u2019 akin to postrelease control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>{\u00b6 25} <em>Jordan </em>and <em>Bezak </em>cannot, as the majority would have them, be so closely parsed. In those cases, the Supreme Court merely reaffirmed the vitality of its 1964 decision in <em>Colegrove v. </em>Burns<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and its 1967 decision in <em>Romito v. Maxwell.</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Colegrove, </em>the court held that a jail sentence imposed for a probation violation was \u201cvoid\u201d because it was not authorized by statute. The court reasoned that because \u201c[c]rimes are statutory, as are the penalties therefor, and the only sentence which a trial judge may impose is that provided for by statute[,] [a] court has no power to substitute a different sentence for that provided for by law or [to impose a sentence] that is <em>either greater or lesser than that provided for by law.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>45</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Twenty years later, in <em>State v. Beasley, </em>the Supreme Court followed <em>Colegrove </em>to hold that a sentence that did not include a statutorily mandated prison term was void.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Twenty years after <em>Beasley, </em>the court in <em>Jordan </em>followed <em>Beasley </em>to hold that a trial court\u2019s failure to provide statutorily mandated postrelease-control notification rendered the sentence void and required resentencing.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 26} In 1967 in <em>Romito, </em>the court declared that \u201c[t]he effect of determining that a judgment is void is well established. It is as though such proceedings had never occurred; the judgment is a mere nullity and the parties are in the same position as if there had been no judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Forty years later, in <em>Bezak, </em>the court followed <em>Romito </em>to hold that a sentence that was void for lack of postrelease-control notification had to be vacated and that the case had to be remanded for a new sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 27} Before and after the postrelease-control cases, this court has followed <em>Colegrove, Beasley, </em>and <em>Romito </em>to vacate as void, and to remand for resentencing, a sentence that excluded a statutorily mandated fine;<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> sentences that fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>outside the statutory range;<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and sentences that, without statutory authority, imposed a lifetime driver\u2019s license suspension,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> community service,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> home incarceration,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> driving privileges,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> restitution,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> a driver\u2019s intervention program,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> alcohol treatment,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and an indefinite sentence.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In the wake of the postreleasecontrol cases, other appellate districts have also continued to follow <em>Colegrove, Beasley, </em>and <em>Romito </em>to vacate as void, and to remand for resentencing, a sentence that was unauthorized for reasons other than the lack of postreleasecontrol notification.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">{\u00b6 28} Finally, in its 2008 decision in <em>State v. Simpkins, </em>the Supreme Court cited <em>Colegrove </em>in explaining that \u201c[t]he underpinning of [the court\u2019s] decisions from <em>Beasley </em>to <em>Bezak </em>is the fundamental understanding that no court has the authority to substitute a different sentence for that which is required by law. (Citation omitted.) Because no judge has the authority to disregard the law, a sentence that clearly does so is void.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 29} The majority cites the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State v. </em>Joseph<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> to argue that the imposition of an unauthorized driver\u2019s license suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>sipn is not one of those \u201climited circumstances under which a sentence will be considered void.\u201d The majority states that the imposition upon Fain of an unauthorized driver\u2019s license suspension is more analogous to the failure to advise Joseph concerning mandatory court costs (which does not render a sentence void) than it is to the failure to advise Jordan and Bezak concerning postrelease control (which does). The analogy does not hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 30} When imposed in a criminal proceeding, a driver\u2019s license suspension, like postrelease control, is a \u201csanction\u201d imposed for the violation of a criminal statute.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In contrast, \u201c[b]y being involved in court proceedings, [a] litigant, by implied contract, becomes liable for the payment of court costs if taxed as part of the court\u2019s judgment,\u201d and \u201c[a] judgment for costs * * * may be collected only by the methods provided for the collection of civil judgments.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Thus, whether imposed in a criminal or a civil proceeding, \u201c[t]he duty to pay court costs is a civil obligation arising from an implied contract.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201ccosts are not punishment, but are more akin to a civil judgment for money.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 31} Moreover, a trial court \u201cdoes not act outside of its jurisdiction when it fails to require payment of court costs.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> But a court acts without authority when it imposes a driver\u2019s license suspension that is not provided for by statute<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> or sanctions a violation of postrelease control that was not properly made a part of a sentence.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, a trial court\u2019s failure to impose court costs does not \u201cimplicate] or [ajffect * * * the powers of other branches of government\u201d;<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> but as the majority effectively acknowledges, a court\u2019s imposition of an unauthorized driver\u2019s license suspension, like its improper imposition of postrelease control, does. And because Fain\u2019s weapons-under-a-disability sentence and his drug-trafficking sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>tence are separately reviewable, and not reviewable as a \u201cpackage,\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> the implications for the bureau of motor vehicles in enforcing Fain\u2019s unauthorized license suspension are not, as the majority suggests, legally irrelevant simply because his license remains subject to suspension as part of his drug-trafficking sentence. Therefore, <em>Joseph </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 33} The majority concedes that the trial court, in sentencing Fain for having weapons while under a disability, had no authority to suspend his driver\u2019s license. The authorities are legion in support of the conclusion that the unauthorized sentence is void, requiring this court, in the reopened appeals, to vacate the sentence and to remand the case to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 34} But at this stage of the reopening proceedings, this court has no authority to finally decide the reopened appeals. Accordingly, I would, as mandated by App.R. 26(B), grant Fain\u2019s application to reopen his appeals,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> appoint new counsel for the reopened appeals,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> and order that the appeals \u201cproceed as on an initial appeal in accordance with [the appellate] rules.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b570-12\">.
