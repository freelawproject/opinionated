Jones, to suppress evidence. The state assigns a single error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACK\">The trial court erred in granting the defendant-appellee\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">Because the trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On August 17, 2009, defendant was charged with one count of carrying a concealed weapon, a knife, in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(1), a first-degree misdemeanor. After pleading not guilty, defendant on September 29, 2009, filed a motion to suppress evidence, contending that police officers, lacking reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in any criminal activity, unlawfully detained him in his vehicle when they retained his driver\u2019s license to run a warrant check. Defendant claimed that all evidence that the police obtained following defendant\u2019s unlawful detention must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-16\">{\u00b6 3} The trial court on October 28, 2009, held a hearing on defendant\u2019s suppression motion. At the hearing, the state\u2019s evidence was uncontroverted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>revealed that shortly after 1:00 a.m. on August 14, 2009, Columbus police officers Jason Garner and Duane Nicholson were on routine bicycle patrol in the vicinity of Sullivant Avenue and Belvedere Avenue in the Hilltop area of Columbus. The Hilltop section of Columbus is a purportedly high-crime area known to the officers for narcotics activity, prostitution, violent crimes, break-ins, and stolen vehicles. The officers observed a vehicle legally parked next to the curb on the right side of the road with its engine running and headlights turned off. Defendant, the sole occupant, was in the driver\u2019s seat with his head down. Wearing plainly marked police uniforms and badges, the police officers approached defendant\u2019s vehicle on their bicycles, with Officer Garner proceeding to the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and Officer Nicholson positioning himself behind the vehicle\u2019s trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 4} Officer Garner asked defendant several questions: whether everything was okay, why he was there, where he lived and worked, and whether he knew anyone in the area. Visibly nervous, shaking, and breathing heavily, defendant responded that everything was fine; he explained that he was waiting to go to work and had pulled over to text his girlfriend. Defendant told the officer he lived and worked in London, Ohio, and did not know anyone in the area where he was parked. The officers testified that defendant was not committing any traffic offense, no odor of alcohol or marijuana was about defendant\u2019s person, the officers had no indication that defendant was involved in narcotics or prostitution activity, and nothing suggested that defendant was otherwise involved in or about to commit any kind of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 5} Based on a belief that defendant had failed to provide a good explanation for why he was in the area, coupled with the reputation of the area and defendant\u2019s nervousness, the officers, relying on their intuition, suspected that something might be wrong. Officer Garner accordingly asked for defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license to verify his identity and to run a records check for warrants. Defendant handed his license to the officer and remained in his vehicle. Officer Garner testified that defendant was not under arrest at that time and was free to leave had he chosen to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 6} Some time after taking possession of defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license to run the warrant check, Officer Garner asked defendant, \u201cIs there anything on you or in your vehicle that could hurt us?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cYes, I have a knife next to me.\u201d Officer Garner testified that out of concern for the safety of the officers and defendant, he instructed defendant to put his hands out the car window so the officers could recover the knife and ensure that it could not be used as a weapon. Officer Garner then opened the driver\u2019s door and observed a knife wedged between the seat and the driver\u2019s door with the knife\u2019s handle facing the front of the vehicle. The knife was a military-style knife and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>enclosed in a sheath approximately 10 to 12 inches long that had a strap and button holding the knife in the sheath. Officer Garner asked defendant why he had the knife, and defendant explained he had it for fishing. Officer Garner testified that defendant was cooperative during the entire encounter, did not try to hide anything from the officers, and was not deceitful.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 7} In a written decision and entry on November 3, 2009, the trial court found that \u201cwhile the investigative stop or detention of the Defendant initially was warranted, once it was determined that there was no criminal activity afoot, the officers were obligated to release the Defendant,\u201d rendering the officers\u2019 subsequent warrantless search of defendant\u2019s automobile and seizure of the knife illegal. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and ordered that the knife the police seized be excluded from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{\u00b6 8} Appealing from the suppression order, the state has certified pursuant to Crim.R. 12(J) that the suppression order rendered the state\u2019s proof so weak that any reasonable possibility of effective prosecution has been destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">II. Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 9} In its sole assignment of error challenging the trial court\u2019s suppression order, the state asserts that the court erred as a matter of law by finding that the police officers\u2019 initial encounter with defendant was an investigatory stop or detention that triggered Fourth Amendment scrutiny, as opposed to a consensual encounter not subject to Fourth Amendment protections. The state contends that the police officers lawfully searched defendant\u2019s vehicle and seized the knife because defendant told the officers that he had a knife located next to him in the vehicle, a statement that justified the officers\u2019 decision to conduct the protective search of defendant\u2019s vehicle and seize the knife out of concern for their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[A]ppellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a motion to suppress evidence involves mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>State v. Vest </em>(May 29, 2001), 4th Dist. No. 00CA2576, 2001 WL 605217. Thus, an appellate court\u2019s standard of review of the trial court\u2019s decision granting the motion to suppress is twofold. <em>State v. </em>Reedy, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-501, 2006-Ohio-1212, 2006 WL 648861, \u00b6 5, citing <em>State v. Lloyd </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 95, 100-01, 709 N.E.2d 913. Because the trial court is in the best position to weigh the credibility of the witnesses, we must uphold the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. Id., citing <em>State v. Klein </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 486, 488, 597 N.E.2d 1141. We nonetheless must independently determine, as a matter of law, whether the facts meet the applicable legal standard. Id., citing <em>State v. Claytor </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 623, 627, 620 N.E.2d 906. The state bears the burden of establishing the validity of a warrantless search. <em>Xenia v. Wallace </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 216, 218, 524 N.E.2d 889, citing <em>State v. Kessler </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 204, 207, 7 O.O.3d 375, 373 N.E.2d 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 11} The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as Section 14, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution, prohibits the government from conducting warrantless searches and seizures, rendering them per se unreasonable unless an exception applies. <em>State v. Mendoza, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-645, 2009-Ohio-1182, 2009 WL 690204, \u00b6 11, citing <em>Katz v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576. Even so, \u201cnot all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u2018seizures\u2019 of persons. Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a \u2018seizure\u2019 has occurred\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868, fn. 16, 20 L.Ed.2d 889; <em>Brendlin v. California </em>(2007), 551 U.S. 249, 254, 127 S.Ct. 2400, 168 L.Ed.2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 12} In determining whether a particular encounter constitutes a seizure, and thus implicates the Fourth Amendment, the question is whether, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the encounter, a reasonable person would believe he or she was not free to leave or not free to decline the officers\u2019 requests or otherwise terminate the encounter. <em>United States v. Mendenhall </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497; <em>Florida v. Bostick </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 429, 439, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389; <em>Michigan v. Chesternut </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 567, 573, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 100 L.Ed.2d 565; <em>Florida v. Royer </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 491, 502, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (plurality opinion). \u201c[T]he crucial test is whether, taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, the police conduct would \u2018have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at 437, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389, quoting <em>Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. at 569, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 100 L.Ed.2d 565. Where the encounter takes place is a factor in deciding whether it constitutes a seizure for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at 437, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 13} The United States Supreme Court recognizes three categories of police-citizen interactions: (1) a consensual encounter, which requires no objective justification, see <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389, (2) a brief investigatory stop or detention, which must be supported by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, see <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, and (3) a full-scale arrest, which must be supported by probable cause, see <em>Brown v. Illinois </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>{\u00b6 14} More particularly, a consensual encounter occurs when the police approach a person in a public place, the police engage the person in conversation, and the person remains free not to answer or to walk away. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229; <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 553-554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497. The person \u201cmay not be detained even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds for doing so.\u201d <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 498, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229. A consensual encounter does not implicate the Fourth Amendment or trigger its protections. <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389; <em>State v. Moyer, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-434, 2009-Ohio-6777, 2009 WL 4936383, \u00b6 13, citing <em>In re Parks, </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-355, 2004-Ohio-6449, 2004 WL 2757852, \u00b6 7, citing <em>Royer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 15} Because the Fourth Amendment protections are not implicated in consensual encounters, a person\u2019s voluntary responses given during a consensual encounter may be used against the person in a criminal prosecution. <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 741, 749, 667 N.E.2d 60, citing <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 559-60, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497. A consensual encounter remains consensual even if police officers ask questions, ask to see the person\u2019s identification, or ask to search the person\u2019s belongings, provided that \u201cthe police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required.\u201d <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at 434-35, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389; <em>Florida v. Rodriguez </em>(1984), 469 U.S. 1, 4-6, 105 S.Ct. 308, 83 L.Ed.2d 165; <em>I.N.S. v. Delgado </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 210, 216, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 16} The next category of police-citizen interaction is an investigatory detention, commonly referred to as a <em>Terry </em>stop. See <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889. An investigatory stop constitutes a seizure for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. Guinn </em>(June 1, 2000), 10th Dist. No. 99AP-630, 2000 WL 702897, citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 16. Under <em>Terry, </em>a police officer may stop or detain an individual without probable cause when the officer has reasonable suspicion, based on specific, articulable facts, that criminal activity is afoot. Id. Accordingly, \u201c[a]n investigative stop does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution if the police have reasonable suspicion that \u2018the person stopped is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jordan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 35, quoting <em>United States v. Cortez </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 17} Reasonable suspicion entails some minimal level of objective justification, \u201cthat is, something more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 but less than the level of suspicion required for probable cause.\u201d <em>State v. Jones </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 554, 556-557, 591 N.E.2d 810, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889; <em>State v. Carter </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 57, 66, 630 N.E.2d 355 (concluding that a police \u201cofficer\u2019s inarticulate hunch -will not provide a sufficient basis for an investigative stop\u201d). Accordingly, \u201c[a] police officer may not rely on good faith and inarticulate hunches to meet the <em>Terry </em>standard of reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>Jones </em>at 557, 591 N.E.2d 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[A]n investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229; <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607; <em>State v. Chatton </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 59, 63, 11 OBR 250, 463 N.E.2d 1237. A person\u2019s mere presence in a high-crime area does not suspend the protections of the Fourth Amendment; nor is it a sufficient basis to justify an investigative stop. <em>Brown v. Texas </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 47, 51-52, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357; <em>Carter, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 65, 630 N.E.2d 355; <em>State v. Chandler </em>(1989), 54 Ohio App.3d 92, 97, 560 N.E.2d 832. An appellate court views the propriety of a police officer\u2019s investigative stop or detention in light of the totality of the surrounding circumstances. <em>State v. Bobo </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 177, 524 N.E.2d 489, paragraph one of the syllabus, approving and following <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 291, 18 O.O.3d 472, 414 N.E.2d 1044, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\"> {\u00b6 19} The third and final category of police-citizen interaction is a seizure that is the equivalent of an arrest. \u201cA seizure is equivalent to an arrest when (1) there is an intent to arrest; (2) the seizure is made under real or pretended authority; (3) it is accompanied by an actual or constructive seizure or detention; and (4) it is so understood by the person arrested.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>106 Ohio App.3d at 749, 667 N.E.2d 60, citing <em>State v. Barker </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 135, 7 O.O.3d 213, 372 N.E.2d 1324, syllabus. \u201cA warrantless arrest that is based upon probable cause and occurs in a public place does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 55, 2007-Ohio-4837, 873 N.E.2d 858, \u00b6 66, citing <em>United States v. Watson </em>(1976), 423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 20} Generally, when a police officer merely approaches and questions persons seated within parked vehicles, a consensual encounter occurs that does not constitute a seizure so as to require reasonable suspicion supported by specific and articulable facts. <em>State v. McClendon, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-554, 2009-Ohio-6421, 2009 WL 4649968, \u00b6 8; <em>State v. Chapa, </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-66, 2004-Ohio-5070, 2004 WL 2803971, \u00b6 8; <em>State v. Szewczyk </em>(Sept. 14, 1999), 7th Dist. No. 98-CA-20, 1999 WL 759990, citing 3 LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed.1987) 408-409, 415-416, Section 9.2(b). Indeed, the parties agree, and the facts in this case support, that defendant\u2019s initial interaction with the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>officers was consensual when the officers approached defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked him a few general questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 21} Nevertheless, what begins as a consensual encounter may escalate into an investigatory detention and seizure of a person that triggers Fourth Amendment scrutiny if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would not feel free to leave or otherwise terminate the encounter. <em>Delgado, </em>466 U.S. at 215, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247, citing <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497; <em>Moyer, </em>2009-Ohio-6777, 2009 WL 4936383, at \u00b6 18; <em>Guinn. </em>If the seizure is unlawful, any evidence obtained after the unlawful seizure must be suppressed as the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v. United States </em>(1963), 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441; <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>(1961), 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081; <em>State v. Pierce </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 592, 597, 709 N.E.2d 203. Thus, \u201cstatements given during a period of illegal detention are inadmissible even though voluntarily given if they are the product of the illegal detention and not the result of an independent act of free will.\u201d <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 501, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 22} Even when police officers have a valid basis to initially detain the driver of a vehicle, the driver of the vehicle may not be detained further once that basis has been explained away, absent some specific and articulable facts that the detention was reasonable; the driver should be \u201cfree to continue on his way without having to produce his driver\u2019s license.\u201d <em>Chatton, </em>11 Ohio St.3d at 63, 11 O.B.R. 250, 463 N.E.2d 1237, citing <em>United States v.

Prouse </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 648, 663, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (holding, \u201c[E]xcept in those situations in which there is at least articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise suspect to seizure for violation of law, stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check his driver\u2019s license and the registration of the automobile are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment\u201d); <em>Brown, </em>443 U.S. at 52, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (holding that absent some reasonable suspicion of misconduct, the detention of the defendant to determine his identity violated the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable seizure); <em>Jones, </em>70 Ohio App.3d 554, 591 N.E.2d 810 (finding that police officer\u2019s request for driver of lawfully parked vehicle to produce identification constituted an unlawful detention when police lacked any reasonable suspicion that driver was involved in criminal activity, thus requiring fruits of the unlawful detention to be suppressed under the exclusionary rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 23} Here, when the officers took defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license to check for warrants, they relied merely on their intuition and acted upon a hunch that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>something might be wrong; they could point to no specific articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in criminal activity. As this court noted in <em>Columbus v. Holland </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 196, 601 N.E.2d 190, an officer\u2019s intuition that \u201csomething was wrong,\u201d even though ultimately confirmed, will not provide a sufficient basis for an investigatory stop. See also <em>Guinn, </em>2000 WL 702897, *6 (noting that \u201ca hunch is not an accepted basis for intruding upon a citizen\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights\u201d); <em>Logan v. Bunthoff </em>(Apr. 14, 1994), 4th Dist. No. 93CA11, 1994 WL 146830, *2 (concluding that an officer\u2019s belief that someone is \u201cup to something\u201d or that his actions are \u201cnot normal\u201d does not justify a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 24} Applying the governing principles to the facts in this case, we conclude that even if the police officers\u2019 interaction with defendant began as a consensual encounter, the consensual nature of that encounter escalated into an investigative detention when the officers, unsatisfied with defendant\u2019s explanation as to why he was parked in a high-crime area, sought to confirm their intuition that something might be wrong. The officers asked for and retained defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license to run a warrants check to confirm or dispel their suspicions. At that moment, any consensual aspects of the encounter ended, and defendant was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 25} Contrary to the state\u2019s assertions, no reasonable person would believe that he or she is free to terminate the encounter and simply drive away when an officer retains his or her driver\u2019s license for the purpose of running a computer check for outstanding warrants. See <em>State v. Campbell, </em>157 Ohio App.3d 222, 2004-Ohio-2604, 810 N.E.2d 447 (concluding that an objectively reasonable person would not have thought himself free to refuse the encounter and leave when police officer asked for and retained his driver\u2019s license in order to run a warrants check while he sat in driver\u2019s seat in car parked at the curb with police cruiser behind the car and police officer standing at driver\u2019s door). See also <em>Commonwealth v. Lyles </em>(2009), 453 Mass. 811, 815-16, 905 N.E.2d 1106 (finding that when police officers took a person\u2019s identification to run a check for outstanding warrants, a reasonable person in that person\u2019s position would not believe that he could terminate the encounter and leave the scene); <em>State v. Daniel </em>(Tenn.2000), 12 S.W.3d 420, 427 (stating that \u201cwhen an officer retains a person\u2019s identification for the purpose of running a computer check for outstanding warrants, no reasonable person would believe that he or she could simply terminate the encounter by asking the officer to return the identification\u201d); <em>United States v. Lambert </em>(C.A.10, 1995), 46 F.3d 1064, 1068 (stating that \u201cwhen law enforcement officials retain a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license in the course of questioning him, that individual, as a general rule, will not reasonably feel free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>terminate the encounter\u201d); <em>Richmond v. Commonwealth </em>(1996), 22 Va.App. 257, 468 S.E.2d 708 (holding that \u201cwhat began as a consensual encounter quickly became an investigative detention once the [officer] received [appellant\u2019s] driver\u2019s license and did not return it to him\u201d); <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1998), 91 Wash.App. 195, 955 P.2d 420, 423 (stating that \u201c[o]nce an officer retains the suspect\u2019s identification or driver\u2019s license and takes it with him to conduct a warrants check, a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment has occurred\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 26} By retaining defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license to run a check for outstanding warrants, Officer Garner implicitly commanded defendant to remain on the scene since, as a practical matter, defendant was immobilized without his driver\u2019s license. To abandon his or her driver\u2019s license and drive away is not a realistic option for a reasonable person in today\u2019s society. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 501-502, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229; <em>United States v. Jordan </em>(D.C.Cir.1992), 958 F.2d 1085, 1087; <em>Lyles; Daniel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 27} Under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, when the police officers asked for and retained defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license to run a warrants check without reasonable suspicion that defendant was, or was about to be, engaged in criminal activity, defendant was unlawfully seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Because defendant\u2019s unlawful seizure occurred before he made his statement to Officer Garner regarding the knife, which statement led to the officers\u2019 search of defendant\u2019s vehicle and seizure of the knife, defendant\u2019s statement regarding the knife and any evidence obtained in the search of defendant\u2019s vehicle must be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree. <em>Wong Sun; Mapp; Royer; Pierce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">{\u00b6 28} Because the trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, we overrule the state\u2019s sole assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b674-10\">Brown and Klatt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
