Johnson, among other arguments, contends that his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence. We agree. However, we find that the evidence does support a conviction for the lesser included offense of criminal trespassing in violation of R.C. 2911.21. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court, and we order the trial court to modify its judgment to indicate that Johnson was convicted of criminal trespassing. We remand this case to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">I-</p>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">{\u00b6 2} Officer Joshua Frisby, a police officer working for the Dayton Police Department, came on duty around midnight on the morning of October 5, 2009. Shortly after he left the police station, he heard a house alarm in the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>vicinity. Frisby then proceeded to drive slowly through the neighborhood, attempting to pinpoint the source of the alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 3} Within a short period of time, Frisby identified the source of the alarm as 149 Grafton Avenue. About the same time as Frisby discovered this, he also observed Johnson carrying a box and walking quickly away from 149 Grafton Avenue. Frisby called for backup, illuminated Johnson with a spotlight on his police car, identified himself, and approached Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 4} At this point, Johnson dropped the box he was carrying and started to run. Frisby chased Johnson for about 50 to 75 yards before he caught him. Frisby then arrested Johnson and escorted him back to his police car. The record demonstrated that the box contained a demolition hammer. By the time Frisby had returned, his backup had also arrived. Frisby placed Johnson in one of the police cruisers. Within a short period of time, Frisby gave Johnson warnings pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. Johnson waived his rights and agreed to speak. Johnson then admitted that he was going to pawn the tool he was carrying in order to purchase drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 5} Roger Wattendorf, the owner of 149 Grafton Avenue, testified that the house was undergoing renovations at the time of the break-in. There were no alarms in the windows of the house. Instead, the only alarms were based on motion detectors. Wattendorf identified the demolition hammer Johnson carried as Wattendorfs property. Wattendorf also testified that the house was unoccupied, but that he was there most days to work on the renovations. Wattendorfs wife, Sandra Hill, stated that she was at the house about once a week. Wattendorf and Hill were out of town at the time of the break-in.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 6} Wattendorf employed Cory Bialke as a carpenter to complete the renovations. When Bialke arrived on Monday morning, he found that one of the windows of the home had been broken. He also found a chunk of cement near the broken window inside the house. Bialke also noticed that Wattendorfs tools had been moved and placed in piles. Finally, Bialke testified that he had been working on the 149 Grafton Avenue project for about two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 7} After a jury trial, the jury convicted Johnson of breaking and entering in violation of R.C. 2911.13(A). Johnson appeals and assigns the following errors for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">First Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMarvin Johnson was convicted on insufficient evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-12\">Second Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court committed plain error by failing to instruct the jury on what constitutes an \u2018unoccupied structure\u2019 in violation of Marvin Johnson\u2019s right to due process and a fair trial under the Constitutions of Ohio and the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">Third Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMarvin Johnson was denied the effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">Fourth Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred in ordering Marvin Johnson to pay restitution in violation of R.C. 2929.19(B)(6).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">{\u00b6 12} Johnson first contends that his conviction was supported by insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">{\u00b6 13} When reviewing a case to determine whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support a criminal conviction, our function \u201cis to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. See also <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">{\u00b6 14} This test raises a question of law and does not allow the court to weigh the evidence. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. Rather, this test \u201cgives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact * * * to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. Accordingly, the weight given to the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are issues for the trier of fact. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 79, 79-80, 24 O.O.3d 150, 434 N.E.2d 1356; <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">{\u00b6 15} Specifically, Johnson contends that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the structure broken into was \u201cunoccupied.\u201d Johnson was convicted of breaking and entering in violation of R.C. 2911.13(A). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>statute provides that \u201c[n]o person by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an unoccupied structure, with purpose to commit therein any theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or any felony.\u201d R.C. 2911.13(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 16} As Johnson notes, the fact that a structure is unoccupied is an essential element of the offense. <em>State v. Talley </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 152, 155-156, 18 OBR 210, 480 N.E.2d 439. Unfortunately, the Revised Code does not provide a definition of \u201cunoccupied.\u201d <em>State v. Carroll </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 313, 314, 16 O.O.3d 359, 405 N.E.2d 305. The Code, however, does define an occupied structure. R.C. 2909.01(C). Under the Code, breaking and entering is a fifth-degree felony, whereas burglary involving the trespass of an occupied structure is a third-degree felony. R.C. 2911.12(A)(3) and (C); see also R.C. 2911.13, Legislative Service Commission note (\u201cThis section defines an offense identical to burglary, except that the structure involved in a violation of this section is unoccupied rather than occupied\u201d). The legislature reasonably decided to punish trespass of an occupied structure more harshly because of the risk of personal harm to the occupants. <em>Carroll, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 314-315, 16 O.O.3d 359, 405 N.E.2d 305. \u201cProof that the structure is unoccupied is diametrically opposed to proof of occupancy.\u201d <em>State v. Beasley </em>(June 1, 1998), Stark App. No. 1997CA00423, 1998 WL 351449.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 17} An \u201coccupied structure\u201d is defined in the Code as follows: \u201cany house, building, outbuilding, watercraft, aircraft, railroad car, truck, trailer, tent, or other structure, vehicle, or shelter, or any portion thereof, to which any of the following applies: (1) It is maintained as a permanent or temporary dwelling, even though it is temporarily unoccupied and whether or not any person is actually present.\u201d R.C. 2909.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA structure which is dedicated and intended for residential use, and which is not presently occupied as a person\u2019s habitation, but, which has neither been permanently abandoned nor vacant for a prolonged period of time, can be regarded as a structure \u2018maintained\u2019 as a dwelling within the meaning of R.C. 2909.01(A). That definition includes a dwelling house whose usual occupant is absent on a prolonged basis or is receiving long-term care in a nursing home, a summer cottage, or a residential rental unit which is temporarily vacant.\u201d <em>State v. Green </em>(1984), 18 Ohio App.3d 69, 18 OBR 234, 480 N.E.2d 1128, at paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201c \u2018Under division (A) of the section, all dwellings are classed as occupied structures, regardless of the actual presence of any person. Whether or not the dwelling is used as a permanent or temporary home is immaterial, so long as it is maintained for that purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bock </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 146, 16 OBR 154, 474 N.E.2d 1228, quoting R.C. 2909.01 Committee Comment. Even homes undergoing major renovations have been found to be occupied structures. <em>State v. Woodruff, </em>Lucas App. No. L-04-1125, 2005-Ohio-3368, 2005 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>WL 1532611, at \u00b6 7-8; <em>State v. Charley, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82944, 2004-Ohio-3463, 2004 WL 1472745, at \u00b6 68-72 (owner was in nursing home, and house was empty and undergoing renovation, but nonetheless it was an occupied structure); <em>Green, </em>18 Ohio App.3d at 71-72, 18 OBR 234, 480 N.E.2d 1128 (term \u201cmaintained\u201d \u201calludes more to the character or type of use for which the dwelling is intended to be subjected\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 19} Here the evidence tended to show that the structure was a residential house, a single-family two-story residence in a craftsman style with three bedrooms. The owners did not reside on the premises, nor did anyone else. The house was currently undergoing substantial renovations and was fairly empty of furniture. The nature of the renovations is not entirely clear. Hill testified that she cleaned an oven, so whatever the nature of the renovations was, the owners did not remove the appliances. Bialke testified that he had previously worked for Wattendorf renovating other houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 20} Wattendorf testified on the stand that the house was unoccupied. Bialke also testified that the house was unoccupied after he and his assistant left. But both of these statements, in context, reflect opinions rooted in the ordinary understanding of the term \u201cunoccupied.\u201d However, \u201cunoccupied\u201d in the terms of the Revised Code is related to \u201coccupied.\u201d And the definition of \u201coccupied\u201d in the Revised Code is far broader than in ordinary usage. Under <em>Beasley, </em>this necessarily limits the scope of \u201cunoccupied\u201d more than in ordinary usage. The mere fact that a residence has no actual tenant or owner living in it does not establish that the structure is unoccupied within the meaning of the Revised Code. There is nothing in the record that tends to show that the house is being renovated for some use of a different character or type other than as a residence. See <em>Green, </em>18 Ohio App.3d at 71-72, 18 OBR 234, 480 N.E.2d 1128. Therefore, we find that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the house was unoccupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 21} We therefore sustain Johnson\u2019s first assignment of error. This renders Johnson\u2019s remaining assignments of error moot, and we decline to address them. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). We therefore vacate Johnson\u2019s conviction for breaking and entering under R.C. 2911.13(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 22} When a \u201cverdict is not sustained by sufficient evidence or is contrary to law; but if the evidence shows the defendant is not guilty of the degree of crime for which he was convicted, but guilty of a lesser degree thereof, or of a lesser crime included therein, the court may modify the verdict or finding accordingly, without granting or ordering a new trial.\u201d R.C. 2945.79(D). See also <em>State v. Esherick </em>(1969), 19 Ohio App.2d 40, 48 O.O.2d 35, 249 N.E.2d 78, at paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Frazier, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1323, 2007-Ohio-11, 2007 WL 16778, at \u00b6 28-29; <em>State v. Davis </em>(Dec. 18, 1997), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Cuyahoga App. No. 71853, 1997 WL 781855. \u201cCriminal trespass, under R.C. 2911.21, is a lesser included offense of breaking and entering, under R.C. 2911.13.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 248, 9 OBR 422, 459 N.E.2d 607, syllabus. The'evidence on which the jury below found Johnson guilty of breaking and entering would clearly establish criminal trespassing under R.C. 2911.21. Johnson in fact contests only the element of an \u201cunoccupied structure\u201d on appeal. We therefore reverse the judgment and remand this cause to the trial court. On remand, we order the trial court to (1) modify its judgment to show that Johnson is guilty of criminal trespassing under R.C. 2911.21 and (2) resentence Johnson accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 23} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-9\">Donovan, P.J., and Fain, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b478-10\">Roger L. Kline, J., of the Fourth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b478-11\">Fain, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Arp\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">{\u00b6 24} I concur fully in Judge Kline\u2019s thoughtful opinion for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">{\u00b6 25} I write separately only to note the unsatisfactory result in this case and to recommend a legislative solution for the General Assembly\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 2911.13(A), proscribing the offense with which Johnson is charged, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-15\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cNo person by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an unoccupied structure, with purpose to commit therein any theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or any felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">{\u00b6 28} The Legislative Service Commission\u2019s comment, in 1973, concerning this section is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-17\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThis section defines an offense identical to burglary, except that the structure involved in a violation of this section is unoccupied rather than occupied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-18\">{\u00b6 30} Actually, as the breaking-and-entering and burglary statutes are presently worded, there is one other difference. Breaking and entering requires the purpose to commit a felony or a theft offense, whereas burglary requires the purpose to commit any criminal offense. Thus, one who trespasses in an occupied structure by means of force, stealth, or deception, with the purpose to commit a misdemeanor offense other than a theft offense, is guilty of burglary, while one who trespasses in an unoccupied structure with the same intent is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>guilty of breaking and entering. With this one exception, the offenses are identical except for the nature of the structure in which the trespass occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 31} Obviously, a structure is either occupied or it is unoccupied. But because the offenses of burglary and breaking and entering are separately defined, the fact that the structure involved is unoccupied becomes an essential element of breaking and entering that the state is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. The unfortunate consequence is that the ambiguous nature of the structure involved may leave the state in a position where it is unable to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the structure is occupied, but it is also unable to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the structure is unoccupied. This, despite the indisputable fact that the structure must be one or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 32} So, in a situation like the one before us, where there is sufficient evidence to prove that a defendant has used force, stealth, or deception to trespass in a structure, with a purpose to commit a felony or a theft offense, he cannot be convicted of either burglary or breaking and entering, despite the fact that he has necessarily committed one or the other of those offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 33} It would seem to me that the General Assembly could avoid this unsatisfactory situation by eliminating the word \u201cunoccupied\u201d from the phrase \u201cunoccupied structure\u201d in R.C. 2911.13(A). Thus, one who uses force, stealth, or deception to trespass in a structure, for the purpose of committing therein a felony or a theft offense, will necessarily be guilty of breaking and entering, and if the structure is occupied, the offender will be guilty of the greater offense of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 34} The only problem with this fix is an allied-offenses-of-similar-import problem. If the breaking-and-entering offense were reworded in the manner I have suggested, it would not actually be a lesser included offense of Burglary. This is because it would be possible to commit burglary without committing breaking and entering, if the offender\u2019s purpose were to commit upon the premises a misdemeanor offense other than a theft offense. Thus, under a strict allied-offenses-of-similar-import analysis, one who uses force, stealth, or deception to trespass in an occupied structure, with a purpose to commit a felony or a theft offense therein, could be convicted of both burglary and breaking and entering, if the statute proscribing the latter were to be amended in the manner suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 35} If this problem were deemed serious enough to require a legislative fix, the General Assembly could either broaden the purpose requirement in the breaking-and-entering statute to include a purpose to commit any criminal offense, so it would then be a lesser included offense of burglary, or narrow the purpose requirement in the burglary statute to mirror the purpose requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>in the breaking-and-entering statute, so that breaking and entering would again become a lesser included offense of burglary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
