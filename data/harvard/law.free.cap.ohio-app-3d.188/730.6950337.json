Because there was no agreement to arbitrate, we hold that the trial court erred in compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 2} The parties entered into a written agreement for the sale of the Bowdens\u2019 insurance business to the Weickerts back in 1998. The agreement provided for a term of employment of Lee Bowden after the sale and contained various other terms and conditions addressing their prospective relationship. Among these terms was mandatory arbitration and a 30-mile radius, 10-year agreement by Lee Bowden not to compete with the Weickerts\u2019 newly acquired business. The parties\u2019 ceaseless controversy erupted shortly after the ink dried.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">{\u00b6 3} In <em>Bowden v. Weickert </em>(May 18, 2001), 6th Dist. No. S-00-039, 2001 WL 536818 <em>(\u201cBowden I </em>\u201d), we upheld the trial court\u2019s referral of the parties\u2019 dispute to arbitration after a failed meditation attempt. In <em>Bowden v. Weickert, </em>6th Dist. No. S-02-017, 2003-Ohio-3223, 2003 WL 21419175 <em>(\u201cBowden II </em>\u201d), we invalidated the first arbitration award because it was improper for the same individual who unsuccessfully mediated the dispute to serve as the arbitrator. The dispute was then referred to a different arbitrator. The second arbitrator found substantial performance of the parties\u2019 primary undertaking, which was the sale of the business. But the arbitrator ruled that both sides had so materially violated their prospective obligations as to constitute mutual rescission. The trial court confirmed the arbitration award. In <em>Bowden v. Weickert, </em>6th Dist. No. S-05-009, 2006-Ohio-471, 2006 WL 259642 <em>(\u201cBowden III\u201d), </em>we affirmed, effectively upholding the ruling that the parties had abandoned their future performance obligations set forth in the original purchase agreement. Id. at \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">{\u00b6 4} In addition, we held that the noncompete agreement survived. Id. at \u00b6 57. To be clear, the parties consummated the sale and abandoned all further obligations, one to the other, save for the single commitment not to compete. We were explicit that \u201ctoday\u2019s decision puts an end to the arbitration proceedings required by the original purchase agreement.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">{\u00b6 5} In the aftermath of <em>Bowden III, </em>plaintiffs-appellants (the Weickerts) brought the present action seeking damages for Lee Bowden\u2019s breach of the noncompete agreement. Bowden demanded arbitration. The trial court stayed litigation of the Weickerts\u2019 claim and compelled arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>II. ARBITRABILITY OF CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 6} In their first assignment of error, appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe lower court erred in its amended judgment entry of June 17, 2009 which \u2018Affirms and Confirms\u2019 the arbitration award of September 12, 2008. The arbitrator award should not have been confirmed since it was in manifest disregard of this court\u2019s mandate, and unlawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">{\u00b6 8} We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">{\u00b6 9} In light of our holding in <em>Bowden III, </em>it was reversible error for the trial court to compel arbitration because the prior agreement to arbitrate, along with all of the other unfulfilled terms of the purchase agreement, was abandoned. See <em>United Steelworkers of Am. v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co. </em>(1960), 363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (\u201carbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit\u201d); <em>Dantz v. Apple Ohio, L.L.C. </em>(N.D.Ohio 2003), 277 F.Supp.2d 794, 800 (\u201cThe determinative factor of whether an arbitration provision can be enforced to settle a dispute is the existence of a contract between the parties demonstrating that they intended for such to be the case. * * * That determination is made with reference to state-law contract principles\u201d); <em>Perry v. Thomas </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 483, 492, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 96 L.Ed.2d 426, fn. 9. See also <em>Floss v. Ryan\u2019s Family Steak Houses, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 211 F.3d 306, 314; <em>Orcutt v. Kettering Radiologists, Inc. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2002), 199 F.Supp.2d 746, 750-751; <em>Toledo Police Patrolman\u2019s Assn., Local 10, IUPA, AFL-CIO-CLC v. Toledo </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 450, 713 N.E.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">{\u00b6 10} Accordingly, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">III. EXPIRATION OF NONCOMPETE AGREEMENT PENDING WHILE ITS ENFORCEMENT IS LITIGATED</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">{\u00b6 11} In their second assignment of error, appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe lower court erred in confirming the arbitration award which incorrectly failed to extend the terms of appellee Bowden\u2019s non-compete agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">{\u00b6 13} We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">{\u00b6 14} We have held that a noncompete agreement cannot expire in litigation while the enforceability of the agreement is being litigated. <em>Trim-Line of Toledo v. Carroll </em>(Feb. 25, 1987), 6th Dist. No. L-86-176, 1987 WL 7056; <em>Homan, Inc. v. A1 AG Servs., L.L.C., </em>175 Ohio App.3d 51, 2008-Ohio-277, 885 N.E.2d 253, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>{\u00b6 15} But here, the arbitrator specifically found that \u201cLee Bowden had not substantially breached the non-compete agreement as of May 26, 2004.\u201d In <em>Bowden III, </em>we held that the \u201coriginal 10-year, 30-mile non-compete provision in the purchase agreement was not terminated or abbreviated by the arbitrator\u2019s decision, and it remains in effect.\u201d <em>Bowden III </em>at \u00b6 58. Thus, the rationale set forth in <em>Trim-Line </em>does not apply to extend the duration of the noncompete agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">IV. AWARD OF COSTS IS INAPPROPRIATE</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">{\u00b6 17} In their third assignment of error, appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe lower court erred in awarding costs to appellees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">{\u00b6 19} We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">{\u00b6 20} Appellants\u2019 claim for damages resulting from appellees\u2019 tortious interference remains pending before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">{\u00b6 21} Since there are no further arbitration proceedings required by the original purchase agreement, there is no reason for a stay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But since issues remain to be litigated in the trial court, an award of costs at this time is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">{\u00b6 23} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The arbitration award is vacated, and the order staying the Weickerts\u2019 claim is vacated. This case is remanded to the trial court for adjudication of the Weickerts\u2019 claim for breach of the noncompete agreement. Appellants and appellees shall share equally the court costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b767-15\">Osowik, P.J., and Handwork, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-16\">.
