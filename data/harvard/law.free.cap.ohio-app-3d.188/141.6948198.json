Besancon told the trooper that he was on his way to a livestock auction and that he was using the trailer to transport cattle to the auction. The municipal court found him guilty of failure to display a license plate in violation of R.C. 4503.21(A). Besancon has appealed, arguing that he did not have to display a license plate on the trailer because it was \u201c[f]arm machinery\u201d under R.C. 4501.01(U). This court reverses his conviction because the trailer was \u201cfarm machinery\u201d and, therefore, he did not have to display a license plate under R.C. 4503.21(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">A TRAILER IS A MOTOR VEHICLE</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">{\u00b6 2} Under R.C. 4503.21(A), \u201c[n]o person who is the owner or operator of a motor vehicle shall fail to display in plain view on the * * * rear of the motor vehicle the distinctive number and registration mark * * * furnished by the director of public safety * * *.\u201d The issue in this case is whether the trailer that Besancon was pulling is a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d as that term is used in R.C. 4503.21. \u201c[WJhether a particular vehicle falls within a definition of a \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 is normally a question of law.\u201d <em>Muenchenbach v. Preble Cty. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 141, 148, 742 N.E.2d 1128, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">{\u00b6 3} R.C. 4501.01(B) defines the term \u201c[m]otor vehicle\u201d for purposes of a number of chapters of the Ohio Revised Code, including Chapter 4503. Accordingly, \u201c[m]otor vehicle,\u201d as used in R.C. 4503.21(A), \u201cmeans any vehicle * * * that is propelled or drawn by power other than muscular power or power collected from overhead electric trolley wires.\u201d R.C. 4501.01(B). R.C. 4503.01 adds trailers to the definition of \u201c[mjotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of certain sections of the Revised Code, including R.C. 4503.21. \u201cTrailer,\u201d as used in R.C. 4503.01, means \u201cany vehicle without motive power that is designed or used for carrying property or persons wholly on its own structure and for being drawn by a motor vehicle * * * [including] a vehicle used to transport agricultural produce or agricultural production materials between a local place of storage or supply and the farm when drawn or towed on a public road or highway at a speed greater than twenty-five miles per hour.\u201d R.C. 4501.01(M). Unless excluded, therefore, a trailer, including a trailer used for certain agricultural purposes, is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of R.C. 4503.21(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>FARM MACHINERY IS NOT A MOTOR VEHICLE</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 4} Although the term \u201c[m]otor vehicle\u201d is broadly defined by R.C. 4501.01(B), that section specifically excludes a number of things that would otherwise fall within its broad definition, including \u201cfarm machinery.\u201d R.C. 4501.01(B). Because the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d as used in R.C. 4503.21(A), is defined by 4501.01(B) and 4503.01, the exceptions listed in R.C. 4501.01(B) also apply to 4503.21(A). If the trailer Besancon was pulling is \u201cfarm machinery,\u201d therefore, it is not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of R.C. 4503.21(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">BESANCON\u2019S LIVESTOCK TRAILER</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 5} The state has argued that Besancon had to display a license plate on his livestock trailer under R.C. 4503.21(A) because it was a \u201ctrailer\u201d under R.C. 4503.01. Besancon has argued that he did not need to display a license plate on it because it was \u201c[f]arm machinery\u201d under R.C. 4501.01(U).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">{\u00b6 6} This court will start with Besancon\u2019s argument that the livestock trailer was \u201cfarm machinery.\u201d Under R.C. 4501.01(U), \u201c \u2018[f]arm machinery\u2019 means all machines and tools that are used in the production, harvesting, and care of farm products, and includes trailers that are used to transport agricultural produce or agricultural production materials between a local place of storage or supply and the farm * * Besancon has argued that the livestock trailer is a \u201cmachine[ ] [or] tool[ ] that [is] used in the production, harvesting, and care of farm products.\u201d He has also argued that it is a \u201ctrailer[ ] * * * used to transport agricultural produce or agricultural production materials between a local place of storage or supply and the farm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">{\u00b6 7} Regarding whether the livestock trailer is a \u201ctrailer[ ] * * * used to transport agricultural produce or agricultural production materials between a local place of storage or supply and the farm,\u201d this court notes that R.C. Chapter 4501 does not define \u201cagricultural produce,\u201d \u201cagricultural production materials,\u201d \u201cstorage,\u201d or \u201csupply.\u201d Whenever the term \u201cagriculture\u201d is used in most sections of the Revised Code, however, it includes \u201canimal husbandry, including, but not limited to, the care and raising of livestock.\u201d R.C. 1.61. As used in R.C. Chapter 929, \u201c \u2018Agricultural production\u2019 means commercial aquaculture, apiculture, animal husbandry, or poultry husbandry; the production for a commercial purpose of timber, field crops, tobacco, fruits, vegetables, nursery stock, ornamental shrubs, ornamental trees, flowers, or sod; * * * or any combination of such husbandry, production, or growth; and includes the processing, drying, storage, and marketing of agricultural products when those activities are conducted in conjunction with such husbandry, production, or growth.\u201d' R.C. 929.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">{\u00b6 8} If the Revised Code does not define a term, this court may look to its dictionary definition. <em>Dairy Farmers of Am., Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 100, 2004-Ohio-321, 802 N.E.2d 627, at \u00b6 18-19 (referring to dictionary for definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201cdairy production\u201d). A dictionary definition of \u201cproduce\u201d is \u201cla 1: something that is brought forth or yielded either naturally or as a result of effort and work * * * 2: agricultural products * * * 3: the progeny usu. of a female animal.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) 1810. A dictionary definition of \u201cstorage\u201d is \u201cla: space for storing * * * 2a: the act of storing or state of being stored * * * b: the price charged for keeping goods in a storehouse * * * c: the holding and housing of goods from the time they are produced until their sale.\u201d Id. at 2252. A definition of \u201csupply\u201d is \u201c1: assistance, succour, aid 2: something that supplies or is supplied to a person or thing * * * d: the quantity or amount (as of a commodity) needed or available * * * e: items or a quantity * * * available for use, exploitation, or development * * * 4a: the quantity of goods and services offered for sale at various prices * * * 5: something that contains, delivers, maintains, or regulates a supply.\u201d Id. at 2297.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">{\u00b6 9} We conclude that the cattle Besancon was hauling were \u201cagricultural produce\u201d under R.C. 4501.01(U) because they were the progeny of livestock animals. We further conclude that the auction house is a \u201cplace of * * * supply\u201d under that section because it is a location at which goods are offered for sale at various prices. A magistrate found that Besancon was using the livestock trailer to transport cattle to an auction house. Besancon, therefore, was using it to transport agricultural produce between a local place of supply and his farm. Accordingly, it was farm machinery under R.C. 4501.01(U). Under R.C. 4501.01(U), there are no limitations regarding the speed below which a vehicle must operate to be considered farm machinery. The fact that Besancon was allegedly going faster than 25 .miles per hour at the time he was stopped, therefore, does not take his livestock trailer outside the definition of farm machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">{\u00b6 10} The state has argued that, even if the livestock trailer is \u201cfarm machinery,\u201d Besancon cannot take advantage of that exception to the definition of motor vehicle under R.C. 4501.01(B) because R.C. 4503.01 specifically adds the term \u201ctrailer\u201d to the definition of motor vehicle for purposes of R.C. 4503.21. According to the state, it is undisputed that Besancon was travelling over 25 miles per hour and that, therefore, his livestock trailer was a \u201ctrailer\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4503.01 because it was \u201ca vehicle used to transport agricultural produce or agricultural production materials between a local place of storage or supply and the farm [being] drawn or towed on a public road or highway at a speed greater than twenty-five miles per hour.\u201d R.C. 4501.01(M).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">{\u00b6 11} Just because R.C. 4503.01 adds the term \u201ctrailer\u201d to the definition of \u201c[m]otor vehicle\u201d for purposes of R.C. 4503.21, however, does not mean that the \u201cfarm machinery\u201d exception found in R.C. 4501.01(B) no longer applies. The fact that R.C. 4503.01 adds trailers to the definition of motor vehicle indicates that trailers are not otherwise within the definition of motor vehicle under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>4501.01(B). The definition of \u201cfarm machinery\u201d incorporated into R.C. 4501.01(B), however, includes \u201ctrailers that are used to transport agricultural produce or agricultural production materials between a local place of storage or supply and the farm.\u201d R.C. 4501.01(U). If the exceptions listed in R.C. 4501.01(B) applied only to sections of the Code unmodified by R.C. 4503.01\u2019s incorporation of \u201ctrailer\u201d into the definition of motor vehicle, there would be no need for the definition of farm machinery to include a type of trailer because, under the general definition provided in R.C. 4501.01(B), a trailer could never be a motor vehicle. The state\u2019s argument would make the inclusion of a type of trailer in the definition of farm machinery superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 12} The state has noted that R.C. 4503.04 provides a registration fee for \u201cfarm trucks\u201d and that the definition of farm truck includes trailers that transport livestock. R.C. 4503.04(J), (K), and (P)(3). Citing those provisions, it has argued that Besancon\u2019s trader is not exempt from registration under R.C. 4503.19. Even if the state is correct that Besancon had to register the livestock trailer under R.C. 4503.04 and 4503.19, that is not the issue in this case. R.C. 4503.21 involves whether a person is required to display a license plate and only applies to someone \u201cwho is the owner or operator of a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 13} Besancon\u2019s livestock trailer is both a \u201ctrailer\u201d as that term is defined by R.C. 4501.01(M) and \u201cfarm machinery\u201d as that term is defined by R.C. 4501.01(U). Under R.C. 2901.04(A), \u201csections of the Revised Code defining offenses * * * shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d In reading R.C. 4501.01 and 4503.01 together in a light most favorable to Besancon, we conclude that his livestock trailer was \u201cfarm machinery\u201d and that the farm-machinery exception provided in R.C. 4501.01(B) applies to the definition of motor vehicle under R.C. 4503.01 and 4503.21(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 14} The municipal court incorrectly determined that the \u201cfarm machinery\u201d exception to the definition of \u201c[mjotor vehicle\u201d under R.C. 4501.01(B) did not apply. Because the livestock trailer was farm machinery, it was not a motor vehicle under R.C. 4503.01 and 4503.21(A). Besancon, therefore, did not have to display a license plate on it. His assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">{\u00b6 15} A livestock trailer transporting cattle to an auction house is \u201cfarm machinery\u201d under R.C. 4501.01(U). The judgment of the Wayne County Municipal Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-11\">Moore and Belfance, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
