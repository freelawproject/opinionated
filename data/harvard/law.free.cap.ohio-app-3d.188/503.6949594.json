We dismiss Gregory\u2019s appeal and Mary\u2019s cross-appeal for lack of a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">{\u00b6 2} Under the terms of the parties\u2019 2006 divorce decree, Mary was designated as the legal custodian and residential parent of the parties\u2019 two minor children, and Gregory was granted visitation. Gregory was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $1,051.18 per month plus 8.8 percent of any bonus that he received and one-half of the parties\u2019 eldest child\u2019s private-school tuition. He was also ordered to pay Mary spousal support for five years (or until she remarried or began cohabitating with an unrelated person) in the amount of $2,000 per month plus 80 percent of any bonus that he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>{\u00b6 3} On May 22, 2008, the Warren County Child Support Enforcement Agency (\u201cCSEA\u201d) issued an administrative decision recommending that Gregory\u2019s monthly child-support obligation be reduced to $525.59 since the parties\u2019 eldest child had turned 18 years old, was on track to graduate from high school on June 2, 2008, and thus would become emancipated on that date. The CSEA\u2019s administrative recommendation triggered the filing of numerous motions by both parties in the Warren County Domestic Relations Court, in which they requested, among other things, a modification of child and spousal support, with Mary requesting an increase, and Gregory, a decrease, in both amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 4} In August 2009, the magistrate issued a decision increasing Gregory\u2019s monthly child- and spousal-support obligations to $691.09 and $3,125, respectively, but terminating his obligation to pay a percentage of his bonuses as additional child and spousal support. The magistrate also found Gregory in contempt for failing to pay the appropriate amount of support on his bonus payments and his share of the parties\u2019 eldest child\u2019s tuition. The magistrate determined that Gregory owed Mary $11,391.04 in additional child- and spousal-support payments on his bonuses less any payments made by him to date, $1,507.97 in tuition payments, and $6,500 for a portion of her attorney fees. The magistrate concluded by noting that Gregory \u201cmay have an arrearage (or an overpayment) with regard to on-going spousal and child support as will be determined by a C.S.E.A. audit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 5} In January 2010, the trial court issued what it declared to be a final, appealable order, partially sustaining two of Gregory\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision but overruling the parties\u2019 remaining objections and adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision, as amended, as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 6} Gregory appeals, and Mary cross-appeals, from the trial court\u2019s order, raising seven assignments of error and five cross-assignments of error. Before addressing the assignments of error, we consider whether the trial court\u2019s order was, in fact, a final, appealable order, as the trial court claimed it to be. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 7} Gregory argues that the trial court erred when it failed or refused to allow the CSEA to perform a new audit of his child- and spousal-support accounts after it misconstrued one of his objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision in which he had argued that the magistrate erred by not directing the CSEA to conduct the new audit <em>before </em>issuing a decision on the question of arrearages or overages on his support accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 8} In February 2009, Gregory filed a motion requesting that the CSEA be directed to audit his child-support account to determine the total amount of his overpayments for child support after the parties\u2019 eldest child became emancipated. In its August 2009 decision, the magistrate sustained Gregory\u2019s motion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>directed, the CSEA to conduct a new audit of his child- and spousal-support accounts and to advise the parties of the results. Gregory filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision, arguing that the magistrate should have ordered the CSEA to conduct a new audit of his support accounts <em>before </em>making any finding against him on the question of arrearages or overages. He also argued that his \u201coverpayment towards support of the [parties\u2019] emancipated child should wipe out any arrearages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court overruled Gregory\u2019s objection, finding that if Gregory wished to have an audit performed by CSEA, it was his duty to have the audit \u201cperformed prior to trial,\u201d and since he failed to do so, he was not \u201centitled to a \u2018second bite at the apple\u2019 after the Magistrate\u2019s Decision.\u201d The trial court added, \u201cShould the Court allow an audit to be performed at this time, it would make a mockery of the system as no judgment would ever be final,\u201d and therefore, the trial court \u201cdecline[d] to grant an audit.\u201d However, the trial court appears to have overlooked the fact that at least five months before the magistrate issued a decision in this matter, Gregory requested that the CSEA be directed to perform a new audit of his child- and spousal-support accounts; the magistrate sustained that request and directed the CSEA to conduct such an audit. Moreover, when the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, it implicitly upheld the magistrate\u2019s directive to the CSEA to perform a new audit of Gregory\u2019s child- and spousal-support accounts, even though the trial court had stated that allowing \u201can audit to be performed at this time * * * would make a mockery of the system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 10} The inconsistency in the trial court\u2019s order strongly suggests that the trial court misunderstood Gregory\u2019s objection: Gregory was not arguing that the magistrate erred by not directing the CSEA to conduct a new audit of his child- and spousal-support accounts \u2014 indeed, the magistrate already had done so in her decision \u2014 rather, he was arguing that the magistrate should not have made any decision regarding the issue of arrearages or overages on his support accounts until the CSEA had conducted a new audit of his support accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 11} Mary contends that the trial court did not prohibit the CSEA from conducting a new audit of Gregory\u2019s support accounts, and Gregory has represented in his brief that while this appeal was pending, the CSEA did, in fact, conduct a new audit of his child- and spousal-support accounts. However, the trial court\u2019s order creates confusion regarding whether the trial court meant simply to overrule Gregory\u2019s objection on the timing of the new audit <em>or </em>whether the trial court meant to prohibit, altogether, the CSEA from performing a new audit of Gregory\u2019s support accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 12} Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution grants courts of appeals jurisdiction \u201cas may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders\u201d of the trial courts within their appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>district. This constitutional provision is implemented, primarily, by R.C. 2505.02, which defines the types of orders that constitute a \u201cfinal order.\u201d If an order appealed from is not final and appealable, a court of appeals has no jurisdiction to rule on the appeal and must dismiss it, sua sponte, even if no party has raised the issue. <em>Curry v. Blanchester, </em>Clinton App. Nos. CA2008-07-024 and CA2008-07028, 2009-Ohio-1649, 2009 WL 903837, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court did not cite the Revised Code section under which it found its order to be final and appealable, but it appears that the only categories of final orders listed in R.C. 2505.02(B) that may have relevance to this case are the ones in set forth in R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) and (2), which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">{\u00b6 17} A \u201c[substantial right\u201d is defined as \u201ca right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or-protect.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">{\u00b6 18} The trial court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision that left unresolved the question whether an arrearage or overage exists in Gregory\u2019s child- or spousal-support accounts, and if so, its amount, is not a final order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) because it is not an order \u201cthat in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. A &amp; D Ltd. Partnership v. Keefe </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 50, 52, 671 N.E.2d 13. The evidence shows that the amount of Gregory\u2019s overpayment for child support between June 2, 2008, the date of the parties\u2019 eldest child\u2019s emancipation, and April 14, 2009, the date of the final hearing held before the magistrate, is significant and could affect such decisions as whether Gregory should be held in contempt for not complying with the trial court\u2019s previous support orders, and if so, the sanction that should be imposed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">{\u00b6 19} The trial court\u2019s order also does not fall under the category of final orders set forth in R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). Orders issued in postdecree proceedings may be final orders under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) if they \u201caffect} ] a substantial right made * * * upon a summary application in an action after judgment.\u201d Id. However, an order \u201caffects\u201d a substantial right only if it has \u201cimmediate consequences,\u201d <em>Walburn v. Dunlap, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 373, 2009-Ohio-1221, 904 N.E.2d 863, \u00b6 24, or is one that \u201cif not immediately appealable, would foreclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>appropriate relief in the future.\u201d <em>Southside Community Dev. Corp. v. Levin, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1209, 2007-Ohio-6665, 878 N.E.2d 1048, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 20} In this ease, the trial court\u2019s order does not have immediate consequences because it left undecided the question whether an arrearage or overage exists on Gregory\u2019s child- and spousal-support accounts, and if so, its amount. That issue will not be decided until the CSEA conducts a new audit of Gregory\u2019s support accounts, because it has been directed to do by the magistrate\u2019s decision, which the trial court implicitly affirmed. Moreover, requiring the parties to wait to appeal the decisions made in the trial court\u2019s order would not foreclose appropriate relief in the future. Consequently, the order from which Gregory appealed and Mary cross-appealed is not one that affects their \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d and thus was not a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 21} In light of the foregoing, this cause is dismissed for lack of a final, appealable order, and the assignments of error are rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-8\">Bressler, P.J., and Hendrickson, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
