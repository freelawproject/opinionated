In addition, Smitherman sought a declaratory judgment that the city manager has the full right and authority under R.C. 3735.27(B)(1)(b) to appoint members to the board, and that the city council has no authority to review, approve, or otherwise limit any such appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent-appellant, the city of Cincinnati, now appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment granting declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorney fees, to Smitherman.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>The Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 3} The Cincinnati Metropolitan Housing Authority (\u201cCMHA\u201d) is governed by a five-member board of commissioners. Pursuant to R.C. 3735.27(B)(1)(b), one member is appointed by the probate court, one member is appointed by the court of common pleas, one member is appointed by the board of county commissioners, and two of the board\u2019s members are appointed by the chief executive officer of the most populous city in the district. With respect to the CMHA, the city of Cincinnati is the most populous city in the district, and its chief executive officer is the city manager. Thus, two of the CMHA board members are appointed by the city manager, each for a five-year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 4} On December 7, 2008, the five-year term of Don Driehaus, one of the two CMHA board members appointed by Cincinnati\u2019s city manager, expired, thereby making that seat available for an appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">{\u00b6 5} On December 10, 2008, at a meeting of Cincinnati\u2019s city council, seven council members presented a motion seeking the city manager\u2019s reappointment of Driehaus to another five-year term as a CMHA board member. But the city\u2019s mayor ruled the motion out of order, so no vote was taken on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">{\u00b6 6} A second motion seeking the city manager\u2019s reappointment of Driehaus was presented and approved by the council. In addition, the council considered and passed Ordinance No. 419-2008, which required the council\u2019s confirmation of any person appointed by the city manager to boards or commissions not within the city\u2019s executive operations. In the ordinance itself, the council recognized that \u201cthere is currently no procedure in place which allows [c]ouncil to confirm appointments made by the [c]ity [m]anager pursuant to state or local law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">{\u00b6 7} The ordinance stated the following: \u201cSection 1. That council hereby requires that as permitted by law, with regard to any individuals who are being considered for appointment by the City Manager to any boards or commissions independent of the administrative or executive operations of the City of Cincinnati, the City Manager shall initially submit the names of such individuals to City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Council at least seven days prior to appointment to allow for Council confirmation of such individuals, but providing that such confirmation procedure would not be applicable to any appointments related to the executive and administrative authority of the City Manager to direct the operations of the City under his or her authority under the Charter of the City of Cincinnati.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cSection 2. That this ordinance shall be an emergency measure necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety and general welfare and shall * * * be effective immediately. The reason for the emergency is the immediate need to ensure that a procedure allowing for Council confirmation of applicable appointments to be made by the City Manager be implemented at the earliest possible time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">{\u00b6 9} The city manager, since his hiring in August 2006, had not appointed anyone to any board or commission independent of the internal administrative or executive functions of the city. Moreover, the city stipulated that the city manager was not aware of any such boards to which he would make appointments in his capacity as the city manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">{\u00b6 10} In a memorandum dated December 11, 2008, the city solicitor advised Cincinnati\u2019s mayor that the city council \u201cmay not enact legislation that contradicts a mandatory state law regarding an appointment procedure for a state-created entity\u201d like CMHA. The solicitor warned that the city\u2019s attempt to deviate from the state-mandated method of appointment to the CMHA would expose the city to litigation regarding the legality of the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">{\u00b6 11} On December 12, 2008, the city manager appointed Lacretia Carter to the board of the CMHA. The position to which Carter was appointed was not the seat left vacant by Driehaus.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">{\u00b6 12} On January 15, 2009, Richard Rust, the interim executive director of the CMHA, advised the city that the board refused to seat Carter as a board member \u201cuntil either (1) the court resolves the controversy surrounding the city ordinance in the Smitherman suit, or (2) City Council approves her appointment.\u201d Rust notified Carter that until the lawsuit was resolved, \u201cit is presumed that the [c]ouncil\u2019s ordinance is lawful and that CMHA must abide by what appears to be their decision to be the official appointing body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">{\u00b6 13} At some point, when it was determined that Carter had been appointed three days before the effective date of Ordinance 419-2008, the CMHA withdrew its earlier refusal to seat Carter on the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">{\u00b6 14} On December 15, 2008, relator-appellee, Christopher Smitherman, tendered a written request to the city solicitor to apply, in the name of the city, for an injunction under R.C. 733.56 to restrain the city council from illegally requiring the city manager to submit names of prospective CMHA board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>appointees to the council for review and confirmation. Despite his earlier opinion that the council\u2019s attempt to usurp the city manager\u2019s appointment authority was improper and would expose the city to litigation, the city solicitor rejected Smitherman\u2019s request. So Smitherman instituted a taxpayer suit in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">{\u00b6 15} In its motion to dismiss the action, the city indicated to the court that it was \u201cwilling to participate in a proper declaratory judgment with all necessary parties.\u201d The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Smitherman. In addition, the court entered a permanent injunction enjoining the city from undertaking any efforts to apply or otherwise enforce Ordinance 419-2008 as it relates to appointments by the city manager to the board of the CMHA. The court awarded attorney fees to Smitherman. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">{\u00b6 17} In four assignments of error, the city argues that the trial court erred by (1) granting attorney fees, (2) denying the city\u2019s motion to dismiss, (3) granting summary judgment in favor of Smitherman, and (4) issuing an injunction. We address the assignments of error out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">{\u00b6 18} In its second assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss Smitherman\u2019s action. The city argues that Smitherman had no personal stake in the case\u2019s outcome and, therefore, had no standing to obtain a declaratory judgment. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">{\u00b6 19} A taxpayer has standing to enforce a public right, regardless of a private or personal benefit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The right to bring a taxpayer action is a right conferred by statute. If the city solicitor fails, upon a written request, to seek to enjoin the misapplication of city funds, the abuse of corporate powers, or the execution or performance of illegal contracts, R.C. 733.59 authorizes a taxpayer to institute suit in his own name on behalf of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">{\u00b6 20} In this case, the city solicitor refused Smitherman\u2019s written request to seek to enjoin the city council\u2019s attempt to restrict the city manager\u2019s power to make appointments to the CMHA board. So Smitherman instituted an action in his name, on behalf of the city. Under R.C. 733.59, Smitherman had standing to enforce a public right to the proper exercise of the city\u2019s corporate powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">\n<em>Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">{\u00b621} In its third assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Smitherman.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>{\u00b6 22} The city did not dispute that the application of Ordinance 419-2008 to the city manager\u2019s appointments to the CMHA board would contravene state law. As no genuine issues of material fact remained to be litigated, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Smitherman. We overrule the third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>The Injunction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">{\u00b6 23} In its fourth assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred by issuing an unnecessary injunction. We review the issuance of an injunction for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">{\u00b6 24} The city contends that the injunction sought by Smitherman was an extraordinary remedy in equity, available only where there was no adequate remedy at law. But the city is referring to a mandatory injunction, which has been described as \u201can extraordinary remedy that compels the defendant to restore a party\u2019s rights through an affirmative action.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">{\u00b6 25} The city misunderstands the distinction between prohibitory and mandatory injunctions. A prohibitory injunction \u201cpreserves the status quo by enjoining a defendant from performing the challenged acts in the future.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, Smitherman sought a prohibitory injunction, to restrain and prevent the abuse of corporate powers by the city, acting through its city council, to subject future appointments to the CMHA board to the advice and consent of the city council. Smitherman did not seek an extraordinary remedy. Thus, the city\u2019s argument that the injunction was an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">{\u00b6 26} Next, the city argues that an injunction was not warranted, because a declaratory judgment alone provided an adequate remedy at law. However, a prohibitory injunction and a declaratory judgment are not mutually exclusive remedies. A party may institute an action for a declaratory judgment <em>and </em>a prohibitory injunction to challenge legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">{\u00b6 27} We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by restraining the city from applying or otherwise enforcing Ordinance 419-2008 with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>appointments by the city manager to positions on the CMHA board of commissioners. Consequently, we overrule the fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">{\u00b6 28} In its first assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred by awarding attorney fees to Smitherman. Specifically, the city contends that attorney fees were prohibited by R.C. 2721.16 because Smitherman\u2019s suit was solely for a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">{\u00b6 29} It is true that \u201cR.C. 2721.16 specifically prohibits the award of attorney fees on a claim for declaratory relief unless another source of law explicitly provides for the award.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But Smitherman\u2019s suit sought more than declaratory relief. Pursuant to R.C. 733.59, he also sought an injunction to restrain the city from applying the provisions of Ordinance No. 419-2008 to any action by the city manager in appointing members to the CMHA board of commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> {\u00b6 30} R.C. 733.61 explicitly authorizes a court to award attorney fees to the taxpayer in a successful R.C. 733.59 suit. And the decision to award attorney fees rests entirely within the court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In exercising this discretion, the court should consider whether the case has resulted in a public benefit and whether the taxpayer had a reasonable basis to support his position.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The public benefit need not be monetary in character. \u201cThat benefit may be of a more intangible character, such as the prevention of illegal government activity.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">{\u00b6 31} The city does not dispute that Smitherman had a reasonable basis to support his position. Moreover, the city now agrees that the provisions of Ordinance No. 419-2008 cannot be enforced with respect to the city manager\u2019s appointments to the CMHA. But the city argues that no public benefit resulted from Smitherman\u2019s taxpayer suit, because the city had agreed not to enforce the new ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">{\u00b6 32} In this case, the trial court concluded that Smitherman\u2019s successful prosecution of the action had prevented illegal government activity in the form of \u201cthe assumption of power by the Cincinnati city council that it was not entitled to assume or exercise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The record reveals that (1) the city council intended the ordinance to apply to the CMHA board appointments, and (2) the CMHA had refused to seat an appointee absent a judicial resolution or the approval of the city council. The public benefitted from the court\u2019s prevention of illegal action by the city in the appointment process. The suit ensured that the city would refrain from abusing its corporate powers, and that the proper, statutorily mandated procedure would be followed in appointing the CMHA board members. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees to Smitherman.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">{\u00b6 34} We overrule the first assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-7\">Sundermann, P.J., and Hendon and Dinkelacker, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-14\">. <em>State ex rel.
