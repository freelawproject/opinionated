On the trial before the jury there was evidence tending to show that, after a cotton bill of lading had been forged and used as collateral for foreign drafts, the forger, having delivered to the carrier cotton of the same quantity, weights, numbers, marks, etc., obtained true bills of lading substantially identical with the forged bills, and thereafter, the true bills being suppressed, delivery was allowed to be made upon such forged bills, all with more or.less knowledge and consent on the part of inferior agents of the carrier. The case was submitted to the jury, and from an adverse verdict and judgment plaintiff sued out this writ of error. We doubt if there was sufficient evidence to warrant the submission of the case to the jury, but as it was submitted under instructions in which we find no reversible error, and as we find no error in any of the rulings admitting or rejecting evidence, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
