Soon after its formation it entered into a contract with the Tennessee Central Railroad Company to construct that railroad. It did construct the railroad, through subcontractors, and received in payment therefor securities of said Tennessee Central Railroad. -These securities, together with securities of the Nashville Terminal Company, constitute almost the entire assets of the alleged bankrupt. In addition to these it is the owner of certain subsidy bonds given by the city of Nashville, Tenn. Since the completion of the railroad' it has been engaged in no construction work. These securities constituted its only source of income, and for a long time prior to the filing of the petition its principal business consisted in endeavoring to conserve these assets and enhance their value. With this end in view attempts were made to reorganize the Tennessee Central Railroad.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-12\">McLaughlin, Russell, Coe &amp; Sprague, of New York City (Frederick C.

Section 2. The petition alleges that the Tennessee Construction Company \u201chas for the greater portion of the six months next preceding the date of the filing of the petition had its principal place of business in (the South<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u25a0ern District of New York).\u201d This averment was controverted, and the issue thus raised is the only one in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The Revised Statutes of Missouri provide (section 3035) that every corporation created or existing under the laws of that state shall have and keep a general office for the transaction of business, and shall have and keep such office within the state of Missouri. The burden of proving that the principal place of business of this Missouri corporation was in New York rests on the petitioning creditors, and we concur with Judge Mayer in the conclusion that .they have not sustained that burden. The proposition would, in. this case, .be difficult to prove, because for a long time past the corporation has practically not been doing any business, except to keep on living. Quite naturally the efforts towards that end have been located, in a sense, beneath the hats of the different officers and directors who, by interviewing different persons in different places, have tried to keep it alive. The residence of these individual officers seems .to us of no importance. The fact that once\u2014perhaps twice\u2014a directors\u2019 meeting was, as a matter of convenience, held in New York is insignificant. Nor is the \u201cheading\u201d of letters written by its officers in reference to its affairs at all persuasive. The \u201cheadings,\u201d like the rest of the letters, were type\u25a0written and usually gave the office address of the particular individual who wrote the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The estate of the alleged bankrupt corporation is now being administered in the courts of the state which created it, and there is nothing in this record which calls for any attempted interference with that administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
