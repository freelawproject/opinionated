Sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ilar circumstances were pleaded in the answer to the second count of the complaint in respect to the service of the fireman, Jenson, on extra train 1033; that train being tied up at Elliston, Mont. Both trains proceeded east from Missoula, the stations in their order being Bear-mouth, Drummond, Garrison, Avon, Elliston, and Blossberg, the last-named point being on the Rocky Mountain Divide which extends between Elliston and Helena. The answer further alleged that the delay in the movement of the trains in question and the necessity of watching and guarding their engines by the said firemen were occasioned by and due to the act of God and the result of causes which were not known to the defendant company, its officers or agents, at the time the trains left Missoula, and which could not have been foreseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\">The act in question in its first section specifies the common carriers to which its provisions are made applicable, and also declares that \u201cthe term \u2018employes\u2019 as used in this act shall be held to mean persons actually engaged in or connected with the movement of any train\u201d; sections 2 and 3 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">\u201cSec. 2. That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier, its officers or agents, subject to this act to require or permit any employ\u00e9 subject to this act to be or remain on duty for a longer period than sixteen consecutive hours, and whenever any such employ\u00e9 of such common carrier shall have been continuously on duty for sixteen hours he shall be relieved and not required or permitted again to go on duty until he has had at least ten consecutive hours off duty; and no such employ\u00e9 who has been on duty sixteen hours in the aggregate in any twenty-four-hour period shall be required or permitted to continue or again go on duty without having had at least eight consecutive hours off duty: Provided, that no operator, train dispatcher, or other employe who by the use of the telegraph or telephone dispatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers orders pertaining to or affecting train movements shall be required or permitted t\u00f3 be or remain on duty for a longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four-hour period in all towers, offices, places, and stations continuously operated night and day, nor for a longer period than thirteen hours in all towers, offices, places, and stations operated only during the daytime, except in case of emergency, when the employ\u00e9s named in this proviso may be permitted to be and remain on duty for four additional hours in a twenty-four-hour period on not exceeding three days in any week: Provided further, the Interstate Commerce Commission may after full hearing in a particular case and for good cause shown extend the period within which a common carrier shall comply with the provisions of this proviso as to such case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201cSec. 3. That any such common carrier, or any officer or agent thereof, requiring or permitting any employ\u00e9 to go, be, or remain on duty in violation of the second section hereof, shall be liable to a penalty of not to exceed five hundred dollars for each and every violation, to be recovered in a suit or suits to be brought by the United States district attorney in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction in the locality where such violation shall have been committed; and it shall be the duty of such district attorney to bring such suits upon satisfactory information being lodged with him; but no such suit shall be brought after the expiration of one year from the date of such violation; and it shall also be the duty of the Interstate Commerce Commission to lodge with the proper district attorneys information of any such violations as may come to its knowledge. In all prosecutions under this act the common carrier shall be deemed to have had knowledge of all acts of all its officers and agents: Provided, that the provisions of this act shall not apply in any case of casualty or unavoidable accident or the act of God; nor where the delay was the result of a cause not known to the carrier or iis officer or agent in charge of such employ\u00e9 at the time said employ\u00e9 left a terminal, and which could not have been foreseen: Provided fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tber, that the provisions of this act shall not apply to the crews of wrecking or relief trains.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">34 Stat. p. 1415.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The contention of the plaintiff in error is that, as in each of the present instances the train and engine were side-tracked within 16 hours and their crews laid off for rest, and that thereafter the respective firemen were placed in charge of their respective engines only for the purpose of keeping up the fires and steam and otherwise watching the engines, they were not during such time actually engaged in or actually connected with the movement of a train, and therefore were not permitted or required by the railroad company to be or remain on duty for a longer period than 16 hours within the meaning of the act of Congress; and the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 221 U. S. 612, 31 Sup. Ct. 621, 55 L. Ed. 878 is cited by counsel as sustaining that contention. We cannot take that view of that case. In so far as it bears upon the question we have here, we think the proper conclusion to be drawn from it is quite the reverse, and sustains our conclusion that the intent of the act was and is to compel rest for each member of the train\u2019s crew at the termination of the 16-hour period, to the end that his next and succeeding hours of service may be efficient. For in the case cited the court, at page 619 of 221 U. S., at page 625 of 31 Sup. Ct. (55 L. Ed. 878) distinctly says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201cThe length of hours of service has direct relation to the efficiency of the human agencies upon which protection of life and property necessarily depends. This has been repeatedly emphasized in official reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and is a matter so plain as to require no elaboration. In its power suitably to provide for the safety of employes and travelers, Congress was not limited to the enactment of laws relating to mechanical appliances, but it was also competent to consider, and to endeavor to reduce, the dangers incident to the strain of excessive hours of duty on the part of engineers, conductors, train dispatchers, telegraphers, and other persons embraced within the class defined by the act. And in imposing restrictions having reasonable relation to this end there is no interference with liberty of contract as guaranteed by the Constitution. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. McGuire, 219 U. S. 549 [31 Sup. Ct. 259, 55 L. Ed. 328]. If then it be assumed, as it must be, that in the furtherance of its purpose Congress can limit the hours of labor of employes engaged in interstate transportation, it follows that this power cannot be defeated either by prolonging the period of service through other requirements of the carriers or by the commingling of duties relating to interstate and intrastate operations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">See, also, United States v. Great Northern Railway Co. (D. C.) 206 Fed. 838; United States v. Missouri-Pacific Railway Co. (D. C.) Id. 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">7. [2] That the present case does not come within either of the provisions of the act, declaring that it \u201cshall not apply in any case of casualty or unavoidable accident or the act of God; nor where the delay was the result of a cause not known to the carrier or its officer or agent in charge of such employ\u00e9 at the time said employ\u00e9 left a terminal, and which could not have been foreseen,\u201d is obvious, if for no other reason, because the uncontradicted evidence, as well as the answer of the defendant company itself, shows that each of the trains in question was stopped by direction of the railroad company, side<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tracked, and their respective crews laid off for rest within 16 hours from the time they left Missoula, for the very purpose of complying with the said statute, excepting only the two named firemen, who were continued at a duty which the company claims was not within the inhibition of the law; the mistake made was its own mistake in continuing one of each of the crews, the fireman, at the duty of' watching the engines.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
