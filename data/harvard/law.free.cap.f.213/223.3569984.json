Clip, etc., Co. v. Steel, etc., Go., 209 Fed- 874. \u2018 The Concrete Company seems to have been acting strictly within its legal rights, so that the only question for consideration now is whether the court below exercised its discretion properly in refusing, a preliminary injunction. An examination of the record discloses no good reason for criticism, and leads us to conclude that the decree complained of should be sustained. As appears from Judge Thompson\u2019s opinion, the injunction was refused upon the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">\u201cIt nowhere appears on the record that the notices given to the plaintiff\u2019s customers were not in good faith, or that they were false or malicious, or for the purpose of destroying the business of the plaintiff. To the contrary, the defendant, so far as appears, believing \"its claims to be valid,' has proceeded to bring suit in this district to establish infringement. Under these circumstances, it must be held for the purposes of the present motion that the defendant is acting within its rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The <em>motion to </em>dismiss is refused, and the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
