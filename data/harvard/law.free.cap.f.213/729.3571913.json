And, even if the officers referred to in the petition or any other officers of the government had authority to make the contract mentioned in the petition, so as to bind the government, respondents deny that any such contract was ever made by them, or any of them, on behalf of the government, and especially deny that there was ever any final conclusion and meeting of minds and contract relative to the matters set out in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b746-10\">\u201cAnd should this court hold that there was ever any authority on behalf of any of the officers of the government to make such a contract as alleged in the petition, and that the contract therein alleged was duly made and perfected, all of which respondents deny, respondents deny all the items of damages claimed in the petition, and especially aver that the rental of the barge referred to in the petition was unnecessary and useless, and that the barge was rented at a time before the selection of the point where the building was to be placed, and at a time when the plaintiff in this case well knew that the quarantine officer at the mouth of the Mississippi river had refused to allow him to erect a building at any point on that reservation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b746-11\">\u201cAnd respondents aver that the erection of the buildings referred to in the petition upon the quarantine reservation .would have interfered with the administration of the United States quarantine laws and regulations, and would have been detrimental to the public health and marine hospital service and against the interest and public policy of the United States, and for these reasons said building could not be permitted upon said reservation, and any pretended agreement for the erection of such building on said reservation was null and void. Wherefore, considering the premises, respondents pray that the demand of the plaintiff herein be rejected at his costs, and for all and general relief. [Signed] Charlton R. Beattie, U. S.

Assuming that the findings of fact made by the trial judge substantially cover the issues made by the pleadings, the effect thereof, properly construed, is that the contract of lease as alleged was entered into between Doullut and the United States in so far as the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to enter into such a lease, and the question is presented whether Doullut is entitled to have judgment against the United States for darqages as found resulting from breach of the contract. By demurrer, and in the answer, contention is made that the contract upon which the plaintiff below bases his suit was unauthorized by law, and that the United States is not bound thereby nor liable for any damages growing out of the breach thereof. No law authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to make any contract of lease for a period of five years is pointed out or even suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes (U.

United States, 155 U. S. 489, 15 Sup. Ct. 174, 39 L. Ed. 234,- the Supreme Court held a contract with the Postmaster General for a lease of a post office for a term of 20 years was without authority, and created no liability against the United States. In the opinion of the court Mr. Justice Harlan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-11\">\u201cBy the law in force when the lease sued on was executed, it was made the duty of the Postmaster General \u2018to establish post offices.\u2019 By section 3732 of the Revised Statutes it is provided, as did, substantially, the statutes in force when the lease was made, that \u2018no contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made unless the same is authorized by law, or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment, except in the War and Navy Departments, for clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, or transportation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>which, however, shall not exceed the necessities of the current year.\u2019 Act March 3, 1825, c. 64, \u00a7 1, 4 Stat. 102; Act March 2, 1861, c. 84, \u00a7 10, 12 Stat. 220.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">\u201cMuch stress is placed by counsel for the plaintiff upon the clause making it the duty of the Postmaster General to establish post offices; the contention being that the power to establish a post office carries with it authority to lease rooms or a building in which the postmaster may conduct the business of his office. In support of this position Ware v. United States, 4 Wall. 617 [18 L. Ed. 389] is cited. But that case does not justify any such interpretation of the act of Congress. The question there was as to the power of the Postmaster General to discontinue a post office that had once been established by him under the authority conferred by the act of 1835 (4 Stat. 102) \u2018to .establish post offices.\u2019 This court, observing that the power to discontinue post offices is incident to the power to establish them, unless there was some provision in the acts of Congress restraining its exercise, said: \u2018Undoubtedly, Congress might discontinue a post office which they had previously established by law, and it is difficult to see why the Postmaster General may not do the same thing when acting under an act of Congress, expressed in the very words of the Constitution from which Congress derives its power.\u2019 Again: \u2018Power to establish post offices and post roads is conferred upon Congress, but the policy of the government from the time the general post office was established has been to delegate the power to designate the places where the mail shall be received and delivered to the Postmaster General.\u2019 P. 632.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201cThere was no issue in that case as to the extent of the authority of the Postmaster General to bind the government by contract for the payment of money or for the lease of a building for a post office. That * * * did not call for any consideration of the general question, whether the words in the statute, \u2018to establish post offices,\u2019 had the full meaning of the same words found in the section of the Constitution enumerating the powers of Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u201cNor is it necessary to determine all that may be done by the Postmaster General under the power \u2018to establish post offices\u2019 conferred upon that officer; for those words are to be interpreted in connection with the above statutory provision forbidding the making, except in the War and Navy Departments, and in those departments only for certain things and under specified conditions, of any contract or purchase on-behalf of the United States unless the same be authorized by law, or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment. There is no claim that the lease in question was made under any appropriation whatever, much less one adequate to its fulfillment. So that the only inquiry is, whether the contract of lease was \u2018authorized by law\u2019 within the meaning of the statute relating to contracts or purchases on behalf of the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">* ***********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">\u2022 \u201cWe have considered the case in the light of the statutes in force when the lease of May 1, 1870, was executed. Shortly after that date, by Act July 12, 1870, c. 251, \u00a7 7, 16 Stat. 251, it was provided that no department of the government should expend, in any one year, any sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for that fiscal year, or involve the government in any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations. And that provision is reproduced in section 3679 of the Revised Statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">In Abbott v. United States (C. C.) 66 Fed. 448, Chase v. United States, supra, was followed and a contract to lease a post office to be erected, for a term of five years, entered into by the Postmaster General, was held to be without authority, and not binding upon the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">In Hooe v. United States, 218 U. S. 322, 334, 31 Sup. Ct. 85, 88 (54 L. Ed. 1055), a case involving the same question the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">\u201cIf an officer, upon his own responsibility and without the authority of Congress, assumes to bind the government, by express or implied contract, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>pay a sum in excess of that limited by Congress for the purposes of such a contract, the contract is a. nullity, so far as the government is concerned, and no legal obligation arises upon its part to meet its provisions. If the circumstances justify such a course, Congress in its discretion can intervene and do justice to the owner of private property used by officers of the government in good faith for public purposes, although without direct legislative authority. The plaintiffs\u2019 remedy is in that direction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Following these decisions, we are constrained to hold that the contract sued on in this case was without authority of law and not binding upon the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with instructions to dismiss the suit. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
