Albert Roney, Jr. of the Circuit Court for Cecil County sitting as a juvenile court. The court found that the act appellant committed \u201cwhich would be a crime if committed by an adult,\u201d Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 3-801 (k) (Supp. 1978), constituted a violation of Md. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 14-104 (a) (1977). Section 14-104 (a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">\u201c(a) In general. \u2014 A person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">(1) Willfully damage or tamper with any vehicle without the consent of its owner; . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The State concedes that there was no damage, and the issue turns upon whether appellant\u2019s conduct constituted \u201ctampering.\u201d The State\u2019s case shows that the victim\u2019s vehicle had been parked in her driveway and locked for the night. Subsequently, shortly after midnight, a witness saw a person approach the victim\u2019s automobile. Although the witness could not see who the person was or what he was doing, he did see the interior light of the automobile illuminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The witness called the police who arrived propitiously. They detained the suspicious person, now identified as appellant, as he was moving away from the automobile. The witness could not \u201csay for a fact that [he] seen him [appellant] in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Recognizing that the judge could infer from this testimony that appellant had opened the car door, causing the light to come on, and conceding (if only for sake of argument) that he had entered the car, appellant argues here that there is no evidence of \u201ctampering.\u201d Concisely stated, appellant contends that the statute presupposes a criminal intent that was not proven, and that the proscribed act implies some injury to the automobile \u201csince the word \u2018damage\u2019 must be read as so closely linked with \u2018tamper\u2019 as to control its meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">The limited number of cases throughout the country provide us little guidance in interpreting our statute, partly because the statutes vary from state to state, and partly because the cases are factually decided. <em>See </em>Annot., 57 A.L.R.3d 606 (1974). We will, therefore, look to the intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>our own Legislature to interpret it in relation to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">We do not agree that the State must prove any \u201ccriminal\u201d intent on the part of one who tampers with a \"vehicle other than that he consciously intended to act (in the words of the statute) \u201cwithout the consent of its owner.\u201d We note that in the related subsection (b) following \u00a7 14-104 (a), wherein the Legislature dealt with \u201c[cjlimbing on or manipulating mechanisms of [a] vehicle,\u201d an intent to commit a malicious mischief, damage, injury or crime is required for behavior to fall within the proscription. \u00a7 14-104 (b). Had the Legislature intended a similar mens rea to be a prerequisite to conviction for willfully damaging<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or tampering, it surely would have included such language as it did for the climbing and manipulating offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u25a0 Tampering</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\"><em>Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1254 (3d ed. 1969) defines \u201ctampering\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">\u201cMeddling; interfering. Making corrupting or perverting changes. Foolish or trifling experimentation. United States v Tomicich (DC Pa) 41 F Supp 33.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">The word does not necessarily imply the commission of a criminal act. Keefe v Donnell, 92 Me 151 159 ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">When the Legislature chooses contextually to criminalize such conduct we are not free to enlarge upon or restrict that which they have enacted. <em>Wheeler v. State, </em>281 Md. 593, 596 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>(1977). In light of the Legislature\u2019s use of the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d it is clear that the inclusion of <em>tampering </em>as an offense was in contrast to that of <em>damaging </em>rather than conjunctively controlled by it. A disjunctive conjunction serves to establish a relationship of contrast or opposition. <em>See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>378 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The judge inferred from the car\u2019s light having gone on, with appellant in the immediate vicinity of the car door, that appellant \u201cwas the one who got in the car.\u201d Even that inference was not necessary to find tampering. The inference that it was appellant who consciously opened the locked car door would have been sufficient to meet the definition of tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Sufficient evidence existed from which a factfinder could have found that appellant had violated the crime prohibited by Md. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 14-104 (a). Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-12\">. Appellant does not argue that the adverb \u201cwillfully\u201d modifies \u201ctamper\u201d as well as \u201cdamage,\u201d but to the extent that \u201cwillfully\u201d connotes \u201c[a]n act done intentionally, or on purpose, and not accidentally\u201d or involuntarily, see <em>Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1369 (3d ed. 1969), we act upon the premise that both verbs are so modified. <em>See generally </em>State v. Stodola, 257 Iowa 863 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
