J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYq\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We herein reverse and remand to the Criminal Court of Baltimore its judgment in which Evelyn T. Knight was sentenced, as the result of a jury verdict of guilty of possession of a controlled dangerous substance (heroin), to one (1) year imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">We take that action for the reason that the State did not comply with Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code Ann. \u00a7 10-1003, and because we are unable to agree with the trial judge that the State\u2019s failure to comply with the clear mandate of section 10-1003 was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Inasmuch as our holding is limited in its scope, no useful purpose will be served by our recounting all the facts out of which this case arose. It is enough for our purpose to know that Ms. Knight was arrested following the execution of a search and seizure warrant at her residence, 1607 East 32nd Street in Baltimore City. The search revealed six (6) tinfoil packets of a white powder which chemical analysis proved to be 4.3% heroin. It is the receipt into evidence of that report, absent the \u201clive\u201d testimony of the chemist relative to chain of custody, that is assailed in this Court by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">By the enactment of Laws 1974, ch. 794, now codified as Courts art. \u00a7\u00a7 10-1001 to 10-1003 inclusive, the General Assembly provided that it would not be necessary for the chemist to appear as a witness in a trial of a person for violation of this State\u2019s Controlled Dangerous Substances Laws, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 276-302, to establish the proper chain of custody unless the defendant complies with the statutory prerequisite spelled out in Courts Art. \u00a7 10-1003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 10-1002 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>\u201cFor the purpose of establishing, in a criminal or civil proceeding, the chain of physical custody or control of evidence consisting of or containing a substance tested or analyzed to determine whether it is a controlled dangerous substance defined under Article 27 of this Code, a statement signed by each successive officer or other person having the custody of the evidence that he delivered it to the person indicated on or about the date stated is prima facie evidence that the person had custody and made the delivery as stated, without the necessity of a personal appearance in court by the person signing the statement. The statement shall contain a sufficient description of the material or its container so as to distinguish it as the particular item in question and shall state that the material was delivered in essentially the same condition as received.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Section 10-1003 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cIn a criminal proceeding, the prosecution shall, upon written demand of a defendant filed in the proceedings at least five days prior to a trial in the proceeding, require the presence of the chemist, analyst, or any person in the chain of custody as a prosecution witness. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-1001 and 10-1002 concerning prima facie evidence do not apply to the testimony of that witness. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-1001 and 10-1002 are applicable in a criminal proceeding only when a copy of the report or statement to be introduced is mailed, delivered, or made available to counsel for the defendant or to the defendant personally when he is not represented by counsel, at least ten days prior to the introduction of the report or statement at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Because the State had, in answer to a discovery motion, furnished a copy of the report to the appellant\u2019s counsel, it did not notify her counsel that the chemist was not going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>appear at the trial. Appellant\u2019s counsel contended in the trial and here that the furnishing of the report in response to discovery did not comply with section 10-1003 inasmuch as there was nothing in the report to indicate the chemist would not be called to testify. <em>Ergo, </em>appellant, not having received word from the State that it intended to submit the report <em>sine </em>the chemist\u2019s presence at trial, did not make \u201cwritten demand\u201d that the chemist be physically present to testify. Appellant asserts that the State\u2019s non-compliance with the statute misled her into believing the State would have the chemist testify. She asserts that as a result she had no opportunity to cross-examine the chemist as to the propriety of the chain of custody in order that she might be able to weaken or destroy the impact of the chemist\u2019s report. The sum and substance of her argument is that she has been denied the right to confront the very witness whose report established that the seized material was a proscribed narcotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The trial judge agreed with the position taken by the assistant state\u2019s attorney that appellant had a copy of the report in her possession for \u201calmost a year\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prior to trial, and that if she wanted the chemist present at trial she should have made the written demand required by Courts Art. \u00a7 10-1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We do not see the matter in the same light as the trial judge. We note that in answer to the discovery motion the chemist\u2019s report was sent to the appellant\u2019s counsel. There is absolutely nothing written, typed, or printed upon that report that would lead anyone to believe that the State intended to submit the report in lieu of the testimony of the chemist. In fact, a contrary conclusion may be drawn from the State\u2019s response to one of the questions put to it on discovery. The State was asked to \u201c[fjurnish the Defendant with a list of names and addresses of the witnesses whom the State intends to call to prove its case in chief....\u201d The State replied, \u201cThe names and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>addresses of the witnesses the State intends to call to prove its case in chief are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Dr. Sumer M. Dugan Chemist, Crime Lab,</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">BCPD\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Clearly, the State\u2019s response to the discovery motion indicated that it intended to call as a witness Dr. Dugan, the chemist who made the analysis upon which the charges were founded. Having been supplied with that information, there was no reason for the appellant\u2019s counsel to believe that the State was not going to call Dr. Dugan to the witness stand. Consequently, it would appear that counsel had no need to make the \u201cwritten demand\u201d required by Courts Art. \u00a7 10-1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">We think that once the State informed appellant, through her attorney, that it intended to call the chemist, Dr. Dugan, as a witness, the appellant had a right to rely upon that representation. Hence, she was not required to employ Courts Art. \u00a7 10-1003 in order to accomplish the very thing the State said that it intended to do. When the State changed its mind and elected to proceed by way of introduction of the chemist\u2019s report through a \u201cchain of custody form\u201d instead of having the chemist testify, it should have notified the appellant\u2019s counsel \u201cat least ten days prior to the introduction of the report... at trial.\u201d In that way, the appellant would be in a position to make timely \u201cwritten demand\u201d for the \u201clive\u201d testimony of the chemist.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Were we to subscribe to the argument that the appellant possessed a copy of the report and, therefore, should have made \u201cwritten demand\u201d for the production in court of the chemist, we would, in effect, be holding that when the State answers that it \u201cintends\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to call certain witnesses to testify it means that it might introduce a report by using a chain of custody form instead of the testimony of witnesses. To reach that point would require our rewriting of the dictionary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Moreover, notwithstanding the State\u2019s reply to discovery, a defendant would have to make demand under Courts art. \u00a7 10-1003 whenever he or she desired the chemist to testify personally. Under such a procedure, section 10-1003 would be devoid of meaning insofar as the State is concerned. Thus, the State could mislead an accused by responding on discovery that it \u201cintends\u201d to call the chemist as a witness, change its mind without notification to the accused, rely upon the chain of custody provisions of the Courts article to introduce the written report instead of having the chemist testify, and then beat back any objection on the ground that the accused did not make \u201cwritten demand\u201d within five (5) days of trial for the physical presence of the chemist. Such a chain of events seems to us to be practicing law by ambush. We do not countenance it.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">We think the appellant was misled by the State to her detriment, and the chemist\u2019s report should not, under the circumstances of this case, have been received into evidence. To admit the report over objection was error going to the fundamental right of an accused to be confronted by her accusers. The report was, as we have seen, the sole basis for concluding that six (6) tinfoil packets found in the purse of the appellant were a proscribed controlled dangerous substance. We have no way of knowing what the cross-examination of Dr. Dugan will produce. The chemist\u2019s testimony might have shown a void in the chain of custody that would cause the rejection of the six (6) packets of heroin. Thus, we cannot conclude that the admission of the report into evidence without the opportunity to cross-examine the author of that report as to the chain of custody is harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A. 2d 665 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">We note that this whole issue could have been avoided if, when the objection to the admission of the report was made, the State had withheld the report and produced the chemist. Alternatively, the trial judge could have declined to receive the report and directed the State to produce the chemist to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Because of our disposition of this issue, we do not reach the remaining two (2) questions raised by the appellant. Both deal with rebuttal testimony, and it is likely that they will not be an issue at the retrial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-10\">.
