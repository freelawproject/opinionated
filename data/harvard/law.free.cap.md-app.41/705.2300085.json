Grover, the appellant, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Buchanan, J.), of felony murder and committed to the custody of the Division of Correction for the remainder of his natural life. On appeal he contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">1. His trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to request an instruction regarding the law of voluntary intoxication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">2. The court erred in admitting the appellant\u2019s statement into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">3. The court erred by permitting the State to introduce the autopsy protocol without requiring the presence in court of a certain doctor who prepared a portion of the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">4. The court erred in admitting certain photographs into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">William Markwitz, a security guard for Baltimore City, was assigned to work at the Baltimore City Courthouse for the 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. shift on December 23, 1977. Between 7:30 and 8:00 P.M. that evening, a patient at Perry Point Hospital and an acquaintance of Markwitz, Vernon Stevens, stopped by to see Markwitz. Both Markwitz and Stevens consumed an unspecified quantity of alcoholic beverages at a Christmas party which was in progress at the courthouse. At 11 o\u2019clock Stevens left with Markwitz in Markwitz\u2019s car. They first drove to the old Post Office Building and picked up the appellant. They then continued on to the Perry Point Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">Thomas Bowman, a nursing assistant at the Perry Point Hospital testified that Stevens arrived at the hospital at 12:30 A.M. December 24 and asked for a refill of his medicine. Bowman stated that Stevens explained that he had been robbed of his medicine while riding on the bus to Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>but that the robbers had not taken his money. After the refill was refused, Stevens left.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The appellant\u2019s statement was introduced by the State. In it he admitted going with Markwitz and Stevens to Perry Point. On the way, he said that they had stopped at an isolated location and had gotten out of the car to urinate. Getting back in, the appellant said Stevens had closed the door on his fingers. In retaliation he said he had punched Stevens. Some time later, they again got out of the car and he hit Stevens a second time. The appellant said he got back in the car while Markwitz and Stevens remained outside the car. A few minutes later, Markwitz got back in and gave him $80 or $90. They then drove away leaving Stevens behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Around 4:00 P.M. December 24, 1977, Stevens\u2019 body was found in a swamp about twenty feet off the road. No wallet or paper money was found on the body. Dr. Hormez Guard performed an autopsy and concluded that death had resulted from \u201cmultiple blunt force injuries to the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Mary Mumford, a neighbor of Markwitz said she had talked to Markwitz and the appellant on December 26, 1977. They told her they had killed a man and asked her for a cleaning solution to remove blood from Markwitz\u2019s car. Around 10:30 A.M. on March 1, 1978, the police arrested the appellant in an apartment in Baltimore City for the homicide and transported him to the Baltimore County Police Headquarters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">I Competency of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Throughout the trial, testimony was presented that Markwitz, Stevens and the appellant had consumed alcoholic beverages during the evening of the homicide. No specific quantities of consumption were mentioned and there was no direct testimony as to the degree of impairment the drinking had caused. No instructions to the jury regarding the law of voluntary intoxication were requested by the appellant\u2019s trial counsel, no objections to the court\u2019s failure to so instruct were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>noted and the appellant did not argue any intoxication defense to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">On appeal the appellant notes he was convicted of felony murder and that the underlying felony was robbery. Then, relying on <em>State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. 602, 298 A. 2d 378 (1973), he argues that if the jury had been instructed that intoxication could negate the crime of robbery, they might have found him not guilty of the underlying felony of robbery and accordingly would have also acquitted him of the felony murder. As his attorney did not raise the issue, he asserts that his' trial counsel was ineffective. The issue of competency of counsel was not raised or considered below and we will not consider it for the first time on appeal. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 276 A. 2d 214 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">II Admission of Appellant\u2019s Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Prior to the admission of the appellant\u2019s statement into evidence, a suppression hearing was conducted to determine whether the statement had been voluntarily made. The appellant\u2019s arrest occurred between 10:30 and 11:00 A.M. He was turned over to Detective Wysham at 1:00 P.M. Wysham testified that he read <em>Miranda </em>rights to the appellant and that at 1:10 P.M. the appellant initialed a card indicating he had received his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At the same time the appellant told Wysham that he was willing to give a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">At the hearing the appellant attacked the voluntariness of his statement. First, he claimed that he could not read the waiver because he didn\u2019t have his glasses. Second, he claimed that he had been out drinking the night before, was \u201chung over\u201d and had an \u201cupset stomach\u201d at the time the statement was given. In <em>Dempsey v. State, </em>277 Md. 134, 151, 355 A. 2d 455 (1976), the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u201cIn <em>Bryant [v. State, </em>229 Md. 531 (1962)], and <em>Mundell [v. State, </em>244 Md. 91 (1966)], the Court set forth the general principle that evidence of mental impairment from drugs or alcohol does not per se render a confession involuntary, and that a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>may admit a confession into evidence if it concludes that it was freely and voluntarily made ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, in the instant case, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">\u201cI find that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were adequately given. And I also find, considering the totality of the evidence, that the State has met the burden by a preponderance of the evidence that his confession in fact was voluntary. Therefore I am going to overrule your motion as to the admissibility, since I think under the circumstances the statement is in fact admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Based on our independent review of the record, we concur with the court that the State met its burden of proving the voluntariness of the appellant\u2019s waiver and find the appellant\u2019s contention concerning voluntariness to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Ill Autopsy Report</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">As his third contention, the appellant complains that the court erred in permitting the State to introduce the autopsy report because it contained a statement by Dr. Biagio Azzarelli who did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">Dr. Hormez Guard, who was called by the State, explained that he was a medical examiner for the State; that his job was to investigate \u201call cases of sudden unnatural deaths and deaths resulting from violence and other problems\u201d; that he was qualified for this work because he was a forensic pathologist; that he had performed an autopsy on Stevens; and that it was his conclusion that Stevens had \u201cdied from multiple blunt force injuries to the head.\u201d Dr. Guard also testified that while he was qualified to study brain injuries, the medical examiner\u2019s office did employ a neuropathologist, Dr. Biagio Azzarelli, to whom he generally referred brain injury matters. After eliciting from Dr. Guard that the autopsy report had been prepared in the ordinary course of his business as a medical examiner, the report was admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The appellant objected to the admission of the report because it contained a statement by Dr. Azzarelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The appellant, relying on <em>Gregory v. State, </em>40 Md. App. 297, 391 A. 2d 437 (1978), contends that his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was violated by the introduction of a document prepared in whole or in part by a party not present in court to testify. In <em>Gregory v. State, supra, </em>at 40 Md. App. 326 we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">\u201cWe have here not the routine record of a person\u2019s birth, or death, or body temperature, nor any other similar statement of fact or condition objectively ascertained, generally reliable and normally undisputed, and free from any motive to record falsely. We are dealing with the opinions of supposed expert witnesses, who, in this document, are giving testimony not only as to appellant\u2019s mental condition, but, more importantly, as to whether or not he is criminally responsible. The document was offered without limitation as to purpose, and therefore for its truth. Thus, the jury was not merely advised of the fact that three staff psychiatrists had formed certain opinions; it was asked to accept as true \u2014 i.e., to believe \u2014 the opinion of these three physicians that appellant was \u2018sane\u2019 at the time he entered the bank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In <em>Gregory v. State, supra, </em>we noted that the field of forensic psychiatry was an inexact science and that differences of opinion frequently existed between experts in the field. This being so, we concluded that the opportunity to cross-examine a witness giving such opinion evidence could be of crucial importance. It should not be supposed that <em>Gregory </em>stands for the proposition that the confrontation clause of the constitution precludes the admission of all evidence under exceptions to the hearsay rule. Dr. Azzarelli\u2019s statement in the autopsy report did not express any opinion. It merely stated his findings of the physical condition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>decedent\u2019s brain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such it falls under the category of a \u201cfact or condition objectively ascertained,\u201d and was probably admissible as a business record as provided by the <em>Md. Code, </em>Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 10-101. It was clearly admissible under <em>Md. Code, </em>Article 22, \u00a7 8 which has been construed by <em>Benjamin v. Woodring, </em>268 Md. 593, 608, 303 A. 2d 779 (1973) to make autopsy reports admissible as to facts, but not as to opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">IV Admission of Photographs</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The State presented two photographs of the victim taken at the scene where the body was recovered. The photographs were offered into evidence but, in response to the appellant\u2019s objection, were not admitted at that time. At the close of the State\u2019s case, the State again moved that the photographs be admitted and they were admitted without objection. The appellant now claims these photographs should not have been admitted because they were inflammatory. No objection was raised at the time they were admitted, thus the issue has not been preserved for appeal. Md. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">\n<em>Appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\">. Markwitz was tried separately, convicted of first degree murder and committed to life imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b733-10\">. Dr. Azzarelli\u2019s complete report reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">\u201cBrain Note</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">\u201cWEIGHT: 1710 grams</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-13\">\u201cThe dura mater and dural sinuses are not remarkable.
