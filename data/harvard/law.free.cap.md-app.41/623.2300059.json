J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIR\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Part of the majesty of American law is the power conferred upon the courts to strike down statutes which run afoul of the Constitution of the United States. No act of Congress or the Legislature may authorize a violation of the Constitution. <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U. S. 873, 95 S. Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975); <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </em>413 U. S. 266, 93 S. Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). When the constitutional defect is brought to the attention of the court, the court is bound by its oath of office to excise the flaw. This is true whether there be a congenital defect in the statute or one that has come about through improper usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">We herein declare that Maryland Transportation Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 13-409 and 16-112 are facially constitutional but, in the circumstances of the instant case, were unconstitutionally applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The facts giving rise to the matter <em>sub judice </em>are uncomplicated. The appellants, Abraham Goode and David Jerome Walker, were convicted by a jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore of three (3) handgun violations. The events leading to the convictions began at approximately 11:10 p.m. on September 20,1977, when Sergeant William McLean of the Baltimore City Police Department observed the 1975 Ford Granada in which appellants were passengers parked in front of an abandoned school. McLean saw several people get in and out of the car. At that time McLean was \u201con random patrol.\u201d The sergeant described the area in which he saw the Granada as \u201can isolated area,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s unusual to see a car parked at that particular location at that time of night.\u201d He stopped the police cruiser in a position where he \u201ckept the ... [Granada] under observation.\u201d McLean went on to relate that \u201c[approximately two to three minutes after ... [he] parked, ... [he] saw the car pull away and it went northbound on Carey Street, made a left turn heading westbound on Gold Street.\u201d The operator of the Granada did not violate any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>traffic laws. Nevertheless, Sgt. McLean radioed that he was following a \u201csuspicious vehicle\u201d and that he \u201cwas going to pull the vehicle over.\u201d He requested a \u201cbackup unit.\u201d The sergeant then activated his \u201cblue light and spotlight.\u201d McLean and an officer from the \u201cbackup unit\u201d approached the halted Granada. The operator,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who was not one of the appellants, \u201ccould not produce either a driver\u2019s license or a registration for the vehicle.\u201d An attempt to verify that the operator was licensed fell short inasmuch as the \u201cD.M.V. computer was out of service.\u201d The fact that the computer was not working also prevented the police from ascertaining to whom the Granada belonged. All the occupants of the vehicle were \u201casked\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to get out of the car. They complied. A \u201cMr. Parnell,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had his \u201chands in front of his sweat shirt. He had a hooded sweat shirt on. It had one of those sewn pockets across the front.\u201d Parnell was told \u201cto remove his hands, and it looked like something was coming out of the pocket with it.\u201d The \u201csomething\u201d turned out to be a wallet which \u201cfell open.\u201d McLean said, \u201cFrom the wallet fell a glassine bag containing a white powder, same type of glassine bag that narcotics are normally packaged in.... At this time Mr. Parnell was informed that he was under arrest for possession of ... controlled dangerous substance.\u201d McLean then returned to the vehicle and \u201cshined the light to the floor directly in front of the passenger compartment.\u201d He observed \u201cwhat appeared to be the stock of a gun.\u201d McLean withdrew the gun, a sawed-off shotgun, and in so doing discovered a .22 caliber automatic as well as a .32 caliber revolver. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>shotgun was unloaded, but the other two weapons contained ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">At a hearing on the appellants\u2019 motion to suppress, the appellants asserted that their arrest was illegal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that any evidence seized thereafter was tainted. The hearing judge implicitly found that Sgt. McLean had the authority to stop the Granada and to request the operator to produce for examination a driver\u2019s license and registration card. From that premise, the court went on to conclude that when the operator of the vehicle could not produce the requested documents, the police were within their right to order the occupants from the car, and that \u201cbearing in mind the activity of the Defendants as one little bit of probable cause piled on another little bit... the officers were obligated at that time to further search the car to see if any controlled dangerous substance or any weapons were in it.\u201d The motion to suppress was denied, and the case proceeded to trial by a jury with the result we have previously stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Inasmuch as the operator of the vehicle in which the appellants were passengers was not ostensibly in violation of any law at the time the car was halted by Sgt. McLean, the justification, if any, for the stopping of the automobile must be found within the Maryland Transportation Article. That article of our code contains two separate provisions which permit police to demand production for examination of a driver\u2019s license or the registration card.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Transportation Art. \u00a7 13-409 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201c(a) <em>In general </em>\u2014 At all times, each registration card shall be carried:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">(1) In the vehicle to which it refers; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">(2) By the individual driving or in control of the vehicle, who shall display it, on demand, to <em>any police officer who identifies himself as such.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Section 16-112 of the same article provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201c(a) <em>Possession and display of license; writing sample. </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">(1) In this subsection, \u2018display\u2019 means the manual surrender of the licensee\u2019s license into the hands of the demanding officer for inspection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">(2) Each individual driving a motor vehicle on any highway in this State shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">(i) Have his license with him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">(ii) Display the license to any <em>uniformed </em>police officer who demands it....\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">As the Revisor\u2019s Note points out, the above two sections of the Transportation Article are incongruous and might cause more problems than they solve. As now written, the statutes confer upon a uniformed police officer the authority, under proper circumstances, to demand and receive for examination the operator\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration card. If, however, the law officer is not in uniform, he is entitled to receive and examine the registration card when he identifies himself as an officer of the law, but he is not entitled to view the driver\u2019s license. One would expect that the refusal of the operator to show his driver\u2019s license to a non-uniformed law officer probably would produce a confrontation between the officer and the motorist that is fraught with peril to both. Such a confrontation could be avoided by a change in the statute so as to bring it in line with section 16-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">We observe that prior to Laws 1970, ch. 534, the Motor Vehicle Code, then Article 66%, provided that a registration card was to be exhibited \u201cupon demand of any uniformed officer of the law.\u201d Laws 1943, ch. 1007, \u00a7 26; Md. Ann. Code (1951) Art. 66%, \u00a7 29. A return by the legislature to that particular phraseology could eliminate possible misunderstanding between the police and the motoring public.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Nevertheless, neither Transportation Art. \u00a7 13-409 nor \u00a7 16-112 nor their predecessors may be read as sanctioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>a random stopping of a single vehicle by police for a \u201croutine check\u201d if the stop is arbitrary, gratuitous, and without justification in the form of reasonable suspicion to believe that a specific violation of the motor vehicle code or some other offense has occurred, because such a stop would be violative of the motorist\u2019s constitutional rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We further overrule any of our prior decisions to the extent that they may indicate a sanctioning of the single stop.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 678, 308 A. 2d 734 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 765 (1973), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be. violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States said in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1, 16, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 1877, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 903 (1968) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201cIt is quite plain that the Fourth Amendment governs \u2018seizures\u2019 of the person which do not eventuate in a trip to the station house and prosecution for crime \u2014 \u2018arrests\u2019 in traditional terminology. It must be recognized that whenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away, he has \u2018seized\u2019 that person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\n<em>See also United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in <em>United States v. Mallides, </em>473 F. 2d 859, 861 (9th Cir. 1973), held that \u201c[a] person whose vehicle is stopped by police and whose freedom to drive away is restrained is as effectively \u2018seized\u2019 as is the pedestrian who is detained.\u201d Similar holdings are found in state court decisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State v. Ochoa, 112 </em>Ariz. 582, 544 P. 2d 1097 (1976); <em>People v. James, </em>44 Ill. App. 3d 300, 3 Ill. Dec. 88, 358 N.E.2d 88 (1976); <em>State v. McKinley, </em>305 Minn. 297, 232 N.W.2d 906 (1975); <em>Morgan v. Town of </em>Heidelberg, 246 Miss. 481, 150 So. 2d 512 (1963); <em>People v. Ingle, </em>36 N.Y.2d 413, 330 N.E.2d 39 (1975); and <em>Commonwealth v. Swanger, </em>453 Pa. 107, 307 A. 2d 875 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U. S. at 20-21, 20 L.Ed.2d at 905, 88 S. Ct. at 1879, the Supreme Court, quoting from its earlier decision in <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U. S. 523, 534-35, 536-37, 18 L.Ed.2d 930, 938-40, 87 S. Ct. 1727, 1734-35 (1967), asserted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201c[I]t is necessary \u2018first to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen,\u2019 for there is \u2018no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or seizure] entails.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The cited cases permit a forcible stop of a motorist, however, when the police officer is able to point to specific and articulable facts, which, together with the rational inferences properly drawn therefrom, warrant a reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed, is about to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>committed, or has been committed. <em>People v. James, </em>44 Ill. App. 3d at 303, 358 N.E.2d at 91. If the courts were to take a contrary view, they would in effect be clothing the police with \u201cabsolute discretion to intrude into the lives of the occupants of motor vehicles,\u201d thereby effectively precluding judicial review of the exercise of the discretion. <em>Id. </em>The police would then be at liberty to stop without rhyme or reason any motorist, at any time, on any whim, merely on the outside chance that the operator of the vehicle would be unlicensed, not in possession of his license, not have a registration card in his possession, or be driving a stolen vehicle. Such a stop is a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d that we will not license. Were we to do so, we would be abdicating the court\u2019s role of buffer between the police and the citizenry.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We recognize that the State has a valid and vital interest in highway safety, and that normally the operation of vehicles by nonlicensed drivers or those operating without a registration card are not readily detectable by mere observation of the manner in which the vehicle is driven. The number of deaths annually attributed to motor vehicle collisions is awesome, without even considering the loss occasioned by bodily injury and property damage arising from those vehicular accidents. Certainly, the State has a duty to protect its citizens through highway safety. Yet, the motorist also has the right to be protected from arbitrary intrusion by the State into his freedom of locomotion. <em>People v. Ingle, supra; see </em>generally, <em>The Right to Travel: In Search of a Constitutional Source, </em>55 Neb. L. Rev. 117 (1975-76). The question then becomes one of balancing the State\u2019s interest in the welfare of its people against that of the individual motorist. While we conclude that, in the light of the Fourth Amendment, the scale tips in favor of the individual vis-a-vis the State, the latter is not without adequate means of protecting the public\u2019s interest through highway safety. This is true because the factual basis necessary to underpin the stop of a motorist for a spot or routine check, is minimal indeed. <em>Commonwealth v. Swanger, </em>453 Pa. at 112, 307 A. 2d at 878. An actual violation of the motor vehicle sections of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Transportation Article need not be detected.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cAll that is required is that the stop be not the product of mere whim, caprice, or idle curiosity.\u201d <em>State v. McKinley, </em>305 Minn, at 304, 232 N.W.2d at 911. Moreover, it may not be simply because of the motorist\u2019s national origin, race, or sex. \u201cIt is enough if the stop is based upon \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion.\u2019 <em>(Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, <em>supra).\u201d State v. McKinley, </em>305 Minn, at 304, 232 N.W.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Sgt. McLean, in the case at Bar, did not articulate any specific facts that warranted the intrusion into the motorist\u2019s right to be secure in the automobile he was driving, nor are there any rational inferences properly deducted from the facts, which, when added to Sgt. McLean\u2019s testimony, will pass muster so as to permit trespass upon the Fourth Amendment protection afforded the motorist. In sum, all that the State produced in the way of justification for the stop of the vehicle in which appellants were riding was the suspicion that was aroused within the sergeant\u2019s mind, and that suspicion falls well short of \u201carticulable specific facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Inasmuch as there was no lawful basis for the halting of the vehicle in the instant case, the stop was illegal, and all that flowed therefrom, including the recovery of the guns, was an unconstitutional seizure. The appellants\u2019 motions to suppress the guns should have been granted. We shall reverse without remanding for a new trial because the evidence must be suppressed, and without that evidence, there is no case. <em>Compare State v. Boone, </em>284 Md. 1, 393 A. 2d 1361 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-6\">. The operator was later identified to be Lawrence Terry Monroe. He was jointly charged and tried with the appellants, but he was acquitted by the jury. \u2018</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\">. Whether the Maryland Constitution permits police to \u201corder\u201d passengers to alight from a motor vehicle is a question which is not presently before us. Nonetheless, we note in passing that the Louisiana Supreme Court recently concluded that the rationale of Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 54 L.Ed.2d 331, 98 S. Ct. 330 (1977), does not extend to automobile passengers. Acknowledging that the <em>Miming </em>decision permits police routinely to order drivers out of their vehicles when they are stopped for traffic offenses, the Louisiana Supreme Court, nevertheless, determined that \"[tjhere is no legitimate support in Louisiana for a rule that would permit police to remove a passenger from an automobile on a routine traffic stop.\u201d State v. Williams, (La. Sup. Ct. 12/15/78), 24 Cr.L. 235.9, 2360 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\">. Parnell was not tried with the appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b648-11\">. We are unable to find within the record a motion to suppress filed by or on behalf of appellant Walker. Nevertheless, the docket entries reveal that the judge \u201cheard and denied\u201d Walker\u2019s \u201cMotion to Suppress.\u201d We infer that such a motion was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\">. In holding that the selective stopping of a single motor vehicle is unconstitutional, we do not imply that the nondiscriminatory stopping of vehicles at a roadblock is prohibited. Where every motorist who passes a given location is stopped, that detention has been sanctioned. Brignoni-Ponce, <em>supra; </em>Almeida-Sanehez, <em>supra. See The Automobile Spot Checks and the Fourth Amendment, </em>6 Rut.-Cam. L.J. 85 (1974-75).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\">. Among those decisions are Kraft v. State, 18 Md. App. 169, 305 A. 2d 489 (1973); Glover v. State, 14 Md. App. 454, 287 A. 2d 333 (1972); and Burkett v. State, 5 Md.

While we agree with the result reached by Judge Hammerman, we do not conclude that Transportation Art. \u00a7'\u00a7 18-409 and 1(5-112 are unconstitutional. Neither section, in our view, contravenes the Fourth Amendment. Rather, it is the use being made of the sections that is violative of the Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\">. <em>See e.g., </em>Transportation Art. \u00a7 23-105 which pertains to police authority to issue an equipment order directing the owner of the motor vehicle to make or cause to be made certain repairs to the motor vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
