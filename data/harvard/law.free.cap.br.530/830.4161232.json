Richard Lee, United States Bankruptcy Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Before the court is a contested matter filed by the chapter 7 trustee, James E. Salven (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The Trustee asks the court to disallow an exemption (the \u201cObjection\u201d) claimed by the debtors, Michael Weilert and Genevieve M. de Mon-tremare (the \u201cDebtors\u201d) applicable to the funds \u2014 approximately $23,000 \u2014 they hold in some individual retirement accounts (the \u201cIRA Accounts\u201d). The Trustee also seeks an order compelling the Debtors to turn over the funds to which the Objection applies (the \u201cTurnover Motion\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Turnover Motion is contingent on the outcome of the Objection. There are no factual disputes and both matters hinge on an interpretation of the relevant California exemption statute. Because the Objection is based on a misinterpretation of the statute, it will be overruled and the Turnover Motion will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">This memorandum decision contains the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), made applicable to this contested matter by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052 and 9014. The court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and General Order Nos. 182 and 330 of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. This is a core proceeding as defined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(A), (B), (E) and (O).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\"><em>BACKGROUND AND FINDINGS OF </em>FACT;</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">After the hearing on this matter the' parties submitted a list of stipulated facts and a joint statement of the issues (Doc. No.- 330). Neither party requested an evi-dentiary hearing. -Based thereon, and on the court\u2019s review of the record, the following facts appear to be undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">This bankruptcy commenced as a voluntary petition under chapter 7 in September 2013. On Schedule B (Doc. No. 19), the Debtors listed several IRA Accounts, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-15\">a. Vanguard \u2014 IRA (W) in the amount of $10,600.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-16\">b. Charles Schwab IRA (W) in the amount of $6,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-17\">c. Charles Schwab IRA (x3)(H) in the amount of $89,355.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-18\">d. Options Express IRA (H) in the amount of $4,984.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-19\">The Debtors also exempted these assets on Schedule C pursuant to Cal.Code of Civ. Proc. (\u201cCCP\u201d) \u00a7 704.115, which applies to any traditional or rollover IRA which is \u201cqualified\u201d as a retirement plan under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408. There is no dispute that the subject IRA Accounts are qualified as private retirement plans under the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) code.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>In 2011, the Debtors made three contributions to the IRA Accounts in the aggregate amount of $11,000. In 2012, the Debtors made three contributions to the Accounts in the aggregate amount of $ 11,-597.22. In 2013, the Debtors made one contribution in the amount of $6,000 (collectively referred to hereafter as the \u201cIRA Contributions\u201d). In each of these years, the maximum cumulative amount that the Debtors were permitted to contribute to their IRA Accounts, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the IRS, was $12,000, $12,000, and $13,000, respectively. The parties agree that the disputed IRA Contributions did not exceed the applicable limits set by the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">While the Debtors did not \u201coverfund\u201d the IRA Accounts, they also were not able to deduct the IRA Contributions from their otherwise taxable income. Generally, joint tax filers can deduct from their income contributions they make to traditional IRA Accounts before calculating their federal taxes. However, that deduction is not available where one of the joint tax filers is covered by a retirement plan through work and the joint tax filers\u2019 modified adjusted gross income is greater than $116,000. While these conditions <em>do not </em>affect the applicable contribution limits, they do affect the <em>deductibility </em>of those contributions from the joint filers\u2019 taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In each of the relevant tax years, Michael Weilert was covered by a retirement plan through his work. In addition, the Debtors\u2019 modified adjusted gross income in each of those years was greater, than $116,000. Accordingly, the Debtors were not able to deduct the IRA Contributions from their taxable income. However, there is no dispute that the Debtors complied with the IRS regulations governing the maximum contribution limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">\n<em>ISSUES PRESENTED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">The Trustee filed a timely objection to each of these exemptions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Trustee asks the court to disallow the exemption of the IRA Accounts designated a, b, and d above, and $2,000 of IRA Account c. In total, he asks for an order compelling the Debtors to turn over $23,584 to the estate. The sole basis for the Trustee\u2019s Objection is the fact that the Debtors were not able to deduct the IRA Contributions from their income for federal tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">The issue here is whether the California exemption statute CCP \u00a7 704.115 applies to the IRA Contributions, funds which the Debtors were legally entitled to contribute to the IRA Accounts, but which the Debtors could not deduct from income on their federal tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">\n<em>APPLICABLE LAW.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">The general set of California exemptions is found in chapter 4 of Title 9 of the CCP (\u00a7\u00a7 703.010-704.995). <em>See </em>CCP \u00a7 704.140(a). The exemption statute applicable here is CCP \u00a7 704.115 (the \u201cStatute\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The courts are required to con-</p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>strue CCP \u00a7 704.115 \u201cliberally ... for the benefit of the debtor.\u201d <em>Lieberman v. Hawkins (In re Lieberman), </em>245 F.3d 1090, 1092 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">The courts must endeavor to determine the legislative intent from the language of the statute. <em>Lamie v. United States Trustee, </em>540 U.S. 526, 534, 124 S.Ct. 1023, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2004). This analysis begins with subpart (b) of the Statute which provides in pertinent part the underlying basis for exemption of the IRA Accounts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">(b) All amounts held, controlled, or in process of distribution by a <em>private retirement plan </em>... <em>are exempt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0u\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The Trustee\u2019s Objection turns on the interpretation of subsection (a)(3) of the Statute which defines the term \u201cprivate retirement plan\u201d and limits the exemption to amounts held in the plan that are exempt from federal income taxation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">(a) As used in this section, \u201cprivate retirement plan\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">(3) [Ajccounts provided for in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including individual retirement accounts qualified under Section 408 or 408A of that code, <em>to the extent the amounts held in the pans, annuities, or accounts do not exceed the maximum amounts exempt from federal income taxation under that code.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">(Emphasis added;)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">Subsection (e) of the Statute includes a further limitation on the exemption of funds held in a private retirement account based on the debtor\u2019s personal financial situation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-15\">(e) Notwithstanding subdivisions (b) ... in the amounts described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) are exempt only to the extent necessary to provide for <em>the support of the judgment debtor when the judgment debtor retires and for the support of the spouse and dependents of the judgment debt- or, taking into account all resources that are likely to be available for the support of the judgment debtor </em>when the judgment debtor retires....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK-U\">(Emphasis added.) '</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\"><em>Burden of Proof. </em>It is well accepted in the Ninth Circuit that a claimed exemption is presumptively valid. <em>In re Carter, </em>182 F.3d 1027, 1029 n. 3 (9th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). Once the exemption has been claimed, \u201cthe objecting party has the burden of proving .that the exemptions are not properly claimed.\u201d Rule 4003(c); <em>In re Davis, </em>323 B.R. 732, 736 (9th Cir. BAP 2005). This means that the objecting party not only has the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>producing evidence rebutting the presumptively valid exemption but also the ultimate burden of persuasion. <em>Carter, </em>182 F.3d at 1029 n. 3. Therefore, even if the presumption of validity is rebutted with evidence from the objecting party forcing the debt- or to come forward with unequivocal evidence to support the exemption, \u201c[t]he burden of persuasion ... always remains with the objecting party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the Trustee, as the objecting party, has the burden of production and persuasion to show that CCP \u00a7 704.115 does not apply to the IRA Accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">\n<em>ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The Trustee suggests that the disputed IRA Accounts are not exempt based on the defining phrase in CCP \u00a7 704.115(a)(3), \u201cto the extent the amounts held in the account do not exceed the maximum amounts <em>exempt from federal taxation.\u201d </em>But upon closer examination, the Trustee is really arguing that the IRA Contributions, as opposed to the IRA Accounts themselves, are not exempt because they <em>were not deductible </em>from the Debtors\u2019 income. What then is the distinction between the concepts of \u201cexempt from taxation\u201d and \u201cdeductible from income\u201d? To answer that, the court must look to the IRS code and the ways in which the IRA Accounts and the IRA Contributions might be subject to taxation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">As discussed below, the Debtors complied with the limits imposed on their IRA Contributions, but they were not able to deduct those Contributions from their income. As a result, the IRA Contributions were taxed as regular income when the Debtors filed their tax returns. That tax was imposed on the Debtors\u2019 income, not on the IRA Accounts themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">Conversely, the IRA Accounts would be subject to a tax had they been overfunded. The IRS code and regulations limit the amount which an individual may deposit into a qualified private retirement plan without penalties or taxation. In the case, <em>inter alia, </em>that an individual contributes more than the contribution limit under the IRS code, the excess amount <em>held in the IRA </em>is taxed at 6% per year as long as that excess amount remains in the IRA account. Here, there is no dispute that the Debtors <em>did not </em>overfund their IRA Accounts. Accordingly, the IRS Accounts are \u201cexempt\u201d from the 6% tax and other possible penalties, that would be imposed if the Accounts held too much money.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">When construed as a whole, CCP \u00a7 704.115 cannot be read consistently with the interpretation offered by the Trustee.. CCP \u00a7 704.115 contains two tests for determining whether funds held in an IRA are exempt. The first test stated in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>section (a)(3) is objective, <em>i.e., </em>it requires the court to consider only the IRS statutes and regulations and determine whether all of the funds previously contributed to, and held in the retirement account, are \u201cexempt from federal income taxation.\u201d In other words, subsection (a)(3) appears to contemplate the <em>funds held </em>in the entire retirement plan, without regard to the owner\u2019s particular circumstances. \u2022 Conversely, the second test, stated in subsection (e) is subjective, <em>i.e., </em>it requires the court to consider the debtor\u2019s personal financial situation at the time of retirement and his or her ability to support dependents. Unlike the objective test, the second inquiry appears to be unrelated to the \u201ctax exempt\u201d status of the retirement plan itself. Notably, nowhere in \u00a7 704.115 is there any reference to the tax treatment applicable to the IRA Contributions themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The Trustee contends, in essence, that both of the tests described in the Statute are subjective. In addition to the Debtors\u2019 \u201csubjective\u201d personal financial situation at the time of retirement, the Trustee wants the court to use the (a)(3) test to consider the Debtors\u2019 \u201csubjective\u201d personal ability to deduct the IRA Contributions from income on their federal tax returns. The Debtors, however, argue that the qualification in subsection (a)(3) is an objective one. The court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">If the California legislature had intended subpart (a)(3) of the Statute to be a subjective test, ie., based on the Debtors\u2019 personal ability to deduct the IRA Contributions from income in any given year, it could have done so with clear and unambiguous language. The relevant term of the Statute would simply read, for example, \u201c... to the extent the amounts held in the plans, annuities, or accounts are traceable to contributions that were deductible from income for federal taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">A review of other exemptions in California law confirms that the legislature knew how to quality an exemption based on <em>subjective </em>factors. For example, in \u00a7 704.140(b), the legislature has subjectively conditioned the exemption of funds received on account of a personal injury: \u201c[A]n award of damages or a settlement arising out of personal injury <em>is exempt to the extent necessary for the support </em>of the judgment debtor and spouse and the dependents of the judgment debtor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">California\u2019s exemption law includes other statutes in which the exemption is based on both an \u201cobjective\u201d test, applicable to the nature of the assets itself, and a \u201csubjective\u201d test applied to the debtor\u2019s personal situation. For example, the \u201ctools of the trade\u201d exemption found in CCP \u00a7 704.060 includes both tests. The objective test in \u00a7 704.060(a) relates only to the description and value of the exempt asset:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASKP\">(a) Tools, implements, instruments, materials, uniforms, furnishings, books, equipment, one commercial motor vehicle, one vessel, and other personal property are exempt to the extent that the aggregate equity therein does not exceed [ (l)-(3) contain objective monetary limits on the value of what can be exempted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">The \u201csubjective test\u201d found in \u00a7 704.060(c) relates to the number and usage of the debtor\u2019s other vehicles.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-10\">(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a motor vehicle is not exempt under subdivision (a) if there is a motor vehicle exempt under Section 704.010 which is reasonably adequate - for use in the trade, business, or profession for which the exemption is claimed under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-11\"><em>The Turnover Motion. </em>The Trustee\u2019s right to compel turnover of the IRA Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>counts arises under \u00a7 542(a), which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-4\">[A]n entity ... in possession, custody, or control, during the case, of property that the trustee may use, sell, or lease under section 363 of this title ... shall deliver to the trustee, and account for, such property or the value of such property, unless such property is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Since the Debtors have properly exempted the IRA Accounts, there is no value in the IRA Accounts for unsecured creditors. The IRA Accounts are of. inconsequential value or benefit to the estate. Conversely, turnover of the IRA Accounts is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Based on the foregoing, the court is not persuaded that the term \u201cexempt from federal income taxation\u201d in CCP \u00a7 704.115(a)(3) means \u201cactually deducted from the Debtors\u2019 income.\u201d The fact that the Debtors could not deduct the IRA Contributions from their income for federal tax purposes is irrelevant to the question of whether the IRA Accounts themselves remained \u201cexempt\u201d from taxation after they were funded. Accordingly, the Trustee\u2019s Objection to the Debtors\u2019 exemption of the IRA Accounts will be overruled. Consequently, there is no basis to compel the Debtors to turn over any funds held in their IRA Accounts and the Turnover Motion will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-9\">.
