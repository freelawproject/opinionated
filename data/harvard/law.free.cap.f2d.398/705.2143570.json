KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b755-22\">The issue presented by this appeal is of great importance in determining the proper relationship of the federal courts to the military establishment. We are called upon to decide whether an enlisted member of the naval reserve claiming to be a conscientious objector may petition for a writ of habeas corpus to obtain review of the decision of his military superiors denying a discharge requested pursuant to Department of Defense and Navy Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-24\">The facts are undisputed and can be stated briefly. On September 30, 1963, appellant Charles A. Hammond, then a 17-year old high school student, enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve [reserve]. Since that date he has been on inactive duty and, at the time of the events here in question, was attached as an inactive reserve enlistee to the U.S.S. Coates, stationed in New Haven, Connecticut and commanded by appellee H. F. Lenfest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In September of 1964, Hammond entered the University of Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>necticut where he is presently enrolled as a student. Because of his exposure to new currents of thought, he became attracted to the tenets of the Society of Friends [Society] and in June 1966, became a member of the local \u201cMeeting\u201d of the Society.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is accepted that the Society of Friends is a religious body which adheres to a pacifistic interpretation of the scriptures. Accordingly, after joining the Society, Hammond became conscientiously opposed to war in any form and, on March 17, 1967, he submitted a request for a discharge to his commanding officer, Lenfest.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Hammond\u2019s heretofore futile efforts to secure a discharge \u2014 described below \u2022 \u2014 can only be understood in the context of the general procedures adopted in this country for dealing with conscientious objectors. We recently have had occasion to review the history of the special treatment afforded conscientious objectors, see United States v. Gearey, 368 F.2d 144 (2d Cir. 1966). For our purposes it is sufficient to note that commencing as early as 1661 \u2014 in the Colony of Massachusetts \u2014 and continuing to the present, statutory provisions have been in existence recognizing the special problems and status of conscientious objectors. Selective Service Monograph No. 11, Conscientious Objection Ch. Ill (1950). Despite the consistent national policy of exempting conscientious objectors from the full rigors of conscription, similar treatment has not been afforded those who become conscientious objectors after entering the service. Thus, both the language of the present draft law, see 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456(j), and judicial decisions make clear that the procedural and substantive protections of the statute apply to those facing induction and not to enlisted or inducted personnel already in the armed services. See, e. g., Brown v. McNamara, 263 F.Supp. 686, 691 (D.N.J.), aff\u2019d 387 F.2d 150 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, Brown v. Clifford, 390 U.S. 1005, 88 S.Ct. 1244, 20 L.Ed.2d 105 (1968). Indeed, until 1962, the Department of Defense had no procedures permitting the discharge of military personnel for reason of conscientious objection. See Comment, God, The Army, and Judicial Review: The In-Service Conscientious Objector, 56 Calif. L.Rev. 379, 401 n. 92 (1968) (letter of the Adjutant General of the Army). But, in 1962, pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 133 (1964), see Brown v. McNamara, supra, 263 F.Supp. at 688, the Secretary of Defense issued Department of Defense Directive [DOD] No. 1300.6 (August 21, 1962), providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">\u201cNo vested right exists for any individual to be discharged from military service at his own request before the expiration of his term of service, whether he is serving voluntarily or involuntarily. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">\u201cThe fact of conscientious objection does not exempt men from the draft; however, the Congress has deemed it more essential to respect a man\u2019s religious beliefs than to force him to serve in the Armed Forces. * * * Consistent with this national policy, bona fide conscientious objection by persons who are members of the Armed Forces will be recognized to the extent practicable and equitable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\">\u201c * * * request for discharge after entering military service, based solely on conscientious objection which existed but was not claimed prior to induction or enlistment, cannot be entertained.\u201d DOD No. 1300.6, Part III.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">In accordance with this directive the Navy promulgated its own implementing regulations. Bureau of Naval Personnel [BUPERS] Instruction 1616.6 (Nov. 15, 1962).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was pursuant to these regulations that Hammond sought his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>It is conceded that Hammond carefully and faithfully complied with the requirements of BUPERS 1616.6. His written discharge request contained a six-page appendix supplying necessary information: for example, his personal history, religious and other organization affiliations, the development of his conscientious objection beliefs and the manner in which his way of life established the depths of his convictions. In addition, Hammond submitted statements from various people, including the Clerk of his Meeting, attesting to his character and the sincerity and strength of his beliefs. In accordance with the regulations, commanding officer Lenfest proceeded to interview Hammond and forwarded his evaluation, together with the discharge request, to the Chief of Naval Personnel [CNP]. BUPERS 1616.6(5a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Len-fest, the only person who interviewed Hammond, concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">\u201c[I]t is my firm opinion that Hammond is completely sincere in his request and in the reason supporting it. I recommend that Hammond be discharged and inducted into the Alternative Service Plan conscientious objector\u2019s work program. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Hammond thus completed the procedural steps required of him by the regulations and had only to await the Navy\u2019s disposition of his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">DOD No. 1300.6 III(E) provides that \u201cclaims of conscientious objection by all persons, whether existing before or after entering military service should be judged by the same standards.\u201d Accordingly, the CNP referred Hammond\u2019s application to the Director of the Selective Service System, General Hershey, for an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d of its validity; the regulations contemplate that a nega-</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">tive decision by General Hershey will normally be decisive. BUPERS 1616.6 (5d) and (5f). General Hershey concluded, without further explanation, that \u201c[b]ased on the information in this [Hammond\u2019s] file, it is my opinion that Charles A. Hammond would not be classified as a conscientious objector if he were being considered for induction [by the Selective Service System] at this time.\u201d Lenfest was duly notified that \u201cin view of the foregoing [General Hershey\u2019s statement] Hammond\u2019s request for discharge by reason of conscientious objection is disapproved.\u201d On May 21, 1967, Lenfest reminded Hammond of his continuing duty to attend drills as required by his reserve obligation. Hammond refused and was ordered to report for two years\u2019 active duty on August 31, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Instead of commencing service, however, Hammond petitioned the District Court for Connecticut for a writ of ha-beas corpus and one week before he was to report for active duty, Judge Zam-pano issued a show cause order that directed, <em>inter alia,, </em>that Hammond \u201cremain in and not be removed from this district until further order of this court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hammond\u2019s basic contention in the court below was that the rejection of his request for a discharge was contrary to the provisions of DOD No. 1300.6 and BUPERS 1616.6 in that the denial of his conscientious objector status was without basis in fact, and that the decision was violative of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court found it unnecessary to evaluate these contentions: it questioned its jurisdiction, citing Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 93-94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>and Brown v. McNamara, supra,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and decided that Hammond had failed to exhaust his available administrative and military remedies, citing Noyd v. McNamara, 267 F.Supp. 701 (D.Colo.), aff'd, 378 F.2d 538 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1022, 88 S.Ct. 593, 19 L.Ed.2d 667 (1967). On this appeal, the government urges an additional ground for affirmance \u2014 that Hammond is not \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Before proceeding to our discussion of the issues, we wish to make clear that we are aware of the lessons of both history and precedent \u2014 that \u201cjudges are not given the task of running the Army -* * The military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian. Orderly government requires that the judiciary be as scrupulous not to interfere with legitimate Army matters as the Army must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters.\u201d Orloff v. Wil-loughby, supra, 345 U.S. at 93-94, 73 S.Ct. at 540. Judicial hesitancy when faced with matters touching on military affairs is hardly surprising in view of the doctrine of separation of powers and the responsibility for national defense which the Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1 and Art. II, \u00a7 2, places upon the Congress and the President. Moreover, the ever-present and urgent need for discipline in the armed services would alone explain the relative freedom of the military from judicial supervision. Nevertheless, in 1953 the Supreme Court indicated that in appropriate circumstances even a court martial proceeding \u2014 the ultimate method of enforcing discipline \u2014could be reviewed in a civil court on an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953). Cf. Harmon v. Brucker, 355 U.S. 579, 78 S.Ct. 433, 2 L.Ed.2d 503 (1958) (per curiam) (District Court has jurisdiction to review discharge pursuant to military loyalty-security program). And Chief Justice Warren, in his James Madison Lecture at New York University Law Center, noted that \u201cWhen the authority of the military has such a sweeping capacity for affecting the lives of our citizenry, the wisdom of treating the military establishment as an enclave beyond the reach of the civilian courts almost inevitably is drawn into question.\u201d Warren, The Bill of Rights and the Military, 37 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 181, 188 (1962). We emphasize, however, that the discussion which follows must be read in light of the precise contentions and factual situation presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the government\u2019s contention that the District Court lacked the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus because Hammond was not \u201cin custody\u201d as that term is used in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. While the language of the Act indicates that a writ of habeas corpus is appropriate only when a petitioner is \u201cin custody,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Act \u201cdoes not attempt to mark the boundaries of \u2018custody\u2019 nor in any way other than by use of that word attempt to limit the situations in which the writ can be used.\u201d Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 238, 83 S.Ct. 373, 375, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963) (habeas corpus available to petitioner on parole). And, recent Supreme Court decisions have made clear that \u201c[i]t [habeas corpus] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>to achieve its grand purpose \u2014 the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.\u201d Id. at 243, 83 S.Ct. at 377. See also Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968) (overruling the prematurity doctrine of McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238 (1934)); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968) (habeas corpus available although petitioner released from prison after writ is filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"> In the instant ease, the naval authorities claim jurisdiction over Hammond\u2019s person and the right to subject him to their orders and supervision. Indeed, it was necessary for the District Court to issue an order directing that Hammond not be taken out of the district during the pendency of this action. While it is true that Hammond is not presently confined, \u201cbesides physical imprisonment, there are other restraints on a man\u2019s liberty, restraints not shared by the public generally, which have been thought sufficient in the English-speaking world to support the issuance of habeas corpus.\u201d Jones v. Cunningham, supra, 371 U.S. at 240, 83 S.Ct. at 376. We recognize that the government\u2019s position is not lacking in support, see, e. g., In re Green, 156 F.Supp. 174 (S.D.Cal. 1957), appeal dismissed as moot, 264 F.2d 63 (9th Cir. 1959), but we believe the better reasoned and modern view is that a petitioner in Hammond\u2019s predicament is under sufficient restraint of his liberty to make appropriate habeas corpus jurisdiction. Any other view would make the ends to be served by the great writ wooden indeed. Moreover, in a case arising during World War II \u2014 at a time when this country was in at least as great a danger as it is today- \u2014 we held that habeas corpus was available to a draftee who was released from active service and transferred to the reserve after being inducted. United States ex rel. Altieri v. Flint, 54 F.Supp. 889 (D.Conn.1943) (Judge, later Circuit Judge, Hineks), aff\u2019d on the opinion below, 142 F.2d 62 (2d Cir. 1944).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This Court accepted Judge Hineks\u2019 reasoning that petitioner, although he was in the reserve and free to roam as he wished, was nevertheless \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of the statute: \u201cHis order [to report to active duty] * * * is in effect a continuing and effective assertion of custody, \u2014 a custody loose at the moment but a custody which may at any time be made as close as the military establishment by further order or regulation shall direct.\u201d 54 F.Supp. at 892. Hammond, of course, is subject to the same restraint as was Altieri; while not on active service and in the reserve (as was Altieri), he was (like Altieri) ordered to report for active duty. See also Ex parte Fabiani, 105 F.Supp. 139 (E.D.Pa.1952) (petitioner ordered to return to United States for pre-induction procedures or face indictment is in \u201cconstructive custody\u201d of the government) (cited with approval in Jones v. Cunningham, supra, 371 U.S. at 240 n. 11, 83 S.Ct. at 375).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">On the facts of this case, we can only echo the perplexity of Judge Hineks in <em>Altieri </em>when faced with the government\u2019s \u201clegalistic attitude,\u201d 54 F.Supp. at 892, that the writ will not lie until Hammond is in active military service. We fail to perceive how the interests of justice would be served or the question before us would be meaningfully different had Hammond first reported for active duty and then applied for the writ. Indeed, we can only understand the government\u2019s position on the assumption\u2014 which we reject \u2014 that Hammond would not be \u201cin custody\u201d even if he were on active military duty. Nor do we discern any distinguishing features because Hammond originally enlisted in the reserve. This factor has little meaningful relevance in considering whether a petitioner is in custody. See Jones v. Cunningham, supra, 371 U.S. at 240, 83 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>S.Ct. 373, 375. (\u201cHabeas Corpus has also been consistently regarded by the lower federal courts as the appropriate procedural vehicle for questioning the legality of an induction or <em>enlistment </em>into the military service\u201d (emphasis supplied)); In re Phillips\u2019 Petition, 167 F. Supp. 139 (S.D.Cal.1958). See also Crane v. Hedrick, 284 F.Supp. 250 (N.D.Cal.1968). But see Saunders v. Crouchley, 274 F.Supp. 505 (D.Neb.1967). Compare Miley v. Lovett, 193 F.2d 712 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 919, 72 S.Ct. 366, 96 L.Ed. 687 (1952). The question presented on an application for a writ of habeas corpus is the <em>present </em>legality of the restraint of liberty to which the petitioner is subjected, not whether the restraint was appropriate or justified in the past.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Nor can we accept the argument that Hammond is not \u201cin custody\u201d because he is subject to no more restraint than other persons under military orders: it is the validity of that very restraint which his petition has brought into question. We would have thought that the many cases in which inductees have successfully petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus should have settled the principle that a member of the armed forces can avail himself of the writ although he is subject only to normal military restraints.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See, e. g., Application of Kanas, 385 F.2d 506 (2d Cir. 1967). Compare Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953) (by implication). And Wales v. Whitney, 114 U.S. 564, 5 S.Ct. 1050, 29 L.Ed. 277 (1885), does not require a contrary result. Wales, a naval officer stationed in Washington, D. C., was placed under arrest and ordered to report for a court martial and given the complete freedom</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">of the city. Our reading of the case makes it clear that <em>Wales </em>does not stand for the proposition that a petitioner is not \u201cin custody\u201d because he is free within the limits of a city. Such an interpretation could not be reconciled with the settled doctrine that aliens refused entry into the United States \u2014 who are free to travel anywhere else in the world\u2014 can challenge their exclusion on an application for a writ of habeas corpus. See, e. g., Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 213, 73 S.Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953). The true rationale of <em>Wales </em>can be seen in the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">\u201c * * * as medical director, he [petitioner] was residing in Washington and performing there the duties of his office. <em>It is beyond dispute that the secretary of the navy had the right to direct him to reside in the city in performance of these duties. </em>* * * It is not easy to see how he is under any restraint of his personal liberty by the order of arrest, which he was not under before.\u201d 114 U.S. at 569-570, 5 S.Ct. 1050, 1052, 29 L.Ed 277. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">Since the only restraint to which the petitioner was subjected was concededly lawful, the Court correctly ruled that habeas corpus was inappropriate. See United States ex rel. Altieri v. Flint, supra, 54 F.Supp. at 893; Sokol, A Handbook of Federal Habeas Corpus 26-28 (1965). Hammond, of course, does not concede the validity of the restraints to which he is being subjected.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">We turn now to the government\u2019s contention that Hammond may not be permitted to petition for a writ of habeas</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>corpus because he has failed to exhaust available remedies with the military since he has not presented his conscientious objector claim as a defense at a court martial proceeding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are told, in effect, that until Hammond violates military law and subjects himself to action by court martial, the federal courts are without power to review the validity of the already completed administrative proceedings that resulted in the denial of his discharge. See Comment, 56 Calif.L.Rev., supra, at 440. Principal reliance is placed upon the recent decision in Noyd v. McNamara, 267 F.Supp. 701 (D.Colo.), aff\u2019d, 378 F.2d 538 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1022, 88 S.Ct. 593, 19 L.Ed.2d 667 (1967), in which the District Court refused to examine the conscientious objector claim of an Air Force captain with 11 years' service who was not a \u201ctotal pacifist\u201d but was merely opposed \u201cto the war that this country is waging in Vietnam.\u201d 267 F.Supp. at 703-704. It is possible to read <em>Noyd </em>as nothing more startling than an application of the settled doctrine that the federal courts will not interfere with duty assignments of persons lawfully in the armed forces, Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953). See Crane v. Hedrick, 284 F.Supp. 250, 252 (N.D.Cal.1968). To the extent that <em>Noyd </em>might suggest that a court martial is a prerequisite for federal court review of the claim that the petitioner, at the time of bringing suit, is not lawfully in the armed forces, we reject its reasoning. For several sufficient reasons we hold that Hammond\u2019s claim is now ripe for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U.S. 128, 71 S.Ct. 149, 95 L.Ed. 146 (1950), relied upon in <em>Noyd, </em>267 F.Supp. at 706, does not require that Hammond await the outcome of a yet to be convened court martial before petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus. In <em>Gusik, </em>the petitioner had already been court martialed and the Court simply concluded that once that route had been traversed, it was incumbent upon him to exhaust his appeal to the Judge Advocate General. Cf. Beard v. Stahr, 370 U.S. 41, 82 S.Ct. 1105, 8 L.Ed.2d 321 (1962) (per curiam) (action to review the recommended removal of an officer from the active list deemed \u201cpremature\u201d because the Secretary of the Army had not exercised his discretionary authority to order the removal); Gorko v. Commanding Officer, 314 F.2d 858, 860 (10th Cir. 1963) (habeas corpus sought after reversal of court martial conviction; second court martial scheduled).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">Moreover, Hammond applied for the writ only after receiving the opinion of the nation\u2019s highest Selective Service official (General Hershey) as to his proper status. There is no proceeding that he could now pursue that would culminate in a more expert or knowledgeable decision or one that would be of greater benefit or guidance to a civil court. Indeed, as we have already noted, the regulations require General Hershey\u2019s advisory opinion to insure uniformity of treatment for all conscientious objectors, whether within or without the service. Furthermore, Hammond contends \u2014 and the government does not assure us otherwise \u2014 that a court martial would consider itself bound by the determination of the Chief of Naval Personnel and would not entertain a challenge to the denial of Hammond\u2019s request. See Brown v. McNamara, 387 F.2d 150, 153 n. 5 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, Brown v. Clifford, 390 U.S. 1005, 88 S.Ct. 1244, 20 L.Ed.2d 105 (1968) (noting, but not ruling upon, the instant contention). And, we are referred to no case that suggests that presenting a conscientious objector claim as a defense to a charge of violating military law by failing to obey orders would be anything more than a futile and ritualistic gesture. The law knows no such requirement. See Wolff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>v. Selective Service, 372 F.2d 817, 825 (2d Cir. 1967). Compare Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 U.S. 40, 42-43, 88 S.Ct. 194, 19 L.Ed.2d 41 (1967) (per curiam); Marino v. Ragen, 332 U.S. 561, 564, 68 S.Ct. 240, 92 L.Ed. 170 (1947) (Justice Rutledge, concurring); United States ex rel. Floyd v. Wilkins, 367 F.2d 990, 993 (2d Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Further, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Hammond\u2019s predicament can be analogized to that of a state prisoner petitioning for federal relief, it is settled that the doctrine requiring the exhaustion of available state remedies is not one defining power but one which governs the proper exercise of power, compare Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U.S. 19, 27, 59 S.Ct. 442, 83 L.Ed. 455 (1939), and is rooted in considerations of comity rather than in the scope of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction, Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 418, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). See also Urquhart v. Brown, 205 U.S. 179, 181, 27 S.Ct. 459, 51 L.Ed. 760 (1907) ,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Where the exhaustion doctrine is applied, as in the state prisoner example, the petitioner has already committed the act for which he is to be punished. The remedy that must be exhausted \u2014 such as an application for a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>\u2014 is a true \u201cremedy\u201d; unlike a court martial, it affords the possibility of relief but does not subject the applicant to the risk of the imposition of additional sanctions. It is noteworthy that an inductee can challenge his classification by the Selective Service System without subjecting himself to the risk of imprisonment or other penalties. He can either refuse induction and present his allegedly improper classification as a defense in a criminal trial <em>or </em>he can submit to induction and petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 377, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428 (1955). In the latter event, he does not risk criminal penalties. If, on the other hand, we analogize a court martial to an administrative rather than judicial remedy, there is even less reason to require Hammond to be court martial-led on the facts of this case. \u201cWhen there is nothing to be gained * * * the courts have not been reluctant to discard [the exhaustion of administrative remedies] doctrine.\u201d Wolff v. Selective Service, supra, 372 F.2d at 825. Compare Townsend v. Zimmerman, 237 F.2d 376 (6th Cir. 1956) (Judge, now Justice, Stewart) (action to enjoin induction).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In addition, although the government maintains that Hammond should present his claim as a defense to a court martial, it fails to explain wherein lies his power to convene the court martial that is supposedly to judge him. And, as Professor Jaffe posits, where \u201c[o]ne must at his risk await such further enforcing procedure as the agency chooses to initiate * * * the exhaustion doctrine is inapplicable; the person has no remedy.\u201d Jaffe, The Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies, 12 Buff.L. Rev. 327, 329 (1963). We find further support for our conclusion that Hammond\u2019s claim is now ripe for adjudication in the many cases in which federal courts have entertained habeas corpus petitions brought by inductees without requiring that they exhaust the rather incongruous \u201cremedy\u201d of a court martial. See, e. g., Application of Kanas, supra. See also, Crane v. Hedrick, supra, 284 F.Supp. at 252. We perceive no meaningful distinction between review of the conscientious objector status of an inductee and military personnel whose beliefs ripen while in the service where, as here, the decision denying the latter\u2019s request for a discharge is based upon the opinion of the Director of Selective Service.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In both cases, the end result is that the petitioner\u2019s challenge, in reality, is to a determination of the Selective Service System, not the military, although the, military may have acted <em>pro forma.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The government also maintains that the decision below should be affirmed because the denial of conscientious objector status pursuant to DOD No. 1300.6 is not subject to judicial review. As we understand the government\u2019s position, it contends that no matter how arbitrary and capricious the denial, we are without power to afford a remedy because the discharge Hammond seeks is a matter of \u201cexecutive grace\u201d rather than \u201cright.\u201d But the exemption afforded conscientious objectors under the present conscription law has frequently been denominated a matter of \u201clegislative grace,\u201d e. g., Fleming v. United States, 344 F.2d 912, 915 (10th Cir. 1965), and, it is settled, as we have already indicated, that a Selective Service classification can be reviewed on a petition for habeas corpus. Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 377, 75 S.Ct. 392 (1955). We recognize, of course, that on this appeal we are dealing with Department of Defense regulations rather than a statute. We reach the same result, however, because a validly promulgated regulation binds the government as much as the individuals subject to the regulation; and, this is no less so because the governmental action is essentially discretionary in nature. See Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 372, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957) (discharge of foreign service officer on loyalty-security grounds); Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959). Indeed, the government\u2019s position would render nugatory the protection afforded servicemen by DOD No. 1300.6 and cannot be reconciled with the fundamental principle that ours is a government of laws, not men. Thus, we agree with the District of Columbia Circuit that \u201cthe District Court may review actions by military authorities which violate their own established regulations.\u201d Dunmar v. Ailes, 121 U.S.App. D.C. 45, 348 F.2d 51, 53 (1965) (review of order separating appellant from Military Academy) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Nor can we accept the contention that judicial review is precluded because DOD No. 1300.6VF provides that: \u201cDetermination by the military department, in accordance with the facts of the case and the guidelines furnished herein, shall be final with respect to the administrative separation of its members.\u201d This statement of policy certainly does not suggest that in appropriate cricumstances a federal court cannot inquire whether the military determination is indeed \u201cin accordance with the facts and the guidelines.\u201d Moreover, it would be strange doctrine to permit an executive department to oust a court of jurisdiction merely by stating in its regulations that a court cannot review agency rulings. And, the Supreme Court has not accepted comparable \u201cfinality\u201d arguments in closely related contexts. For example, in Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 119-22, 66 S.Ct. 423, 426, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946), the Court held that a statutory provision that \u201cdecisions of [the] local [draft] boards shall be final\u201d was not a bar to limited judicial review. See also Gusik v. Schilder, supra, 340 U.S. at 132, 71 S.Ct. at 152 (\u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d decision of Judge Advocate General made \u201cbinding upon all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of the United States\u201d does not preclude habeas corpus jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">As we indicated in part II of this opinion, the federal courts have traditionally afforded the military the broadest possible discretion in military matters and questions which touch on the national defense. But it would be a gross fiction to assume, on the record before us, that Hammond was denied a discharge because of military necessity or the requirements of the Navy; or that, in the words of the regulation, his discharge would not be \u201cpracticable or equitable.\u201d On the contrary, the Navy\u2019s own records allow but one conclusion \u2014 that \u201cin view of the foregoing [General Hershey\u2019s opinion] Hammond\u2019s request for a discharge by reason of conscientious objection [was] disapproved.\u201d The Navy, by its own regulation, chose to defer to Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>eral Hershey\u2019s decision; that decision should be subject to judicial review on a petition for habeas corpus in the same manner as other status classifications of the Selective Service System. See Brown v. McNamara, 387 F.2d 150 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, Brown v. Clifford, 390 U.S. 1005, 88 S.Ct. 1244, 20 L.Ed.2d 105 (1968) (opinions of JJ. Van Dusen and Maris); Crane v. Hedrick, 284 F.Supp. 252 (N.D.Cal.1968) (petition for habeas corpus granted and discharge ordered); Gilliam v. Reaves, 263 F.Supp. 378, 384-385 (W.D.La.1966) (relief denied on merits). But see Chavez v. Fergusson, 266 F.Supp. 879 (N.D.Cal.1967).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is no answer to suggest that Hammond\u2019s discharge might have been refused because of the exigencies of national defense or for some other reason not subject to judicial scrutiny. The fact remains that the Chief of Naval Personnel\u2019s decision was not grounded in considerations of military need and the question before us is the validity of the decision actually rendered, not of a decision that might have been on other facts. Cf. Vitarelli v. Seaton, supra, 359 U.S. at 539-540, 79 S.Ct. at 968; Roberts v. Vance, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 367, 343 F.2d 236, 239 (1964) (Secretary of Army not relieved of requirements of valid regulations by provision that \u201cexceptions to these regulations may be authorized on an individual basis\u201d where the record did. not suggest that any such authorization had been made).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Our previous discussion makes clear that our decision in no way interferes in legitimate military matters or improperly interjects the judiciary in questions of national defense. Nevertheless, by way of emphasis, we reiterate that we have dealt only with the precise issues presented by this appeal. Specifically, we have not held that a decision based on military exigencies refusing to discharge a serviceman lawfully in the armed forces \u2014 the situation that would have been presented, for example, if a soldier on a battlefield during World War II had been refused a discharge because of the needs of the service \u2014 is subject to judicial review. The federal courts have neither appropriate judicial standards nor the capacity for dealing with such questions. Compare the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1) (F) and (G) (act does not apply to \u201ccourts martial and military commissions [or] military authority exercised in the field in time of war or in occupied territory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">In sum, we are of the opinion that this case was ripe for adjudication and that the District Court should have ruled on the merits of the petition. Hammond concedes, as he must, that the applicable scope of review is the severely limited \u201cno basis in fact\u201d standard used on judicial review of Selective Service classifications. See United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 185, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965), quoting Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122-23, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the Distric.t Court should determine whether there is any basis in fact for the conclusion that, at the time of filing his request for a discharge, Hammond would not have been classified as a conscientious objector were he being considered for induction by the Selective Service System. A negative answer would obviate the need for further consideration of the remaining issues presented by Ham<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>mond\u2019s application. We note that the record before us does not contain a scintilla of evidence challenging the sincerity or depth of Hammond\u2019s conscientious objector beliefs or that these beliefs ripened after he entered the service. We therefore direct that the writ of habeas corpus be issued and Hammond ordered released from the Navy unless some evidence is introduced during the District Court hearing to provide a basis in fact for the denial of his request for a discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-25\">.

Hammond enlisted in the Naval Reserve on September 30, 1963, and thereby became a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, 10 U.S.C. c. 11, he became entitled to certain privileges, notably exemption from the Selective Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(a) (2), and assumed certain liabilities. Among the latter was subjection to military discpline, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(3). I see no justification for ruling, after he has enjoyed.the privileges for four and a half years, that he is now to be relieved of the obligations. In doing so, my brothers appear to have disregarded the principle summarized by the Chief Justice not long ago. \u201cSo far as the rel\u00e1tionship of the military to its own personnel is concerned, the basic attitude of the Court has been that the latter\u2019s jurisdiction is most limited.\u201d Warren, The Bill of Rights and the Military, in The Great Rights 89, 95 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The reasons assigned for relieving Hammond of his obligation to stand trial before a court martial and then pursue his appellate remedies within the military are that he cannot convene a court martial and that, if one is convened, adverse decision is a certainty. As to the first, there is little doubt that the Navy is ready to set its disciplinary machinery in motion if Hammond persists in refusing to report for active duty, once the district court lifts its stay. In any event Hammond suffers no harm until it does; the threat of a court martial is not impairing his continued adherence to his conscientious objection. There is likewise no basis for assuming that proceedings under the Code of Military Justice will be an exercise in futility. The Navy\u2019s Regulations, BUPERS 1616.6f, say only that \u201cIndividuals for whom neither 1-0 nor I-A-0 classification is recommended by Selective Service normally will be retained in the naval service, subject to normal duty requirements.\u201d It would be well within the competence of a court martial to rule that, in the absence of evidence supporting General Hershey\u2019s \u201cadvisory opinion,\u201d it would follow the recommendation of Commanding Officer Lenfest, although, quite naturally, the Government cannot assure us what the decision will be. As the Chief Justice has also said, \u201cour recent experience has shown * * * that the Court of Military Appeals can be an effective guarantee of our citizens\u2019 right to due process when they are subjected to trial by court martial.\u201d Supra at 98. It will be ample time for a civil court to act if the military tribunals fail to grant Hammond the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">My brothers seem to concede, as I think Supreme Court decisions compel, that if a court martial had been convened, habeas corpus would not lie until military remedies had been exhausted. See Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U.S. 128, 71 S.Ct. 149, 95 L.Ed. 146 (1950); Beard v. Stahr, 370 U.S. 41, 82 S.Ct. 1105, 8 L.Ed.2d 321 (1962). I fail to perceive why Hammond should stand better because he beat the Navy to the draw. As to this I would follow the reasoning of Judge Doyle, adopted by the Tenth Circuit, in Noyd v. McNamara, 267 F.Supp. 701 (D.Colo.), aff\u2019d, 378 F.2d 538, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1022, 88 S.Ct. 593, 19 L.Ed.2d 667 (1967). The cases allowing draftees to challenge an allegedly wrongful induction by habeas corpus are so plainly inapposite, see 267 F.Supp. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>708, as to render their discussion supererogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The tension between \u201cproper regard for habeas corpus, \u2018the great writ of liberty\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthe duty of civil courts to abstain from intervening in matters constitutionally committed to military justice\u201d inevitably \u201craises questions of great delicacy and difficulty.\u201d Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 148, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 1052, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953) (Mr. Justice Frankfurter). I regret that my brothers\u2019 understandable resentment at what appears to be an arbitrary \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d by the Director of Selective Service should lead to civil interference with the military, which may be needless and surely is premature in this case and will doubtless precipitate a flood of applications for similar relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\">On Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<author id=\"b766-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">On this petition for rehearing, we have been advised that the armed services have recently adopted new regulations, not previously brought to the attention of this court, dealing with the administrative discharge of conscientious objectors from the armed services. See United States ex rel. Mankiewicz v. Ray, 399 F.2d 900 (2d Cir. 1968). In light of these new regulations, which make major improvements in the procedures to be followed by applicants for conscientious objector discharges, we believe that the interests of justice and a proper regard for the relationship of the armed services and the federal courts would best be served by sending the case back to the Department of the Navy with directions that Hammond\u2019s application be processed in accordance with the new regulations. We, therefore, remand the case to the District Court to return the matter to the Naval authorities and, in view of the disposition of Hammond\u2019s application for a discharge, for whatever further proceedings may prove necessary not inconsistent with the opinion of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
