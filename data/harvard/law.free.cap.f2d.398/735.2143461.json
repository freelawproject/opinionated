Appellant, a Maine corporation, operates a fleet of taxicabs in Chicago, Illinois. Appellee union<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the union) is the certified collective bargaining agent of appellant\u2019s drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">On May 10, 1966, appellant discharged Harold Ray, one of its cab drivers, on the ground that he was unsuitable for employment as a driver. The union intervened on Ray\u2019s behalf at a grievance meeting on May 13. At that .meeting appellant refused to reconsider its discharge of Ray. There was no further communication on the matter between appellant and the union until ten weeks later when the union, at a regular grievance meeting, attempted to discuss the reinstatement of Ray. Appellant refused to discuss the matter. Two weeks later, on August 5, 1966, the union requested arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-18\">At the outset of arbitration proceedings appellant challenged the arbitrability of the dispute, contending the union had not complied with contractual requirements that grievances be submitted in writing and that requests for arbitration be submitted within twenty days after the Company\u2019s adverse decision on a grievance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-19\">The arbitrator rejected the first of these contentions on the ground that appellant had not previously enforced the writing requirement, although numerous grievances had been processed. He rejected the second contention on the ground that the twenty-day limitation on requests for arbitration should be measured from the date of the last discussion of Ray\u2019s discharge between appellant and the union. The arbitrator construed the arbitration provision of the contract as having the purpose of encouraging voluntary settlement of grievances prior to arbitration. He found that many discharge grievances concerning appellant\u2019s drivers had been settled in the course of time by reinstatement and concluded that the purpose of the grievance procedure would be frustrated if the contract were narrowly construed to require resort to arbitration within twenty days of the Company\u2019s first denial of a grievance. As he saw it \u201cthe issue * * * is whether or not there was a reasonable basis for the union\u2019s belief, that the grievance was still open for discussion and possible settlement.\u201d He found that there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-20\">On the merits the arbitrator concluded that Ray\u2019s discharge was unjust. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>awarded Ray back pay in the amount of $3,033.66. However, he denied reinstatement, finding that a letter which Ray wrote to appellant\u2019s insurance carrier following his discharge revealed a motivation that disqualified him as an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Appellant petitioned the district court on May 26,1967 to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award on grounds that he exceeded his power and displayed evident bias and partiality. The union cross-petitioned for enforcement of the award, and both parties moved for summary judgment. The court, in its memorandum order granting summary judgment for the union, refused to review the arbitrator\u2019s determination of the procedural questions and found that the arbitrator neither exceeded his authority nor displayed bias or partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The first question presented by this appeal is whether the arbitrator\u2019s decision on questions of procedural arbitrability are subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court has held that disagreements concerning procedural arbitrability should not be considered as separate disputes, but as aspects of the dispute which called the grievance procedure into play and should therefore be left to the arbitrator. John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964). It cannot be supposed that the courts, recognizing the arbitrator\u2019s exclusive authority to determine procedural questions, may upset the arbitrator\u2019s determination in a review proceeding, unless it is arbitrary, capricious or not adequately grounded on the applicable collective bargaining agreement. See Dallas Typographical Union No. 173 v. A. H. Belo Corp., 5 Cir., 372 F.2d 577 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\"> The arbitrator\u2019s resolution of procedural questions is a part of his decision on the merits of the dispute, as the Supreme Court suggested in <em>Wiley. </em>As such, it is subject to the limited standard of review annunciated in United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-10\">\u201c[A]n arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may of .course look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. When the arbitrator\u2019s words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.\u201d 363 U.S. at 597, 80 S.Ct. at 1361. Torrington Co. v. Metal Products Workers Union Local 1645, 2 Cir., 362 F.2d 677 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">The arbitrator\u2019s decision, including his resolution of the procedural questions, clearly draws its essence from the contract. Appellant does not suggest that his decision on the merits is not based on the contract. His decision that compliance with the requirement of written grievances had been excused was based on the parties\u2019 practical construction of the contract. \u201cThe labor arbitrator\u2019s source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract, as the industrial common law \u2014 the practices of the industry and the shop \u2014 is equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 581-582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1352, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960). The arbitrator\u2019s decision that the period of limitation for filing arbitration requests runs from the .parties\u2019 last discussion of the grievance was based on his interpretation of the contract in light of the practice of the shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">We do not sit to pass upon the arbitrator\u2019s construction of contractual provisions. \u201c[T]he question of interpretation of the collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>agreement is a question for the arbitrator. It is the arbitrator\u2019s construction which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., supra, 363 U.S. at 599, 80 S.Ct. at 1362. Avco Corp., etc. v. Mitchell, 6 Cir., 336 F.2d 289 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">We find nothing in Torrington Co. v. Metal Products Workers Union Local 1645, supra, that compels us to an opposite conclusion. The court there applied the same standard of review that we apply here, but concluded that the arbitrator\u2019s award did not draw its essence from the contract. That award was based on a company policy that had no foundation in the contract. The arbitrator there concluded that the policy was \u201ccarried over\u201d when an existing contract was continued with modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the arbitrator was biased rests solely on the alleged \u201coutrageous\u201d inconsistency between his award of back pay to Ray and his denial of reinstatement. The Supreme Court has recognized the need for flexibility in arbitration remedies. See United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., supra. The contract contains no provision on remedies, leaving the arbitrator free to exercise his discretion. The award of back pay to a wrongfully discharged employee is obviously within the authority of an arbitrator. Arbitration would be meaningless if the arbitrator lacked the authority to redress the economic wrong inflicted on such an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">We do not find an inconsistency so glaring as to require us to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. The letter found to disqualify Ray for employment was written after his wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-12\">.
