A month after this action was commenced a second action, SEC v. Fifth Avenue Coach Lines, Inc., D.C., 289 F.Supp. 3, was brought in the Southern District alleging violations by the same defendants of the federal securities laws. The second action has been tried and decided by Judge McLean, whose opinion was filed July 26, 1968. That decision calls for the appointment of a receiver. The opinion also says, \u201cThere is no need to duplicate expense. The court has conferred with Judge Palmieri who authorizes the court to state that upon appointment of a receiver, he will vacate his order in the <em>Braasch </em>case appointing the Special Fiscal Agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-14\">At the time this court heard oral arguments on the present appeal sufficient safeguards for the protection of the interests of all parties were provided by Judge Palmieri\u2019s order, as modified by Judge Friendly\u2019s ruling on appellants\u2019 application for a stay, and the appeal was therefore, permitted to lie fallow, pending Judge McLean\u2019s decision in the S.E.C. action. With the appointment of a receiver, the interim protective arrangements are no longer necessary and the orders implementing them may be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-15\">Accordingly the case is remanded to the District Court for appropriate action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
