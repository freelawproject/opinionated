He alleges specifically that he was not warned of his right to counsel when he made incriminating statements to the interrogating F.B.I. agents and that, because of these statements, he was compelled to plead guilty. Appellant also contends that a certain assistant United States attorney offered to obtain a lenient sentence for a plea of guilty, which sentence was to be concurrent with the sentence he was then serving in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">After an evidentiary hearing comprising 110 pages of the record on appeal, the district judge found that appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel was valid. The record supports this conclusion. See Putt v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 64, 65 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">Appellant\u2019s allegation regarding 'the voluntariness of his plea of guilty is also without merit. The district court found after the hearing that appellant\u2019s plea was entirely voluntary and this finding is sustained by the record. See Broxson v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1967, 372 F.2d 944; Busby v. Holman, 5 Cir., 1966, 356 F.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">No error has been found in the district court\u2019s judgment. The order of denial is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"Ae7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
