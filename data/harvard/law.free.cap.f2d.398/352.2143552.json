The Board\u2019s order, which affirmed the hearing examiner, is reported at 159 NLRB 108. The facts are adequately reported in the decision of the hearing examiner and the order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">The respondent does not contest the finding that by reason of interrogations during an organization campaign an 8(a) (1) violation occurred. The 8(a) (3) violation is the consequence of the discharge of one Robert McCall, Jr., allegedly for union activities. The trial examiner, affirmed by the Board, credited all witnesses appearing for the union and discredited all witnesses appearing for the company. We cannot say, however, that his factual conclusions are without support on the record, considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-22\">We, therefore, affirm the order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-23\">Entered by order of the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
