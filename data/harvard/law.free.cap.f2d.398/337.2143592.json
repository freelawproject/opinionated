Insofar as the orders proscribe other unfair labor practices and require the reinstatement of employee Goins, they will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">The Board\u2019s findings that Heck\u2019s, Inc., violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by inter-' rogating employees with regard to their union sympathies, threatening reprisals against employees for their union support, creating the impression of surveillance of its employees\u2019 union activities and offering employees benefits in exchange for their union opposition, are supported by substantial evidence. There is also substantial evidence to support the finding that employee Goins was discharged for his union activities, his dismissal being a violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">However, the Board\u2019s findings that the refusal of Heck\u2019s, Inc. to bargain with the unions was a violation of \u00a7 8 (a) (5) and (1) of the Act cannot stand. The Teamsters and the Meat Cutters based their demands for recognition and bargaining on union authorization cards. In the Charleston area warehouses, the union had obtained 13 signed authorization cards from the employees in the requested unit of 26 members when the first demand for recognition was made. An additional card was procured the next day when a second demand was made. The Ashland store union fared a little better, obtaining 21 signed authorization cards from 38 employees in the unit, although there'was some ambiguity as to the precise size of the bargaining unit requested. Heck\u2019s, Inc. refused to recognize and bargain with the unions under a claim of belief that they had not yet attained majority status in the respective bargaining units.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">We have recently discussed the unreliability of the cards, in the usual case, in determining whether or not a union has attained a majority status and have concluded that an employer is justified in entertaining a good faith doubt of the union\u2019s claims when confronted with a demand for recognition based solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>upon union authorization cards. We have also noted that the National Labor Relations Act after Taft-Hartley amendments provides for an election as the sole basis of a certification and restricts the Board to the use of secret ballots for the resolution of representation questions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is not one of those extraordinary cases in which a bargaining order might be an appropriate remedy for pervasive violations of \u00a7 8(a) (1). It is controlled by our recent decisions and their reasoning. See NLRB v. S. S. Logan Packing Co., 4 Cir., 386 F.2d 562; NLRB v. Sehon Stevenson and Co., 4 Cir., 386 F.2d 551; Crawford Mfg. Co. v. NLRB, 4 Cir., 386 F.2d 367, cert. denied 390 U.S. 1028, 88 S.Ct. 1408, 20 L.Ed.2d 286. There was not substantial evidence to support the findings of the Board that Heck\u2019s, Inc. had no good faith doubt of the unions\u2019 claims of majorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Enforcement granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-15\">. 166 NLRB Nos. 32 and 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-20\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-14\">.
