Lookretis, 7 Cir., 385 F.2d 487, was vacated by the Supreme Court following its decisions in Mar-chetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889; and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>19 L.Ed.2d 906, and the case remanded to this Court \u201cfor further consideration in the light of\u201d Marchetti, and Chapman v. State of California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The pertinent facts are adequately set forth in our previous opinion (385 F.2d 487) and need not be repeated here. The case was tried upon a stipulation of facts, and exhibits admitted in evidence by stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In disposing of the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination issue raised by the defendant\u2019s contention that his conviction rests in part on evidence in the form of disclosures compelled by the federal wagering tax statutes (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4411 and \u00a7 4412) we concluded (385 F.2d 489-490) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">\u201cInasmuch as the stipulation otherwise, and wholly apart from and independent of the recital concerning the application for and issuance of the federal wagering tax stamp, established the fact of defendant\u2019s partnership in the operation of the baseball pool we do not reach the Fifth Amendment constitutional issue defendant seeks to tender. No substantial right of the defendant is involved where, as here, the disclosure complained of was merely cumulative of other competent evidence and did not, even if erroneously admitted, prejudice defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, particularly in the absence of a jury. Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 U.S.C.A.); Butler v. United States, 7 Cir., 138 F.2d 977, 980.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In its brief on remand the government concedes that the \u201charmless-constitutional-error rule\u201d promulgated in Chapman v. State of California, 386 U.S. 18, 22, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, to the effect that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">\u201c * * * there may be some constitutional errors which in the setting of a particular case are so unimportant and insignificant that they may, consistent with the Federal Constitution, be deemed harmless, not requiring the automatic reversal of the conviction.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">is subject to a limitation that once a constitutional infraction has been shown, the government must \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained\u201d. Chapman, supra, p. 24, 87 S.Ct. p. 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">In <em>Marchetti </em>it was held that nothing in United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22, 73 S.Ct. 510, 97 L.Ed. 754, and Lewis v. United States, 348 U.S. 419, 75 S.Ct. 415, 99 L.Ed. 475:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-15\"><em>\u201c * </em>* * now suffiees to preclude petitioner\u2019s assertion of the constitutional privilege [against self-incrimination] as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent <em>Kahriger </em>and <em>Lewis </em>are overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-17\">As we understand the impact of <em>Mar-chetti </em>on the instant case the stipulated disclosures compelled by defendant\u2019s compliance with the federal wagering tax statutes are inadmissible against him over his assertion of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. And in Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, p. 71, 88 S.Ct. 709, p. 715, it was pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-18\">\u201cGiven the decisions of this Court in Kahriger and Lewis, supra, which were on the books at the time of petitioner\u2019s trial, and left untouched by Albertson v. SACB, supra [382 U.S. 70, 86 S.Ct. 194, 15 L.Ed.2d 165], we are unable to view his failure to present this issue as an effective waiver of the constitutional privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-19\">The above quoted observation, which gives recognition to the pre<em>Marchetti </em>force of <em>Kahriger </em>and <em>Lewis, </em>is equally apposite to any attempt to divine whether or not the compelled disclosures may have contributed to the finding of guilt made by the trial judge. We are unable to state that the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial judge despite <em>Kahriger </em>and <em>Lewis </em>rejected the probative value of the compelled disclosures and relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>solely on other evidence which is not subject to the Fifth Amendment challenge. In view of this we are not persuaded by the government\u2019s argument that the trial judge must be presumed to have exercised his ability to discrimi-nately treat the improperly admitted evidence without drawing any prejudicial inferences therefrom. Such argument overlooks the fact that the trial judge would have had no reason, in this <em>pre-Marchetti </em>trial, to regard the recitals of the stipulation concerning the application for and issuance of the federal wagering tax stamp as being inadmissible against the defendant on a Fifth Amendment challenge, which although not made was, nevertheless, in the posture of this case, not waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Under the circumstances of this case we have no basis for concluding that the error was harmless. That there was competent evidence upon which the trial court <em>might </em>have relied is beside the point. The trial judge had no reason to reject what the teaching of <em>Marchetti </em>has since established to be inadmissible on a proper assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The District Court\u2019s judgment order of conviction and sentence is vacated, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b114-7\">KNOCH, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ALD\">(dissenting) .</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">I believe that the position set out in the original opinion of this Court by Chief Judge Castle is still the correct one. Wholly apart from and independent of the recital concerning the application for and issuance of the federal wagering stamp, the stipulation established the fact of the defendant\u2019s partnership in the operation of the baseball pool. The evidence to which exception is taken was merely cumulative. This was not a jury trial. The error was harmless and did not rise to such gravity as to require reversal of this conviction which was amply supported by competent evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
