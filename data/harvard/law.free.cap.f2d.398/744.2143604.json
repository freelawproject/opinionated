The trial court imposed a 5-year prison sentence and Grundy filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-27\">Grundy\u2019s Selective Service \u201cjacket\u201d was introduced into evidence in the course of the testimony of the clerk of his draft board, Mrs. Agnes Kehoe. It disclosed, in relevant part, these facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-28\">Grundy, then 18 years of age, registered for the draft on November 23, 1962. In a \u201cClassification Questionnaire\u201d which he completed and filed on May 19, 1964, he claimed he was a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>scientious objector and requested that he be furnished with a \u201cSpecial Form for Conscientious Objector\u201d. The Form was sent to him on June 16, 1964 and when he advised the draft board that he had not received it he was sent a duplicate form which he completed and filed July 8, 1964. He claimed therein that he conscientiously objected to any form of military service, combatant or otherwise, \u201cby reason of my religious training and belief\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Grundy was given a 1-A classification by his draft board on August 5, 1964, and a \u201cClassification Card\u201d was mailed to him on August 11, 1964 advising him of this classification and his right to appeal from it within 10 days. Grundy never filed an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Nine months later, on May 11, 1965, the draft board sent him a \u201cCurrent Information Questionnaire\u201d. He never filed it even though the board sent him a second notice on May 25, 1965 requesting that he do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">On June 8, 1965 the board sent Grundy an \u201cOrder to Report For Armed Forces Physical Examination\u201d on June 29, 1965, but he failed to appear. On July 21, 1965, the board declared him \u201cdelinquent\u201d and sent him a \u201cDelinquency Notice\u201d the following day, which advised him that he had been declared \u201cdelinquent\u201d by reason of the fact that he had \u201cfailed to report for physical examination on June 29, 1965\u201d. In this \u201cNotice\u201d Grundy was \u201cdirected to report to this local board immediately, either in person or by mail\u201d and advised that his failure to comply would constitute a violation of the Universal Military Training and Service Act punishable by imprisonment \u201cfor as much as 5 years or a fine of as much as $10,000, or both\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">When Grundy failed to reply, the board, on July 23, 1965 mailed him an \u201cOrder to Report For Induction\u201d on August 9, 1965. This Order stated \u201cDelinquent \u2014 For Immediate Induction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Grundy failed to report for induction on August 9, 1965 and he was indicted some five months later on January 26, 1966. He entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty on February 10, 1966; court-appointed counsel was then assigned to represent him and his case came to trial more than a year later on March 22,1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Mrs. Kehoe was the government\u2019s sole witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">Grundy testified in his own defense and called no other witness. He said that he had not appealed his 1-A classification because the 10-day period for appeal had expired when it first came to his attention some 20 days after he returned from an out-of-town visit. He said that he subsequently did not advise the board of the circumstance of his absence from the city when the classification notice was received at his home, or of his desire to appeal. He also admitted, after he had earlier testified to the contrary that he had received the board\u2019s notice to appear for a physical examination and had not complied with it. He admitted, too, that he had received his induction notice and had failed to comply with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">On this appeal Grundy\u2019s counsel, a member of the [Public] Defenders Association of Philadelphia, contends that the trial judge erred \u201cin showing a degree of prejudice toward the defendant that could scarcely have failed to influence the jury\u2019s verdict and move the judge to impose an unduly severe sentence\u201d, and further requests this Court to remand the case for \u201cevidentiary hearings on issues of fact personally raised by the appellant which are incapable of being decided by the appellate court\u201d, referred to in a letter addressed by Grundy to his present counsel. The critical substance of the stated \u201cissues of fact\u201d relate to Grundy\u2019s complaint that he was inadequately represented at his trial by his trial court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that there is no basis for either of the above stated contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">The record does not disclose \u201cundue participation\u201d by the trial judge in the interrogation of either Mrs. Kehoe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>or Grundy, nor does it indicate any prejudicial attitude on the part of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">In United States v. Kelly, 3 Cir., 329 F.2d 314 (1964), where a similar contention was advanced by the appellant we said at page 315:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">\u201cAs to undue participation by a judge in the interrogation of witnesses, \u2018The test is not the number of questions which the trial court asks\u2019. United States v. DeFillo, 257 F.2d 835, 839 (2 Cir. 1958). The test is whether, because of such questioning, the defendant was prejudiced. United States v. Stayback, 212 F.2d 313, 320 (3 Cir. 1954)\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The trial judge\u2019s questions, insofar as Grundy was concerned, were well within the normal confines of permissible judicial participation in the trial, and gave no indication of prejudicial motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">On the latter score, it must be observed that the trial judge, in his charge to the jury, expressly instructed it that it was not to \u201cassume that I hold any opinion on the matters to which my questions related\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">It should also be noted that at no point in the trial was there any objection taken to any of the questions addressed to either Mrs. Kehoe or Grundy by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">With respect to Grundy\u2019s contention that he was inadequately represented by his trial counsel it need only be said that the record discloses the contrary to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">This, too, must be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">Grundy, in his letter attached to his counsel\u2019s brief, challenges the validity of his 1-A classification by his draft board. This challenge cannot be entertained in view of Grundy\u2019s failure to appeal his 1-A classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">It is settled that failure to appeal from a 1-A classification by a draft board constitutes a waiver of a defendant\u2019s right to challenge the validity of his classification in his criminal prosecution for failure to submit to induction. United States v. Kurki, 384 F.2d 905, 907 (7 Cir. 1967), cert. den. 390 U.S. 926, 88 S.Ct. 861, 19 L.Ed.2d 987 (1968); Noland v. United States, 380 F.2d 1016, 1017 (10 Cir. 1967), cert. den. 389 U.S. 945, 88 S.Ct. 308, 19 L.Ed.2d 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">For the reasons stated the judgment of sentence of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-29\">.
