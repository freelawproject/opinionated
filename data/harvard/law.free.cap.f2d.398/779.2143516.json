A., (Depositor). The villainous artful forger, Carlos Echeverr\u00eda, has clouded the equities between the two protagonists not only by his consummate calligraphic talents but also by his position as the Depositor's agent and auditor in Panama. The district court below discarded a relevant Panamanian statute as being vague and inconclusive, found the proximate cause of Echeverria\u2019s success to be the Bank\u2019s negligence, and ruled for the Depositor. Compania de Aguaceros, S.A. v. First National City Bank, D.C.C.Z.1966, 256 F.Supp. 658. We find unequivocal and controlling sustance in said statute and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">The Depositor was a Panamanian corporation engaged in the sale of various airlines and aircraft throughout Latin America. Although the Depositor maintained a cheeking account with the Bank\u2019s Panamanian branch, Joseph M. Silver-thorne, who was the Depositor\u2019s organizer and treasurer, and who was the only executive authorized to sign checks on the Panamanian Bank, resided in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Panamanian law required the Depositor to maintain a resident agent in Panama, and Silverthorne engaged the auditing firm of Farca, S.A. (Farcasa). In 1962 Echeverr\u00eda bought out the owner of Farcasa and thus placed himself in the position of trust from which he later gamed his gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">The nine forged checks on the Depositor\u2019s account totaled $44,000 and covered the period from October 11, 1963, to February 25,1964. Each check was returned by the Bank, with the statement for the month in which it was paid, on or about the first of the following month. However, because Farcasa received the canceled checks and statement, Silverthorne remained an innocent abroad and no protest was made prior to March 20, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">On March 19, 1964, Silverthorne returned to Panama, having been absent since October 29, 1963. He went to the Bank to establish a letter of credit and, while there, discovered that the balance in his company\u2019s account was substantially lower than it should have been. Because Echeverria\u2019s forgeries were skillfully done, Silverthorne was unable to determine immediately which cheeks he himself had not signed. With the Bank\u2019s help, however, he did trace the forged checks to Echeverr\u00eda. According to the Bank, Echeverria was less artful at the casino than he was in the auditor\u2019s office, and so the two victims of the fraud must contest the ultimate loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>At trial both parties stipulated the existence of the following three Panamanian statutes:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Article 989 of the Panama Commercial Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">\u201cArticle 989. \u2014 Banks are required to furnish their customers their accounts current at least eight days after the end of each quarter or liquidation period agreed upon, requesting their written conformity thereof, and the latter, or any comments that may be in order with respect thereto, must be presented within five days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">\u201cShould a customer fail to reply within said period, his account will be held as admitted and the debit or credit balance shall be definitive as of the date of such account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Article 23 of the Negotiable Instruments Law of Panama:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-8\">\u201cArticle 23. \u2014 When a signature is forged or made without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, it is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the instrument, or to give a discharge therefor, or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto, can be acquired through or under such signature, unless the party, against whom it is sought to enforce such right, is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority.\u201d Article 9 of the Civil Code of Panama:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-9\">\u201cArticle 9. \u2014 When the meaning of the law is clear, its literal content shall not be discarded under pretext of questioning its true spirit or intention. However, for the purpose of interpreting any obscure expression of law it is permissible to have recourse to the intention or spirit clearly manifested in the law itself or in the trustworthy history of its institution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">The trial judge, in his conclusions of law, found: \u201c5. Article 989 is ambiguous and needs interpretation for its exact meaning cannot be determined from its language.\u201d 256 F.Supp. at 663. Then, while reviewing the testimony of three expert witnesses, he concluded: \u201c6. The experts are divided on the effect that is given in Panama to the provisions of Article 989 but it seems that the proper interpretation is that it is not peremptory and establishes only a prima facie situation which is subject to rebuttal.\u201d 256 F.Supp. at 663. In the remainder of his opinion the trial judge exculpated Silver-thorne and placed the determinative blame on the Bank. He awarded to the Depositor the sum of $44,000 plus interest from March 20, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">We will not review the trial court\u2019s finding of negligence because we find that Panamanian Article 989 clearly precludes the Depositor\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">I. Panamanian Law, Question of Law or Question of Fact?</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">This first issue, a procedural one, is brought to light by the Depositor\u2019s brief. The first sentence of that brief begins, \u201cThis case involves several questions, all of them only of fact * * * \u201d and concludes by quoting the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Further in the brief the following conclusion is reached:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-17\">\u201cWe, therefore, submit that the trial court found as a fact the proper interpretation of foreign law \u2014 and, of course, it is a fundamental proposition that foreign law is a question of fact in the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-18\">Although we find no direct attack on this \u201cfundamental proposition\u201d in the Bank\u2019s brief, we refer both parties to Rule 44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That Rule reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-19\">\u201cRule 44.1 Determination of Foreign Law</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-20\">A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the law of a foreign country shall give notice in his pleadings or other reasonable written notice. The court, in determining foreign law, may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under Rule 43. <em>The court\u2019s determination shall be treated as a ruling on a question of law. </em>Added Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Rule 44.1 (1967 Supp.) (Emphasis ' added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules add:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-5\">\u201cUnder the third sentence, the court\u2019s determination of an issue of foreign law is to be treated as a ruling on a question of \u2018law,\u2019 not \u2018fact,\u2019 so that appellate review will not be narrowly confined by the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of Rule 52(a). Cf. Uniform Judicial Notice of Foreign Law Act \u00a7 3; Note, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 318 (1958).\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. Rule 44.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Prior to July 1, 1966, although our Court had accepted the common law classification of foreign law as an issue of fact,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we had consistently recognized the hybrid nature of such a classification. Thus, the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule was often ignored on review especially when the relevant foreign statutes were available in English.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the responsibility of interpreting foreign statutes at trial was given to the judge rather than to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further reconciliation of the \u201cfact\u201d label with the predominantly \u201claw\u201d application has been made unnecessary by the functional approach of Rule 44.1. Regardless of the special procedures of proof listed in Rule 44.1, without doubt one purpose of the Rule is the relief of foreign law schizophrenia by the recognition of such law <em>as law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-21\">An exhaustive analysis, past and present, of determinations of foreign law can be found in Miller, \u201cFederal Rule 44.1 and the \u2018Fact\u2019 Approach to Determining Foreign Law; Death Knell for a DieHard Doctrine,\u201d 65 Mich.L.Rev. 613-750 (1967). See also Kaplan, \u201cContinuing Work of the Civil Committee: 1966 Amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (II),\u201d 81 Harvard L.Rev. 591, 613-17 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-23\">Litigation in this case began on November 30, 1964, well before the promulgation or the effective date of Rule 44.1. However, the proceedings continued until July 5, 1966, after the Rule\u2019s effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>date, and the district court\u2019s decision was rendered on August 11, 1966. The 1966 amendments to the federal rules provide that all rules taking effect on July 1, 1966, \u201cshall govern all proceedings in actions brought thereafter and also in <em>all further proceedings, in actions then pending, </em>except to the extent that in the opinion of the court their application in a particular action then pending would not be feasible or would work injustice * * * \u201d 28 U.S.C.A. Rule 86. (Emphasis added.) Under the facts of this case, we can hardly see how our acceptance of Rule 44.1 on appeal would work an injustice to either side; moreover, the trial court\u2019s decision contained the following recognition of the Rule and the proper procedure thereunder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-4\">\u201cConclusions of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">3. In accordance with Rule 44.1, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the laws of Panama as stipulated by the parties are rulings of law and are as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">* * * [quoting Article 989, Article 23, and Article 9.]\u201d 256 F.Supp. at 662-663.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">II. Article 989 of the Panama Commercial Code</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">Article 989 imposes obligations on two parties. First, it requires a bank to furnish accounts current to depositors \u201cat least eight days after the end of each quarter or liquidation period agreed upon, requesting their written conformity thereof.\u201d There is no contention that the Bank failed to meet this responsibility. Second, Article 989 requires each depositor to present any comments concerning the accounts current \u201cwithin five days.\u201d The next paragraph provides the only express sanction of the Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-14\">\u201cShould a customer fail to reply within said period, his account will be held as admitted and the debit or credit balance shall be definitive as of the date of such account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">Our analysis focuses initially on the sanction. Without doubt the sanction is directed against only the depositor. The substance of the sanction is nearly as obvious; if activated, it prevents any contest of the accounts current presented to the depositor. The only indefinite item in the sentence <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is the time of activation, and we cannot agree with the trial court that this lack of chronological precision renders the statute a nudum statutum.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">The trial court discarded the sanction to Article 989 because the eight-day time limit on a bank and the five-day time limit on a depositor were ambiguous. This analysis seeks to prove too much\u2014 for example, whether <em>\u201cat least </em>eight days after * * * \u201d means <em>\u201cwithin </em>eight days after * * * \u201d and whether \u201cwithin five days\u201d refers to the mailing or to the receipt of the bank\u2019s statement. The words of Article 989 may be awkward, inelegant, or maladroit; but a common sense interpretation grants eight days within which to mail and five days after receipt to object.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>cifics of the limitations periods are not vital to this case. No combination or permutation of days before us in this case and no rational or logical addition or subtraction from or to eight and five could yield any answer except the barring of the Depositor\u2019s relief. When a case arises in which time limits are in issue, we can and perhaps will reconsider the specifics. But we will not discard the plain substance of a statute because of theoretical and irrelevant ambiguities.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Most jurisdictions have a bank-protection statute such as Article 989. We quote from Brady, Bank Checks \u00a7 15.29 (page 561) (3rd Ed. 1962) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-5\">\u201c\u00a7 15.29. <em>Other statutes which may bar claim for forgery or alteration. </em>A word about \u2018final adjustment of statement of account statutes\u2019 is in order. Such statutes set a time limit from the time a bank statement is given to a customer after which the customer may not question the correctness thereof. Such a provision should bar a claim for payment of a forged or altered check or a check with a forged indorsement if the time limit has elapsed, although the \u2018final adjustment\u2019 statutes apply in all instances where the correctness of a bank statement is challenged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The Depositor denies neither the existence of such statutes nor that a few states compel notice within thirty days. He contends, however, that the five-day period is unduly harsh, that the Uniform Commercial Code provides a one-year period,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that even the Bank\u2019s statement specified ten days for reply. Thus, he concludes, the five-day period cannot be peremptory. We will not penalize the Bank for granting a period more liberal than that specified by statute. Moreover, we cannot ignore statutes merely because they are harsh. Harshness does not in itself constitute ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Courts have consistently denied recovery to depositors who had failed to report discrepancies within the statutory period. Moreover, they have labeled such reporting requirements as substantive conditions precedent to recovery. Valley Nat. Bank of Phoenix v. Electrical Dist. No. 4, Pinal County, 1961, 90 Ariz. 306, 367 P.2d 655, 661 (statute applicable even if depositor is exempt from procedural statutes of limitations); G. Franklyn Fischer &amp; Associates v. First Nat. Bank of Atlanta, 1960, 102 Ga.App. 567, 116 S.E.2d 902 (statute applicable even if bank promises special care in handling depositor\u2019s checks); Clyman v. Glasser [Marks] 1963, 39 Misc.2d 198, 240 N.Y.S.2d 532, 536-537 (statute applicable even if bank is in a fiduciary relationship with depositor). A few courts have required not merely general compliance but specific compliance. American Bldg. Maintenance Co. of Calif. Inc. v. Federation Bank &amp; Trust Co., D.C.N.Y. 1963, 213 F.Supp. 412, 416-417 (general notice of forgery is not adequate if the statute requires a depositor to specify in detail the check or checks involved); Stauffer v. First Nat. Bank of San Antonio, Tex.Civ.App.1956, 291 S.W.2d 743, 745 (oral notice is not adequate if the statute requires written notice). At least one court has ruled that failure to report within the statutory time is a \u201ccomplete defense\u201d even though the depositor\u2019s agent for receiving the bank statement was a defrauder. Schwaben-ton v. Security National Bank of Greensboro, 1960, 251 N.C. 655, 111 S.E.2d 856, 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">Court language has been consistent regardless of the period allotted by the applicable statute. (1) Two years. American Bldg. Maintenance Co. of Calif, v. Federation Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra, and Rainbow Inn, Inc. v. Clayton Nat. Bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>1964, 86 N.J.Super. 13, 205 A.2d 753, 759 (in which case the court applied the statute despite certain ambiguities). (2) One year. Clyman v. [Marks] Glasser, supra, and Stauffer v. Frost Nat. Bank of San Antonio, supra. (3) Six months. Airco Supply Co. v. Albuquerque National Bank, 1961, 68 N.M. 195, 360 P.2d 386, 390 and Rainbow Inn, Inc. v. Clayton Nat. Bank, supra. (4) Sixty days. G. Franklyn Fischer &amp; Associates v. First Nat. Bank of Atlanta, supra.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, in eases involving contractual reporting requirements set out in bank passbooks or other bank statements, courts have required notice within shorter periods. (1) Thirty days. Hammerschlag Mfg. Co. v. Importers\u2019 and Traders\u2019 Nat. Bank, 2 Cir. 1919, 262 F. 266, 274. (2) Ten days. Brunswick Corp. v. Northwestern Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Minneapolis, 1943, 214 Minn. 370, 8 N.W.2d 333, 336 (action barred after ten days even though depositor\u2019s accountant was fraudulent) and Whitney Trust &amp; Savings Bank v. Jurgens-Fowler Co., 1934, 180 La. 445, 156 So. 460, 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We are construing a solemn statute with a discernible intention to limit the period of bank liability. Although we may question the equities in a five-day notice requirement, we cannot assume a legislative role and deny the statute\u2019s vitality. Cf. West Side Bank v. Marine Nat. Exchange Bank, Wisc. January 30, 1968, 37 Wis.2d 661, 155 N.W.2d 587 (requirements of posting under U. C.C. \u00a7 4-109). To do so would be to violate Article 9 of the Civil Code of Panama, quoted supra, as well as to ignore prior court decisions. Green v. King Edward Employees\u2019 Federal Credit Union, 5 Cir. 1967, 373 F.2d 613, 616 (\u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory construction that effect should be given to all of the provisions of a statute, if reasonably possible\u201d); Florentine v. Church of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, 2 Cir. 1965, 340 F.2d 239, 241-242 (\u201cwhat is clear from the text of Article 7 cannot be obscured by reliance on the ambiguous general purpose clause\u201d); Rainbow Inn, Inc. v. Clayton Nat. Bank, supra, 205 A.2d at 759-760 (in which case the court applied bank protection statute after an extensive analysis of ambiguities). Cf. United States v.

Board of Trustees of Newcastle, 1931, 239 Ky. 751, 40 S.W.2d 335, 336 <em>(\u201cAt least </em>two weeks\u201d publication of notice for a bond issue election meant <em>\u201cnot less </em>than two weeks.\u201d) Compare Miller v. State, 1923, 130 Miss. 564, 94 So. 706 <em>(\u201cAt least </em>four months\u201d requirement as to maintenance of public schools <em>meant that </em>school <em>time </em>must <em>\u201cnot be less than </em>four months.\u201d) with Warren Mfg. Co. of Baltimore v. Hoffman, 62 Md. 165, 170.
