Appellant contends that his Constitutional rights were violated in that: 1 \u2014 he was not warned of his right to remain silent; 2 \u2014 of his right to have an attorney appointed for him and 3\u2014 his plea of guilty was wrongfully induced by certain promises made by his attorney and thus the plea was not made voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-26\">Our review of the record of the proceedings before the District Court reveals that both the United States Attorney and the District Judge took painstaking care to make certain that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was being made voluntarily, free from threats or promises of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-27\"> Having found the plea of guilty to have been voluntarily entered this constitutes a waiver of all non jurisdictional defects and defenses, United States v. Ptomey, 366 F.2d 759 (3rd Cir. 1966).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus the Court need not pass on the merits of appellant\u2019s first two asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>complaints directed at the trial judge, appellant\u2019s attorney and the arresting authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The order of the District Court denying the Writ of Habeas Corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-18\">. A voluntary plea of guilty has been held to constitute a waiver of constitutional defenses including an inadmissible confession of a co-defendant, Watts v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 367, 278 F.2d 247 (1960), and an illegal search and seizure, Edwards v. United States, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 152, 256 F.2d 707 (1958). There is no contention or allegation that appellant\u2019s plea resulted from the admissions he alleges he made to the City detectives.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
