Downing et al. teach that the claimed be-taine-like zwitterionic compounds are detergents which are usable with soap and soaplike products * * * in aqueous media * * *. The German application (Bohme) also teaches that amphoteric compounds of the type claimed may be employed in combination with sulfate and sulfonate detergents of the types recited in the instant claims * * *. Isbell teaches that equivalent amphoteric detergents are usable with anionic detergents, phosphate salts, silicate sales and hydro-trope sulfonates. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-21\">We agree with the examiner and the board that it appears obvious to add the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>zwitterionic compounds of Downing and Bohme to virtually any known detergent composition in view of the clear statements in those references that the compounds are compatible with and useful in combination with such compositions. Since Downing states that the sultaines are useful \u201cin conjunction with the known processing or treating agents,\u201d and Bohme suggests their use with sulfonate anionics, we see nothing unobvious about using the sultaines with the known anionic-containing composition of Krumrei. Appellant\u2019s argument that neither Downing nor Bohme suggests the use of a zwit-terionic compound in a built<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> composition such as that of Krumrei is unpersuasive since Downing discloses the use of zwitterionic compounds \u201cin admixture with soap or soap-like products\u201d for use \u201c[a]s cleansing agents particularly in hard water * * This suggests the use of zwitterionic compounds in built detergent compositions since the use of builders is known in compositions designed for hard water use. Furthermore, Isbell teaches the use of amphoteric detergents, which are zwitterionic within certain pH ranges, in conjunction with builders.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Appellant argues, however, that his invention is patentable because he achieved an unexpected and unpredictable improvement in suds stability by combining a sultaine and an anionic detergent in a built composition. In support of this argument, appellant directs our attention to two affidavits in the record. The examiner refused to accept these affidavits as sufficient to overcome the obviousness rejection because of their limited scope relative to the breadth of the claims. The two affidavits together show six compositions within the scope of the claims. All of these employ only two sultaines, and only two anionic detergents. In each composition the total detergent concentration is 12%. We agree with the examiner that these limited comparative tests, when compared with the number of compounds and ranges of concentrations within the scope of the claims, are inadequate to overcome the strong suggestion of obviousness inferred from the references.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-7\">A term referring to a detergent composition containing 'water-soluble alkaline salts such as potassium pyrophos-phate which have the capability of combining with (sequestering) calcium ions (the \u201chardness\u201d in water) to promote the detergency of the composition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-14\">.
