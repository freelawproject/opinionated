On August 25 it wrote to the company requesting recognition as bargaining representative of \u201call full-time and regular part-time employees * * * including leased departments, excluding supervisors, guards and professional employees\u201d and asserted majority representation of such a unit provable by the several authorization cards it had solicited and collected in the preceding weeks. The company rejected the union\u2019s demand and contested the appropriateness of the unit. A representation hearing was held as a result of which the Regional Director found the unit appropriate, and, acting on an election petition filed by the union on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the same day it asserted its majority status to the company, directed that an election be held. The election, originally scheduled for December 4, was postponed on December 2 upon the filing of unfair labor practice charges by the union. In January the union withdrew its election petition altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">8(a) (1)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We hold that there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s 8(a) (1) findings and order. First, the president of Sandy\u2019s Stores addressed various shifts of employees during the latter part of June, well after the union\u2019s organizational campaign had begun, and announced changes in company personnel policy which, he conceded, included some newly instituted employee benefits. Although President Dushman testified that these benefits were introduced as a result of a broad reexamination of company employee policy, itself allegedly prompted by employee discontent over a recent unpaid Memorial Day holiday, the Board upheld both the Trial Examiner\u2019s refusal to credit Dushman\u2019s testimony, and his finding, amply supported by the record, that Dushman\u2019s speeches were designed to discourage employee endorsement of the union. Such conduct is clearly coercive within the meaning of 8(a) (1). NLRB v. Exchange Parts Co., 375 U.S. 405, 409, 84 S.Ct. 457, 11 L.Ed.2d 435 (1963) ; NLRB v. Universal Packaging Corp., 361 F.2d 384 (1st Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Second, Department Manager Shea warned employee Riley that the store manager was going to fire him unless he stopped his union activity in the store. This the Board properly found to be coercive as a threat of reprisal for union participation. Editorial \u201cEl Imparcial,\u201d Inc. v. NLRB, 278 F.2d 184, 187 (1st Cir. 1960). Absent a showing by the company that Riley was engaged in impermissible union activity within the store, or that the company had promulgated a broad and justifiable no-solicitation rule applicable even to non-public areas, Shea\u2019s statement could be construed as over-broad and subject to Board attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Third, incidents such as Office Supervisor Hawksley\u2019s warning to employee Messier not to talk to union organizers because Store Manager Kannally had been observing her were properly found to be coercive as creating an \u201cimpression of surveillance\u201d. NLRB v. Prince Macaroni Mfg. Co., 329 F.2d 803 (1st Cir. 1964). Respondent\u2019s late denial of Hawksley\u2019s supervisory status is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Finally, the Board found that certain management-employee exchanges initiated by respondent\u2019s agents constituted coercive interrogations in violation of 8 (a) (1). All but one involved the coincidence of inquiry and implied promise of benefits. However, casual and unobjectionable any given question standing alone may have been, we are persuaded that when considered against the prophecy of increased benefits, the other 8(a) (1) violations generally, and the company\u2019s expressed anti-union animus, their total effect was to offend the intendment of the Act. See NLRB v. Sinclair Co., 397 F.2d 157 (1st Cir. 1968); cf. NLRB v. England Bros., Inc., 201 F.2d 395 (1st Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">8(a) (3)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">The Board also found that respondent discriminatorily discharged employee Edyth Kearris in violation of the Act. Kearns was hired by a Sandy\u2019s Stores\u2019 supervisor but her salary was paid by Sullivan\u2019s Donuts, Inc., a concessionaire. While she was evidently principally employed to sell doughnuts, the record shows that she spent considerable time assisting respondent at its adjoining snack bar. In fact, according to Kearns\u2019 testimony, she was the only employee who covered the snack bar during the evening hours that she worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">Store Manager Kannally testified that Kearns was \u201claid off\u201d because he discovered that the stock of doughnuts was sold out by early evening so that there was no reason to keep her on. The Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>found that this was not respondent\u2019s motivation and concluded that Kearns was discharged because of her involvement in union activities. The record substantially supports this result. If doughnut sales were so active that demand outran supply, we would have supposed the reasonable response would be to increase the supply rather than fire the saleslady. In any case, Sandy\u2019s Stores had no economic interest in reducing or eliminating the salary expense incident to Kearns\u2019 employment. She was on Sullivan\u2019s payroll, not Sandy\u2019s Stores\u2019. In fact, crediting Kearns\u2019 testimony that when she worked she worked alone and covered both the doughnut concession and respondent\u2019s snack bar, the company could only stand to lose by her discharge for if the snack bar was to remain open it would obviously have to be staffed, and this probably at company expense. Also the record discloses that while Kannally testified that he \u201claid off\u201d Kearns because her product was sold out (no doughnuts, no dough), he told Kearns only that she was discharged because \u201cSullivan was letting [her] go\u201d and that he did not know why. According to Kearns, however, Mrs. Sullivan explained that it was Sandy\u2019s Stores, not Sullivan\u2019s, that was dissatisfied with her services. Finally, it is clear from the evidence that Kearns was a union sympathizer and that the company believed her to be an important source of information to the non-employee union organizers.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Recognizing that the credibility of witnesses is for Board determination, NLRB v. Lowell Sun Publishing Co., 320 F.2d 835, 840 (1st Cir. 1963), we think it entirely appropriate in this case for the Board to have drawn from its evaluation of Kannally\u2019s testimony and other record evidence the inference of an improper motivation for Kearns\u2019 discharge. NLRB v. Bird Mach. Co., 161 F.2d 589, 592 (1st Cir. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">8(a) (5)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Coming to the refusal to bargain issue, we take preliminary note of the tenuous posture of this aspect of the case. The charge was dismissed on February 8, 1965. Upon reconsideration it was reinstated. The Trial Examiner, after hearing, concluded that the unit comprised some ninety-six employees and that valid authorization cards numbered forty-six, or less than a majority. Hence, no 8(a) (5) violation. The Board, however, found on its own review of the record that the unit comprised ninety-seven employees and that the union had obtained forty-nine valid cards, or a one-card majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">To uphold the Board\u2019s determination that the union has a one-card majority, we would have to affirm two Board reversals of the Trial Examiner on eligibility, two reversals on the validity of card authorizations, and six findings of validity of cards not considered by the Trial Examiner. While we need deal with only one determination as to eligibility, there is at least one other which would give us difficulty. Moreover, affirmation of the card authorization findings would require reliance in the most mechanical sense on the <em>Cumberland </em>rule, an approach rejected by a number of other circuits and, we think, not necessarily commanded in the instant case by our own re-iharks in NLRB v. Southbridge Sheet Metal Works, Inc., 380 F.2d 851 (1st Cir. 1967). That the Board in March 1967 saw fit to reverse the Trial Examiner\u2019s dismissal of the 8(a) (5) charge a year earlier on conduct which had taken place two and one-half years earlier was of course within its power. But we question the practical wisdom of doing so when so many links of the chain of decision are so frangible.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The necessary predicate for the Board\u2019s 8(a) (5) decision is that the union was the designated bargaining agent of a majority of the eligible unit employees on the critical date. The undisputed critical date, August 26, 1964, marks the time of receipt by the company of the union\u2019s demand for recognition. We deal only with the finding that a Miss Ouimet was on the critical date \u201ca regular part-time employee\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Jeanine Ouimet was first hired by respondent in December of 1963 while still a student in high school. Company records in evidence, although incomplete for the period through April of 1964, indicate that she worked most pay periods in May and June, all in July and August, some in September and October, most in November and one in December.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only testimony that bears on Ouimet\u2019s employment comes from one Gilberte Hebert, who said that Ouimet was hired to take her place for the summer while she was on a leave of absence. Hebert further testified that Ouimet \u201cwas going to nursing school\u201d in the fall; left in September upon Hebert\u2019s return; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cwent to school\u201d; and thereafter worked for the company \u201cwhen she was able\u201d. The Trial Examiner concluded that Ouimet was hired as a summer replacement for Hebert and that her work thereafter was \u201cat her convenience\u201d and casual. She was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The Board, in its review, noted that Ouimet worked regularly from early May through the middle of September, and \u201cthat she resumed work the week of October 10, and, with the exception of two weeks, worked in every week through December 5.\u201d It, in effect, characterized her as a regular Saturday replacement for Hebert in the months preceding and following the summer season when she \u201cworked as a full-time employee\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Disagreeing with the Trial Examiner, the Board gave \u201clittle credence to the testimony of Hebert\u201d as it related to Ouimet\u2019s status, concluded that Ouimet continued to work in the fall on a regular part-time basis, and included her in the unit. While conceding the wide range of discretion vouchsafed to the Board in eligibility matters, this nevertheless was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We begin with the rule that the availability of post-critical date information cannot be used to color the facts of a case as they stood on the critical date, NLRB v. Belcher Towing Co., 284 F.2d 118, 121 (5th Cir. 1960); that is, unless there is cause to believe that the subsequent and assertedly relevant events were contemplated beforehand, NLRB v. Joclin Mfg. Co., 314 F.2d 627, 633 (2d Cir. 1963). Likewise, we recognize that summer and casual part-time employment will not qualify as regular part-time employment. E.g., Dobbs Houses, Inc., CCH NLRB |f 9576 (1961); Kelsey Hayes Wheel Co., 85 N.L.R.B. 666, 675 (1949). Indeed, the Board\u2019s rule as to students is that those working for the summer with the intention of returning to school are ineligible to vote in an election. Pacific Tile &amp; Porcelain Co., 137 N.L.R.B. 1358, 1364-65 (1962). This is so because as casual employees they do not share a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d with the other employees. Home Brewing Co., 124 N.L.R.B. 930, 932 (1959).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">May</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">1 2 3 4 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">September 12 8 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\">June 12 3 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-13\">October 1 2 3 4 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-14\">July 12 3 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-15\">\u00ed\u00a1s * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-16\">November 12 3 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-17\">August 1 2 3 4 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-18\">December 12 3 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-19\">* <em>Denotes pay periods worked.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number> Viewing the evidence as it related to events on or before August 26, 1964 we have only company employment record sheets and Hebert\u2019s testimony. The former is inconclusive, for beyond the substantial void (December-April) there is information relating only to two pre-summer employment months and the two summer months up to and including the critical date. That this data strongly suggests Ouimet was a full-time summer employee is clear; she worked each pay period during July and the relevant portion of August. That it establishes regular part-time employee status before that time is less than clear; Ouimet missed the last week in May and the first week in June. While consistent employment but one day a week may be enough to satisfy the Board\u2019s \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d standard, see e.g., Horn &amp; Hardart, 147 N.L.R.B. 654, 658 (1964); Giordano Lumber Co., 133 N.L.R.B. 205, 207 (1961), we are persuaded that evidence of less than consistent Saturday employment, especially when absenteeism runs to twenty per cent of the work period involved, cannot sustain a finding of regular part-time employment without other evidence. See NLRB v. Greenfield Components Corp., 317 F.2d 85, 89 (1st Cir. 1963). Hebert\u2019s testimony fails to supply the missing link. If anything, it constitutes persuasive authority that Ouimet was a summer employee and no more.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the latter intended to work on Saturdays on a regular basis we have no direct evidence of that fact nor evidence from which such an inference may be appropriately drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Furthermore, even assuming that the circumstances of this case permitted us to examine the post-critical date evidence bearing on Ouimet\u2019s status, but see NLRB v. Joclin Mfg. Co., supra, we cannot say that it would repair the Board\u2019s case. Both the Trial Examiner, who excluded her, and the Board, which included her, were too generous in their account of her post-summer employment record. To be sure, Ouimet worked every Saturday but two from the week of October 10 through December 5. She did not work the last two weeks in September, however, or the first week in October or the last three weeks in December. While we might be willing to concede that Ouimet\u2019s employment terminated as of December 5, so that the remaining weeks of that month should not reflect adversely on the regularity of her overall employment, wc see no basis for the Board\u2019s dismissing out of hand her three week absenteeism before October 10 while at the same time maintaining that she was all along \u2014 at least from the critical date forward \u2014 a regular part-time employee. The fact is that Ouimet worked in only seven of twelve post-summer employment weeks, or was absent over forty per cent of the time. Surely this portion of the record no more permits a finding that Ouimet was a regular part-time employee on the date in question than that considered earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The Board\u2019s 8(a) (1) and (3) order shall be enforced. The 8(a) (5) order shall be set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\">. Her record of employment for each pay period was as follows:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b320-20\">. Company records show that Ouimet did not work the week that Hebert returned, or, for that matter, the two weeks after that.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-21\">. It is not clear from the direct evidence whether Ouimet worked only Saturdays or other hours as well before and after her full-time summer employment. Notwithstanding, we think the record supports the Board\u2019s finding that her hours were confined to Saturdays.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b321-4\">. While the Board has the right to discount a witness\u2019 credibility, it may not do so for a reason which is impermissible. The Board stated as its sole ground for discrediting Hebert\u2019s relevant testimonv \u201cthe fact that Ouimet worked every week except two between September and December * * Our textual discussion explains why we find this reason impermissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
