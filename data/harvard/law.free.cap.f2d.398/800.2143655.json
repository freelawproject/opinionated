Rule 73(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provide that a notice of appeal shall be filed within thirty days of the entry of the final order appealed. Timely filing of that notice is jurisdictional to the appeal, and this Court cannot waive or modify that requirement. Schlink v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., 276 F.2d 116 (6th Cir.1960). On the other hand, the District Court, \u201c* * * upon a showing of excusable neglect * * can extend the time for filing, not to exceed thirty days \u201c* * * from the expiration of the original time * * *\u201d Rule 73(a) (2), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Appellant contends that the sixty-day stay of the order of discharge was such a grant of an extension of time. We do not agree. A District Court may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal only to the extent and under the conditions prescribed by Rule 73(a). Rich-land Knox Mutual Insurance Company v. Kallen, 376 F.2d 360, 363 (6th Cir.1967). Here, no showing of excusable neglect was made, nor was there a finding of excusable neglect. The filing of a notice of appeal is a simple matter, and the sixty-day stay was provided no doubt for the purpose of instituting a retrial, not the filing of a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-17\"> Nevertheless, a finding of excusable neglect by the District Court, before or after expiration of the original thirty-day period, will validate a late filing, provided filing was made within the sixty-day maximum. In this case, notice of appeal was filed within fifty-three days of entry of the final order; therefore the case will be remanded so that the District Court can determine whether there was excusable neglect. Evans v. Jones, 366 F.2d 772 (4th Cir.1966). If there is a finding of excusable neglect the appeal will proceed. Otherwise, the appeal will be dismissed. Meanwhile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>action on the Appellee\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, to docket the appeal and to dismiss the appeal will be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
