The judgment was affirmed by this court. Rainbo Gold Mines v. Magnus, 371 F.2d 519 (10th Cir. 1966). Mrs. Magnus then obtained a lien on the mining properties owned by the appellants. On May 12, 1967, the United States Marshal sold the property to Mrs. Magnus for $75,000. of her $275,000. judgment. Appellants\u2019 motion to stay the sale was denied by this court. Appellants then asked the district court to set aside the sale and its refusal to do so forms the basis for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-21\">Appellants\u2019 principal contention is that the purchase price was grossly inadequate and that the sale should be set aside for this reason. There was testimony that the property had a value of $2-4 million but this was based, in part, on an estimate of the value of the ore in place. Appellee\u2019s expert witness testified that the property would not command such a price since the mine was not yet a producing one. From this conflicting evidence the district court found that the amount bid for the property by the ap-pellee was not disproportionate to its real value. We have reviewed the record and cannot say that this finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-22\">Appellee\u2019s motion to affirm is granted and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
