Evans, was injured during the course of his employment while attempting to dismantle a cardboard box cutting machine. He instituted this diversity action against the defendant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cLiberty\u201d) his employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, alleging that Liberty\u2019s negligence in failing to \u201cadequately inspect\u201d the cutting machine and to warn plaintiff of its alleged unsafe condition caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-26\">The action was tried to a jury. After the close of the evidence, Liberty moved for a directed verdict in its favor. The motion was granted and the jury discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-27\">On this appeal plaintiff contends that (1) an injured employee may sue his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation carrier for injuries caused by the carrier\u2019s alleged negligence in failing to properly conduct its inspection of its insured\u2019s premises, under our decision in Mays v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 323 F.2d 174 (3 Cir. 1963); and (2) sufficient evidence was presented by plaintiff to warrant submission of his case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In reply, Liberty contends (1) this Court should reconsider and overrule our holding in <em>Mays </em>in the light of a later Pennsylvania trial court holding<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that a workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier shares an employer\u2019s immunity from common law liability; and (2) plaintiff\u2019s evidence failed to establish a cause of action under either Section 323 or Section 324A of the Restatement of Torts, 2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We do not reach Liberty\u2019s first contention, because it is unnecessary to do so since we subscribe to its second contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Viewed in \u201ca light most favorable to the plaintiff\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his evidence establishes the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">On August 18, 1964, plaintiff was assigned the task of dismantling a cardboard box cutting machine. A wrench he was using slipped, causing his hand to strike against one of the machine\u2019s cutting blades with resulting serious injury. The machine was not equipped with a protective guard and the cutting blades were exposed. Liberty, prior to the accident, had made four \u201csafety\u201d inspections of plaintiff\u2019s employer\u2019s plant and made specific \u201csafety\u201d recommendations as a result of these inspections. It had not, however, made an inspection of the particular machine involved in this accident, nor had it made any recommendations with respect to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">The purpose of Liberty\u2019s inspections was threefold: (1) to advise and counsel those whom it insured \u201con programs which they should adopt to reduce the cost and frequency of accidents\u201d; (2) to provide a method of \u201cgathering underwriting information\u201d; and (3) \u201cto help the sales department in the solicitation of new business and in securing\u201d business already enjoyed. Liberty had neither power nor authority to compel an insured to act upon any of its safety recommendations and performed only an advisory function in making them. In the event an insured failed to comply with a recommendation which it deemed critical, Liberty only could pursue the alternative of discontinuing its coverage. Each of its insured employers \u201cis responsible for its own safety record, or safety program\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">There was no evidence that plaintiff\u2019s employer had ever followed Liberty\u2019s safety recommendations. Further, there was no evidence that Liberty was under a legal duty or contractual obligation to inspect the plant of plaintiff\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">The crux of plaintiff\u2019s contention here is that while Liberty was not under a legal duty or contractual obligation to inspect its insured plant, it \u201cgratuitously\u201d undertook to make such inspections, and that being so, it was liable to plaintiff for his damages under Section 323 of the Restatement of Torts, 2d, inasmuch as its failure to inspect the machine which figured in the accident was, in the plaintiff\u2019s view, \u201cunreasonable or negligent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Section 323 \u201cNegligent Performance of Undertaking to Render Services\u201d provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201cOne who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of the other\u2019s person or things, is subject to liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">(a) his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of such harm, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">(b) the harm is suffered because of the other\u2019s reliance upon the undertaking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Section 324A of the Restatement, adverted to by the District Court in its Opinion <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">\u201cLiability to Third Person for Negligent Performance of Undertaking. \u201cOne who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person or his things, is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">(a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">(b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the other to the third person, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">(c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person upon the undertaking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">The District Court premised its direction of a verdict in favor of Liberty on the grounds that plaintiff had failed to adduce evidence that Liberty\u2019s failure to inspect his machine (1) had increased \u201cthe risk of harm\u201d or (2) that plaintiff suffered harm because of his \u201creliance\u201d upon Liberty\u2019s undertaking, as required under Sections 323 and 324A.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">On review of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence (Liberty presented no defense testimony) we are of the opinion that the District Court did not err in directing a verdict in Liberty\u2019s favor against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-18\">In DeJesus v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 423 Pa. 198, at page 201, 223 A.2d 849, at page 850, (1966), it was held that under Section 323:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-19\">\u201c* * * negligent performance or nonperformance must increase the risk of harm and * * * there must be reliance by the injured plaintiff upon the defendant\u2019s performing the service he has undertaken to render\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai3C\">In the instant case, as the District Court correctly found, plaintiff failed to adduce evidence that Liberty\u2019s \u201cnonperformance\u201d, viz., failure to inspect his machine, increased his \u201crisk of harm\u201d <em>or </em>that plaintiff relied on an inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-21\">Further, there was no evidence in the instant case that Liberty had \u201cundertaken\u201d to make an inspection of the entire plant of plaintiff\u2019s employer. The evidence, indeed, affirmatively established that Liberty only made what may be described as \u201cspot\u201d inspections. As earlier stated, it was under no legal duty or contractual obligation to make \u201ccomplete\u201d inspections, and the evidence established that primary responsibility for the \u201csafety\u201d of the plant of plaintiff\u2019s employer remained with the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-22\">It is well-settled under Pennsylvania law, controlling in this diversity action, that plaintiff must \u201cprove, inter alia, the existence of a duty owed to him and a breach thereof\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and plaintiff has failed to adduce such proof here.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-23\">For the reasons stated, the Order of the District Court entering a directed verdict in favor of Liberty and against plaintiff will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\">.
