Korn, 204 Pa. Super. 153, 203 A.2d 341 (1964); in the summer of 1963 plaintiff rented an apartment in Camden County, New Jersey and in 1965 he instituted a divorce action against defendant in the Superior Court of Camden County which he discontinued, after a hearing but prior to a decision, in November, 1966, subsequent to his arrival in St. Thomas on October 2, 1966; plaintiff continued to practice his profession in Philadelphia during the period of his residence in New Jersey; he instituted the instant action on December 14, 1966, some nine weeks after his arrival in St. Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">In seeking to establish the fact that he was \u201cdomiciled\u201d in the Virgin Islands when he commenced his divorce action, plaintiff testified on direct examination as follows: he had closed his medical practice and \u201ccut\u201d all his business connections in Philadelphia; he had come to the Virgin Islands with the intention to make the Islands his \u201cpermanent residence and domicile\u201d and \u201cwith the idea of making a new life, starting a practice in the Virgin Islands\u201d; he had \u201cmade application to be admitted to practice\u201d, in the Virgin Islands, and had discussed the \u201cmatter\u201d with Dr. Roy A. Anduze, Commissioner of Health of the Virgin Islands, who had advised him to contact Dr. Benjamin Nath, Secretary of the Board of Medical Examiners; he did so and \u201chad to fill out certain forms\u201d in order to take a required examination for admission to practice; he had not yet taken the examination but it was his intention to do so and he had spent his time since arriving in the Islands studying \u201cand making outlines\u201d in preparation for the examination; on his arrival in the Virgin Islands he stayed for about a month at the Pineapple Beach Club in St. Thomas; he thereafter rented a house in St. Thomas for about two months; he then returned to the Pineapple Beach Club for a few weeks, after which he moved to the Yacht Haven Hotel in the. beginning of February, 1967 \u201cwhere I have been staying ever since\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">In \u201ccorroboration\u201d of his \u201cdomicile\u201d in the Virgin Islands, plaintiff intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>duced in evidence a \u201cNotice of Payment Due\u201d from the Blue Cross of Greater Philadelphia for health insurance premiums for the period March 1, 1967 to June 1, 1967, listing his address as the Pineapple Beach Club, and a copy of his federal income tax return for 1966 in which he had listed his address as the Yacht Haven Hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Plaintiff, on cross-examination, admitted that he had not at the time of trial\u2014 some nine months after his arrival at St. Thomas\u2014 filed an application to take the required examination to practice his profession in the Virgin Islands, although he had testified to the contrary on direct examination. With reference to his testimony on direct examination that he had \u201cstudied\u201d in preparation for the licensing examination and made 50 to 100 \u201coutlines\u201d of materials, he was unable to produce such \u201coutlines\u201d and he admitted on cross-examination that he had no medical books in the Islands and had \u201cstudied\u201d only from \u201cbetween five and twenty\u201d medical journals.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Further, in contradiction of his testimony on direct examination that he had resided at the Yacht Haven Hotel continuously since he had registered there in early February, 1967, plaintiff admitted on cross-examination that he had not done so and had in fact made an unspecified number of trips to Philadelphia and New York between early February and the time of his trial on June 7 and 8 and July 14, 1967; plaintiff said that he had made three or four trips to New York and five or six trips to Philadelphia between the time of his arrival in St. Thomas on October 2, 1966 and the time of his trial. The trips, plaintiff said, were made for social and family visits, and they were financed with borrowed funds, since he had no assets and had not had any income subsequent to his arrival in the Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In her defense testimony, defendant introduced records of the Yacht Haven Hotel which disclosed that plaintiff had registered there on February 6, 1967 listing his address at the time as \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d. The Yacht\u2019Haven Hotel records further disclosed that plaintiff had checked out on April 16th, checked in again on May 2d and checked out on May 14th; checked in again on May 30th and checked out on June 9th; checked in again on June 21st and checked out on June 24th.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">It may be noted that defendant also introduced into evidence a letter from Dr. Anduze dated April 4, 1967 which was in reply to plaintiff\u2019s letter of March 8, 1967 regarding licensure in the Virgin Islands, and a letter which plaintiff wrote to Dr. Nath on April 7, 1967 requesting \u201c * * * any pertinent information \u2014 or forms \u2014 regarding medical li-censure in the Virgin Islands\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">On the record recited, the District Court made the fact-finding that plaintiff was \u201cdomiciled\u201d in the Virgin Islands when he started his divorce action without specification as to the basis of that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">On our review of the entire evidence we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the District Court\u2019s fact-finding that plaintiff was \u201cdomiciled\u201d in the Virgin Islands when he commenced his divorce action, and that the finding was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d, and must be reversed for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">The distilled essence of settled principles applicable here may be epitomized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">One\u2019s testimony as to his intention to establish a domicile, while entitled to full and fair consideration, is subject to the infirmity of any self-serving declaration, and it cannot prevail to establish domicile when it is contradicted or negatived by an inconsistent course of conduct ; otherwise stated, actions speak louder than words.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>In the instant case, plaintiff\u2019s \u201centire course of conduct\u201d before and after his arrival at St. Thomas, contradicts and negates his self-serving declarations that he came there \u201cwith the idea of making a new life, starting a practice in the Virgin Islands\u201d, and making the Islands his \u201cpermanent residence and domicile\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">This \u201centire course of conduct\u201d, evidenced by the record, may be high-lighted as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Plaintiff, age 53, practiced osteopathic medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for 31 years prior to coming to St. Thomas; in 1958 he was convicted in Philadelphia of the crime of performing an illegal abortion; he married defendant in 1961; they separated in 1963; she successfully prosecuted an action for support against plaintiff in 1964 in a Philadelphia court; during the pendency of the support action, plaintiff, in 1963, while continuing his practice in Philadelphia, sought to establish a residence in New Jersey by renting an apartment in that state, and in 1965 sued defendant for divorce in a New Jersey court; after a hearing in his divorce action, but before a decision was handed down with respect thereto, he came to St. Thomas on October 2, 1966; he discontinued his New Jersey divorce action in November, 1966, and instituted the instant divorce action on December 14, 1966 (nine weeks after his arrival at St. Thomas); prior to coming to the Virgin Islands to \u201cmake a new life\u201d and start a \u201cpractice\u201d there, he made no attempt to ascertain the requirements for admission to practice his profession from the Virgin Islands Board of Medical Examiners or anyone else; he did not make any attempt to ascertain the stated requirements until March 8, 1967- \u2014 -five months after he arrived at St. Thomas; contrary to his testimony on direct examination that he had \u201cmade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>application to be admitted to practice\u201d in the Islands prior to June, 1967 when his divorce action came to trial, he admitted on cross-examination that he had never made such an application; he had confined his preparation for the never-applied-for licensing examination to making \u201c50 to 100 outlines\u201d from several medical journals because he had no medical books; he was unable to produce any of the \u201coutlines\u201d because he had \u201cmemorized\u201d and destroyed them; the \u201cRequirements for Medical Licensure in the Virgin Islands\u201d specify that an applicant for a license to practice medicine must satisfy the Board of Examiners that he is \u201cof good moral character\u201d and that the applicant file \u201cat least two letters of favorable character tsetimony\u201d; plaintiff had made no effort to secure employment in the Islands although he had no assets and no income and was living on borrowed funds; he made no attempt to establish a permanent home in the Islands from the time of his arrival to the date of the trial of his divorce action and during that time he made between eight to ten trips to the United States; he \u201cchecked out\u201d from his hotels at frequent intervals during the period covered by these trips; when he first registered at the Yacht Haven Hotel on February 6, 1967 \u2014 four months after his arrival at St. Thomas \u2014 he listed his address as \u201cPhiladelphia, Pa.\u201d; and he continued to maintain his health insurance in the Blue Cross of Greater Philadelphia and directed the latter to mail his \u201cNotice of Payment Due\u201d for the period March 1, 1967 to June 1,1967 to St. Thomas because \u201cI knew that I was going to be here and <em>probably stay here\u201d, </em>(emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The recited evidence as to plaintiff\u2019s course of conduct discloses a pattern of forum shopping in his quest for a divorce \u2014first in New Jersey and then in the Virgin Islands \u2014 following failure of his efforts to defeat defendant\u2019s proceedings for support in the Pennsylvania courts, and it makes inescapable the conclusion that he did not, as he testified, come to the Islands \u201cwith the idea of making a new life, starting a practice in the Virgin Islands\u201d and making the Islands his \u201cpermanent residence and domicile\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">As our late brother Goodrich stated in his admirable \u201cGoodrich, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 29, pages 67-68 (3 ed. 1949), \u201c* * * [M]otive may be very important in deciding as a fact whether the alleged intention [to establish a domicile] was genuine' * * * [it] may lead, or help lead, the trier of the fact to conclude that there really was not a change of domicile at all, but the appearance of a change made for the purpose of securing some personal advantage. This effect of motive has been recognized by the courts. Thus, many divorce decrees coming from states or countries where divorces are easily obtained * * * have been denied recognition on this basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">Of critical significance here in evaluating plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he had come to the Islands to start \u201ca practice\u201d is his initial failure to make any preliminary inquiry before coming there, as to the eligibility requirements of the Islands\u2019 medical licensing program, and his further failures (1) to ascertain such requirements until five months after he had arrived at St. Thomas, and (2) to file an application to take the required licensing examination. On the score of the latter, it may be recalled that his credibility as a witness was impaired when he admitted on cross-examination that he had not applied to take the stated examination in contradiction of his testimony on direct examination that he had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">For the reasons stated, the Judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s Complaint for lack of jurisdiction and to award defendant her costs, and reasonable counsel fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">.
