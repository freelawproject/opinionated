After winning a judgment against the offending driver, she and the judgment-debtor joined in a suit seeking satisaction of the judgment from State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, his insurer. We approve and adopt Judge Russell\u2019s opinion, 278 F.Supp. 725 (D.S.C.1968), holding that the exclusionary clause in Heaton\u2019s policy was valid under South Carolina law and precluded coverage in this instance. We intimate no view as to the possible availability of relief to the injured plaintiff under South Carolina\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, Code of Laws of South Carolina 1962, Title 46-701 et seq., against her insurer, if she in fact carried insurance on her own automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
