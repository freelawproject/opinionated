The parties stipulated that the sole issue in this case is whether or not the pension plan, over* which the employer maintains \u201cabsolute dominance,\u201d is violative of Section 302 of the Act, and they made cross motions for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 56. We previously have held that federal courts have jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions in Section 302 disputes. International Longshoremen\u2019s Association AFL-CIO v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 326 F.2d 916, 918-919 (2d Cir. 1964). The district court held that Section 302<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was violated by the pension plan because it did not conform to Section 302(c) (5) (B). For reasons which follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Plaintiff, Independent Association of Mutuel Employees of the State of New York, is a labor union representing as exclusive bargaining agent more than 600 employees of the Mutuel Department of NYRA, a statutory corporation created in 1958, McK. Unconsolidated Laws \u00a7 7902 (1961), for the purpose of conducting thoroughbred racing in the State of New York. Following arm\u2019s length bargaining between the union and NYRA\u2019s predecessor, a collective bargaining agreement was signed effective November 16, 1955 and, pursuant to its terms, the employer, on April 1, 1956, established a pension plan for the union members and entered into a trust agreement. Under the current collective bargaining agreement, NYRA may amend the pension plan only with the consent of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">The plan is financed by contributions of NYRA and the employees. All payments are made directly to the sole trustee, Bankers Trust Company. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>trustee is in charge of the investment and handling of contributions to the trust and of the funds in the trust. The NY RA has the exclusive right to name the trustee and the union has no right to approve or disapprove of the employer\u2019s choice. The parties stipulated that Bankers Trust Company is not a \u201crepresentative\u201d of any of the employees of NYRA within the meaning of the Act. No funds in the trust are handled by or pass through the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Disbursements by the trustee must be authorized by the Pension Committee. Under the terms of \u00a7 2(b) of the Trust Agreement, the Pension Committee has power to order the trustee to pay moneys to plan members and beneficiaries and to the Pension Committee itself. However, as a matter of actual practice no funds are handled by or pass through either the Committee or its members. The Pension Committee consists of six members and a chairman. Three members are designated by NYRA and three members are designated by the union. The chairman is designated by the NYRA with the approval of the majority of the members of the Committee designated by the union. The present chairman, defendant Frank M. Basil,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is the Vice President, Treasurer and Comptroller of NYRA and acts as chairman of the employer\u2019s labor coordinating committee. The chairman casts the deciding vote when the Committee is deadlocked. The complaint alleged and defendants agree that there is a \u201ccontrolling imbalance\u201d in the Pension Committee whereby the employer maintains \u201cabsolute dominance of the Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The district court held that the statute \u201cpermits but one type of plan which must comply in all respects with the elements set forth [in Section 302(c) (5)] or fall as an illegal payment under one or more of the first four subdivisions.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">As the language of the Act clearly indicates, a trust fund for the benefit of employees need not conform to the provisions of Section 302(c) (5) unless employer contributions to the fund would violate one or more of the provisions of Section 302(a). United States v. Annunziato, 293 F.2d 373, 379 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 240, 7 L.Ed.2d 134 (1961); Mechanical Contractors Association v. Local Union 420, 265 F.2d 607, 611 (3rd Cir. 1959); Sheet Metal Contractors Association of San Francisco v. Sheet Metal Workers International Association, 248 F.2d 307, 315 (9th Cir. 1957); Paramount Plastering, Inc. v. Local No. 2, D.C., 195 F.Supp. 287, 292, aff\u2019d, 310 F.2d 179 (9th Cir. 1962); Shapiro v. Rosenbaum, 171 F.Supp. 875, 878 (S.D.N.Y.1959). See United States v. Ryan, 350 U.S. 299, 305, 76 S.Ct. 400, 100 L.Ed. 335 (1956); International Longshoremen\u2019s Association v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 326 F.2d at 919; S.Rep.No. 1739, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 58 (1956); H.R.Rep.No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">We also disagree with the district court\u2019s alternative holding that NYRA\u2019s payments to the trust fund constitute payments to a \u201crepresentative of employees\u201d in violation of Section 302(a) (1). While we agree that the independence of the trustee is not determinative since Bankers Trust Company merely has custody of funds which are disbursed by order of the Pension Committee, the district court erred in finding that \u201cat least 50% of the Fund is dominated and controlled by the employee representatives\u201d on the Pension Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">The pension plan makes it clear that the employee members of the Committee may not order any disbursement of trust funds without the approval of at least two employer representatives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>employee and employer members of the Committee are deadlocked, the Chairman who is chosen by and represents the employer casts the tie-breaking vote. We think it is clear that the Pension Committe is not an employee representative because, as the parties have stipulated, there is a \u201ccontrolling imbalance\u201d on the Pension Committee which gives NYRA \u201cabsolute dominance over the plan.\u201d Unlike the trusts in Mechanical Contractors Association v. Local Union 420, supra, Sheet Metal Contractors Association v. Sheet Metal Workers International Association, supra, and Local No. 2 of Operative Plasterers &amp; Cement Masons v. Paramount Plastering, supra, the union does not have an equal voice with the employer in the management of this pension plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The purpose of Section 302 is to prevent unions and union officials from demanding that employers contribute to \u201cwelfare funds\u201d under the control of the union which the union\u2019s officials could use as they saw fit. Arroyo v. United States, 359 U.S. 419, 425-426, 79 S.Ct. 864, 3 L.Ed.2d 915 (1959); United States v. Ryan, 225 F.2d 417 at 423-424, 425-426; 350 U.S. at 304-306, 76 S.Ct. 400. What Congress wished to accomplish by enacting Section 302 was to give the employer an equal voice with the union in the administration of union-established welfare funds. See Cox, Some Aspects of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Harv.L.Rev. 274, 290 (1948). There is nothing in the history of the legislation to indicate that it was meant to require an employer to give a union an equal voice in employer-established welfare funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">When a welfare fund or trust is established by the employer and the plan specifies the conditions under which funds may be disbursed and makes it impossible for the representatives of the employee who participate in the administration of the plan to use any funds as they see fit, or to authorize use of funds without the employer\u2019s consent, the dangers which Section 302 was designed to combat are not present and there is no need to invoke the specific safeguards of Section 302(e) (5). See Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corp., 361 U.S. 459, 465, 80 S.Ct. 489, 4 L.Ed.2d 442 (1960); Arroyo v. United States, 359 U.S. at 426, 79 S.Ct. 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Reversed and remanded to the district court for entry of summary judgment in. favor of defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-11\">. \u201cResteictions on Payments to Employee Representatives Sec. 302.

The parties have agreed that the question whether or not the defendant Basil\u2019s appointment and tenure as Chairman of the Pension Committee conformed to the technical requirements of the pension plan is not at issue in this case and that determination of this appeal is without prejudice to any claim plaintiffs may wish to make with respect to that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-14\">. \u00a7 8.02 The Trustee shall disburse payments contemplated by the Pension Plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>only upon instructions of the Pension Committee in accordance with the provisions of this Pension Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\u00a7 10.01 This Pension Plan shall be administered by a Pension Committee consisting of six members and a Chairman, each of whom shall serve without compensation. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">\u00a7 10.05 A quorum of the Committee for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Committee shall consist of any four members of the Committee, at least two of which shall be members of the Pension Committee selected by the Employer and at least two selected by the Union. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">\u00a7 10.06 The Committee may take action without a meeting and any action approved in writing by any four members of the Committee, exclusive of the Chairman, at least two of which shall be members of the Pensions Committee selected by the Employer and at least two selected by the Union shall be the act of the Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">\u00a7 10.08 The Pension Committee shall have such powers as may be necessary for the proper administration of the Pension Plan, including but not limited to,, the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">(e) To authorize the Trustee to make-all disbursements from the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Plan and to establish necessary procedures therefor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b639-15\">. While the union could disrupt the operation of the plan to some extent by instructing its representatives on the Pension Committee not to attend meetings or sign disbursement authorizations, there are appropriate remedies under state law for intentional obstruction of the operation of the plan. Furthermore, such tactics could hardly defeat the purpose of the Act since the unions still would be-unable to divert trust funds for its own. use.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
