This is made to appear from a now undisputed history of the processing of seemingly identical claims with wholly irreconcilable results. The circumstances call for the resolution of the issue by a three-judge district court. The court may on application afford the parties an opportunity for further development of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The order of dismissal is vacated and the case remanded with directions to the District Judge to take appropriate steps for the convening of a three-judge district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
