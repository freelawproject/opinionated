We deny enforcement of those portions of the order dependent upon the latter finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The Upholsterers\u2019 International Union of North America, AFL-CIO attempted to organize the Company\u2019s employees. By letter, the union advised the company that it held signed authorization cards from a majority of the company\u2019s employees and requested recognition and a bargaining meeting. The Board found that at that time the union held valid cards from 120 of 207 employees in the unit in question. The company refused to recognize the union, stating its disbelief in the union\u2019s claimed majority status. In the meantime, the union filed a petition with the Board for a representation election. The election was held and the union was defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The Board found that during the union\u2019s campaign the company engaged in coercive activity in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act. Substantial evidence exists on the whole record to support this finding, and we enforce those portions of the order directing the company to cease and desist from coercing its employees and to post appropriate notices. Accepting the Board\u2019s findings, however, the violations of \u00a7 8(a) (1) as found by the Board were not so extensive or pervasive as to prevent the conduct of a valid secret election.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The Board further found that the company\u2019s refusal to bargain with the union upon request was not motivated by a good faith doubt as to majority status and constituted a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act. In several recent cases we have set forth in sufficient detail the reasons such a finding cannot stand in a typical case of this sort.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny enforcement of those portions of the order directing the company to cease and desist from refusing to bargain with the union and to bargain with the union upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Enforcement granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. 157 NLRB No. 59.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. Whether or not the election actually held was properly held invalid, we do not decide, but the \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations found to have occurred were not so pervasive that available remedies were not reasonably calculated to assure a free exercise of the employees\u2019 choice by secret ballot rather than by resort to a count of questionable cards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-23\">.
