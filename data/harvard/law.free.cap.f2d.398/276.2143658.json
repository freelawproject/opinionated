He undertook to find a buyer or additional capital. He sought to interest another of his customers, one Penn. Penn showed no interest in purchasing a controlling share in Sea-stores, nor in a request by petitioner for a $10,000 loan to help petitioner pay creditors of his earlier broker-dealer business, which had failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Petitioner then represented to Penn that he had advanced $20,000 to Mrs. Barber for boat hoisting equipment and was committed to advance an additional $5,000, on the receipt of which Seastores would make a public offering handled by petitioner\u2019s firm. Penn then loaned petitioner $5,000, taking a note in the form of a writing setting forth the following understanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-15\">\u201c * * * (1) The $5,000 is a loan to me and is repayable in 90 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-17\">(2) For the favor \u2014 I am willing to give you % of the shares which I will receive. I estimate <em>but cannot guarantee </em>that these shares (500) should have a value of $12,500. However, these shares probably will not be salable until this summer. * * * \u201d (Emphasis in the original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">In fact petitioner had borrowed from, not advanced monies to, Mrs. Barber; his firm had only talked about Seastores going public, and not very seriously; there was no plan for an offering of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-19\">Petitioner, unable to pay the note, received one extension of ninety days, and, after he defaulted on the extended due date, Penn brought his complaint to the Commission. The note was subsequently paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-20\">We first consider the jurisdictional issue, even though the only ground for appeal under which this issue may be thought to be preserved in the Petition for Review is that \u201c * * * [t]he order is not * * * in accordance with the applicable law. * * * \u201d Petitioner\u2019s argument is that the transaction at issue lacks the requisite ties with facilities of interstate commerce. But it is stipulated that Penn drew a check in New Hampshire on a New York bank, which had to use interstate means to have it cleared. This is enough. That the jurisdictional hook need not be large to fish for securities law violations is well established. Little v. United States, 331 F.2d 287 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 834, 85 S.Ct. 68, 13 L.Ed.2d 42 (1964); United States v. Schaefer, 299 F.2d 625 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 917, 82 S.Ct. 1553, 8 L.Ed.2d 497 (1962) ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>United States v. Cashin, 281 F.2d 669, 673 (2d Cir. 1960).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The two major substantive questions are whether the transaction in this case was a \u201csale\u201d and whether the subject matter was a \u201csecurity\u201d. Petitioner argues that (1) the Commission erred in construing the definition of \u201csale\u201d in the Securities Exchange Act to be identical with that in the Securities Act;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) that, even under the more specific Securities Act, there was no transaction involving Seastores securities \u201cfor value\u201d; (3) nor a \u201cpurchase of securities or any other thing\u201d to which a gift of Seastores shares could attach; and (4) nor any security \u201cgiven or delivered with\u201d any purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We consider first whether the written commitment to deliver 500 shares of Seastores stock when issued was a \u201csecurity\u201d under both securities statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold that it was. In Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 338, 88 S.Ct. 548, 554, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967) the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201cAs used in both the 1933 and 1934 Acts, security \u2018embodies a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of money of others on the promise of profits.\u2019 S. E. C. v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, at 299, 60 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">In this case petitioner\u2019s written promise to deliver securities in the future was not dissimilar to arrangements specifically covered by the relevant statutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, an unconditional promise to deliver securities \u201cprobably * * * not * * * salable until this summer\u201d would seem to evidence a more substantial right than an opportunity to subscribe to or purchase stock in the future. In SEC v. Addison, 194 F.Supp. 709, 722 (N.D.Tex. 1961) the court did not hesitate to conclude that oral profit-sharing agreements with lenders and suppliers of services \u201care investment contracts, and, as such, are securities.\u201d And in Seeman v. United States, 90 F.2d 88 (5th Cir. 1937), 96 F.2d 732 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 305 U.S. 620, 59 S.Ct. 80, 83 L.Ed. 396 (1938), the court was not impressed by the argument that a sale of forged bonds could not be a sale of \u201csecurities\u201d. Fraudulent representations as to securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ties not yet issued offer fully as much reason for invoking the protection of the securities laws.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">We also hold that the transaction was a \u201csale\u201d. We are unable to detect any significant difference so far as the transaction in this case is concerned between the two relevant statutes. Both cover contracts for the sale or other disposition of a security. Section 2(3) of the Securities Act, while requiring a transaction \u201cfor value\u201d, makes clear that a security given with or as a bonus on account of the purchase of \u201csecurities or any other thing\u201d is conclusively presumed to have been sold for value. Petitioner\u2019s obligation to Penn as expressed in his letter falls within this language, whether we view the commitment as stemming from unalloyed gratitude, or, more reasonably, as part of the quid pro quo to induce Penn to purchase petitioner\u2019s ninety day interest-free note. The transaction in this case was not dissimilar to the obtaining of loans and services accompanied by commitments to share in future profits of mining and timber operations which the court in SEC v. Addison, supra, characterized as sales of securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Section 3(a) (14) of the Securities Exchange Act contains neither the \u201cfor value\u201d limitation of Section 2(3) of the Securities Act nor the conclusive presumption of value provision. We have no reason to believe that Congress intended, one year after the passage of the Securities Act, to dilute the concept of \u201csale\u201d in the Securities Exchange Act. Cf. Tcherepnin v. Knight, supra. The \u201cotherwise dispose of\u201d language of Section 3(a) (14) and its corollary, \u201cotherwise acquire\u201d in Section 3(a) (13), are, as the court observed in Vine v. Beneficial Fin. Co., 374 F.2d 627, 634 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 970, 88 S.Ct. 463,19 L.Ed.2d 460 (1967) \u201chardly limiting\u201d. Thus, the transaction in this case constitutes a sale within Section 3(a) (14) as well as Section 2(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the findings of the Commission as to the falsity of petitioner\u2019s representations are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Finally, we come to the appropriateness of the Commission\u2019s sanction. The Commission has broad discretion to determine the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in this area. Marketlines, Inc. v. SEC, 384 F.2d 264, 267 (2d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 947, 88 S.Ct. 1033, 19 L.Ed.2d 1136 (1968). Only upon showing a gross abuse of discretion will a sanction be overturned. Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8-9 (2d Cir. 1965). Petitioner\u2019s only argument \u2014 that the Commission\u2019s findings and conclusion have no relation to the original charges \u2014 is not based on a balanced reading of the charges as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">The hearing examiner considered and gave weight in his decision to mitigating factors. The sixth month suspension ended on June 19, 1968. The remaining sanction regarding employment in a non-supervisory capacity is a common one and was chosen in lieu of revocation of petitioner\u2019s registration in order to give him \u201canother chance \u2014 to give him the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>means to make amends or to rehabilitate himself.\u201d Even this sanction is subject to possible revision or removal should circumstances warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\">. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 TJ.S.C. \u00a7 78j (b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 CER 240.10b-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\">. Another basis for jurisdiction, not argued extensively, lies in the finding of the Commission that petitioner made several misrepresentations concerning Seastores stock in telephone calls to Penn. Whether the calls were interstate or not does not appear. But, even if intrastate, this might be sufficient. Myzel v. Fields, 386 F.2d 718 (9th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 951, 88 S.Ct. 1043, 19 L.Ed.2d 1143 (1968); Lennerth v. Mendenhall, 234 F.Supp. 59, 63 (N.D.Ohio 1964) ; Nemitz v. Cunny, 221 F.Supp. 571, 575 (N.D.Ill.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\">. Section 2(3) of the Securities Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">\u201cThe term \u2018sale\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 shall include every contract of sale or disposition of a security or interest in a security, for value. * * * Any security given or delivered with, or as a bonus on account of, any purchase of securities or any other thing, shall be conclusively presumed to constitute a part of the subject of such purchase and to have been offered and sold for value. * * *\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b (3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">Section 3(a) (14) of the Securities Exchange Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-18\">\u201cThe terms \u2018sale\u2019 and \u2018sell\u2019 each include any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c (a) (14).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b327-19\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b (1); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c (a) (10). The Senate Report on the Act asserts that the definition of security in the 1934 Act was intended to be \u201csubstantially the same as [that contained] in the Securities Act of 1933.\u201d S.Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 14 (1934).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b327-22\">. Both statutes, see n. 4 supra, specify in substantially identical language that the following arrangements are encompassed within the definition of \u201csecurity\u201d: a \u201cpreorganization certificate or subscription\u201d ; an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d; or a \u201ccertificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase\u201d \u201cany instrument commonly known as a \u2018security\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">. Petitioner argues that the transaction was an exempted one under Section 4(1) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77d, 1967 Supp.) in- that \u201c[t]he transaction was not one involving an issuer, underwriter or dealer and [is exempt] under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as the transaction did not involve a public offering.\u201d The short answer is that Sections 4(1) and (2) create exemptions only from the registration requirements of Section 5 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e) and not from the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\">. The use of the word \u201cinclude\u201d rather than the word \u201cmeans\u201d in both Sections 2(3) and 3(a) (14) would seem to warrant a nonrestrietive interpretation. See 1 Loss, Securities Regulation 512 (1961 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">Such a holding would not seem to be strictly necessary since a wilful violation of the Securities Act is a sufficient basis for the imposition of sanctions under Section 15(b) (5) (D) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(b) (5) (D) (1967 Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
