He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the computer crime counts, arguing that evidence that he knowingly provided false information to banks was not sufficient to show that he \u201cused\u201d a computer within the meaning of ORS 164.377(2), because the state should have been required to prove that he directly accessed or manipulated the banks\u2019 computers. After review of the text, context, and legislative history, we agree that the record lacks evidence from which a factfinder could find that defendant \u201cused\u201d a computer or computer system within the meaning of the statute. The trial court, therefore, erred when it denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the 18 counts of computer crime. Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s entry of a judgment of conviction on Count 10 for computer crime instead of identity theft. The state concedes the error, and we agree. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s convictions for computer crime, reverse and remand as to Count 10 for entry of a conviction for identity theft, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">When denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal \u201ccenters on the meaning of the statute defining the offense,\u201d we review the interpretation of the statute for legal error. <em>State v. Hunt, </em>270 Or App 206, 210, 346 P3d 1285 (2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the facts in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The relevant facts are undisputed. In September and October 2012, defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud two banks. Defendant personally visited several bank branches and opened checking and savings accounts. Defendant provided the banks\u2019 employees with false information, primarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>fraudulent social security numbers and home addresses. The bank employees relied on the information defendant provided, entering that information into the banks\u2019 computer systems to create bank accounts for defendant. Defendant activated automatic teller machine (ATM) cards and provided worthless checks for deposit into his new accounts. In compliance with federal law, the banks made at least $100 available immediately after defendant opened the accounts, before the checks were processed. Shortly after defendant created the accounts, someone other than defendant used the ATM cards and passwords to withdraw credited funds from the accounts or make purchases before the banks could determine the validity of the checks. As a result, the banks suffered financial losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">Defendant was charged with multiple counts of identity theft, theft in the second degree, and computer crime. At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the computer crime counts, among others, arguing that the state failed to present any evidence that defendant \u201cused\u201d a computer for purposes of ORS 164.377(2). He argued that there was no evidence that he opened an account online or that he withdrew any money from the accounts using an ATM. Defendant argued that, \u201cjust because a bank or a business that you go to uses computers, that doesn\u2019t mean that [defendant] used a computer.\u201d The state countered that defendant was \u201cusing a computer system\u201d by \u201ctrying to inflate a bank balance\u201d so that money could be withdrawn later from an ATM. In the state\u2019s view, providing false information to a bank employee, who then enters that information into the bank\u2019s computer database, constitutes \u201cusing\u201d a computer under ORS 164.377(2). The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, and the jury convicted defendant on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">On appeal, defendant renews his arguments made in the trial court. Defendant contends that the state\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cuse\u201d under ORS 164.377(2) is overly broad and contrary to the legislature\u2019s intent. The state reiterates its arguments, relying primarily on the statute\u2019s text and context to contend that defendant \u201cused\u201d the banks\u2019 computer systems for purposes of ORS 164.377(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The parties\u2019 arguments raise a question of statutory interpretation of whether the legislature intended the phrase, to \u201cuse\u201d a computer system, to reach defendant\u2019s conduct here. In construing a statute, we consider its text, context, and legislative history, to discern legislative intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We begin with the text and context of the computer crime statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That statute, ORS 164.377(2), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201cAny person commits computer crime who knowingly accesses, attempts to access or uses, or attempts to use, any computer, computer system, computer network or any part thereof for the purpose of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201c(a) Devising or executing any scheme or artifice to defraud;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">\u201c(b) Obtaining money, property or services by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201c(c) Committing theft, including, but not limited to, theft of proprietary information or theft of an intimate image.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The statute defines various terms, from \u201caccess\u201d to \u201cservices.\u201d For example, to \u201caccess\u201d is \u201cto instruct, communicate with, store data in, retrieve data from or <em>otherwise make use of </em>any resources of a computer, computer system or computer network.\u201d ORS 164.377(1)(a) (emphasis added). The statute, however, does not define its term \u201cuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Because the legislature has not defined, \u201cuse,\u201d we consider the term\u2019s ordinary, plain meaning. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). The verb \u201cuse\u201d at the time the legislature enacted the statute was defined as \u201cto carry out a purpose or action by means of : make instrumental to an end or process : apply to advantage : turn to account [.] \u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2524 (unabridged ed 2002). The dictionary explains that \u201cuse is general and indicates any putting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>to service of a thing, usu[ally] for an intended or fit purpose or person [.] \u201d <em>Id. </em>That broad definition of \u201cuse\u201d posits a range of meanings, and it begs the question whether to \u201cuse\u201d may be directly or indirectly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Both parties argue that the text and context of ORS 164.377(2) supports their positions. Defendant observes that the plain meaning of \u201cuse\u201d can be either broad or narrow. Defendant argues that the \u201capply to advantage\u201d definition of \u201cuse\u201d connotes a \u201cbroad definition in which a person could take advantage of something indirectly, without accessing or manipulating it.\u201d Defendant contrasts that meaning of \u201cuse\u201d with the meaning of the phrases, \u201cputting to service of a thing\u201d and \u201cmakfing] instrumental to an end.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2524. He argues that the latter meaning of \u201cuse\u201d connotes a \u201cmore narrow definition in which a person directly manipulates something for an intended purpose, and that the thing being used be crucial to achieving that intended purpose.\u201d Defendant reasons that, because ORS 164.377(2) requires that the individual \u201cuse\u201d the computer \u201cfor the purpose of\u2019 one of several prohibited activities, the context implies the direct manipulation of the computer for an intended and prohibited purpose, rather than indirectly taking advantage of someone else\u2019s manipulation of a computer system. Therefore, defendant posits that the legislature had a narrow definition of \u201cuse\u201d in mind\u2014specifically to target computer hackers\u2014when it enacted the computer crime statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The state responds that nothing in the statute connotes a requirement that, to \u201cuse\u201d a computer in order to execute a fraud, the perpetrator must personally enter the fraudulent information into the computer. Applying one meaning of \u201cuse,\u201d the state argues that defendant \u201cused\u201d a computer because defendant \u201ccarried out his purpose to commit fraud by means of the banks\u2019 computer networks.\u201d Or, applying another meaning, the state argues that defendant made the banks\u2019 computers \u201cinstrumental\u201d to the end of committing theft by fraud, and thus \u201cused them for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">For support, the state cites <em>State v. Osborne, </em>242 Or App 85, 255 P3d 513 (2011) as an application of the dictionary definition of the term \u201cuse\u201d in a different statute. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>that case, we concluded that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find that the defendant \u201cused\u201d a knife for purposes of first-degree robbery, ORS 164.415, when he held a knife in his hand and demanded money from a store clerk. <em>Id. </em>at 89-90. <em>Osborne </em>does not resolve the question here, however, because, in that case, the defendant personally held the knife to carry out the robbery. Further, dictionary definitions do not resolve our question. \u201cIn construing statutes, we do not simply consult dictionaries and interpret words in a vacuum. Dictionaries, after all, do not tell us what words mean, only what words <em>can </em>mean, depending on their context and the particular manner in which they are used.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Cloutier, 351 Or 68, 96, 261 P3d 1234 (2011) (emphasis in original). In this case, further inquiry is needed to determine the legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Like defendant, we acknowledge that the plain meaning of \u201cuse\u201d can be broad or narrow. As the parties\u2019 textual arguments demonstrate, the court could reach different results depending on how broadly or narrowly the term \u201cuse\u201d is construed. Recognizing a similar dilemma in interpreting another subsection of ORS 164.377, the Supreme Court looked to legislative history to understand that subsection based on the \u201ccontext of the technology of the time.\u201d <em>State v. Nascimento, </em>360 Or 28, 42-44, 379 P3d 484 (2016); <em>see State v. Perry, </em>165 Or App 342, 349, 996 P2d 995 (2000), <em>aff'd, </em>336 Or 49, 77 P3d 313 (2003) (\u201cContext may be found in * * * the historical context of those relevant enactments.\u201d). Although the state\u2019s proposed construction of the word \u201cuse\u201d in ORS 164.377(2) is plausible, that construction becomes untenable when considered in light of the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The statute, ORS 164.377, began as House Bill (HB) 2795. The bill was originally introduced during the 1985 legislative session to combat the theft of cable television services. <em>See </em>Bill File, HB 2795 (1985) (before amendment). Representatives of the General Telephone Company urged a House Judiciary subcommittee to adopt an amendment to respond to a related and growing problem at the time, described as \u201ccomputer crime, or computer hackers if you will.\u201d Tape Recording, House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee 1, HB 2795, May 6,1985, Tape 576 (statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>of Dave Overstreet, General Telephone Company). Sterling Gibson, an employee of General Telephone Company, explained that many businesses had come to use computers and that the purpose of the amendment was to \u201cprevent people from calling into someone\u2019s computer\u201d to manipulate the data and \u201ccreate havoc to that business or industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(statement of Sterling Gibson). To illustrate the kind of conduct the amendment sought to prohibit, he provided some examples: people who remotely accessed business computers and altered business documents; students who used computers to automatically \u201cscan\u201d telephone exchanges for unsecured computer systems into which they could remotely dial; and individuals who publicly posted confidential long-distance telephone \u201cbilling codes\u201d on computer bulletin board systems. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">That testimony, and other testimony, supports the sense that the bill was targeted at computer hacking and the direct manipulation of information stored within the computer or computer systems. For example, one legislator expressed concern that the amendment might criminalize the conduct of computer hobbyists who used telephone modems of that era to connect with other computers. <em>Id. </em>(statement of Rep Kopetski). Marion County District Attorney Dale Penn emphasized that the law would not apply to people who are allowed access to computer systems:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiD\">\u201cThere we get into the definition of \u2018access.\u2019 I think *** if you call up to a computer system and you\u2019re not authorized you\u2019re probably not even going to be able to get the menu up. If you\u2019re calling to a bulletin board you\u2019re going to see the menu. And that\u2019s not what we\u2019re addressing here. We\u2019re addressing a computer system in which you\u2019re not authorized to dial. You won\u2019t know the codes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\"><em>Id. </em>(statement of District Attorney Dale Penn). A committee chair asked why the amendment was necessary in light of a previously enacted \u201ctheft of services\u201d statute. Gibson from General Telephone replied that the amendment was concerned with people utilizing computers to \u201cmanipulate] *** documents that are vital to th[e] organization,\u201d which may or may not constitute theft. He stated that, \u201c[a]gain we are not dealing necessarily with the theft of something, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>we are dealing with manipulation. We have in the environment computers with the ability of having information being observed by another * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>(statement of Sterling Gibson).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The amendments were adopted in the House Judiciary subcommittee and moved to the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, where testimony again focused on computer hacking. At the House Judiciary Committee, legislative counsel stated that the proposed amendment was introduced to address the \u201cidea of <em>people who use their computers or instruments </em>to get access to computer systems or networks and then gain by using the information or program that belongs to someone else.\u201d Tape Recording, House Judiciary Committee, HB 2795, May 13, 1985, Tape 613, Side A (statement of legislative counsel) (emphasis added). Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dave Overstreet, also from General Telephone, emphasized that the \u201cbill address [es] computer hackers\u2014persons who use computers to defraud. Computers can now be used to talk to other computers.\u201d Minutes, Senate Judiciary Committee, HB 2795, June 7, 1985, 18 (minutes noting comments; audiotape malfunctioned).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In sum, the legislative history of ORS 164.377 demonstrates that the bill was intended to combat \u201ccomputer hacking,\u201d commonly understood as the practice of gaining access to a computer system and often tampering with sensitive data or information stored within. <em>See Nascimento, </em>360 Or at 42-44. In 1985, the legislature was concerned with people operating a computer to \u201ccall[] into someone\u2019s computer\u201d to manipulate the data stored within the computer, accessing someone\u2019s computer without authorization, and directly using computers for larcenous or fraudulent purposes. There is no indication that the bill was intended to reach the conduct of a person, such as defendant, who simply provided false information to an authorized employee, who then entered that false information into an employer\u2019s computer system. The 1985 legislature did not intend to turn ordinary theft or fraud into a computer crime merely when the victim\u2019s employee made authorized use of a computer, doing ordinary data entry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>and when the perpetrator did not directly access or manipulate the computer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">The state acknowledges that the legislature\u2019s motivation was to criminalize computer hacking, but it argues that the \u201ctext the 1985 legislature ultimately adopted is not limited to addressing the problem of trespass-by-computer.\u201d The state argues that subsections (3) and (4) criminalize computer use that is \u201cwithout authorization,\u201d so subsection (2) should be construed more broadly to include \u201careas outside that concern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">In <em>Nascimento, </em>360 Or at 43-44, the Oregon Supreme Court rejected a similar argument about subsection (4) of ORS 164.377. In that case, the issue was the meaning of the phrase, \u201cwithout authorization.\u201d Under 164.377(4), it is a crime to use, access, or attempt to access a computer or computer network \u201cwithout authorization.\u201d ORS 164.377(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state urged the court to adopt a broad interpretation of \u201cwithout authorization,\u201d arguing that the defendant\u2019s computer use violated her employer\u2019s computer use policies and, therefore, her violation of those policies constituted computer crime under ORS 164.377(4).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Nascimento, </em>360 Or at 35-36. The court concluded that the legislative history of ORS 164.377 established that the statute was intended to \u201caddress the unauthorized access of a computer by \u2018hackers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>or others who had no authority to use the computer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43. The state contended that, even if the legislative history reflected those concerns, \u201cthe text that the legislature adopted is \u2018not so limited,\u2019 and that it prohibits <em>all </em>\u2018access\u2019 that is \u2018without authorization.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43-44 (emphasis in original). The court rejected the state\u2019s interpretation, explaining that the legislature may ultimately choose to adopt \u201cbroader language that applies to a wider range of circumstances than the precise problem that triggered legislative attention,\u201d but that \u201cdoes not mean that we necessarily interpret statutes in the broadest possible sense that the text might permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Similarly, here, the state urges us to interpret \u201cuse\u201d in the broadest possible sense, notwithstanding the narrower legislative history of ORS 164.377. However, we decline to interpret \u201cuse\u201d to include the situation in the present case, where defendant did not directly access or manipulate a computer or computer system in the commission of theft or fraud. Although defendant induced the banks to act to permit his theft, at all times the victim banks remained in unqualified and uncompromised control of their computer systems. Therefore, we conclude that defendant did not \u201cuse\u201d a computer or computer system within the meaning of ORS 164.377(2). The trial court, therefore, erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the computer crime counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s entry of a judgment of conviction on Count 10 for computer crime instead of identity theft as charged in the indictment and on the verdict form. The state concedes the error. We accept the concession, and remand for entry of a judgment of conviction for identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Convictions on Counts 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, 28, 31, 34, 36, 38, 41, 44, and 47 reversed; Count 10 reversed and remanded for entry of judgment of conviction for identity theft; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\"> The version of the statute that applies in this case is ORS 164.377 (2011), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2015, ch 350, \u00a7 1, but because the subsequent amendment does not affect our analysis, we cite the current version of the statute throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-5\"> We do not address a set of facts in which a bad actor dupes an innocent employee into introducing malicious code or software into an employer\u2019s computer system.
