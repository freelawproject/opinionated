He challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to enter a judgment of acquittal following his contention during closing arguments<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that the letters he sent to his former therapist were communications that a reasonable person could conclude were a \u201cthreat of imminent and serious personal violence,\u201d as required by <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 977 P2d 379 (1999). Thus, he argued, the letters were not \u201crepeated, unwanted contacts that reasonably alarm or coerce the victim and that also create reasonable fear for personal safety.\u201d <em>State v. Ryan, </em>350 Or 670, 679, 261 P3d 1189 (2011) (briefly stating the crime of stalking). The state concedes that the letters, which were relied upon for both counts, were insufficient under <em>Rangel </em>to constitute a contact as required under ORS 163.732. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-5\"> A defendant may preserve a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by raising that issue during closing argument. <em>State v.
