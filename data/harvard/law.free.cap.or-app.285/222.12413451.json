J.</author>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief arising out of requests for public records under the Oregon Public Records Law, ORS 192.410 to 192.505. Plaintiff, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), appeals a judgment dismissing its complaint against defendant, the Port of Portland. In its complaint, the ILWU sought to have the circuit court compel the port to produce the requested records and to waive or substantially reduce the fees that the port was requiring the ILWU to pay before the port produced the records. The court dismissed part of the ILWU\u2019s complaint because there had been no \u201cdenial\u201d of the ILWU\u2019s records request, which the court concluded was necessary for it to have jurisdiction over claims seeking to compel the port to produce records. The court also dismissed the ILWU\u2019s claims relating to the port\u2019s fees to produce the records, with leave to replead those claims. The ILWU declined to replead its remaining claims and filed this appeal from the judgment dismissing its claims. We conclude that the circuit court erred in dismissing the ILWU\u2019s complaint. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Because it assists in understanding the facts of this case, we begin with an overview of the relevant provisions of the Public Records Law. Under ORS 192.420(1), \u201c[e]very person has a right to inspect any public record of a public body in this state, except as otherwise expressly provided by ORS 192.501 to 192.505 [listing exemptions from disclosure] .\u201d \u201cUnder the statutory scheme, disclosure is the rule,\u201d and exemptions are narrowly construed. <em>Guard Publishing Co. v. Lane County School Dist., </em>310 Or 32, 37, 791 P2d 854 (1990). As such,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201c[a] public body must adhere strictly to the requirements of the relevant statutes. A public body may not exempt itself from its responsibilities under the Inspection of Public Records law by adopting a policy that seeks to deprive citizens of their right under the law to inspect public records. Disclosure is the norm; exclusion is the exception that must be justified by the public body.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The custodian of a public record is required to provide a person who asks to inspect a record the reasonable opportunity to inspect or copy the record. ORS 192.440(1). If the request is in writing, the public body is required to \u201crespond as soon as practicable and without unreasonable delay\u201d and may request clarification or additional information \u201cfor the purpose of expediting the public body\u2019s response to the request.\u201d ORS 192.440(2); <em>see also </em>ORS 192.440(2)(a) - (f) (setting out statements the public body\u2019s response must include).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Any person who is \u201cdenied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record of a state agency\u201d may petition the Attorney General \u201cto review the public record to determine if it may be withheld from public inspection.\u201d ORS 192.450(1). If the person is \u201cdenied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record of a public body other than a state agency,\u201d then the person may petition the district attorney of the county in which the public body is located in the same manner as provided for a petition to the Attorney General. ORS 192.460(1). The burden is on the public body \u201cto sustain its action.\u201d ORS 192.450(1). Under those review statutes, the Attorney General or district attorney has the authority to order the public body to disclose the public record. ORS 192.450(2); ORS 192.460. If the Attorney General or district attorney denies the person\u2019s petition, the person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit court. ORS 192.450(2); ORS 192.460. The failure of the Attorney General or district attorney to issue an order granting or denying a petition within seven days of receipt \u201cshall be treated as an order denying the petition for the purpose of determining whether a person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief.\u201d ORS 192.465(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">With regard to the circuit court proceedings, ORS 192.490(1) provides that, \u201c [i] n any suit filed under ORS 192.450 [or] 192.460 * * *, the court has jurisdiction to enjoin the public body from withholding records and to order the production of any records improperly withheld from the person seeking disclosure.\u201d As at the Attorney General or district attorney review level, \u201cthe burden is on the public body to sustain its action.\u201d ORS 192.490(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The Public Records Law also includes provisions related to a public body\u2019s authority to establish fees \u201cthat the requester must pay * * * as a condition of receiving the public records.\u201d ORS 192.440(2)(c). ORS 192.440(4)(a) provides, in part, that \u201c[t]he public body may establish fees reasonably calculated to reimburse the public body for the public body\u2019s actual cost of making public records available.\u201d Under ORS 192.440(5), the public body \u201cmay furnish copies without charge or at a substantially reduced fee if the custodian determines that the waiver or reduction of fees is in the public interest because making the record available primarily benefits the general public.\u201d Finally, under ORS 192.440(6), \u201c[a] person who believes that there has been an unreasonable denial of a fee waiver or fee reduction may petition the Attorney General or the district attorney in the same manner as a person petitions when inspection of a public record is denied under ORS 192.410 to 192.505.\u201d That section also provides that \u201c[t]he Attorney General, the district attorney and the court have the same authority in instances when a fee waiver or reduction is denied as it has when inspection of a public record is denied.\u201d ORS 192.440(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">With that legal background in place, we briefly summarize the facts from the ILWU\u2019s complaint. Over the course of about a year, the ILWU and the port communicated by letter and email about three sets of requests that the ILWU made to the port (the June 2012, September 2012, and December 2012 requests) for the production of public records under the Public Records Law. In response to the June 2012 request, the port estimated that its cost for staff time to locate responsive records would be $200,000 (which included searching 195 boxes in storage) and estimated that additional \u201csubstantial\u201d costs would be incurred for legal review of those documents prior to production. The port required the ILWU to pay the $200,000 fee before it would undertake to search for responsive records, and would require the ILWU to pay an undetermined additional fee for legal review before production. The port provided cost estimates for the September 2012 and December 2012 requests in the amounts of approximately $4,600 and $5,500, respectively, and required prepayment of those amounts before locating records.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The parties engaged in an extended back and forth correspondence about the ILWU\u2019s requests. In that correspondence, the ILWU primarily objected to the port\u2019s estimated costs and inadequate responses, requested that the port provide more detailed information, and requested a waiver or a reduction of a substantial portion of the fees. In response, among other things, the port refused to waive or reduce its fees, suggested that the ILWU narrow its records requests to reduce costs, and indicated that it would not continue with records searches until the cost issues were resolved. In March 2013, the port also provided revised cost estimates for locating responsive records in the amount of $37,434.15 for the June 2012 request (which excluded the 195 boxes in storage), $8,541.96 for the September 2012 requests, and $3,471.83 for the December 2012 requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In July 2013, the ILWU petitioned the Multnomah County District Attorney \u201cto review [the port\u2019s] denial of ILWU\u2019s right to inspect or obtain copies of public records and [the port\u2019s] denial of ILWU\u2019s requests for waiver and/or reduction of fees for the public records.\u201d The district attorney declined to make a decision on the ILWU\u2019s petition because he believed that he did not have authority to do so \u201cbecause there has not been an actual written denial of your request by the Port of Portland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">After receiving the district attorney\u2019s response, the ILWU filed for declaratory and injunctive relief in the circuit court. In its complaint, the ILWU asserted six claims for relief based on six alleged violations of the Public Records Law. Those six claims are that the port (1) failed to provide sufficient information and responses, (2) denied the ILWU access to public records through untimely responses and dilatory tactics, (3) charged fees not reasonably calculated to reimburse the port for actual costs, (4) unlawfully denied the ILWU\u2019s request for a fee waiver or reduction, (5) unlawfully mishandled the ILWU\u2019s requests because the requested documents could be used against the port in separate ongoing litigation between the port and the ILWU, and (6) discriminated and retaliated against the ILWU because of that ongoing litigation through the port\u2019s handling of the requests and denial of a fee waiver or reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>In association with each claim, the ILWU requested as a remedy that the court compel the port to produce to the ILWU \u201cthe non-exempt records requested by ILWU\u201d and \u201cto waive or substantially reduce the fees associated with the disclosure of the public records requested by ILWU.\u201d The ILWU also requested in a separate prayer for relief that the court issue several declarations, which were not associated with specific claims. Those requested declarations included that the port\u2019s fees were unreasonable, the port\u2019s refusals to waive or reduce fees were unsupported by facts or law, and the port\u2019s handling of the records requests was dilatory, unlawful, and in bad faith. The ILWU also sought in the prayer for relief an order enjoining the port \u201cfrom continuing or repeating the unlawful activities\u201d set out in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The port filed an answer that admitted the allegations in the ILWU\u2019s complaint that accurately restated the content of the parties\u2019 correspondence but denied that any of its conduct constituted a denial of the ILWU\u2019s record requests or violated the Public Records Law. After filing its answer, the port filed a motion under ORCP 21 A(1) to dismiss the ILWU\u2019s claims\u2014based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction\u2014\u201cto the extent the ILWU is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief compelling the port to produce public records.\u201d The port also filed a motion for partial summary judgment against the ILWU\u2019s claims \u201cto the extent the ILWU is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief compelling the port to waive or significantly reduce fees associated with the ILWU\u2019s public records requests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">At the hearing, the court granted the port\u2019s motion to dismiss but denied the port\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. With regard to the motion to dismiss, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201cWith respect to the first motion in which [the port] seeks to dismiss [the ILWU\u2019s] claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, to the extent that [the ILWU] alleges there was a denial, I\u2019m going to grant that motion to dismiss. I think I have no jurisdiction because there is certainly no reason for me to conclude that there was a denial, let alone a <em>de facto </em>denial, if in fact a <em>de facto </em>denial would be a sufficient denial, which I don\u2019t conclude at all. But I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>don\u2019t determine that there\u2019s a basis to conclude there was a denial or a <em>de facto </em>denial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The court denied the port\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment because \u201cit\u2019s inappropriate at this stage to conclude that there\u2019s no genuine issue of material fact in that regard.\u201d The order on the port\u2019s motions stated that the \u201cMotion to Dismiss is granted and, to the extent [the ILWU\u2019s] claims seek declaratory and injunctive relief compelling [the port] to produce public records, they are dismissed with prejudice because there has been no denial of [the ILWU\u2019s] record requests,\u201d and that the motion for partial summary judgment was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">After the court entered its order, the ILWU and the port proceeded with the case but ultimately disagreed as to the issues that were left for trial. Shortly before trial, the ILWU and the port submitted a joint motion to the court for clarification on the issues to be tried, with opposing memoranda setting out their positions. The court disagreed with both the ILWU and the port as to what remained for trial because the court concluded that its grant of the port\u2019s motion to dismiss had dismissed the ILWU\u2019s entire complaint, but that only part of the complaint was dismissed with prejudice. The court then entered an order granting the ILWU an opportunity to replead the claims dismissed without prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201cThe Court intended and understood that its November 22, 2013 Order dismissed all claims in the Complaint per ORCP 21 A, with the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief compelling [the port] to produce public records being dismissed with prejudice and the remaining claims being dismissed without prejudice, and with leave to re-plead the claims dismissed without prejudice. [The ILWU] has 10 days from July 16, 2014, to file an amended complaint. The amended complaint may not include or address any of the claims that were dismissed with prejudice, and it may not assert any new claims that were not previously alleged in the original complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">After entry of that order, the ILWU decided not to file an amended complaint to allow it to take an immediate appeal. The court then entered a judgment that dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>all of the' ILWU\u2019s claims with prejudice, and the ILWU appeals that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">On appeal, the ILWU raises two assignments of error. In the first, the ILWU argues that the trial court erred in relying on disputed evidence to find that the port had not denied (or <em>de facto </em>denied) the ILWU\u2019s records requests, which was the sole basis given for the court\u2019s dismissal of the ILWU\u2019s complaint. In the second, the ILWU argues that the court erred in dismissing its complaint based on the court\u2019s legally erroneous conclusion that a public body must issue a \u201cdenial\u201d of a records request for a circuit court to have jurisdiction of a case under the Public Records Law. As explained below, we conclude that the circuit court did have subject matter jurisdiction to consider all of the claims in the ILWU\u2019s complaint, and, thus, the court erred in granting the port\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">As set out above, 285 Or App at 223-25, the Public Records Law expressly provides that the Attorney General or the district attorney is authorized to review a public body\u2019s denial of the right to inspect or receive a public record and a public body\u2019s denial of a fee waiver or reduction. ORS 192.450; ORS 192.460; ORS 192.440(6). If the Attorney General or the district attorney denies such a petition, then those same statutes expressly provide that the person may seek injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit court, with the court having the express authority to \u201cenjoin the public body from withholding records and to order the production of any records improperly withheld from the person seeking disclosure.\u201d ORS 192.490(1). In addition, in <em>In Defense of Animals v. OHSU, </em>199 Or App 160, 183, 112 P3d 336 (2005), we concluded that, \u201c [although ORS chapter 192 does not expressly provide for circuit court review of the reasonableness of a public body\u2019s fees, it [i]s within the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to decide that question\u201d under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, ORS 28.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In this case, the circuit court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant the ILWU\u2019s requested declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the port to produce public records \u201cbecause there has been no denial of [the ILWU\u2019s] record requests.\u201d The port\u2019s jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>argument, which the circuit court accepted, is that ORS 192.490(1)\u2014which provides that a circuit court has jurisdiction to enter an injunction against the public body\u2014begins with the preface, \u201c[i]n any suit filed under ORS 192.450 [or] 192.460.\u201d In turn, those statutory sections provide that a person who is \u201cdenied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record\u201d may petition the Attorney General or district attorney for an order that the public body disclose the public record. Thus, the port argues, a court\u2019s jurisdiction under ORS 192.490(1) is dependent on the public body first denying a records request.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The port misreads how the statutes work together. First, the prefatory statement in ORS 192.490(1), \u201c[i]n any suit filed under ORS 192.450 [or] 192.460,\u201d is an identification of the type of suit to which ORS 192.490(1) applies\u2014 <em>viz., </em>a declaratory or injunctive proceeding filed under those statutes\u2014it is not a wholesale incorporation of the provisions in those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Second, the references in ORS 192.450(1) and 192.460(1) to a person \u201cdenied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record\u201d are references to who may petition the Attorney General or the district attorney. Those statutory sections do not say anything about who may file a proceeding in the circuit court. Rather, who may file a proceeding in the circuit court is governed by ORS 192.450(2), which provides that a person seeking the disclosure of records may file suit \u201c [i] f the Attorney General [or the district attorney] denies the petition in whole or in part.\u201d Thus, the only statutory prerequisite to instituting a circuit court proceeding under ORS 192.450 or ORS 192.460 is that the Attorney General or district attorney has denied, in whole or part, the person\u2019s petition (ORS 192.450(2); ORS 192.460), or has failed to act on the petition within seven days of receipt of the petition because such failure \u201cshall be treated as an order denying the petition for the purpose of determining whether a person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief\u2019 (ORS 192.465(1)). <em>See Morse Bros., Inc. v. ODED, </em>103 Or App 619, 798 P2d 719 (1990) (holding that the circuit court should have dismissed the case because the plaintiff filed the court proceeding before the seven days had elapsed on the petition to the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>General, and the Attorney General had not yet acted on the petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Third, the port\u2019s argument that there must be a \u201cdenial\u201d of a records request before a court can enjoin a public body ignores the plain statutory text of ORS 192.490(1). Under ORS 192.490(1), a circuit court \u201chas jurisdiction to enjoin the public body from withholding records and to order the production of any records improperly withheld from the person seeking disclosure.\u201d Nothing in that grant of jurisdiction requires that the public body formally \u201cdeny\u201d a records request before a court can exercise its statutory injunctive authority. Moreover, it is self-evident that an improper withholding of a public record could occur in any number of ways short of some formal \u201cdenial\u201d of a records request, such as by stonewalling or other obstructive conduct on the part of the public body. We decline to read into the statute a jurisdictional requirement that is not in the text of the statute and that would be contrary to the statutory scheme favoring the disclosure of public records. <em>See, e.g., Guard Publishing Co., </em>310 Or at 39 (\u201cA public body may not exempt itself from its responsibilities under the Inspection of Public Records law by adopting a policy that seeks to deprive citizens of their right under the law to inspect public records. Disclosure is the norm; exclusion is the exception that must be justified by the public body.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Here, the district attorney failed to act within seven days on the ILWU\u2019s petition because he determined he did not have authority to act. However, that determination did not affect the <em>circuit court\u2019s </em>jurisdiction to hear the matter. Under ORS 192.465(1), the district attorney\u2019s failure to act was a denial of the ILWU\u2019s petition for purposes of instituting a circuit court proceeding under ORS 192.460, which is the only statutory prerequisite for such an action. Because the only statutory prerequisite had been met, the circuit court did have jurisdiction under ORS 192.490 to determine whether an injunction should issue compelling the port to produce the public records that the ILWU sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In addition, the circuit court had jurisdiction under ORS 192.440(6) to compel the port to produce the public records. Under ORS 192.440(6), the Attorney General, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>district attorney, and the court have <em>\u201cthe same authority </em>in instances when a fee waiver or reduction is denied as it has when inspection of a public record is denied.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That \u201csame authority\u201d is an explicit reference to the Attorney General\u2019s and district attorney\u2019s authority to order disclosure of a public record, ORS 192.450 to 192.460, and the circuit court\u2019s authority to enjoin a public body from withholding public records and to compel production of improperly withheld records, ORS 192.490. Thus, the circuit court also had explicit statutory authority under ORS 192.440(6) to enjoin the port from withholding the requested public records and to compel the port to produce those records based on the ILWU\u2019s claims related to the port\u2019s refusal to waive or reduce the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Finally, we briefly turn to the ILWU\u2019s first assignment of error. Having concluded that whether there has been a denial of the right to inspect a public record is not a fact that bears on the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit court, we also necessarily conclude that the court erred in its ruling on the port\u2019s ORCP 21 A(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction by making a factual determination on whether the port had denied inspection. ORCP 21 A (providing that a court may make findings only to determine the existence or nonexistence of a defense listed in (1) through (7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the circuit court erred when it granted the port\u2019s motion to dismiss and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
