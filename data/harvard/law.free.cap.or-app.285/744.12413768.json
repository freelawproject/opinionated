However, she contested allegations by the Department of Human Services (DHS) that she had a substance abuse problem (Allegation 1) and mental health issues (Allegation 2) that interfered with her ability to safely parent the children. After a jurisdictional hearing, the juvenile court determined that DHS had proven the substance abuse and mental health allegations, and took jurisdiction based on those allegations, as well as mother\u2019s admission to the domestic violence allegation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">On appeal, mother asserts that the evidence was insufficient to establish that substance abuse or mental health issues caused her to be an unsafe parent. DHS concedes that the evidence at the jurisdictional hearing was \u201clegally insufficient to prove that mother had a substance abuse problem that posed a current risk of harm to her children at the time of the dependency trial.\u201d DHS, however, argues that sufficient evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s determination that mother\u2019s mental health issues posed a current risk of harm to her children at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">We agree with DHS on both counts. That is, we accept DHS\u2019s concession that the evidence was insufficient as to the substance abuse allegation, and agree that there was sufficient evidence to support jurisdiction based on mother\u2019s mental health issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Jurisdictional judgments reversed and remanded for entry of judgments establishing dependency jurisdiction based on allegations other than Allegation 1; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\"> The three oldest children and the two youngest children have different fathers. The juvenile court determined that jurisdiction with respect to each father was appropriate. Neither father appeals the judgments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\"> The juvenile court dismissed an allegation that mother failed to provide an adequate supply of food for the children and often fails to prepare meals for the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
