Respondent assigns error to the trial court\u2019s issuance of the FAPA restraining order. In support of his position, respondent first contends that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that abuse occurred. <em>See </em>ORS 107.718(1). Second, respondent asserts that the court erred by failing to make two findings that were essential to the issuance of a FAPA restraining order, specifically, that petitioner was in imminent danger of further abuse, and that respondent represented a credible threat to petitioner\u2019s safety. <em>See id. </em>Third, respondent argues that the court could not have made those findings, because the record does not support them. In response, petitioner argues that respondent failed to preserve each of those contentions, but that, to the extent that we consider them, the record supports each of the trial court\u2019s express and implicit findings and the restraining order as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">As explained below, we agree with petitioner that respondent failed to raise before the trial court some of the contentions that he seeks to have us consider on appeal, and, accordingly, we do not consider the merits of those contentions. Respondent did preserve his argument that the trial court\u2019s finding that the abuse occurred is unsupported by the record. However, we decline respondent\u2019s request to conduct <em>de novo </em>review in this case and conclude that evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding of abuse. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We begin with a brief overview of the procedural history of the case and the evidence presented at the FAPA hearing. On July 20, 2015, petitioner filed a \u201cPetition for Restraining Order to Prevent Abuse\u201d under ORS 107.718(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>In her petition, she alleged that, on July 15, 2015, respondent, who was petitioner\u2019s husband, had committed abuse within the meaning of FAPA. Petitioner alleged that, on that date, respondent \u201ccame home from work, after a few drinks [.] * * * [H]e physically attacked me. I had to fight for my safety. It was terrifying.\u201d The trial court reviewed the petition <em>ex parte </em>and issued the requested restraining order. <em>See </em>ORS 107.718(1) (authorizing the initial issuance of a restraining order through <em>ex parte </em>proceedings). Respondent filed a timely request for a hearing to contest the issuance of that order. <em>See </em>ORS 107.718(10) (imposing hearing request deadline of 30 days after service of the order).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">At the contested hearing, the court began by clarifying the scope of respondent\u2019s challenge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019ll describe how I\u2019d like to proceed. First of all, I\u2019d like to know the position [of respondent] * * * on the restraining order itself; and that is, is it his position that if we go through and hear all the facts, I will determine that the incident did not occur? Is that the position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u201c[RESPONDENT]: Yes, Your Honor, that no abusive incident occurred, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: *** I want to determine first that issue, and then obviously if it did not occur, then we\u2019re done. * * * I have read the petition. It establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case for granting the restraining order, and that\u2019s what a restraining order is based on in the initial stage. And so I want to treat the petition as direct testimony of the petitioner, and start with allowing any cross-examining of the petitioner on that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Respondent voiced no objection to the court\u2019s proposed reliance on the petition and proceeded to question petitioner regarding her allegations of abuse. Petitioner testified that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>following a heated argument with respondent, she had gone outside and sat on the steps of their home with her cell phone in her hand. She stated that respondent had followed her outside and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">\u201chad a big glass of wine in his right hand, and he lunged at me with his left hand and he tried to get the phone out of my hand[.] * * * I was determined not to let go of that phone; and he grabbed my left hand and bent my hand backwards to try to force me to let go of it, and he knocked me backwards on the stairs. I didn\u2019t fall over, but I was afraid of falling over and I had to struggle between hanging onto the phone and not falling off the stairs onto the cement, where there was a pile of construction debris below [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">According to petitioner, when respondent \u201clunged\u201d at her, she was \u201cknocked around\u201d and \u201cscreamed at the top of [her] lungs * * * and that\u2019s when he let go of [her].\u201d Petitioner further testified that she had \u201cbruising on [her] forearm\u201d as a result of the incident. To corroborate her testimony, petitioner introduced into evidence a brief video of the incident that she had taken with her cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Respondent disputed petitioner\u2019s account of the incident. To impeach petitioner\u2019s testimony that he had bruised her forearm, respondent cross-examined her regarding a photograph taken on July 16, the day after the alleged abuse, which showed no apparent bruising. Respondent also testified to a different version of events. He recalled \u201ct [aking] the phone out of [petitioner\u2019s] hand\u201d during the July incident, but denied that there had been a struggle or that he had pushed petitioner. According to respondent, the only physical contact that occurred was when petitioner \u201crake[d] my arm with her fingernails, trying to get her phone back, and when she realized she couldn\u2019t get it back she started screaming \u2018Help\u2019 at the top of her lungs. * * * I was surprised and kind of scared by the volume * * * so I handed her her cell phone back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">At the conclusion of respondent\u2019s testimony, the trial court summarized the relevant aspects of the parties\u2019 evidence. The court recounted that petitioner first had testified that respondent \u201c\u2018physically attacked me, I had to fight for my safety.\u2019 Then there was the video, and then there was [respondent\u2019s] testimony that said, T snatched the phone out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>of her hand.\u2019\u201d Based on that evidence, the court found that respondent \u201csubjected [petitioner] to this offensive physical contact [and] placed her in fear[.]\u201d Upon concluding that \u201ca restraining order [was] appropriate for that action,\u201d the court entered an order upholding the <em>ex parte </em>restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Respondent now appeals that order and, as noted, raises three arguments in support of his contention that the court erred in entering the order. As a preliminary matter, we first address petitioner\u2019s contention that respondent failed to preserve his arguments before the trial court and that we therefore should not consider them. As petitioner correctly observes, generally, \u201c[n]o matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1). <em>See State v. Reynolds, </em>250 Or App 516, 519, 280 P3d 1046, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 666 (2012). To preserve an issue for appellate review, a litigant must raise the relevant issue below and provide an explanation of his or her position to the trial court. <em>State v. Liviu, </em>209 Or App 249, 252, 147 P3d 371 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 158 (2008). Preservation gives a trial court the chance to consider and rule on an argument, which may avoid an error altogether or correct one already made and obviate the need for an appeal. <em>Shields v. Campbell, </em>277 Or 71, 77, 559 P2d 1275 (1977). Preservation also ensures fairness to an opposing party by permitting that party to respond to a contention and not be taken by surprise. <em>Davis v. O\u2019Brien, </em>320 Or 729, 737, 891 P2d 1307 (1995). Accordingly, our jurisprudence has embraced the preservation requirement \u201cnot to promote form over substance but to promote an efficient administration of justice and the saving of judicial time.\u201d <em>Shields, </em>277 Or at 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">With those principles in mind, we conclude that respondent adequately raised and preserved his first argument, in which he asserts that the trial court\u2019s finding of abuse lacked sufficient evidentiary support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>her view that respondent did not preserve that argument for appeal, petitioner notes that respondent never objected to the court\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s conduct constituted abuse. Respondent does not dispute that point, nor does his briefing \u201cdemonstrate that the question or issue presented by [that] assignment of error timely and properly was raised and preserved\u201d in the trial court, ORAP 5.45(4)(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite that failing, however, we conclude that respondent\u2019s contention is preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">As noted, in response to the trial court\u2019s pre-hearing inquiry, respondent confirmed that his \u201cposition\u201d was that \u201cno abusive incident occurred.\u201d He proceeded to present evidence disputing petitioner\u2019s version of events, including her account of the alleged abuse in July 2015. Respondent thus notified petitioner that he contested the factual sufficiency of her abuse claim and alerted her to the fact that he would hold her to her burden of proof on that issue. <em>See Vanik-Burns v. Burns, </em>284 Or App 366, 370-71, 392 P3d 286 (2017) (petitioner must prove each element in ORS 107.718(1) to obtain a restraining order). Those same actions informed the court that respondent\u2019s contention was that he had not abused petitioner, a contention that the court directly addressed in its oral ruling. As a result, those actions fulfilled the purposes of the preservation requirement\u2014notably, fairness, notice to the opposing party, and efficient judicial administration\u2014and, accordingly, preserved respondent\u2019s contention for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Respondent did not, however, preserve his remaining arguments on appeal. As noted, respondent contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>that the trial court erred in failing to make express findings that petitioner was in imminent danger of further abuse and that respondent represented a credible threat to her safety. <em>See </em>ORS 107.718(1). As with his first argument, respondent\u2019s briefing does not comply with ORAP 5.45(4)(a). Petitioner argues that respondent did not preserve his assertion that the trial court was required to make those findings, because respondent in no way alerted petitioner or the court that he disputed those findings or that, in his view, the court was required to expressly make them. We agree with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">It bears repeating once again that, at the outset of the hearing, the trial court asked respondent if his position was that the abusive incident had not occurred, and respondent confirmed that understanding without elaboration. Additionally, over the course of the hearing, respondent presented no evidence or argument that would have signaled to petitioner or the court his contention that, even if the court found abuse, a restraining order was not warranted. <em>See Kelley v. Stutzman, </em>281 Or App 388, 391-92, 383 P3d 287 (2016) (a petitioner seeking a restraining order must present evidence to establish that the respondent\u2019s conduct created an imminent danger of further abuse and that the respondent was a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner); <em>see also Daley v. Daley, </em>280 Or App 448, 454, 380 P3d 1226 (2016) (the trial court erred in continuing the FAPA restraining order, because \u201cnone of the evidence presented in this case [wa] s sufficient to support a determination that respondent\u2019s conduct put petitioner at imminent risk of further abuse or credibly threatened her physical safety\u201d). And, at the conclusion of the hearing, when the court determined that respondent had \u201csubjected [petitioner] to this offensive physical contact, placed her in fear, and a restraining order [wa]s appropriate for that action,\u201d respondent did not argue that additional findings were required or that the evidence would not support those findings. As a result, the trial court was not afforded the opportunity to correct the alleged errors, nor was petitioner given the opportunity to address them. <em>See Davis, </em>320 Or at 737 (preservation rules ensure that a party clearly present arguments to the trial court and that the opposing party is not taken by surprise, misled, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>denied the opportunity to meet an argument). Accordingly, we do not address those arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Turning back to the issue respondent preserved before the trial court, we begin with the standard of review. As noted, respondent requests <em>de novo </em>review. Respondent\u2019s brief summarily asserts that <em>de novo </em>review is warranted, because, in his view, \u201cthe trial [court\u2019s] decision does not comport with express factual findings it made, or the uncontro-verted evidence on the salient issues.\u201d <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(d) (including those factors among considerations relevant to the exercise of <em>de novo </em>review). However, respondent does not provide a single example of \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d that is inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s decision, nor any explanation of how the trial court\u2019s express findings compelled a different outcome. Moreover, he offers no other basis on which to conclude that this is an exceptional case warranting <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (stating that we will exercise our discretion to undertake <em>de novo </em>review only in exceptional cases). Accordingly, we conclude that <em>de novo </em>review is not warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Respondent argues that, if we decline his request for <em>de novo </em>review, then we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s finding of abuse constituted an abuse of discretion. Petitioner counters that our review is limited to whether there is any evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding. We agree with petitioner. Thus, we constrain our review to whether any evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that abuse satisfying FAPA\u2019s criteria occurred. <em>See Patton v. Patton, </em>278 Or App 720, 721, 377 P3d 657 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Applying that standard here, we conclude that the evidentiary record readily supports the trial court\u2019s finding of abuse. In her <em>ex parte </em>petition, which the court considered without objection, petitioner stated that respondent \u201cphysically attacked\u201d her and that she was \u201cterrif[ied]\u201d as a result. Petitioner also testified, stating that respondent \u201clunged\u201d at her, \u201cgrabbed\u201d her hand and \u201cbent\u201d it backwards, and \u201cknocked\u201d her backwards on the stairs. She also testified that respondent\u2019s actions left her with a bruised forearm. That evidence supports the finding that abuse occurred. <em>See </em>ORS 107.705(1) (defining \u201cabuse\u201d as action causing physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>injury <em>or </em>placing a person in fear of imminent physical injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Respondent\u2019s contrary argument does not persuade us otherwise. It is true that respondent disputed petitioner\u2019s version of events. However, his arguments on appeal\u2014that petitioner\u2019s testimony was not \u201ccredible\u201d or sufficiently \u201cspecific\u201d\u2014are nothing more than a request that we reweigh the evidence. That we cannot do, given our standard of review. Thus, it is immaterial that, in respondent\u2019s view, petitioner\u2019s evidence was not persuasive or was contradicted by other evidence. It was the trial court\u2019s role to determine whose testimony was credible and what weight to give the parties\u2019 competing evidence. In finding that respondent subjected petitioner to offensive physical contact and placed her in fear, the trial court evidently did just that\u2014in favor of petitioner\u2019s account of the incident. There is evidence in the record to support the finding of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\"> ORS 107.718(1) authorizes a court to issue a restraining order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avg-dedup-0\">\u201c[u]pon a showing that the petitioner has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, that there is an imminent danger of further abuse to the petitioner and that the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner or the petitioner\u2019s child [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>In turn, ORS 107.705(1) defines \u201cabuse\u201d as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcO\">\u201cthe occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOO\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVV\">\u201c(b) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJV\">\u201c(c) Causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-6\"> Respondent\u2019s argument is not entirely clear and, at times, could be viewed as contending that the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the facts that it had found qualified as \u201cabuse\u201d under FAPA. Respondent\u2019s focus, however, appears to be on whether the evidentiary record supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings. Therefore, we proceed with the understanding that his argument is that the record does not support those findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-6\"> ORAP 5.45(4)(a) requires petitioner to \u201cspecify the stage in the proceedings when the question or issue * * * was raised in the lower court, the method or manner of raising it, and the way in which it was resolved\u201d and to \u201cset out pertinent quotations of the record where the question or issue was raised and the challenged ruling was made, together with reference to the pages of the transcript or other parts of the record quoted or to the excerpt of record.\u201d \u201cCompliance with ORAP 5.45 is not a matter of mere form; it is crucial to our ability to review trial court rulings for error and to determine whether the appellant\u2019s claims of error were preserved below.\u201d <em>Migis v. AutoZone, Inc., </em>282 Or App 774, 805, 387 P3d 381 (2016). Because compliance with ORAP 5.45(4)(a) often affects our ability to properly consider a case, we may decline to consider an argument where an appellant fails to follow its mandate. ORAP 5.45(4)(c); <em>see Migis, </em>282 Or App at 806. Here, however, our ability to review the first argument has not been impaired, and we exercise our discretion to review it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
