J.</author>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In 1993, at 15 years old, petitioner and his twin brother murdered an elderly couple.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner was waived into adult court and, based on a stipulated facts trial, was convicted of one count of aggravated murder, one count of murder, and one count of first-degree robbery. Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced petitioner to an indeterminate life sentence on the aggravated murder conviction, an 800-month term of imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the life sentence, on the murder conviction, and a 36-month term of imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the aggravated murder and murder sentences, on the first-degree robbery conviction. In 2013, following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller v. Alabama, 567 </em>US 460, 132 S Ct 2455, 183 L Ed 2d 407 (2012), petitioner filed a successive petition for post-conviction relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The superintendent filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the petition was successive and untimely and, therefore, \u201cbarred by both ORS 138.510(3) and ORS 138.550(3).\u201d The post-conviction court agreed and, accordingly, granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the petition. Petitioner appeals the resulting judgment and, on appeal, we conclude, as we did in <em>Kinkel v. Persson, </em>276 Or App 427, 367 P3d 956, <em>rev allowed, </em>359 Or 525 (2016), and <em>Curdo v. Premo, </em>284 Or App 698, 395 P3d 25 (2017), that the statutory rule against successive petitions bars petitioner from raising the grounds for relief set forth in his petition in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">As noted, based on acts committed when he was 15 years old, petitioner was convicted of aggravated murder, murder, and first-degree robbery. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment without opinion on direct appeal, and the Supreme Court denied review. <em>See State v. White, </em>139 Or App 136, 911 P2d 1287, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 691 (1996). In 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>petitioner sought post-conviction relief, requesting that the judgment of conviction be set aside and the sentences be vacated. Among other things, petitioner asserted that defense counsel was inadequate for failing to object to the sentence as \u201cillegal and unauthorized.\u201d He also claimed that \u201c[t]he trial court was in error for imposing a life sentence and 836 month[s] on petitioner!,] a remanded juvenile. The sentence violates the Eighth Amendment protection against Cruel and Unusual punishment.\u201d The post-conviction court denied relief and, on appeal from the post-conviction judgment, we, again, affirmed without opinion and the Supreme Court, again, denied review. <em>See White v. Thompson, </em>163 Or App 416, 991 P2d 63 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 607 (2000). Petitioner later filed a second unsuccessful petition for post-conviction relief. We summarily affirmed the judgment in that case, and the Supreme Court entered an order denying review.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">In 2012, the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision held a prison term hearing and issued an order establishing petitioner\u2019s prison term on the life sentence imposed for the aggravated murder conviction. <em>See State ex rel Engweiler v. Felton, </em>350 Or 592, 629, 260 P3d 448 (2011) (\u201c [Prisoners sentenced for aggravated murder are entitled to a parole hearing at which the board must either set a release date or explain why it has chosen not to do so.\u201d). As petitioner set out in his petition for post-conviction relief, the board \u201cset a prison term of 288 months on the conviction for Aggravated Murder.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Also in 2012, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Miller, </em>in which it held that \u201cthe Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.\u201d 567 US at 479, 132 S Ct at 2469. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201cMandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features\u2014among them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences. It prevents taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>into account the family and home environment that surrounds him\u2014and from which he cannot usually extricate himself\u2014no matter how brutal or dysfunctional. It neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him. *** And finally, this mandatory punishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation even when the circumstances most suggest it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 477, 132 S Ct at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In his petition in this case, petitioner claimed that he had been denied adequate assistance of trial counsel in a number of ways, including that counsel failed to \u201cobject to, as unconstitutionally disproportionate punishment, the imposition of the 800-month sentence on the Murder conviction that would likely greatly exceed the sentence on the more serious charge of Aggravated Murder,\u201d and failed to \u201cobject to the constitutionality of the 800-month sentence on the grounds that it constituted a <em>de facto </em>sentence of Life without the possibility of parole.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also asserted that he had received inadequate and ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel and was, therefore, deprived of the \u201cability to fully challenge the validity of his sentences in subsequent proceedings.\u201d Petitioner acknowledged that the petition was successive but noted that ORS 138.550 \u201callows for successive petitions when \u2018the court on hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted which could not reasonably have been raised in the initial or amended petition.\u2019\u201d He asserted that he could not reasonably have raised the ground for relief set forth in the petition prior to, among other things, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The superintendent filed a motion for summary judgment asserting, among other things, that the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>was time barred under ORS 138.510(3) and did not fall within the escape clause under that statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, the superintendent asserted that the grounds for relief in the petition either had been or could have been raised in the original petition for post-conviction relief and, therefore, the successive petition was barred under ORS 138.550(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The post-conviction court held a hearing on the motion and, ultimately, agreed with the superintendent that the petition was untimely and successive and that petitioner had \u201cnot demonstrated * * * that [any of his] allegations qualify for any escape clause.\u201d Accordingly, the court granted the superintendent\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">On appeal, in his first assignment of error, petitioner contends that the trial court erred when it denied him relief on his claim of inadequate and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In particular, he asserts that the 1995 judgment in his criminal case imposed a de facto life sentence without the possibility of release.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He asserts that he is entitled to relief because his sentences \u201cviolate the ban on cruel and unusual punishments in Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution, [and] * * * the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution,\u201d and the 800-month sentence for murder is \u201cdisproportionate to a life sentence with the possibility of release\u201d for aggravated murder. Furthermore, he contends that his late and successive petition for post-conviction relief satisfies the escape clauses in ORS 138.510 and ORS 138.550 because (1) he \u201ccould not reasonably have anticipated the rule from <em>Miller </em>and thus * * * could not have raised the grounds for relief here in a timely post-conviction proceeding\u201d and (2) he could not reasonably have raised his disproportionality challenge until after the board\u2019s 2012 order setting his prison term on the aggravated murder sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The superintendent responds, in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>that the petition is untimely and successive and that petitioner\u2019s claims are barred in light of ORS 138.510 and ORS 138.550. He also asserts that, even if petitioner\u2019s claims were not barred, they would nevertheless fail on the merits. Because it is dispositive, we address the question whether ORS 138.550 precludes petitioner from obtaining relief on the grounds raised in his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The state post-conviction relief act provides \u201cthat post-conviction petitions must be filed within two years after the challenged conviction becomes final, ORS 138.510(3), and it also bars successive petitions, ORS 138.550(3).\u201d <em>Verduzco v. State of Oregon, </em>357 Or 553, 561, 355 P3d 902 (2015). However, both of those procedural bars \u201ccontain identically worded \u2018escape clauses.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the escape clauses, \u201c[essentially, if [a] petitioner could not reasonably have raised the grounds for relief alleged in his [successive] petition either in a timely fashion or in the first petition, then those state procedural bars do not prevent petitioner from pursuing the grounds for relief alleged in his second post-conviction petition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In <em>Verduzco, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court interpreted and applied ORS 138.550. As the court explained, under ORS 138.550(2), if a petitioner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201chas appealed from a judgment of conviction and if the petitioner could have raised a ground for relief on direct appeal, then the petitioner cannot raise that ground for relief in a post-conviction petition \u2018unless such ground was not asserted and could not reasonably have been asserted in the direct appellate review proceeding.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 565 (quoting ORS 138.550(2)). Similarly, under ORS 138.550(3), \u201call grounds for relief must be raised in the original or amended petition for post-conviction relief unless the post-conviction court \u2018on hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted therein which could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting ORS 138.550(3)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201cThose two statutory provisions \u2018express a complete thought\u2019 and, read together, \u2018express the legislature\u2019s determination that, when a petitioner has appealed and also has filed a post-conviction petition, the petitioner must raise all grounds for relief that reasonably could be asserted.\u2019 A \u2018failure to do so will bar a petitioner from later raising an omitted ground for relief.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><em>Kinkel, </em>276 Or App at 440 (quoting <em>Verduzco, </em>357 Or at 565).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In <em>Verduzco, </em>the petitioner filed a successive petition for post-conviction relief, claiming that counsel in his underlying criminal proceeding had been ineffective for failing to advise him of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to distribution of a controlled substance. In an earlier unsuccessful post-conviction petition, the petitioner had alleged essentially the same grounds for relief. Thereafter, the United States Supreme Court had decided <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 US 356, 369, 130 S Ct 1473, 176 L Ed 2d 284 (2010), in which it held that, \u201cwhen the deportation consequence [of a conviction] is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear,\u201d and the failure to give such advice amounts to a violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In support of his successive petition, the petitioner contended that he could not have raised his current claims for relief until after the Court announced its decision in <em>Padilla. </em>Thus, he asserted, the change in the law brought his claims within the escape clauses in ORS 138.510 and ORS 138.550. <em>Verduzco, </em>357 Or at 561. The Oregon Supreme Court rejected that assertion, concluding that it need not decide whether the petitioner reasonably could have earlier raised his claims because the petitioner had, in fact, raised his constitutional claims in his earlier petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Id. </em>at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Because the petitioner had earlier raised those claims, the court concluded that he could not \u201cclaim that he could not reasonably have raised them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the court explained, \u201c[t]he escape clause does not preclude petitioner from relitigating only those grounds for relief that he was certain he could win when he filed his first post-conviction petition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201cIn other words, the fact that, in an earlier appeal or petition for post-conviction relief, a petitioner unsuccessfully raised a ground for relief that would have been successful under later case law does not bring a claim for relief within the escape clauses of ORS 138.550(2) and (3). On the contrary, the fact that a petitioner earlier raised the same ground for relief demonstrates that that ground for relief <em>could </em>reasonably have been raised on appeal or in a first petition for post-conviction relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><em>Kinkel, </em>276 Or App 442 (emphasis added); <em>see Hardin v. Popoff </em>279 Or App 290, 304 n 10, 379 P3d 593, <em>rev den, </em>360 Or 465 (2016) (\u201cOur analysis simply requires us to ask whether a claim could reasonably have been raised, not whether that claim could have been raised fruitfully.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">As noted, in this case, petitioner asserts, in part, that he is entitled to relief from the 1995 judgment because the sentence imposed, particularly, the 800-month murder sentence, is a de facto life sentence that constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and Article I, section 16. Furthermore, he asserts that he could not have raised that challenge earlier because <em>Miller </em>announced a new rule that he could not have reasonably anticipated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, with respect to this challenge to his sentence, as in <em>Verduzco, Kinkel, </em>and <em>Cunio, </em>petitioner cannot successfully assert that he could not have raised his claim earlier because he, in fact, earlier challenged his sentence on that basis. As discussed above, in his original petition for post-conviction relief, petitioner asserted that the sentences imposed on him in the 1995 judgment violated \u201cthe prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment secured by the Eighth Amendment [to] the United States Constitution.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>particular, he asserted that the \u201clife\u201d and \u201c836 month\u201d sentences imposed on him, \u201ca remanded juvenile,\u201d violated the \u201cEighth Amendment protection against Cruel and Unusual punishment.\u201d As in <em>Cunio, </em>having raised that claim in his original post-conviction petition, he cannot now assert that he could not have earlier challenged his sentence as violating the constitutional provision on cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Cunio, </em>284 Or App at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">As noted, petitioner also claims that the 800-month sentence for murder is vertically disproportionate to the sentence for aggravated murder, and asserts that he could not have raised that challenge before the parole board established a release date on his aggravated murder sentence in 2012, and, therefore, it falls within the escape clauses in ORS 138.510 and ORS 138.550. We are unpersuaded. As petitioner notes, his vertical proportionality challenge \u201cinvolves a comparison between the sentence for murder and the sentence for aggravated murder.\u201d However, his sentence on each conviction was set forth in the 1995 judgment in this case and those sentences have not changed in the years since they were imposed. Thus, a challenge based on the premise that the 800-month sentence for murder is vertically disproportionate to an indeterminate life sentence for aggravated murder could have been raised at that time. <em>See Cunio, </em>284 Or App at 706 n 7. Furthermore, to the extent that his challenge is based on the board\u2019s decision, as the state correctly notes, petitioner cannot challenge the board\u2019s decision in post-conviction relief. <em>See id.; see also </em>ORS 138.530(1);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ORS 138.540(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject petitioner\u2019s assertion that his vertical disproportionality challenge to his sentences could not have been raised earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">In a second assignment of error, petitioner asserts that the court erred when it denied relief on his claim of inadequate or ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel. In particular, he asserts that his procedural default should be excused based on the inadequacy of counsel in his original post-conviction proceeding. That is, he asserts that he \u201csatisfies the escape clauses in the [Post-Conviction Hearing Act] if he proves that his * * * counsel unreasonably failed to raise a ground for relief in a prior post-conviction proceeding.\u201d We reject that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">First, as we recently reiterated in <em>Cunningham v. Premo, </em>278 Or App 106, 124, 373 P3d 1167, <em>rev </em>den, 360 Or 422; 360 Or 751 (2016), <em>cert </em>den,_US_, 2017 WL 1040930 (Mar 20, 2017), \u201cthe adequacy of post-conviction counsel may not be challenged in a later post-conviction proceeding.\u201d Furthermore, in support of his argument, petitioner relies on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Martinez v. Ryan, </em>566 US 1, 17, 132 S Ct 1309, 182 L Ed 272 (2012), in which the Court held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201c[w]here, under state law, claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">However, as we explained in <em>Cunningham, </em>the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Martinez </em>\u201capplies narrowly to procedurally barred claims of ineffective trial counsel in federal habeas corpus petitions, where barred claims will only be reviewed upon demonstration of cause and prejudice for the procedural default, or that a failure to review the claim will result in the fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>278 Or App at 124. That is a very different standard than that set forth in ORS 138.550(3). Thus, in <em>Cunningham, </em>we \u201cdecline [d] to extend the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Martinez </em>to post-conviction claims that are barred as successive, and conclude [d] that petitioner may not avail himself of the escape clause based on his claim that former post-conviction counsel was inadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124-25. Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s contention that he can satisfy the escape clauses based on his claim that his former post-conviction counsel was inadequate is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In sum, the post-conviction court did not err in granting the superintendent\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing petitioner\u2019s claims as improperly successive pursuant to ORS 138.550(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\"> As petitioner notes in his brief, petitioner and his brother, Laycelle, received similar convictions and sentences. Laycelle\u2019s appeal from a post-conviction judgment is currently pending in <em>White v. Premo, </em>A154420.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> Petitioner filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for post-conviction relief in December 2011 and then, in February 2013, filed an amended petition through counsel in which he relied on <em>Miller.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> As petitioner notes in his brief, his projected release date on the aggravated murder sentence is 2018 and, at time the brief was filed, his expected release date on the 800-month sentence was June 3, 2051.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> In his petition, petitioner also stated several other ways in which, in his view, his criminal trial counsel had been inadequate. For example, he claimed counsel had failed to investigate or articulate \u201cany sentencing facts in mitigation\u201d and failed to object to the imposition of an upward departure sentence on the ground that the court \u201cfailed to articulate findings supporting application of aggravating factors to support such a departure.\u201d He does not specifically discuss those claims on appeal, nor does he articulate any reason that those claims could not have been raised in his original post-conviction petition. Accordingly, we do not understand him to challenge the post-conviction court\u2019s dismissal of those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-4\"> ORS 138.510(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201cA petition pursuant to ORS 138.510 to 138.680 must be filed within two years of the following, unless the court upon hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted which could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201c(a) If no appeal is taken, the date the judgment or order on the conviction was entered in the register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">\u201c(b) If an appeal is taken, the date the appeal is final in the Oregon appellate courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201c(c) If a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court is filed, the later of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">\u201c(A) The date of denial of certiorari, if the petition is denied; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">\u201c(B) The date of entry of a final state court judgment following remand from the United States Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b595-11\"> ORS 138.550 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">\u201cThe effect of prior judicial proceeding concerning the conviction of petitioner which is challenged in the petition shall be as specified in this section and not otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">\u201c(1) The failure of petitioner to have sought appellate review of the conviction, or to have raised matters alleged in the petition at the trial of the petitioner, shall not affect the availability of relief under ORS 138.510 to 138.680.

If petitioner was not represented by counsel in the direct appellate review proceeding, due to lack of funds to retain such counsel and the failure of the court to appoint counsel for that proceeding, any ground for relief under ORS 138.510 to 138.680 which was not specifically decided by the appellate court may be asserted in the first petition for relief under ORS 138.510 to 680, unless otherwise provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-15\">\u201c(3) All grounds for relief claimed by petitioner in a petition pursuant to ORS 138.510 to 138.680 must be asserted in the original or amended petition, and any grounds not so asserted are deemed waived unless the court on hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted therein which could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition. However, any prior petition or amended petition which was withdrawn prior to the entry of judgment by leave of court, as provided in ORS 138.610, shall have no effect on petitioner\u2019s right to bring a subsequent petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b596-5\"> Petitioner points out that, when he was sentenced, his earliest release date would not have been until he was in his 80s. As noted, he also states that, at the time he filed his brief, his release date from the 800-month sentence was June 3, 2051, when he would be in his early 70s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\"> As noted, petitioner claims in this case that trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective. That claim is irreconcilable with his assertion that his claims fall within the escape clauses of ORS 138.510 and ORS 138.550. As we explained in <em>Lutz v. Hill, </em>205 Or App 252, 256, 134 P3d 1003, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 140 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201c[T]he factual premise of petitioner\u2019s invocation of the \u2018escape clauses\u2019 in ORS 138.510(3) and ORS 138.550(3), <em>viz., </em>that his present claim\u2018could not reasonably have been raised\u2019 before [new Supreme Court case law], is irreconcilable with the factual premise of his claim of inadequate assistance of counsel, <em>viz., </em>that, as of [the time of his trial], reasonable criminal defense counsel would have anticipated [that development of the law] and raised a * * * challenge [based on that expected development of the law]. Although it <em>may </em>be abstractly possible, in some case, that an otherwise time-barred claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>of inadequate assistance of counsel could be cognizable under the \u2018escape clauses,\u2019 this is not such a case.

As we recognized in both of those cases, in <em>Montgomery v. </em>Louisiana,_ US_,_, 136 S Ct 718, 732, 193 L Ed 2d 599 (2016), the Court explained that <em>\u201cMiller </em>announced a substantive rule that is retroactive in cases on collateral review.\u201d As we explained in <em>Kinkel, </em>however, we \u201cdo not interpret <em>Montgomery </em>to preclude operation of ORS 138.510(3) or ORS 138.550(2) and (3).\u201d 276 Or App at 438 n 6. \u201cIn other words, whether petitioner would be entitled to relief on the merits if his petition were permitted under the statutes does not affect our consideration, in the first instance, of whether petitioner\u2019s successive petition is procedurally barred by ORS 138.550.\u201d <em>Cunio, </em>284 Or App at 706 n 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b600-5\"> As in <em>Cunio, </em>petitioner\u2019s argument that the sentence in this case is cruel and unusual under Article I, section 16, are based on Eighth Amendment arguments. He relies on <em>Miller </em>in support of his position and essentially argues that, because the sentences are cruel and unusual for Eighth Amendment purposes, they violate Article I, section 16, as well. \u201cIn light of petitioner\u2019s earlier challenges to his sentence, his Article I, section 16, claim\u201d that the sentence is cruel and unusual, which is based on his Eighth Amendment claim, \u201ccould have also been raised earlier\u201d and does \u201cnot fall within the statutory escape clause.\u201d <em>Cunio, </em>284 Or App at 710 n 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b600-6\"> Under ORS 138.530(1), post-conviction relief is to be granted when a petitioner establishes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201c(a) A substantial denial in the proceedings resulting in petitioner\u2019s conviction, or in the appellate review thereof, of petitioner\u2019s rights under the Constitution of the United States, or under the Constitution of the State of Oregon, or both, and which denial rendered the conviction void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201c(b) Lack of jurisdiction of the court to impose the judgment rendered upon petitioner\u2019s conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">\u201c(c) Sentence in excess of, or otherwise not in accordance with, the sentence authorized by law for the crime of which petitioner was convicted; or unconstitutionality of such sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">\u201c(d) Unconstitutionality of the statute making criminal the acts for which petitioner was convicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b601-12\"> Under ORS 138.540(2),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">\u201c[w]hen a person restrained by virtue of a judgment upon a conviction of a crime asserts the illegality of the restraint upon grounds other than the unlawfulness of such judgment or the proceedings upon which it is based or in the appellate review thereof, relief shall not be available [under the post-conviction relief statutes] but shall be sought by habeas corpus or other remedies, if any, as otherwise provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
