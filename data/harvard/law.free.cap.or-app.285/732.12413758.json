The board adopted the determination of the administrative law judge (ALJ) that claimant\u2019s undisputed disc pathology of the thoracic spine was a degenerative disc \u201cbulges\u201d condition that is not \u201cequivalent\u201d to disc \u201cprotrusions,\u201d and that claimant, therefore, failed to prove the existence of the claimed condition. Claimant argues that the board erred in relying on the diagnosis for the bulge condition as the basis for upholding employer\u2019s denials. We conclude, however, that the board found as a factual matter that the diagnoses describe distinct conditions and that the \u201cdisc bulge\u201d condition from which claimant suffers is not encompassed within the scope of her claim for a new or omitted condition of \u201cdisc protrusions.\u201d We also conclude that those findings are supported by substantial evidence and, accordingly, affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The historical facts are not in dispute and are taken from the board\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Claimant has been employed by Fred Meyer (employer) for more than 13 years as a bakery manager. In 2001, employer accepted a claim for a nondis-abling thoracic strain. Claimant sporadically sought treatment for thoracic pain over the next decade, but, just before the 2012 injury incident, claimant\u2019s back was \u201cfine.\u201d The compensable injury at issue here arose from lifting incidents on the day before Thanksgiving, 2012. First, claimant was stacking items when she felt a sharp pain in her mid-back. Then, later that day, claimant was lifting cases of pumpkin pies when she felt upper thoracic symptoms. Employer accepted the claim for a disabling thoracic strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Three months after the injury, claimant\u2019s treating doctor, Bolstad, ordered a thoracic MRI that showed what the radiologist described as \u201cdisc protrusions\u201d at three of claimant\u2019s thoracic discs: \u201cmild\u201d and \u201cslight\u201d protrusions at T6-7 and T8-9, and a \u201cmoderate\u201d protrusion at T7-8. Claimant submitted a claim for a \u201cnew or omitted medical condition\u201d of \u201cT-6 disc protrusion [and] T-7-8 disc protrusion with cord compression [and] T-8-9 disc protrusion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Employer denied the claim, and claimant requested a hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ALJ upheld employer\u2019s denial on the ground that claimant had not proven the existence of the claimed new or omitted condition of disc \u201cprotrusions,\u201d and the board adopted and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\">The evidence at the hearing included the opinions of four doctors who commented on the nature of claimant\u2019s thoracic disc condition. Because the wording of those opinions forms the basis for the parties\u2019 dispute, we quote extensively from those opinions where pertinent. Arbeene, whose opinion the board primarily relied upon, is an orthopedic surgeon who examined claimant at employer\u2019s request. He reviewed the MRI image and described it as showing \u201cmultilevel degenerative disc disease changes in the mid thoracic disc spaces.\u201d He concluded that claimant\u2019s \u201cdisc abnormalities\u201d were likely caused by non-work-related degenerative processes. Later, Arbeene agreed with a summary of his opinion that had been prepared by employer\u2019s lawyer. He confirmed that, in his opinion, claimant had \u201ca long history of thoracic spine symptoms\u201d and \u201cmultilevel thoracic spondylosis and degenerative disc disease.\u201d He agreed that the conditions had developed gradually over time and were unrelated \u201cto a specific identifiable event or injury.\u201d Arbeene did not object, however, to the attorney\u2019s use of \u201cdisc protrusions\u201d throughout the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>In deposition testimony, Arbeene articulated the distinction that is now at the center of this case. He testified that the \u201cmore appropriate diagnosis and the more accurate diagnosis is multilevel thoracic spondylosis,\u201d by which he meant \u201cthe presence of disc bulging, not disc protrusions.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He acknowledged that \u201cif you ask five different doctors what they mean by \u2018disc bulging\u2019 versus \u2018disc protrusions,\u2019 you might get five different answers.\u201d In Arbeene\u2019s opinion, however, the two terms refer to separate conditions that differ both in appearance and etiology. A disc bulge is \u201cvery broad based *** whereas in a protrusion the height of the disc bulge or abnormality is basically equal to the base of the disc bulge.\u201d A bulge, which Arbeene equated with thoracic spon-dylosis or general disc disease, arises as a degenerative process, while a protrusion occurs traumatically. He explained that claimant\u2019s kyphoscoliosis, or improper curvature of the spine, causes compression on her vertebrae and discs at the T6 through T9 levels, \u201cso she has a good anatomic explanation for this multilevel spondylosis or disc-degeneration at those three thoracic levels.\u201d Thus, \u201cthe major cause for the disc bulges is the degenerative process resulting from her kyphoscoliosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\">Rokosz, a neurosurgeon with whom claimant consulted shortly after the MRI, reported that the MRI shows \u201cvery mild disc degeneration\u201d with a \u201cslight bulge\u201d at T8 and a \u201cbulge\u201d at T7-8. He \u201cexplained to the patient that it can be very difficult to know where someone\u2019s pain is coming from, especially in the thoracic spine,\u201d and he recommended \u201cchiropractic evaluation as they are quite adept at evaluating and treating rib abnormalities,\u201d which he believed to be partly causing claimant\u2019s pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The other two doctors used the terms \u201cbulge\u201d and \u201cprotrusion\u201d interchangeably. They also recognized that claimant has degenerative changes in the thoracic spine yet described her condition as work related. Bolstad opined that, in addition to Arbeene\u2019s diagnoses of thoracic strain and spondylosis, she would add \u201c[m]ild central disc protrusion at T6-7 with mild cord compression, moderate right paracentral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>disc protrusion T7-8 with moderate cord compression and right paracentral disc protrusion T8-9.\u201d She also wrote that an MRI of claimant\u2019s spine from 2008 showed \u201cmild degenerative change with disc space narrowing at T6-7 and T7-8\u201d with \u201c[m]inimal posterior disc bulge.\u201d In later reports, Bolstad opined that claimant\u2019s current condition was due to \u201cdisc protrusions\u201d and that claimant\u2019s injury \u201cis the major contributing cause for her need for treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Russo, a pain specialist, reported that the MRI showed \u201cdisc protrusion at T6-7, T7-8, and T8-9.\u201d After examining claimant, Russo diagnosed \u201c[tjhoracic spondylo-sis [with] multilevel disc bulges at T7-8, T8-9.\u201d Russo later wrote that claimant had \u201cdisc bulges/protrusions\u201d at \u201cthese levels\u201d and that she had \u201cmulti-disc disease,\u201d but that her \u201cpain, spasm, and symptom interference is in excess of what would be expected [from] solely a pre-existing degenerative process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The ALJ concluded that Arbeene\u2019s opinion was \u201cthe most detailed, well reasoned and persuasive on the threshold issue of the \u2018existence\u2019 of the claimed disc protrusion conditions.\u201d The ALJ explained that, although Bolstad and Russo had diagnosed \u201cprotrusions,\u201d or \u201cbulges/ protrusions,\u201d and had at times used the terms interchangeably, Arbeene had explained the physical details that characterize different types of disc abnormalities. The ALJ emphasized that Rokosz had described claimant\u2019s condition as \u201cbulges,\u201d and the ALJ discounted Russo\u2019s opinion due to his unexplained shift in diagnosis from \u201cbulges\u201d to \u201cbulges/ protrusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">On appeal to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, in addition to adopting the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding the existence of the claimed \u201cdisc protrusions\u201d condition, the board explained that it was persuaded by \u201cthe well-reasoned opinion of Dr. Arbeene\u201d because he \u201chad a complete and accurate history of claimant\u2019s condition, including thoracic symptoms that preexisted the compensa-ble injury,\u201d and had \u201cengaged in a thorough weighing of the potential causes of the claimed conditions.\u201d By contrast, the board viewed Russo\u2019s and Bolstad\u2019s reports as \u201cnot demonstrating] the same level of awareness of the preexisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>symptoms\u201d and not \u201cas well-reasoned and explained\u201d as Arbeene\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">On judicial review, claimant contends that the board \u201cerred in distinguishing between the terms disc \u2018protrusion\u2019 and disc \u2018bulge.\u2019\u201d Relying on cases in which we have rejected the need for \u201cmagic words\u201d to prove the compensa-bility of workers\u2019 compensation claims, claimant argues that she proved that she suffers from a thoracic disc condition that was not part of the original acceptance and that she did not need to prove a specific name or diagnosis for that condition in order to prove that it is a new or omitted condition. Employer responds that the difference between the diagnosis of disc bulges and the diagnosis of disc protrusions is not just a matter of labeling claimant\u2019s condition but is, instead, a factual distinction that determines whether claimant suffers from the condition for which she claimed compensation. Both parties are correct to an extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Claimant is correct that, for a new or omitted condition claim, ORS 656.262(7)(a) and ORS 656.267 require the claimant to give notice of conditions for which compensation is sought but \u201cdo not require notice of <em>diagnoses\u201d Labor Ready v. Mogensen, </em>275 Or App 491, 498, 365 P3d 623 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>360 Or 235 (2016) (emphasis in original). However, whether a condition is encompassed within the scope of the new or omitted condition claim is a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 497. Moreover, whatever the diagnosis, the claimant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a claimed new or omitted condition exists, and proving the existence of new symptoms is not enough. <em>De Los-Santos v. Si Pac Enterprises, Inc., </em>278 Or App 254, 258, 373 P3d 1274, <em>rev den, </em>360 Or 422 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Our decisions in <em>De Los-Santos </em>and <em>Labor Ready </em>provide useful guidance for our review of the board\u2019s order in this case. The claimant in <em>De Los-Santos </em>had an accepted claim for a back strain and then filed a new or omitted condition claim for \u201cradiculopathy/radiculitis,\u201d which the employer denied. 278 Or App at 255-56. The board found that the claimant had failed to prove that the claimed condition existed, and the claimant argued that the board\u2019s conclusion was contrary to our cases that have allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>claimants to prove an initial compensable injury by proving only work-related <em>symptoms. Id. </em>at 258; <em>see, e.g., Horizon Air Industries, Inc. v. Davis-Warren, </em>266 Or App 388, 392, 337 P3d 959 (2014) (affirming board decision that claimant could prove compensable injury without proving that work exposure \u201cresulted in a specifically diagnosable medical condition\u201d). On review in <em>De Los-Santos, </em>we emphasized that the rule is different when the claim is for a new or omitted condition. 278 Or App at 258. We also emphasized that we did \u201cnot understand the board\u2019s holding that a claimant must prove the existence of a claimed new or omitted condition to encompass a holding that the claimant must do so through evidence of a specific diagnosis.\u201d Rather, the board properly required the claimant \u201cto prove the existence of the new or omitted condition that she asserts should be accepted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The claimant in <em>Labor Ready </em>filed a new or omitted condition claim for \u201ccomplex regional pain syndrome\u201d (CRPS I) based on continuing pain in his finger, part of which had been severed in a previously accepted workplace injury. 275 Or App at 492. The employer denied the claim, and, after subsequent examinations, the parties agreed that the correct diagnosis for the claimant\u2019s condition was \u201cCRPS II,\u201d which involved nerve damage, unlike CRPS I. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94. The employer argued to the board that it \u201clacked authority to address the compensability of CRPS II\u201d because that condition was encompassed by neither the claim itself nor the employer\u2019s denial. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95. The board disagreed, concluding that the original claim for \u201ccomplex regional pain syndrome\u201d was broad enough to encompass the claimant\u2019s eventual diagnosis of CRPS II. <em>Id. </em>at 495-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">On review, we affirmed the board. We explained that the scope of a claim and of a denial is a factual determination reviewable for substantial evidence, and that the board\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 497-98. We noted specifically that \u201ca reasonable interpretation of the medical record is that CRPS II is a form of \u2018complex regional pain syndrome,\u201d\u2019 and we concluded that, on the record presented, \u201cthe board could find that the source of claimant\u2019s symptoms, ultimately diagnosed as CRPS II, is the same condition for which claimant originally sought acceptance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>We affirm the board here for essentially the same reasons that we affirmed the board decisions in <em>Labor Ready </em>and <em>De Los-Santos. </em>Here, the board\u2019s conclusion turns on its finding that claimant suffers from the condition of \u201cdisc bulges,\u201d which is a degenerative condition and is not \u201cequivalent\u201d to the condition of \u201cdisc protrusions.\u201d Given the board\u2019s express finding that the disc conditions are not \u201cequivalent,\u201d we reject claimant\u2019s contention that the board improperly focused on magic words, or required claimant to prove a specific diagnosis for her disc pathology, when it upheld the denials. <em>Cf. Freightliner Corp. v. Arnold, </em>142 Or App 98, 105, 919 P2d 1192 (1996) (\u201cAn expert\u2019s testimony need not be ignored merely because it fails to include \u2018magic words\u2019 such as \u2018major contributing cause.\u2019\u201d). Rather, we understand the board to have held as a factual matter that claimant had failed \u201cto prove the existence of the new or omitted condition that she asserts should be accepted.\u201d <em>De Los-Santos, </em>278 Or App at 258. Conversely, the board found as a factual matter that the disc condition that does exist is beyond the scope of the claim for acceptance of a new or omitted condition. <em>Cf. Labor Ready, </em>275 Or App at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">We review those findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence, which means that \u201cthe record, viewed as a whole, permits a reasonable person to find as the board did, in the light of supporting and contrary evidence.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Williams, </em>281 Or App 542, 543, 381 P3d 955 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, in reviewing the board\u2019s \u201cevaluation of expert opinions, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the board; rather, we determine whether the board\u2019s evaluation of that evidence was reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548 (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying that standard, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The board primarily relied on the opinion of Arbeene to support its findings that a condition of disc \u201cbulges\u201d is distinct from a condition of disc \u201cprotrusions,\u201d and that claimant suffers from disc \u201cbulges,\u201d not \u201cprotrusions.\u201d The board\u2019s findings are a reasonable interpretation of the medical evidence. Although Arbeene was the only doctor to make the distinction, the board accepted his opinion because he persuasively explained that bulges describe a degenerative disc pathology while protrusions describe a pathology that occurs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>traumatically, because he gave the most detailed explanation of claimant\u2019s spinal pathology, and because he discussed a more complete history of claimant\u2019s symptoms. Arbeene\u2019s acknowledgement that some doctors use the terms \u201cbulge\u201d and \u201cprotrusion\u201d interchangeably does not undermine the board\u2019s ability to rely on Arbeene\u2019s opinion that the conditions are distinct. <em>See SAIF v. Walker, </em>260 Or App 327, 338, 317 P3d 384 (2013) (\u201cIn a case involving conflicting medical evidence, we will reverse the board only when the credible evidence apparently weighs overwhelmingly in favor of one finding and the [b]oard finds the other without giving a persuasive explanation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). Thus, the board could find that claimant had failed to prove the existence of a condition for which she sought compensation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See De Los-Santos, </em>278 Or App at 258 (although a claimant need not prove a specific diagnosis, a claimant is \u201crequired to prove the existence of the new or omitted condition that she claims should be accepted\u201d); <em>cf. Labor Ready, </em>275 Or App at 499 (affirming the board\u2019s factual determination that the ultimately diagnosed condition was the same as the claimed condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\"> Given our affirmance of the board\u2019s decision that claimant did not prove the existence of the claimed condition, we do not reach claimant\u2019s challenge to an alternative holding of the board that, \u201c [e]ven assuming that claimant established the existence of the claimed conditions,\u201d she did not prove that the conditions were compensable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> Because the hoard adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings, we refer to all findings as those of the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-4\"> Neither party addresses whether the claim was for a \u201cnew\u201d condition or for an \u201comitted\u201d condition, nor does either party argue that the distinction would affect our analysis in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-5\"> Employer later amended its denial of the protrusions claim to clarify that it was denying that the condition was compensable under an occupational disease theory as well as under an injury theory.
