For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, \u201c[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact, making reasonable inferences, could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Defendant was incarcerated pending prosecution on a burglary charge. Defendant became cellmates with another inmate, Crowley. Defendant told Crowley that defendant \u201cwanted his witnesses [to his burglary case] to not show up to trial,\u201d and that \u201che wanted people dead.\u201d Specifically, defendant mentioned his father-in-law, brother-in-law, and the Wasco County District Attorney. Defendant asked Crowley whether Crowley knew of anyone who had killed a person before. Crowley responded, \u201cYeah, I have. I mean, I\u2019ve been to prison. I mean, I know people that have killed people.\u201d Defendant asked whether Crowley \u201ccould have somebody killed\u201d and Crowley responded affirmatively. In fact, Crowley did not know of such a person. After hearing that Crowley \u201cmight know somebody that could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>do something,\u201d defendant began \u201cwriting stuff,\u201d including writing people\u2019s names. Within hours, Crowley sent several inmate request forms to jail staff, asking to speak to detectives because \u201csomeone could get hurt.\u201d Sergeant Birchfield visited Crowley, and Crowley told Birchfield what defendant had said.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">When Crowley returned to his cell, defendant was writing a letter. According to Crowley, defendant \u201cwrote out a couple letters, and he wanted to get it perfect. His detail about it had to be perfect.\u201d When defendant finished writing the letter, he gave it to Crowley to read, then put the letter in an envelope, placed it underneath his mattress, and asked Crowley if he was a cop. The next morning, defendant gave Crowley the envelope. Defendant believed that Crowley would \u201cput [the envelope in Crowley\u2019s personal] property\u201d and release it to someone outside the prison \u201cso that a hit man could get it for [defendant] and take care of what he wanted [taken] care of.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The envelope contained a map of defendant\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s house and a letter stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">\u201cDear stranger,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">\u201cI have a job for you.

DA-Your choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201cHow I would like it to look.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">(Underscoring in original.) After giving Crowley the envelope with the letter, defendant repeatedly asked Crowley, \u201cAre they coming yet? Are they coming yet? Is he going to do it yet? Why ain\u2019t this done yet?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Shortly thereafter, defendant and Crowley were placed in separate isolation cells across the hall from one another. Defendant and Crowley exchanged handwritten notes by using strings to fling cylinder-shaped papers into one another\u2019s cells. Defendant wrote, \u201cAny idea when dude is coming man? I decided I\u2019m not going to let DA tear me and my family up.\u201d Crowley responded, \u201cI\u2019ll give you his name [when] I get it then you can go to visit and give him the hit that way [you\u2019re] face to face with the killer and he can talk to you and say what[\u2019]s up.\u201d Defendant wrote, \u201cOk that sounds good to me. Just got [to] let me know the day [and the] name so I can put the person on my visitors list.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">In another exchange, Crowley asked defendant whether defendant still wanted the district attorney killed even though the district attorney has a family. Defendant responded, \u201cHell yeah, I can deal with it. Remember toes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>pointing up to the clouds.\u201d Crowley saved the notes that he received from defendant and gave them to jail staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Defendant was charged with four counts of attempted aggravated murder, three counts of attempted murder, four counts of solicitation of aggravated murder, three counts of solicitation of murder, and two counts of tampering with a witness. Defendant tried his case to the court. After the state rested, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal as to the four counts of attempted aggravated murder, three counts of attempted murder, and two counts of tampering with a witness. Defendant argued that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that defendant engaged in conduct constituting a substantial step towards the commission of the charged crimes, as required by ORS 161.405. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal and found defendant guilty of the attempted aggravated murder, attempted murder, and tampering with a witness counts. As to the solicitation counts, the trial court found defendant guilty of attempted solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the counts of attempted aggravated murder, attempted murder, and tampering with a witness. Defendant renews his argument that he did not take a substantial step toward the commission of the crimes of aggravated murder, murder, and tampering with a witness. According to defendant, he \u201cdid not meet with a purported \u2018hit man,\u2019 he did not engage in detailed planning, and he did not pay money or arrange to pay money,\u201d and therefore his conduct was insufficient to satisfy the substantial step element of his attempt convictions and his convictions for tampering with a witness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant contends that \u201c [h] is desire to meet with someone to make a plan is not a plan in itself, much less a substantial step toward the commission of the objective.\u201d In response, the state argues that defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cmore than enough to amount to a substantial step.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>As noted above, our task is to determine \u201cwhether a rational trier of fact, making reasonable inferences, could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>327 Or at 570. We begin with the text of ORS 161.405(1), which provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when the person intentionally engages in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the crime.\u201d In <em>State v. Walters, </em>311 Or 80, 85, 804 P2d 1164, <em>cert den, </em>501 US 1209 (1991), the Supreme Court observed that \u201cORS 161.405 codifies the Model Penal Code\u2019s \u2018substantial step\u2019 test for distinguishing acts of preparation from an attempt.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">To constitute a substantial step, a \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct must (1) advance the criminal purpose charged and (2) provide some verification of the existence of that purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnder that standard, an attempt *** must be established by conduct that is corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.\u201d <em>State v. Carlton, </em>361 Or 29, 45, 388 P3d 1093 (2017). \u201c[T]he same conduct may constitute a substantial step toward the commission of more than one charged crime, as long as that conduct strongly corroborates the actor\u2019s criminal purpose underlying each charged crime.\u201d <em>Walters, </em>311 Or at 86 n 9. There is no special rule regarding whether a solicitation is also an attempt: \u201c[U]nder Oregon law, \u2018[s]olicitation *** qualifies as a \u201csubstantial step\u201d if, under the facts, the defendant\u2019s actions exceed mere preparation, advance the criminal purpose charged, and provide some verification of the existence of that purpose.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Badillo, </em>260 Or App 218, 223, 317 P3d 315 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>202 Or App 478, 489, 123 P3d 304 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 158 (2006) (second brackets in <em>Badillo)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, we conclude that a reasonable factfinder could determine that defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a substantial step toward the commission of the murders of his father-in-law, brother-in-law, and the Wasco County District Attorney. As recounted above, defendant told Crowley that he \u201cwanted people dead,\u201d specifically mentioning his father-in-law, brother-in-law, and the Wasco County District Attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Defendant then asked Crowley whether Crowley \u201ccould have somebody killed.\u201d When Crowley answered in the affirmative, defendant carefully composed a letter to an unknown \u201chit man\u201d that set out the details of his intended murders. Then, defendant gave the letter to Crowley for the purpose of delivering it to the purported hit man. Finally, defendant inquired of Crowley why the murders were not \u201cdone yet.\u201d As the trial court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201cWith regard to advancing the purpose, it\u2019s very clear from the content of the letter that the Defendant gave great consideration to the details of the offenses. And had he just sat around and thought about that, * * * we\u2019d have no offense here. But he did the next step of writing it all down. And then he went beyond that, delivering it to a third person with the intent that it be carried out, believing that that third person had a relationship with individuals that could carry it out. And he actively inquired about the progress of the events related to his letter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention that his \u201cdesire to meet with someone to make a plan is not a plan in itself,\u201d mischar-acterizes the evidence. Indeed, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, the evidence shows that defendant advanced his criminal purpose by seeking out a hit man, and writing and delivering the letter to Crowley, with the intention that Crowley deliver the letter to the hit man; as a result, defendant believed that the letter alone would result in the murders of his father-in-law, brother-in-law, and the district attorney. As the trial court noted, defendant\u2019s letter provided detail with regards to whom he wanted killed, how be wanted them killed, and how the hit man would be compensated, and after delivering the letter to Crowley, defendant repeatedly asked why the murders had not taken place. To explain why the murders were not committed promptly, Crowley later told defendant that the hit man would visit defendant to finalize the details of the murders. Before that point, however, a trier of fact could find that defendant believed that the letter alone would cause the hit man to commit the murders; indeed, defendant\u2019s actions exceeded mere preparation because defendant had done all that he could have done under the circumstances to cause the murders of his intended victims. <em>See State v. Taylor, </em>47 Or 455, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>459, 84 P 82 (1906) (holding that the defendant\u2019s actions exceeded mere preparation for purposes of attempt where \u201che had * * * done all that he was expected to do, and his felonious design and action was then just as complete as if the crime had been consummated\u201d and that \u201cfailure to commit the crime was not due to any act of [the defendant], but to the insufficiency of the agencies employed for carrying out his criminal design\u201d). Thus, defendant\u2019s actions advanced his criminal purpose in having his father-in-law, brother-in-law, and the district attorney murdered. Moreover, a reasonable factfinder could also conclude that that same evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct verified his criminal purpose. In that way, defendant\u2019s conduct was corroborative of his criminal purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The facts in this case are similar to the circumstances in <em>Johnson. </em>In that case, the defendant solicited a woman he met in a public Internet chat room to kill his wife and daughter. 202 Or App at 481. The defendant reaffirmed his desire during \u201cat least one\u201d telephone conversation with the woman. <em>Id. </em>at 482. The defendant \u201cdescribed his house plan and mentioned that the sliding glass doorway to his wife\u2019s bedroom was not lockable. Further, he stated that it would be easy to continue down a hallway to shoot his daughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA quid pro quo was discussed; once the plan was completed, [the] defendant stated, [the woman] would \u2018never want for anything.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the woman informed the police of the defendant\u2019s conversation with her, and the defendant was convicted of various counts of attempted aggravated murder, attempted murder, solicitation to commit murder, and solicitation to commit aggravated murder. <em>Id. </em>at 482-83. On appeal, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a \u201csubstantial step\u201d for the purposes of proving attempt because \u201cample evidence would permit a finding that [the] defendant solicited [the woman] to kill his wife and daughter. That solicitation, it could be concluded, served to advance defendant\u2019s criminal purpose\u2014murdering his wife and daughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Here, defendant\u2019s conduct was similar to the defendant\u2019s conduct in <em>Johnson. </em>It is immaterial that, there, the defendant successfully solicited the woman to kill his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>and daughter, whereas here, defendant\u2019s attempt to solicit the hit man failed because the hit man did not exist. As defendant concedes, for purposes of attempt, it is not necessary that conduct constituting a substantial step actually be capable of causing the crime. <em>See </em>ORS 161.425 (\u201cIn a prosecution for an attempt, it is no defense that it was impossible to commit the crime which was the object of the attempt where the conduct engaged in by the actor would be a crime if the circumstances were as the actor believed them to be.\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant took a substantial step toward the crimes of attempted aggravated murder and attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Similarly, as to the two counts of witness tampering, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a substantial step toward the commission of tampering with the witnesses to his burglary case. Defendant initially told Crowley that he \u201cwanted his witnesses [to his burglary case] to not show up to trial.\u201d In his letter to the hit man, defendant wrote that he wanted the two witnesses threatened. Following his instruction to threaten the witnesses, defendant included both of the witness\u2019s names, addresses, telephone numbers, and dates of birth. As previously mentioned, the letter also contained information on how the hit man would be paid with the personal property stolen from defendant\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s home. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct in instructing the purported hit man to threaten the two witnesses, with the inclusion of specific identifying information about each of the witnesses, and a method of payment, both advanced and provided verification of his criminal purpose; in that way, defendant\u2019s conduct was corroborative of his criminal purpose. Thus, the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant took a substantial step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>toward inducing the witnesses to offer false testimony or withhold testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Accordingly, because a reasonable factfinder could conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a substantial step toward the commission of aggravated murder, murder, and tampering with a witness, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\"> The trial court also found defendant guilty of four counts of attempted solicitation of aggravated murder and three counts of attempted solicitation of murder. The court merged all of the guilty verdicts into the nine convictions listed above. Defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal relate only to the attempted murder, attempted aggravated murder, and witness-tampering counts; he does not challenge the verdicts on the solicitation counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-12\"> The captain at Northern Oregon Regional Correction Facility (NORCOR) testified that an inmate can release his personal property to a person outside of the prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\"> Because defendant was convicted on Counts 15 and 16 for \u201cknowingly inducting] or <em>attempting] to induce </em>a witness or a person the person believes may be called as a witness in any official proceeding to offer false testimony or unlawfully withhold any testimony,\u201d his witness-tampering convictions also required that his conduct constitute a substantial step toward that result.

Carlton, </em>361 Or 29, 45, 388 P3d 1093 (2017). I agree with the majority that, under our case law, defendant\u2019s actions in instructing a hypothetical hit man on the details of the crimes and the amount of compensation to be paid for commission of the crimes and delivering those instructions to a courier were a substantial step toward the commission of those crimes. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>202 Or App 478, 487-89, 123 P3d 304 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 158 (2006) (solicitation of crime as a substantial step); <em>State v.

Even if actual solicitation of a crime can be a substantial step, how is an <em>attempted </em>solicitation equally substantial? It seems to me that conduct that advances a criminal purpose is conduct that makes the crimes more likely to occur. Defendant\u2019s delivery of the letter to his cellmate did not make the crimes any more likely, even though the delivery corroborates defendant\u2019s intent to commit the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The test that a defendant has \u201cdone all that he was expected to do\u201d in determining whether a substantial step has been taken, while suggested by our precedents, should be re-examined and discarded, and the meaning of \u201cadvancing the criminal purpose charged\u201d should be clarified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
