In her first assignment of error, wife argues that the trial court erred in its award of spousal maintenance support; wife raises two arguments concerning the amount and timing of the award. In her second assignment of error, wife argues that the trial court erred in setting child support based upon her imputed income. Husband cross-appeals, raising two assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We write only to address wife\u2019s contentions on appeal, and reject without discussion husband\u2019s assignments of error on cross-appeal. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand the awards of spousal maintenance support and child support, and otherwise affirm on appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">On appeal, wife does not seek <em>de novo </em>review and this is not an exceptional case warranting such review. ORS 19.415(3)(b); ORAP 5.40(8)(c). \u201cAccordingly, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s express and implicit factual findings if they are supported by any evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Andersen and Andersen, </em>258 Or App 568, 570, 310 P3d 1171 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). We recite the facts consistently with that standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The parties were married for over 20 years. At the time of dissolution, the parties\u2019 only child was 19 years old and was living with husband and attending community college.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Husband has a high school education and had taken some classes at a community college. At the time of trial, husband worked for DNV/KEMA; husband estimated that his base salary was approximately $70,400 per year, averaging a gross monthly income of $6,200. In addition to husband\u2019s base salary, he enjoys a benefits package of an additional $24,000; husband\u2019s entire \u201csalary package\u201d is approximately $94,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Wife has a high school education and was employed during most of the marriage at various retail stores. Wife\u2019s most recent long-term employment was as a manager for Save-A-Lot; in that position, wife earned approximately $49,000 per year, working seven days per week for about 75-85 hours per week. Additionally, that position required wife to commute from the family home in Albany to the store\u2019s location in Springfield, which added an additional two hours to her workday.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Husband and wife agreed that wife should find a job that would allow wife to work fewer hours. Wife was unable to find work at a comparable income because her experience made her too qualified for sales or retail work and her education was inadequate for management positions that might have approached her income at Save-A-Lot. As a result, in order to qualify for management positions and earn a higher salary, wife decided to return to school. The parties disputed whether they had agreed that wife would pursue higher education; nonetheless, the trial court found that husband was aware of\u2014and at least tacitly agreed to\u2014wife returning to school.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">At the time of the dissolution trial in April 2014, wife was unemployed and was a full-time student at community college, with an ultimate goal of obtaining a master\u2019s degree in either counseling or social work. Wife expected that she would graduate with her bachelor\u2019s degree after the winter term of 2017 and with her master\u2019s degree after the winter term of 2018. Wife requested that the trial court award her $750 per month in transitional spousal support for a period of five years and $750 per month in spousal maintenance support for an indefinite period of time. The trial court ultimately awarded wife $750 per month in transitional spousal support for five years, and $500 per month in spousal maintenance support to commence five years after dissolution, and to run for an indefinite period of time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court ordered husband to pay $603 per month in child support, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>and the court ordered wife to pay $451 per month in child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">On appeal, in her first assignment of error, wife contends that the trial court erred in its award of spousal maintenance support. First, wife argues that the trial court\u2019s award of $500 per month in spousal \u201cmaintenance support is too low and falls outside of a just and equitable choice of legally correct alternatives.\u201d Second, wife argues that the award of spousal maintenance support should have commenced upon entry of the judgment of dissolution and the court erred by commencing that support five years after dissolution. In other words, as we understand wife\u2019s argument, the trial court erred in failing to award spousal maintenance support for the first five years following dissolution. In response, husband argues that the trial court awarded wife \u201ca reasonable and legally proper amount of spousal support,\u201d and that \u201cit is less important to determine whether the two types of spousal support should run simultaneously, and more important to review whether the total award of support is appropriate for each time period.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination about a just and equitable amount of support for abuse of discretion. We will uphold a support award if, given the findings of the trial court that are supported by the record, the court\u2019s determination that an award of support is just and equitable represents a choice among legally correct alternatives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\"><em>Andersen, </em>258 Or App at 570 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">A trial court, in its judgment of dissolution, may order \u201c [s]pousal maintenance as a contribution by one spouse to the support of the other for either a specified or an indefinite period.\u201d ORS 107.105(1)(d)(C). Spousal maintenance support \u201callows one financially able spouse to contribute to the support of the other, depending on the financial needs and resources of each party.\u201d <em>Abrams and Abrams, </em>243 Or App 203, 207, 259 P3d 92, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 716 (2011). In long-term marriages, \u201cthe primary goal of spousal support is to provide a standard of living to both spouses that is roughly comparable to the one enjoyed during the marriage [.] \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>\u201cIn determining the proper amount and duration of an award of spousal maintenance support, the factors to be considered by the court include the duration of the marriage; the age of the parties; the physical, mental, and emotional health of the parties; the standard of living established during the marriage; the parties\u2019 relative income and earning capacity; a party\u2019s training, employment skills, and work experience; the financial needs and resources of each party; the tax consequences to each party; a party\u2019s custodial and child support responsibilities; and any other factors that the court deems just and equitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><em>Mitchell and Mitchell, </em>271 Or App 800, 811, 353 P3d 28 (2015) (citing ORS 107.105(1)(d)(C)(i) - (ad)).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In a letter opinion to the parties, the court stated that the case presented \u201ca somewhat unique factual situation where Wife, with at least the tacit support of Husband, leaves a job that has her overworked, to be retrained and then cannot obtain the same paying job because of too much experience for a clerk, while too little education] for a management position.\u201d In the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the parties\u2019 financial needs and resources, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">\u201cWife currently lives with her parents and plans to move to an apartment within a short period of time. This move, reasonable at her age and stage of life, will increase her financial needs. Her resources, assuming that she remains in school, will not be increased to cover the additional costs. Her anticipated expenses are expected to total $2,100 per month in fixed costs, with consumer financial obligations of an additional $450 per month and child support. Her educational costs and child support * * * break out to an additional monthly cost of $1,282 per month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u201cThere is no reason to find that Husband\u2019s financial needs or resources will change post marriage. * * * Husband stands to have approximately $1,500 left at the end of the month [after expenses], not considering the total \u2018salary package\u2019 that he enjoys from his employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">As to the parties\u2019 relative income and earning capacity, the court found that, although husband was at the top of his earning capacity,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">\u201cWife is currently well below her earning capacity. Still, when Wife has obtained her degree(s), her earning capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>is 60% of Husband\u2019s earning capacity, without considering the benefit package that Husband enjoys or any potential benefit that Wife may have when she is fully educated. Based upon the evidence, there is no reason to not conclude that this relative income disparity should not continue into the future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">As to factors the trial court deemed \u201cjust and equitable,\u201d the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">\u201cDuring the marriage, Wife worked 75-80 hours per week in her latest, and most lucrative employment. She earned a salary of $49,000 per year with, literally, no family life outside of her employment. Certainly, Husband worked a full time job as well, but there is nothing in the record suggesting that Husband made the type of sacrifice that Wife made for both parties to provide for the family. At her separation from Save-A-Lot, Wife\u2019s income was approximately 68% of Husband\u2019s income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">\u201c* * * Wife has shown true investment in her education to the point at which it appears that her experience at work verses education levels would not make similar salary expectations probable. The evidence is that in her chosen field of pursuing a Master\u2019s Degree, she can expect a salary of $40,000 per year [and that] is a reasonable expectation. She shouldn\u2019t be penalized for forgoing a job requiring 80 hours a week for a profession that she has chosen in this case. Still, assuming a salary of $40,000, she can expect a salary that is approximately 60% of that which Husband looks to enjoy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">In determining spousal support, the court stated that it \u201chas taken into consideration Wife\u2019s anticipated income after graduation.\u201d The court then awarded wife spousal maintenance support in the amount of $500 per month for an indefinite period, \u201cto commence after the termination of the transitional support,\u201d which was set to terminate five years following entry of the general judgment of dissolution. In other words, the trial court did not award spousal maintenance support for the first five years, but awarded $500 in monthly spousal maintenance support to commence five years after dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">We agree with wife that the trial court misapplied the factors specified in ORS 107.105 (1) (d) (C). Contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings that at the time of dissolution wife was a full-time student with little to no financial resources, and that it would take at least four years for wife to obtain her master\u2019s degree and earn a reasonable income, the trial court did not award wife spousal maintenance support for the first five years following dissolution. As noted, the primary purpose of an award of spousal maintenance support is to provide a standard of living to both spouses that is roughly comparable to the one that each party enjoyed during the marriage. Here, the trial court\u2019s denial of a spousal maintenance award for the first five years following dissolution results in wife\u2019s standard of living not being roughly comparable to the standard of living that each party enjoyed during the marriage. Indeed, the court found that during the time that wife would be obtaining her degrees, her only financial resources would consist of $750 in transitional support and her student loans. Nevertheless, contrary to that finding, the court did not award any spousal maintenance support for that critical period during which wife was in school. <em>See Snyder and Snyder, </em>102 Or App 41, 44-45, 792 P2d 478 (1990) (\u201c[I]n marriages of long duration, where the parties have disparate earning capacities, permanent spousal support is necessary to avoid an overly disproportionate impact on the disadvantaged spouse.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\">Similarly, in awarding spousal maintenance support, the trial court appears to have incorrectly imputed wife\u2019s estimated future salary\u2014a salary that she expects to make after obtaining her master\u2019s degree\u2014in calculating the amount of the spousal maintenance support award. As noted, in \u201cdetermining what is just and proper,\u201d the trial court stated that it had \u201ctaken into consideration Wife\u2019s anticipated income after graduation.\u201d In so doing, the trial court did not base its award on wife\u2019s circumstances existing at the time of dissolution. <em>See Cullen and Cullen, </em>223 Or App 183, 190, 194 P3d 866 (2008) (\u201cA spousal support order should be based on circumstances existing at the time of dissolution [.] \u201d); <em>McLauchlan and McLauchlan, </em>227 Or App 476, 491, 206 P3d 662, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 363 (2009) (\u201c[A]lthough a spousal support order must take into account the lifestyle enjoyed by the parties during the marriage, it is also based on circumstances existing at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>dissolution.\u201d). Moreover, even when considering wife\u2019s future estimated salary, the trial court found that wife\u2019s earning capacity would be 60 percent of husband\u2019s earning capacity, without taking into account husband\u2019s additional benefit package, noted above. Despite the disparity in the parties\u2019 incomes and earning capacities, the trial court concluded that a monthly spousal maintenance award of $500 was just and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the trial court misapplied the factors specified in ORS 107.105(1)(d)(C). As a result, the spousal maintenance support award does not represent a choice among legally correct alternatives. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the trial court\u2019s spousal maintenance support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In her second assignment of error, wife contends that the trial court erred in calculating child support based on wife\u2019s imputed income of $40,000 per year. Wife argues that the court improperly used her future potential income to set child support, rather than using minimum wage. In response, husband argues that the trial court properly imputed her income because \u201cwife was unemployed but had the skills and ability to be employed at the time of trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">We review whether the trial court correctly calculated the parties\u2019 incomes under the child support guidelines for legal error. <em>Morgan and Morgan, </em>269 Or App 156, 167, 344 P3d 81, <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 595 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">For purposes of calculating child support, a parent\u2019s income can include the parent\u2019s actual income and potential income. OAR 137-050-0715(1). \u201cActual income\u2019 means a parent\u2019s gross earnings and income from any source [.] \u201d OAR 137-050-0715(2). On the other hand, potential income \u201cmeans the parent\u2019s ability to earn based on relevant work history, including hours typically worked by or available to the parent, occupational qualifications, education, physical and mental health, employment potential in light of prevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the community, and any other relevant factors.\u201d OAR 137-050-0715(3). If a parent\u2019s actual income is less than the parent\u2019s potential income, the court may impute potential income to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>parent. OAR 137-050-0715(6). \u201cThus, a parent\u2019s income under OAR 137-050-0715 must be based on the income that the parent is receiving or could be receiving.\u201d <em>Adams and Adams, </em>274 Or App 423, 427, 360 P3d 742 (2015). However, a finding that a potential income exceeds his or her actual income must be supported by \u201cnonspeculative\u201d evidence \u201cand relate to * * * present earning capacity.\u201d <em>Andersen, </em>258 Or App at 585-86; <em>Leif and Leif, </em>246 Or App 511, 519, 266 P3d 165 (2011) (\u201cWhen determining a parent\u2019s gross income for child support purposes, a trial court must inquire into the parent\u2019s present income.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Here, the trial court incorrectly imputed income to wife in setting wife\u2019s child support obligation. In its letter opinion, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">\u201cWife\u2019s only current income is [transitional] spousal support [$750] and student loans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">\u201c* * * The potential income for Wife in this case, and the actual salary level that she expects [to receive after graduating with her master\u2019s degree], is $40,000, or $3,333 per month.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">As a result, the trial court erred in determining wife\u2019s child support amount because, when calculating wife\u2019s income, the court did not find that, at the time of dissolution, wife had the present ability to earn $3,333 per month. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that wife\u2019s potential income for child support purposes was $40,000 was contrary to the court\u2019s factual findings that wife was a full-time student who was unable to find work \u201cprimarily because her experience made her too qualified for sales/retail work and her education was inadequate for management positions,\u201d and whose only financial resources were $750 per month in transitional spousal support and student loans. By using wife\u2019s speculative future income\u2014an income that wife estimated she could make after obtaining her master\u2019s degree\u2014that did not relate to wife\u2019s present earning capacity at the time of dissolution, the trial court erred in setting wife\u2019s child support obligation. <em>See Bouris and Bouris, </em>276 Or App 637, 639, 369 P3d 1186 (2016) (\u201cIn light of wife\u2019s full-time status as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>student, we conclude that the court\u2019s imputation of full-time income is not supported by the evidence in the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">On appeal, awards of spousal maintenance support and child support reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed. Affirmed on cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\"> On cross-appeal, in his first assignment of error, husband argues that the trial court erred in awarding wife indefinite spousal maintenance support. In his second assignment of error, husband argues that the trial court improperly calculated the distribution of the parties\u2019 assets by miscalculating the amount of husband\u2019s withdrawal from his retirement account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\"> We note that wife does not challenge the trial court\u2019s award of transitional support. A trial court may award transitional support \u201cas needed for a party to attain education and training necessary to allow the party to prepare for reentry into the job market or for advancement therein.\u201d ORS 107.105(1)(d)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
