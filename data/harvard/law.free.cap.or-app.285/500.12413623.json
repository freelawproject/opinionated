As to mother, the juvenile court determined that the Department of Human Services (DHS) proved numerous allegations that mother\u2019s mental health, substance abuse, and neglect created a risk of harm to the children. As to father, he admitted that jurisdiction was appropriate because he was incarcerated and therefore unavailable to be a custodial resource. However, he disputed DHS\u2019s allegation 2(q) that his \u201csubstance abuse involvement, without treatment, interferes with his ability to safely parent the child.\u201d The juvenile court determined that DHS proved the substance abuse allegation and took jurisdiction based on that allegation and father\u2019s admission that his incarceration made him unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On appeal, mother asserts that the evidence was insufficient to establish that her behavior \u201cthreatens her children with serious injury or loss.\u201d In doing so, she challenges several of the allegations on which the court based jurisdiction. With the exception of allegation 2(j) (\u201cDespite having participated in services designed to improve mother\u2019s parenting skills, she is unable to safely parent the [children].\u201d), we reject mother\u2019s assignments of error without further discussion. As to allegation 2(j), DHS concedes that the court erred by asserting jurisdiction on that basis. We agree, accept DHS\u2019s concession, and reverse and remand the jurisdictional judgments for entry of judgments establishing jurisdiction based on allegations other than 2(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Father asserts that the court erred by taking jurisdiction based on his \u201csubstance abuse involvement.\u201d DHS concedes that the court erred by asserting jurisdiction on that basis.
