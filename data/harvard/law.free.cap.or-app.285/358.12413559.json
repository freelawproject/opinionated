ORS 166.384(1)(a). Defendant waived his right to a jury, and the trial court found defendant guilty of both counts. Defendant appeals. As explained below, we conclude that the trial court failed to apply the correct definition of \u201cdestructive device,\u201d which excludes any device that \u201cis designed primarily or redesigned primarily for use as a * * * pyrotechnic\u201d device. ORS 166.384(1)(a); ORS 166.382(2)(a). We further conclude that, because the trial court\u2019s express factual findings establish that the devices at issue were designed primarily for use as pyrotechnic devices, the trial court erred in convicting defendant of manufacturing destructive devices. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We begin with the facts, which are undisputed. During a traffic stop in 2011, officers found two objects in defendant\u2019s truck. Defendant told the officers that the objects were firecrackers or fireworks and that he wanted to hear them \u201cgo boom.\u201d The first object was a small plastic container that held 28 grams of smokeless powder and 11 \u201csnap pop\u201d fireworks. The container had a hole with a four-inch fuse. The second object was similar, but it contained 24 grams of smokeless powder, seven \u201csnap pop\u201d fireworks, and it did not have a fuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">At trial, the state called a hazardous device technician, Blank, as a witness. Blank testified that if a person threw or stepped on the objects, the \u201csnap pop\u201d fireworks could ignite the smokeless powder, which would create heat and pressure that could cause the container to explode and send out plastic fragments. According to Blank, if a person stepped on one of the objects and it exploded, the person could be burned. In addition, if the object exploded and sent out plastic fragments, the fragments could injure a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. Defendant argued that the objects at issue did not fall within the statutory definition of \u201cdestructive device\u201d because that definition excludes any device that \u201cis designed primarily or redesigned primarily for use as a *** pyrotechnic\u201d device, ORS 166.382(2)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>and that, under <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Garrett, </em>193 Or App 629, 91 P3d 830 (2004), \u201cpyrotechnic devices\u201d are \u201cfireworks,\u201d and \u201cfireworks\u201d are \u201ccombustible or explosive substances, including bombs, that are prepared for the purpose of providing a visual or audible effect.\u201d Specifically, defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">\u201c[ORS 166.382(2)(a)] indicates that a pyrotechnic device is excluded from the definition of a destructive device, and * * * the <em>Garrett </em>case * * * indicates that a pyrotechnic device is not defined by statute but the term generally refers to what we know as fireworks, and fireworks are defined as combustible or explosive substances, including bombs, that are prepared for the purpose of providing a visual or audible effect. * * * [W]e are arguing that it clearly falls within the statute as one of the exclusions that it was a firework. By my client\u2019s own admission, he created it as a firework. He didn\u2019t knowingly create a destructive device, and if Your Honor finds that he did knowingly create a destructive device, that if it was considered a bomb, that it falls within the exclusions or what are kept out of the statute as a pyrotechnic device or a firework, by what he indicated it was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant did not present any evidence, and the case proceeded to closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In his closing argument, defense counsel again argued that the objects at issue were not \u201cdestructive devices\u201d because they were \u201cpyrotechnic devices,\u201d that is, \u201cfireworks.\u201d Specifically, defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">\u201cI would like to point out specifically to [ORS] 166.382(2)(a) which defines destructive device. It says it does not include any device which is designed primarily or redesigned primarily\u2014and I\u2019m focusing on the word redesigned, showing that we can have one design for something but if we redesign it as a pyrotechnic device, and it says pyrotechnic device, we don\u2019t have a definition of pyrotechnic device by statute but in the <em>Garrett </em>case it says that we commonly refer to it as a firework. Now, that\u2019s what my client called it when he was stopped and arrested. He referred to it as a firework and that it would go boom, like a firework. <em>So that is what he redesigned the materials that he had for, for a primary use of being a pyrotechnic device. </em>We have the definition from <em>Garrett </em>of a firework. It\u2019s defined as combustible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>or explosive substance, and it says including bombs, that are prepared for the purpose of providing a visible or audible effect. And that goes further with what my client admitted to the officer that he made the device and that it was for to be a boom, like a firework. So we\u2019re advocating that it would be a pyrotechnic device.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s arguments. At the outset of its ruling, the trial court found that defendant\u2019s intent in creating the devices \u201cwas to make some display or hear something go boom, or I can\u2019t remember what the words were. * * * [T]he intent wasn\u2019t to create a device that was going to be used in some terrorist activity or something of that nature.\u201d But, the court concluded that the objects fell within the definition of \u201cdestructive device,\u201d and convicted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that destructive devices do not include objects that are designed or redesigned to be used primarily as fireworks and that, given the trial court\u2019s factual findings, the objects at issue were redesigned primarily for use as fireworks, as defined in <em>Garrett, </em>in that they were \u201ccombustible or explosive substances *** prepared for the purpose of providing a visual or audible effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The state agrees that destructive devices do not include objects that are designed or redesigned primarily for use as fireworks, but disagrees with defendant\u2019s reliance on the definition of \u201cfirework\u201d in <em>Garrett, </em>contending that it is <em>dicta. </em>The state proffers an alternative definition of \u201cfirework\u201d and contends that the objects at issue do not fall within that definition. Specifically, the state argues that the applicable definition of \u201cfirework\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201c[A] device for producing a striking display (as of light, noise, or smoke) by the combustion of explosive or flammable compositions esp. for exhibition, signaling, or illumination and typically consisting of a paper case containing combustible material (as charcoal, sulfur, or a metal powder, an oxidizing agent (as a nitrate or chlorate), and a metal salt as a coloring agent if color is desiredf]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>856 (unabridged ed 2002). Treating the definition\u2019s description of the \u201ctypical\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>type of case as a requirement, the state asserts that \u201ca \u2018firework\u2019 is a device with a <em>paper </em>case containing combustible material used to make a striking display of light or noise.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Applying that formulation, the state argues that the objects at issue are not fireworks because they had <em>plastic </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The parties\u2019 arguments give rise to two questions: (1) What constitutes a \u201cpyrotechnic device,\u201d also known as a \u201cfirework,\u201d and, as such, is excluded from the definition of \u201cdestructive device,\u201d and (2) given its own fact findings, could the trial court conclude that the objects at issue were \u201cdestructive devices?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The first question is one of statutory interpretation, which we address by employing the familiar methodology established by <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), and <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). We first examine the text and context of the statute, as well as any useful legislative history, and, if that examination does not resolve the question, we apply maxims of statutory construction. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-72. \u201c[W]e begin with the statutory text and context, which are the best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Wyers v. American Medical Response Northwest, Inc., </em>268 Or App 232, 244, 342 P3d 129 (2014), <em>aff'd, </em>360 Or 211, 377 P3d 570 (2016). Statutory context includes prior opinions interpreting the statute, as well as other provisions of the same or related statutes. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Polacek and Polacek, </em>349 Or 278, 284, 243 P3d 1190 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">As mentioned, defendant was charged with two counts of unlawful manufacture of a destructive device, which is defined by ORS 166.384. That statute provides, in part, that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of unlawful manufacture of a destructive device if the person assembles, produces or otherwise manufactures *** [a] destructive device, as defined in ORS 166.382[.]\u201d In turn, ORS 166.382 defines the crime of unlawful possession of a destructive device, as well as terms used in the definition. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of unlawful possession of a destructive device if the person possesses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u201c(a) Any of the following devices with an explosive, incendiary or poison gas component:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-3\">\u201c(A) Bomb;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">\u201c(B) Grenade;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201c(C) Rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201c(D) Missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201c(E) Mine; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201c(b) Any combination of parts either designed or intended for use in converting any device into any destructive device described in paragraph (a) of this subsection and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\u201c(2) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">\u201c(a) <em>\u2018Destructive device\u2019 does not include any device which is designed primarily or redesigned primarily for use as a signaling, pyrotechnic, line throwing, safety or similar device.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, as defined by ORS 166.382, \u201cdestructive device\u201d does not include any device which is designed or redesigned primarily for use as a \u201cpyrotechnic\u201d device.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">We addressed the definition of \u201cdestructive device\u201d in <em>Garrett, </em>193 Or App 629, a juvenile delinquency case. In <em>Garrett, </em>the youth appealed the juvenile court\u2019s order asserting jurisdiction over him for committing an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful manufacture of a destructive device under ORS 166.384. On appeal, the youth argued that the state had failed to present sufficient evidence that the object at issue\u2014which we described as \u201ca lawful firework, commonly known as a \u2018Piccolo Pete [,] \u2019 \u201d that the youth had hammered flat and wrapped in duct tape\u2014 was a \u201cdestructive device.\u201d 193 Or App at 631. We noted that \u201cdestructive device\u201d is defined to include, among other things, a \u201cbomb.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets omitted). We also noted that it is defined to exclude any device that is designed or redesigned primarily for use as a \u201cpyrotechnic device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>observed that the term \u201cpyrotechnic device\u201d is not defined by statute and that it \u201cgenerally refers to what are commonly known as \u2018fireworks.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1854 (unabridged ed 1993)). For a definition of \u201cfireworks,\u201d we looked to the then-current Oregon Fireworks Law, ORS 480.110 to 480.160, and, relying on that law\u2019s definition of \u201cfireworks,\u201d which was set out at ORS 480.110(1), we stated, \u201c\u2018Fireworks\u2019 are defined as combustible or explosive substances, including \u2018bombs,\u2019 that are \u2018prepared for the purpose of providing a visible or audible effect.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>former </em>ORS 480.110(1) (2003)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We did not, however, determine whether the object at issue in <em>Garrett </em>was a \u201cfirework\u201d because, in the juvenile court, the youth had expressly disclaimed reliance on the pyrotechnic device or firework exception. He argued that not only was the object not a destructive device, it was not even a firework. 193 Or App at 633. He pointed out that the definition of \u201cfirework\u201d excluded certain \u201ccylindrical fountains\u201d that are designed to produce showers of colored sparks, and he argued that the object at issue was such a fountain. <em>See </em>ORS 480.127(4)(c) (2003), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2013, ch 24, \u00a7 3. Reviewing <em>de novo, </em>we acknowledged that the definition of \u201cfirework\u201d excluded certain fountains, but determined that the object at issue was not such a fountain because the youth had \u201caltered it so that it would no longer merely produce \u2018shower[s] of colored sparks.\u2019\u201d 193 Or App at 633 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>(quoting ORS 480.127(4)(c) (2003)). Instead, it was \u201ccapable of exploding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Because, in the juvenile court, the youth had \u201cexpressly disclaimed any reliance on the exclusion from the definition of \u2018destructive device\u2019 for \u2018pyrotechnic device [s]\u2019 contained in ORS 166.382(2)(a),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 632, we did not reach his argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that, even if the object was a \u201cbomb,\u201d \u201cthe state had failed to prove that [it] was not the sort of bomb that is a \u2018pyrotechnic device\u2019 that is expressly excluded from the definition of a prohibited \u2018destructive device.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634: Consequently, as the state contends, our statements of the definitions of \u201cpyrotechnic device\u201d and \u201cfirework\u201d in <em>Garrett </em>are <em>dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">However, after <em>Garrett, </em>we decided <em>State v. J. N. S., </em>258 Or App 310, 308 P3d 1112 (2013), a juvenile delinquency case in which the youth was alleged to have possessed and manufactured a destructive device. In <em>J. N. S., </em>the youth argued that the object at issue\u2014a tennis ball that was filled with smokeless gunpowder and had a fuse made from a \u201cPixie Stick\u201d wrapper\u2014was a \u201cpyrotechnic device.\u201d To address the youth\u2019s argument, we had to interpret the term \u201cpyrotechnic device,\u201d and, following <em>Garrett </em>and its reliance on <em>former </em>ORS 480.110(1), we held that \u201cpyrotechnic devices\u201d are \u201cfireworks,\u201d and \u201cfireworks\u201d are \u201ccombustible or explosive substances, including \u2018bombs\u2019 that are \u2018prepared for the purpose of providing a visible or audible effect.\u2019\u201d 258 Or App at 323 (quoting <em>Garrett, </em>193 Or App at 631).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We adhere to that interpretation. The state\u2019s arguments, discussed below, do not establish that our interpretation was wrong, much less \u201cplainly wrong\u201d as required for this court to overrule its precedent. <em>See State v. Civil, </em>283 Or App 395, 406, 388 P3d 1185 (2017) (explaining that a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>seeking to have one of our prior decisions overruled must demonstrate that the prior decision was \u201cplainly wrong\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The state argues that we should not, as we did in <em>Garrett </em>and <em>J. N. S., </em>rely on the \u201cfirework\u201d definition from <em>former </em>ORS 480.110(1). The state notes that <em>former </em>ORS 480.110 expressly provides that it defines terms \u201c[f]or the purposes of <em>[former] </em>ORS 480.110 to 480.160* * * the Oregon Fireworks Law[.]\u201d Thus, the state reasons, the definition should not be used when interpreting the destructive device statutes, which are not part of the Oregon Fireworks Law. According to the state, \u201c[t]he definition in [former] ORS 480.110(1) is not part of the context for ORS 166.382(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The state\u2019s argument, which would require us to overrule <em>J. N. S., </em>is unavailing. A statute\u2019s context includes related statutes. <em>State v. Klein, </em>352 Or 302, 309, 283 P3d 350 (2012). The destructive device statutes were enacted in 1989, after the enactment of provisions of ORS chapter 480, which governed \u201cfireworks\u201d and \u201cexplosives.\u201d ORS 480.010 - 480.290. The legislature was aware of those provisions, as evidenced by the fact that ORS 166.382, which defines the crime of possession of a destructive device, provides that it does not apply to persons who possess explosives as provided in chapter 480. Specifically, ORS 166.382(3)(a) provides that ORS 166.382 \u201cdoes not apply to *** [p]ersons who possess explosives as provided in ORS 480.200 to 480.290.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">From that cross-reference, we conclude that, when enacting the destructive device statutes, the legislature relied upon the definition of \u201cexplosive\u201d set out at ORS 480.200(1), which defined \u201cexplosives\u201d to exclude \u201cfireworks as defined by [former] ORS 480.110(1).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The cross-reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>indicates that, when it enacted the destructive device statutes, the legislature was aware of provisions in ORS chapter 480 governing \u201cfireworks\u201d and \u201cexplosives,\u201d including the definition of \u201cfirework\u201d in [former] ORS 480.110(1). It also indicates that the legislature intended the destructive device statutes to be consistent with those provisions. Thus, contrary to the state\u2019s argument, we properly considered the definition of \u201cfirework\u201d in <em>former </em>ORS 480.110(1) in <em>Garrett </em>and <em>J.N. S.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In sum, adhering to <em>Garrett </em>and <em>J. N. </em>S., we conclude that, under the statutes that apply to this case, a \u201cdestructive device\u201d does not include \u201cany device which is designed primarily or redesigned primarily for use as a *** pyrotechnic *** device,\u201d ORS 166.382(2)(a), and a \u201cpyrotechnic device\u201d is a \u201cfirework,\u201d which is defined as \u201cany combustible or explosive composition or substance, or any combination of such compositions or substances, or any other article which was prepared for the purposes of providing a visible or audible ef<em>fect,\" former </em>ORS 480.110(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Having defined \u201cpyrotechnic device\u201d for the purposes of the destructive device statutes, we turn to defendant\u2019s argument that, applying that definition, the trial court erred in convicting him of the two charged counts. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal, but defendant\u2019s argument is that, applying the proper definition of \u201cpyrotechnic device\u201d to the facts as found by the trial court, the trial court erred in convicting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Procedurally, defendant\u2019s argument is similar to one raised in <em>State v. Clum, </em>216 Or App 1, 7-9, 171 P3d 980 (2007). In <em>Clum, </em>the defendant was charged with failing to report as a sex offender, in violation of ORS 181.597, which was enacted in 1995. The defendant waived his right to a jury, and the case was tried to the court. At trial, the state presented evidence that the defendant had moved to Oregon in 1996, after the enactment of ORS 181.597, and the defendant responded by presenting evidence that he had moved to Oregon in 1994, before the enactment of ORS 181.597. After the presentation of evidence by both parties, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that, because he had moved to Oregon before the enactment of ORS 181.597, it did not apply to him. The state countered that, even if the defendant had moved to Oregon before the enactment of ORS 181.597, it applied to him. The trial court expressly found that the defendant had moved to Oregon in 1994, before the enactment of ORS 181.597, but it adopted the state\u2019s argument that the statute applied to the defendant, regardless of when he had moved to Oregon, and convicted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The defendant appealed, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. In response, the state argued that the trial court could not have granted the motion for judgment of acquittal because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">\u201cthere was conflicting evidence as to whether defendant moved to Oregon before the effective date of ORS 181.597 and, in reviewing the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, we review the record and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether the trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">216 Or App at 5. As we summarized, the state\u2019s argument reduced to the proposition that, because the defendant \u201cchose the wrong procedural vehicle for his challenge to the application of ORS 181.597 and, on appeal, defendant assigns error only to the denial of his procedurally improper motion, his assignment of error is defeated by the requisite standard of review [.] \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>We rejected that argument, which would have required us to ignore the trial court\u2019s express factual finding regarding when the defendant had moved to Oregon. We explained that the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal was \u201cdirectly analogous to a ruling on an exception to an instruction in a jury trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. In the trial court, the defendant had made both a legal <em>argument\u2014viz., </em>that ORS 181.597 did not apply to persons who had moved to Oregon before the enactment of the statute\u2014and a factual <em>argument\u2014viz., </em>that he had moved to Oregon before the enactment date. And, the trial court had addressed both arguments. On appeal, we concluded that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling, ORS 181.597 does not apply to persons who moved to Oregon before it was enacted, and, because the trial court had expressly found that the defendant had moved to Oregon before the statute was enacted, we reversed the judgment of conviction. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\u201c[T]he trial court made a finding of fact on a disputed issue after a full trial on the merits. The court made that finding knowing that it was the only fact in dispute between the parties and that, from defendant\u2019s point of view, it was dispositive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 7. Thus, in <em>Clum, </em>we did not remand for the trial court to correctly apply ORS 181.597, because the trial court had already resolved the dispositive factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In this case, as in <em>Clum, </em>defendant made both a legal argument and a factual argument. He argued that, as a matter of law, \u201cdestructive device\u201d does not include any device that is primarily designed or redesigned for use as a \u201cpyrotechnic device\u201d and that, as we had held in <em>Garrett, </em>\u201cpyrotechnic devices\u201d are \u201cfireworks,\u201d and \u201cfireworks\u201d are \u201ccombustible or explosive substances, including bombs, that are prepared for the purpose of providing a visual or audible effect.\u201d He also argued that, as a matter of fact, he created the objects to make noise. Because, as discussed above, defendant\u2019s legal argument is correct, the only remaining question is whether, given the trial court\u2019s express factual findings regarding defendant\u2019s intent, the trial court erred in convicting him. We conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Whether the objects fell within the definition of \u201cfireworks,\u201d and therefore were excluded from the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of \u201cdestructive devices,\u201d was dependent upon defendant\u2019s primary purpose in designing or redesigning them. As defendant argued to the trial court, if his primary purpose was to use the objects to \u201cprovid [e] a visual or audible effect,\u201d then they were \u201cfireworks.\u201d In response to defendant\u2019s argument, the trial court expressly found that defendant\u2019s \u201cintent was to make some display or hear something go boom\u201d and that his \u201cintent wasn\u2019t to create a device that was going to be used in some terrorist activity or something of that nature.\u201d Given that express finding\u2014which, as in <em>Clum, </em>the trial court made \u201cknowing that it was the only fact in dispute between the parties and that, from defendant\u2019s point of view, it was dispositive\u201d\u2014the trial court erred in concluding that the objects were \u201cdestructive devices,\u201d as defined by ORS 166.382.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-5\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 480.110(1) (2003) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201c\u2018Fireworks\u2019 means any combustible or explosive composition or substance, or any combination of such compositions or substances or any other article which was prepared for the purpose of providing a visible or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration or detonation, and includes blank cartridges or toy cannons in which explosives are used, balloons which require fire underneath to propel the same, firecrackers, torpedoes, skyrockets, Roman candles, bombs, rockets, wheels, colored fires, fountains, mines, serpents or any other article of like construction or any article containing any explosive or inflammable compound or any tablets or other device containing any explosive substances or inflammable compound!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In 2013, after both <em>Garrett </em>and defendant\u2019s conduct in this case, the legislature repealed ORS 480.110. Or Laws 2013, ch 24, \u00a7 13. At the same time, it enacted the provisions that were subsequently codified in ORS 480.111, which define certain terms used in ORS chapter 480. Or Laws 2013, ch 24, \u00a7 2. Throughout the remainder of this opinion, we use <em>\u201cformer </em>ORS 480.110\u201d to refer to this former statute, which existed in the same form from 1983 to 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> The state had presented evidence that, by pounding the Piccolo Pete flat, the youth \u201chad increased the density of the explosive powder that it contained, which would change the \u2018burn rate\u2019 and allow the resulting gases to escape at a much higher velocity.\u201d 193 Or App at 632. The state also presented evidence that \u201cthe duct tape wrapping could contain those gases until the pressure built up to a point that the device could explode.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\"> In <em>J.

Or Laws 1999, ch 980, \u00a7 1; Or Laws 2001, ch 914, \u00a7 26. Thereafter, as part of the 2013 amendment, <em>see </em>285 Or App at 364 n 1, the legislature amended ORS 480.200(3) (2001) to refer to the definition of \u201cfireworks\u201d in ORS 480.111. Or Laws 2013, ch 24, \u00a7 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\"> The state also argues that we should not rely on the definition of \u201cfirework\u201d in <em>former </em>ORS 480.110 because the legislature has adopted new definitions for the Oregon Fireworks Law. That argument is unavailing because those definitions were not in effect at the time of the charged crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> We note that this definition is not inconsistent with the state\u2019s definition. As set forth above, the state argues that, instead of the definition of \u201cfirework\u201d in <em>former </em>ORS 480.110(1), we should use a dictionary definition, which, as summarized by the state, provides that a \u201cfirework\u201d is \u201ca device for producing a \u2018striking display\u2019 of \u2018light, noise, or smoke\u2019 from the \u2018combustion of explosive or flammable compositions * * * typically consisting of a paper case containing combustible material\u215c * *, an oxidizing agent * * * and a metal salt as coloring agent if color is desired.\u201d (Quoting <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 856.) The state argues that, under that definition, the objects at issue in this case are not fireworks because they did not have paper cases. But even under the state\u2019s definition, although a paper case may be \u201ctypical,\u201d it is not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
