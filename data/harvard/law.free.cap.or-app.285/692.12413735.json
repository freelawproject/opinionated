J.</author>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The Oregon Probate Code allows an \u201cinterested person\u201d to take certain actions with regard to a decedent\u2019s estate, including petitioning to reopen an estate for proper cause. The code defines an \u201cinterested person\u201d to include \u201cheirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors and any others <em>having a property right or claim against the estate of a decedent that may he affected by the proceeding.\u201d </em>ORS 111.005(19) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dispute in this case is over what the emphasized portion of that sentence modifies\u2014that is, whether the phrase modifies only the term immediately preceding it\u2014\u201cany others\u201d\u2014or, alternatively, whether it modifies all of the preceding terms, so that even \u201cheirs\u201d must \u201chav[e] a property right or claim against the estate of a decedent that may be affected by the proceeding\u201d to qualify as \u201cinterested persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In the proceeding below, respondents Lotlikar and Ma petitioned to reopen the estate of their deceased brother, Chin, to investigate the transfer of assets from Chin to one of his nephews, appellant Price, who had served as the personal representative of the estate. Price opposed the petition, as did one of Chin\u2019s other siblings, appellant Penney Gertsch, who was the estate\u2019s sole devisee under the will that was probated, and her husband, appellant Robert Gertsch. Appellants argued that Lotlikar and Ma, who did not have any financial interest in their brother\u2019s estate, were not \u201cinterested persons\u201d and therefore could not petition to reopen it. Respondents countered that, as the decedent\u2019s sisters, they met the statutory definition of \u201cheirs\u201d and were \u201cinterested persons\u201d by virtue of that fact alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The probate court agreed with respondents\u2019 expansive reading of the statute and granted their petition to reopen the estate. The court ruled that, regardless of whether Lotlikar and Ma were asserting a financial interest in Chin\u2019s estate, \u201cinterested person\u201d is \u201cdefined broadly so that heirs and family members who do not currently have a financial interest in the estate, like [Lotlikar] and [Ma], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>can vindicate wrongdoing in connection with the disposition of the estate.\u201d We disagree with the probate court\u2019s construction of the statute and conclude that, to be an \u201cinterested person,\u201d even heirs must have some property right or claim against the estate that may be affected by the proceeding. Accordingly, we reverse the limited judgment reopening the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Although the probate court made extensive findings of fact regarding the circumstances surrounding the petition to reopen, we confine our discussion of the facts to those pertinent to the narrow issues on appeal. The decedent, Chin, died on July 23, 2012. He was survived by his siblings, including Lotlikar, Ma, and Penny Gertsch, as well as his nephew Price, who was the son of one of Chin\u2019s other siblings, Jean Chin. In August 2012, Price filed a petition in Multnomah County Circuit Court to probate a will dated February 5, 2003. That will nominated Penny Gertsch to serve as personal representative of the estate and left the entire estate to her; in the event that she was unwilling or unable to serve as personal representative, it named Robert Gertsch to serve. Price\u2019s petition represented that both Penny and Robert Gertsch had declined to serve and requested that Price instead be appointed as personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In September 2012, the probate court admitted the 2003 will to probate as Chin\u2019s final will. At the same time, Price was appointed as personal representative. In October 2012, Lotlikar and Ma were notified that the 2003 will had been admitted to probate and were informed of the need to file any will contest within four months. That deadline passed without a contest, and Price filed a final account and petition for final distribution in February 2013. The same month, the court entered a judgment approving that final account and authorizing the final distribution. Penny Gertsch, as the sole beneficiary under the will, signed a receipt acknowledging her full distributive share of the estate, and the court entered a supplemental judgment on February 26, 2013, that closed the estate proceedings and discharged Price from duties as the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Two days after the estate was closed, Lotlikar and Ma filed a petition to reopen it, pursuant to ORS 116.233, which provides, \u201cUpon the petition of any interested person, the court, with such notice as it may prescribe, may order the estate of a decedent reopened if other property is discovered, if any necessary act remains unperformed or for any other proper cause appearing to the court.\u201d In declarations and a memorandum in support of the petition, Lotlikar and Ma asserted that Price, claiming to be the decedent\u2019s \u201clong lost nephew,\u201d had used undue influence to defraud the decedent and had committed elder abuse through financial exploitation\u2014claims that, they asserted, the estate had not investigated because Price was the personal representative. Lotlikar and Ma asserted that they \u201cfiled this petition as named heirs of the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The probate court ultimately held a three-day hearing on the merits of the petition to reopen, taking testimony from various witnesses. One of the issues then before the probate court was whether Lotlikar and Ma had demonstrated that they were \u201cinterested persons\u201d within the meaning of the probate code. Price asserted that they were not, contending that under ORS 111.005(19),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\u2018\u201cheirs, devisees, children, spouses, [and] creditors\u2019 are all categories of people \u2018having a property right or claim against the estate of a decedent that may be affected by the proceeding.\u2019 It is not enough to merely bear one of those labels: someone who fits within one of those enumerated categories only has standing to the extent that he or she also has property rights that the proceeding may affect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">(Emphasis omitted.) Lotlikar and Ma, meanwhile, contended that they met the statutory definition of \u201cheir\u201d because they would have been entitled to Chin\u2019s property had he died intestate, ORS 111.005(18), and therefore remained \u201cinterested persons\u201d under ORS 111.005(19) even after the estate was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The probate court agreed with Lotlikar and Ma, reaching the following conclusions of law regarding whether they were interested persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>\u201cFaye Lotlikar and Shirley Ma are heirs of the decedent, and they continue to have that status for purposes of the petition to reopen the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">\u201cThe definition of \u2018interested persons\u2019 in ORS 116.233 includes, among other persons, \u2018heirs\u2019 of the decedent. Because Faye Lotlikar and Shirley Ma are heirs of decedent, they are \u2018interested persons\u2019 as defined in ORS 111.005(19) and ORS 116.233.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201cFurther, Faye Lotlikar\u2019s and Shirley Ma\u2019s familial ties to decedent and their desire to vindicate the rights of the decedent\u2019s estate make them \u2018interested persons\u2019 as defined in ORS 111.005(19) and ORS 116.233. Faye Lotlikar and Shirley Ma are \u2018interested persons\u2019 although they did not receive assets under the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cA person does not have to have a financial interest in the estate to be an \u2018interested person\u2019 within the meaning of ORS 111.005(19) and ORS 116.233. The term \u2018interested person\u2019 is defined broadly so that heirs and family members who do not currently have a financial interest in the estate, like Faye Lotlikar and Shirley Ma, can vindicate wrongdoing in connection with the disposition of the estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">(Paragraph lettering omitted.) Having ruled that the petition was properly before it, the probate court then concluded that Lotlikar and Ma had made a <em>prima facie </em>showing of undue influence and elder abuse by Price, such that there was proper cause to reopen the estate under ORS 116.233. The court further concluded that the Gertsches, both of whom were now willing to serve as personal representative, were unsuitable for that role because they were, aligned with Price and did not intend to pursue the claims against him if the estate were reopened. The probate court then appointed an attorney, Whitney Yazzolino, who is the other respondent on appeal, to serve as personal representative, and the court entered a limited judgment memorializing its rulings. Price and the Gertsches now appeal that limited judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">On appeal, the parties\u2019 central dispute is whether Lotlikar and Ma were \u201cinterested persons\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>meaning of ORS 111.005(19).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The answer to that question turns on an issue of statutory construction, which we resolve by applying familiar principles set out in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), and <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). That is, we discern the meaning of ORS 111.005(19) most likely intended by the legislature that enacted it, by examining the text and context of that statute and, where appropriate, legislative history and pertinent canons of construction. <em>Dowell v. Oregon Mutual Ins. Co., </em>361 Or 62, 67, 388 P3d 1050 (2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The text of ORS 111.005(19) presents a classic ambiguity. The legislature may have intended the final phrase of the sentence to apply to all the preceding terms, such that \u201cheirs, devisees, children, spouses, [and] creditors\u201d must \u201chav[e] a property right or claim against the estate of a decedent that may be affected by the proceeding\u201d in order to be \u201cinterested persons.\u201d Reading the statute that way, the terms \u201cheirs,\u201d \u201cdevisees,\u201d \u201cchildren,\u201d \u201cspouses,\u201d and \u201ccreditors\u201d are illustrative of, and clarify, the category of \u201cothers\u201d who might have a qualifying property interest or claim against the estate. <em>See generally Daniel N. Gordon, PC v. Rosenblum, </em>361 Or 352, 365, 393 P3d 1122 (2017) (explaining how examples provide context relevant to terms within a statute even outside the formal structure of <em>ejusdem generis); Johnson v. Gibson, </em>358 Or 624, 629-30, 369 P3d 1151 (2016) (explaining <em>noscitur a sociis </em>textual canon, whereby the meaning of an unclear word may be clarified by other words in context); <em>see also Goodwin v. Kingsmen Plastering, Inc., </em>359 Or 694, 702, 375 P3d 463 (2016) (\u201cCertainly nothing precludes the legislature from employing a measure of redundancy in its statutes; sometimes, that is what it intended\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Alternatively, the legislature may have intended the final phrase to apply only to the immediately preceding term, \u201cany others,\u201d such that \u201cheirs, devisees, children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>spouses, [and] creditors\u201d are, by that status alone, \u201cinterested persons\u201d within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Both readings are plausible based on the text alone. However, we do not construe statutory text in isolation. Viewing the definition of \u201cinterested person\u201d in its broader statutory and historical context, we are persuaded that the legislature intended \u201cinterested person\u201d to include only persons\u2014including heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, and others\u2014who have a claim or property right against the estate that may be affected by the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">As a matter of statutory context, ORS 111.005(19) was enacted as part of a landmark revision to Oregon probate law in 1969. Or Laws 1969, ch 591, \u00a7 1. The preliminary drafts of that revision were prepared by the Advisory Committee on Probate Law Revision and include commentary on particular provisions. As the Advisory Committee explained, their purpose was to simplify the probate laws while continuing to \u201creflect the basic idea of probate to provide an orderly procedure for collecting and distributing the assets of a decedent as speedily as possible, consistent with steps recognized as proper and with due regard to the rights and interests of all persons concerned in an estate.\u201d Commentary to Advisory Committee on Probate Law Revision Proposed Oregon Probate Code, Preliminary Draft, xiv (Dec 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The definition of \u201cinterested person\u201d appears in section 1, paragraph 19, of the preliminary drafts from the Advisory Committee, and it was enacted by the legislature without change as ORS 111.005(19). <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1. According to the committee\u2019s commentary to section 1, the definition of \u201cinterested person\u201d was adapted from a draft of the Uniform Probate Code. <em>Id. </em>(identifying definitions, including for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\u201cinterested person,\u201d that were \u201ctaken or adapted from definitions in the Uniform Probate Code\u201d); <em>id. </em>at xix (stating that \u201cUniform Probate Code\u201d refers to the \u201cThird Working Draft, Uniform Probate Code, With Comments\u201d (Draft Uniform Probate Code) which was then under consideration by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws). That draft defined \u201cinterested person\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">\u201c\u2018Interested person\u2019 includes heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors and any others having a property right in or claim against the estate of a decedent, ward or protected person which may be affected by the proceeding. It also includes fiduciaries representing interested persons. <em>The meaning may vary from time to time and, as to any particular proceeding or part thereof, its meaning must be determined according to the particular purpose and matter involved. </em>In respect to protective proceedings, the term includes the agencies mentioned in Section 5-506.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Draft Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 1-103(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The Draft Uniform Probate Code, as the emphasized text demonstrates, made express the understanding that the meaning of \u201cinterested person\u201d was determined according to the purpose and matter of the proceeding. <em>See also id. </em>at 30 (table illustrating that, in formal probate proceedings, \u201c[interested persons determined by question raised\u201d). In that light, the text that was ultimately imported into ORS 111.005(19)\u2014\u201chaving a property right in or claim against the estate of a decedent, ward or protected person which may be affected by the proceeding\u201d\u2014would have been understood to modify all of the preceding terms, such that \u201cheirs\u201d or \u201cspouses\u201d or \u201ccreditors\u201d would only be interested in a probate proceeding if they had a property right or claim against the estate that may be affected by that proceeding. <em>Accord Estate of Thorne, </em>1997 ME 202, 704 A2d 315, 318 (Maine 1997) (explaining that the definition of \u201cinterested person\u201d in the Uniform Probate Code \u201climit [s] participation in probate proceedings to persons having an interest in the estate at issue. * * * It is thus possible that one may be an \u2018interested person\u2019 for the purpose of one particular probate proceeding but not another. * * * An interested person, however, will always possess an interest in the estate itself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>That understanding of the text of ORS 111.005(19) also better comports with the concept of \u201cinterested person\u201d in Oregon probate law that predated the 1969 revision. Historically, probate laws in this state and. throughout the country required more than generalized grievances or status as a family member in order to be considered an \u201cinterested person.\u201d <em>See Mills v. Feiock, </em>229 Or 618, 625, 368 P2d 327 (1962) (\u201cA relative may or may not be a 'person interested\u2019. Those only may contest the validity of a will who would be entitled to share in the estate of the deceased had he died intestate or should the will be denied probate.\u201d). Indeed, only those persons with a <em>financial </em>interest in an estate were permitted to contest a will in probate proceedings. <em>E.g., In re Estate of Chas. J. Peterson, </em>202 Or 4, 5, 271 P2d 658 (1954) (\u201c[P] etitioners have no standing in court to contest the will in question as under the state of the record they would have no financial interest in the estate.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">There is no indication that the drafters of Oregon\u2019s 1969 revisions intended the dramatic and fundamental shift away from those established notions of an \u201cinterested person,\u201d particularly with regard to will contests, that would result from respondents\u2019 proposed construction of the statute. That is, we are not aware of any legislative history that suggests that the drafters of the 1969 revisions to Oregon\u2019s probate laws intended to define \u201cinterested person\u201d merely in terms of a title or abstract status, or in a way that allows for those persons to vindicate interests other than their property interests or claims against the estate. To the contrary, the legislative history of the related provision of the code regarding will contests, section 98 (later enacted as ORS 113.075), confirms that the drafters were not making such a sweeping change. That section provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u201cSection 98. (Contest of will) When a will has been admitted to probate, any interested person may, at any time within four months after the date of the entry in the court journal of the order of court admitting the will to probate, contest the probate of the will or the validity of the will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The commentary to that provision states, \u201cSection 98 is the same as [the existing statute,] ORS 115.180, except that the time for the will contest has been shortened from six months to four months to conform to the shortening of the period for creditors to file claims from six months to four months.\u201d Commentary at \u00a7 98. If the drafters were proposing a probate code that fundamentally altered the nature of who was entitled to contest a will, we cannot imagine that the commentary and other legislative history would have affirmatively suggested that no significant changes had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Respondents, for their part, do not offer any persuasive contextual or historical arguments in support of such an expansive reading of the \u201cinterested person\u201d definition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, their argument depends largely on a rule of statutory construction\u2014the \u201cdoctrine of the last antecedent\u201d\u2014 which they argue is applicable in this situation. <em>See PGE, </em>317 Or at 611 (in examining the meaning of a statute, we consider \u201crules of statutory construction that bear directly on how to read the text\u201d). Under the doctrine of the last antecedent, \u201c\u2018[Referential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent. The last antecedent is the \u2018last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Webb, </em>324 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Or 380, 386, 927 P2d 79 (1996) (quoting Norman J. Singer, 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.33, 270 (5th ed 1992)). \u201c\u2018[EJvidence that a qualifying phrase is supposed to apply to all antecedents instead of only to the immediately preceding one may be found in the fact that it is separated from the antecedents by a comma.\u2019\u201d 324 Or at 386 (quoting Singer, 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>at 270).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Respondents argue that, in this case, the absence of a comma after the word \u201cothers\u201d is textually significant: \u201cIf the Legislature had intended that all \u2018interested persons\u2019 must have a \u2018property right or claim\u2019 against the estate, then under the Rule of the Last Antecedent, a comma would appear in ORS 111.005(19) between the words \u2018others\u2019 and \u2018having.\u2019\u201d Because that comma does not appear in the statute, respondents argue, \u201cthe \u2018property right or claim\u2019 language only applies to limit the last antecedent: \u2018creditors and any others.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Respondents overlook a commonly recognized limitation on the doctrine of the last antecedent: \u201cWhen several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.\u201d <em>Porto Rico Railway, Light &amp; Power Co. v. Mor, </em>253 US 345, 348, 40 S Ct 516, 64 L Ed 944 (1920). <em>See also Board of Trustees of F. and P. Fund v. Templeton, </em>1939 Ok 53, 184 Okla 281, 86 P2d 1000, 1004 (1939), <em>cited in Johnson v. Craddock et al, </em>228 Or 308, 317, 365 P2d 89 (1961) (\u201cSlight indication of legislative intent so to extend the relative term is sufficient. Where several words are followed by a clause as much applicable to the first and other words as to the last, the clause should be read as applicable to all.\u201d (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted.)); <em>accord </em>Singer, 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>at 270 (\u201cWhere the sense of the entire act requires that a qualifying word or phrase apply to several preceding or even succeeding sections, the word or phrase will not be restricted to its immediate antecedent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In fact, the California Court of Appeals discussed that limitation on the doctrine of the last antecedent in the context of an almost identical statutory construction question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>under California\u2019s probate code. In <em>Lickter v. Lickter, </em>189 Cal App 4th 712, 725, 118 Cal Rptr 3d 123, 133 (2010), the plaintiff, relying on the doctrine of the last antecedent, asserted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">\u201cthat the closing phrase in subdivision (a)(1) of Probate Code section 48\u2014\u2018having a property right in or claim against a trust estate or the estate of a decedent which may be affected by the proceeding\u2019\u2014cannot be read as qualifying all of the terms that precede it\u2014that is, \u2018heir, devisee, child, spouse, creditor, beneficiary, and any other person.\u2019 In their view, the closing phrase qualifies only the term that precedes it immediately\u2014\u2018any other person\u2019\u2014and thus \u2018an heir, devisee, child, spouse or beneficiary is always an \u2018interested person\u2019 under Section 48.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The court rejected that reading of the probate code, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">\u201cThere is an exception to [the doctrine of the last antecedent] , however, which provides that [w]hen several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be applicable to all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">\u201cHere, the phrase \u2018having a property right in or claim against a trust estate or the estate of a decedent which may be affected by the proceeding\u2019 is just as applicable to the more remote preceding terms\u2014\u2018heir, devisee, child, spouse, creditor, beneficiary\u2019\u2014as it is to the immediately preceding term\u2014\u2018any other person.\u2019 Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the last antecedent rule is misplaced because the exception to that rule applies here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 726, 118 Cal Rptr 3d at 133-34 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">The court, in reasoning that is instructive in this case, then proceeded to explain that its understanding of the statute was \u201csupported by the historical understanding of the term \u2018interested person\u2019 in probate proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727, 118 Cal Rptr 3d at 134. Just as in Oregon, \u201cthe concept of an \u2018interested person\u2019 was well developed in California probate law,\u201d and it \u201cincluded the idea that the person had to have an interest of some sort that could be impaired, defeated, or benefitted by the proceeding in question to be \u2018interested\u2019 in that proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finding no \u201creason to conclude that this concept was changed in any way by the enactment\u201d of revisions to the probate code, the court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>that \u201cthe exception to the last antecedent rule, rather than the rule itself, governs,\u201d such that \u201cthe status of \u2018heir,\u2019 by itself, is not enough to make a person an \u2018interested person.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728, 118 Cal Rptr 3d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we reach the same conclusion as the court in <em>Lickter. </em>We hold that the phrase \u201chaving a property right or claim against the estate of a decedent that may be affected by the proceeding\u201d modifies all of the preceding terms in ORS 111.005(19). That is, the \u201cinterest\u201d that makes \u201cheirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors and any others\u201d into \u201cinterested persons\u201d is a \u201cproperty right or claim against the estate of a decedent that may be affected by the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the probate court erred in ruling that Lotlikar and Ma were \u201cinterested persons\u201d based on their \u201cfamilial ties to decedent and their desire to vindicate the rights of the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d The probate laws do not contemplate the vindication of those kinds of rights; rather, their status as interested persons depends on whether Lotlikar or Ma had a property right or claim against Chin\u2019s estate that may be affected by the proceeding to reopen his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Although Lotlikar and Ma primarily claimed a personal interest in vindicating the rights of Chin\u2019s estate, they suggest that they may actually have a financial interest as well. Appellants respond that any claimed financial interest is purely speculative. On the record before us, we agree with appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">As described above, Lotlikar and Ma were \u201cheirs\u201d of their brother\u2019s estate, because they would have been entitled to Chin\u2019s property under intestate succession if he had died intestate. ORS 111.005(18) (\u201c\u2018Heir\u2019 means any person, including the surviving spouse, who is entitled under intestate succession to the property of a decedent who died wholly or partially intestate.\u201d). And, until it was determined that their brother died testate\u2014with a will that did not leave any property to Lotlikar or Ma\u2014they were plainly interested persons, because those intestate property rights depended on the outcome of the proceedings to probate the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>However, Lotlikar and Ma acknowledge that, because Chin\u2019s will was admitted to probate and the time to contest the will elapsed, they \u201care not currently positioned to receive any money from Mr. Chin\u2019s estate.\u201d They further concede that they \u201cdo not currently have plans to seek to invalidate Mr. Chin\u2019s will.\u201d However, they submit that there is a \u201creasonable likelihood that the new personal representative will find documents or other information that will justify setting Mr. Chin\u2019s will aside.\u201d The trial court made a similar observation, stating that \u201c[i]t is possible that [Lotlikar and Ma] may have a financial interest in decedent\u2019s estate,\u201d but that it was \u201cunable to make a more definite finding regarding financial interest because it is unclear whether [Lotlikar and Ma] will seek to have decedent\u2019s will set aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">On this record, we fail to see how there is <em>any </em>likelihood that reopening the estate for an investigation into Price\u2019s alleged misconduct, all of which appears to have occurred over the last few years of Chin\u2019s life, between 2010 and 2012, would provide any basis for invalidating a will that was dated in 2003. As appellants correctly observe, the probate process would be eviscerated if statutory heirs were entitled to reopen final distributions based on mere speculation that grounds for invalidating a probated will could be uncovered. Because there is nothing in this record to suggest that respondents had a property interest or claim against Chin\u2019s estate that may be affected by the proceeding to reopen, the probate court should have dismissed their petition on that ground. We therefore reverse the limited judgment reopening the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\"> ORS 111.005 was amended various times after the probate court\u2019s ruling in this case.

In light of our conclusion that the court erred in ruling that Lotlikar and Ma met the definition of \u201cinterested person,\u201d we do not reach the Gertsches\u2019 alternative contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> In contending that the final phrase does not apply to \u201cheirs,\u201d respondents actually argue that that phrase modifies \u201ccreditors and any others,\u201d but we fail to see how that construction makes any grammatical sense. If the legislature intended to group \u201ccreditors\u201d with \u201cany others,\u201d and to set them off from the rest of the terms in the statute, the word \u201cand\u201d would appear before <em>creditors\u2014i.e., </em>\u201cheirs, devisees, children, spouses, [and] creditors and any others having a property right or claim against the estate of a decedent that may be affected by the proceeding.\u201d Without that type of textual clue, there is no reason to think that the final phrase modifies more than the final term but less than all of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><em> See also In re Carlson\u2019s Estate, </em>153 Or 327, 335, 56 P2d 347 (1936) (\u2018\u201cThe statutes sometimes enumerate those who may contest the validity of wills.
