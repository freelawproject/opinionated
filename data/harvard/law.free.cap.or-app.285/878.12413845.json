On appeal, defendant raises two assignments of error. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, in which he challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences. We write only to address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which he challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of $624 in court-appointed attorney fees in the \u201cabsence of sufficient evidence or a finding of [his] ability to pay.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 151.505(3) (\u201cThe court may not require a person to pay costs under this section unless the person is or may be able to pay the costs.\u201d); ORS 161.665(4) (\u201cThe court may not sentence a defendant to pay costs under this section unless the defendant is or may be able to pay them.\u201d); <em>State v. Pendergrapht, </em>251 Or App 630, 633, 284 P3d 573 (2012) (a court lacks authority to require a defendant to pay attorney fees unless it has determined that the defendant is or may be able to pay them); <em>see also State v. Kanuch, </em>231 Or App 20, 24, 217 P3d 1082 (2009) (the state \u201cbears the burden of persuasion and the obligation to make a record\u201d regarding a defendant\u2019s ability to pay attorney fees). Although the asserted error is unpreserved, defendant urges us to review and correct it as plain error. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1); <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">We agree with defendant that, on the record here, the court committed plain error in imposing attorney fees in the absence of evidence that defendant \u201cis or may be able\u201d to pay them. <em>See State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (the burden is on the state to prove that a defendant is or may be able to pay costs, and it is plain error to impose such costs in the absence of evidence of ability to pay); <em>see also State v. Brown, </em>272 Or App 321, 355 P3d 129 (2015) (concluding that the trial court committed plain error under similar circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Furthermore, for the reasons articulated in <em>Coverstone, </em>we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the plain error under the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>of this case. 260 Or App at 716-17. In particular, in light of the amount of the fees, the length of the sentence, and the lack of any evidence regarding defendant\u2019s financial status at the time of sentencing, we conclude that the gravity of the error weighs in favor of correcting the error. <em>See id.; see also State v. Hunt, </em>271 Or App 347, 350 P3d 521 (2015) (exercising discretion to correct plain error for those reasons under similar circumstances). Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the judgment requiring defendant to pay $624 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
