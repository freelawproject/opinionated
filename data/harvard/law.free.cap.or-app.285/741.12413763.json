Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (holding that a trial court commits plain error by imposing court-appointed attorney fees where the record is silent as to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the fees ordered). For an error to be plain error, it must be an error of law, obvious and not reasonably in dispute, and apparent on the record without requiring the court to choose among competing inferences. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The state disputes the presence of \u201cplain error,\u201d arguing that, because \u201cthe record reflects that defendant owned a truck,\u201d it is at least \u201creasonably in dispute\u201d that defendant \u201cis or may be able to pay\u201d the \u201crelatively small sum of $80,\u201d and because defendant\u2019s \u201capplication for court-appointed [counsel] may have included information concerning his ability to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">We conclude that the trial court plainly erred in imposing attorney fees because there is no affirmative indication that the court made the determination required by statute, and the record is silent as to defendant\u2019s ability to pay. <em>State v. Runnels, </em>283 Or App 512, 515-16, 390 P3d 1120 (2017). The mere fact that defendant \u201cowned a truck\u201d does not demonstrate an ability to pay, and the record does not contain defendant\u2019s application for court-appointed counsel. Accordingly, the record was silent as to defendant\u2019s ability to pay and the court committed plain error by imposing attorney fees in that circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">We also conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct that error because the fee amount is sufficiently grave when considered with other provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>of the judgment\u2014specifically, the imposition of $500 in fines, a provision that the court would automatically impose a \u201cpayment schedule assessment fee\u201d if defendant did not pay his monetary obligations within 30 days, and a provision that defendant pay a \u201c28 percent collection referral fee\u201d if the obligation is referred to a collection agency. <em>See State v. Housego, </em>276 Or App 550, 552, 368 P3d 62 (2016) (exercising discretion in similar circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
