He argues that the search was not a valid search incident to arrest and that it was not a lawful inventory. The state agrees with defendant on both points, and concedes that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s suppression motion. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
