In the underlying criminal case, a jury convicted petitioner of various offenses arising from allegations that he had beaten his 14-year-old daughter with a wooden board and subjected her to other assaultive conduct. During petitioner\u2019s trial, the court repeatedly interrupted the proceedings to chastise defense counsel, address witnesses, and instruct the jury, usually without prompting by the prosecution or defense counsel. Petitioner argues that, because those unilateral actions disproportionately favored the prosecution and, therefore, conveyed to the jury the impression of judicial bias, that conduct deprived him of a fair trial. Petitioner contends that, as a result, his attorney\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial in response to the court\u2019s actions constituted inadequate assistance of counsel. Defendant superintendent<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> disputes petitioner\u2019s assertion that the trial court\u2019s actions were inappropriate but argues that, in any event, the post-conviction court did not err in concluding that petitioner had not been prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to take corrective action. Because we conclude that defense counsel\u2019s inaction resulted in a substantial denial of petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to adequate assistance of counsel, we reverse the judgment of the post-conviction court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The material facts are procedural and undisputed. Petitioner\u2019s convictions arose from two separate incidents involving his teenage daughter, A. In the first incident, the state charged petitioner with assault in the second degree, felony assault in the fourth degree, and criminal mistreatment, all for disciplining A with \u201cboarding\u201d\u2014striking her on the buttocks and legs with a wooden board. Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>did not deny using a board to discipline his daughter, but denied that his actions had been criminal. As a defense to those charges, petitioner argued that ORS 161.205(1) rendered his conduct lawful because, as a parent, he had used only the degree of physical force reasonably \u201cnecessary to maintain discipline or to promote the welfare\u201d of A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to raising a reasonable-discipline defense, petitioner argued that the state had not proved certain elements of the charges arising from that incident, including that the board that he had used had been a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d within the meaning of ORS 163.175(l)(b) (defining offense of assault in the second degree),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that another of his children had witnessed the alleged felony assault in the fourth degree, without which that alleged conduct would at most constitute a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the second incident, petitioner purportedly \u201cbumped\u201d A into a wall as they walked past each other, leading to a separate misdemeanor charge of assault in the fourth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">In the course of petitioner\u2019s trial, the court repeatedly interrupted defense counsel and certain witnesses. The court first interrupted defendant\u2019s attorney shortly into his opening statement. Counsel appears to have been explaining to the jury that petitioner could not be found guilty of assault in the second degree unless he was shown to have used a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: First off, you\u2019re going to have the\u2014he\u2019s charged with Assault in the Second Degree, that\u2019s the big one here. That\u2019s the physical injury with a dangerous or deadly weapon, very serious charge. This is a charge you get when you put a bullet in somebody or when you put someone in a wheelchair, okay? Serious physical injury\u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The court abruptly intervened <em>sua sponte, </em>leading to the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: You know, I\u2019m going to\u2014ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019m going to interrupt at this point in time. Physical injury does not require a bullet in somebody or putting them in a wheelchair, and I think I\u2019d better instruct you because I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t want us to be off on a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I was talking about the dangerous weapon, what a dangerous weapon is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I apologize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Physical injury does not require the same\u2014it does not have the same requirements. Maybe I should instruct you even so, so we don\u2019t have any issues here regarding that matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Following that exchange, the trial court instructed the jury by reading various uniform jury instructions defining the terms \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d \u201cphysical injury,\u201d and \u201cserious physical injury.\u201d The court then reminded the jurors that they were not to attempt to apply that law to the facts until the conclusion of the trial and allowed defense counsel to continue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The court again interrupted during the eviden-tiary portion of the trial. Petitioner\u2019s 18-year-old son, who had been a minor at the time of the \u201cboarding\u201d incident, was alleged to have witnessed that offense, but testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>in support of petitioner. In response to cross-examination by the prosecutor on another matter,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the son replied, \u201cI do not remember.\u201d Again without provocation, the trial court stepped in, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, I\u2019d [implore] you\u2014let me tell you, Mr. Maney\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014you\u2019re here under oath, I expect you to tell the truth, the whole truth, and the whole truth only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t want\u2014expect you to sort of scat around, <em>you may want to consider that question and answer it again, </em>if you would.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">(Emphasis added.) Two questions later, the court again interrupted the same witness\u2014once again without prompting\u2014 this time to instruct the witness not to volunteer information beyond the specific questions he had been asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The court later interrupted petitioner himself during his direct testimony. Petitioner\u2019s attorney had asked him to look at pictures of his daughter\u2019s injuries and to provide his opinion as to whether he \u201cwent a little too far this time.\u201d Petitioner answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: I made the decision based on what I knew at the time. The pictures, as you\u2019ve seen, they show bruises. They don\u2019t show any\u2014any physical injury other than contusions in the skin, although I have a little question about the last two. *** [I]f my remembrance is right these last two * * * were taken a day later. Well, obviously the bruises you see on the date that she left are much more apparent than these two. And I\u2019m saying this because of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I think we\u2019ll just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: \u2014the severity\u2014my\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Just a moment, * * * I think we\u2019re going to let the attorneys argue * * * to the jury. I don\u2019t think we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>need the witnesses making arguments so * * * if you have questions you wish to ask this witness, [counsel], please go ahead and ask those questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Defense counsel acknowledged the court\u2019s comments, but the admonition continued: \u201cI\u2019ve let a little bit beyond what I would consider to be appropriate cross-examination <em>[sic] </em>where * * * \u2018you just tell the jury whatever you want to tell them,\u2019 that\u2019s not an appropriate question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Finally, the trial court repeatedly interrupted defense counsel in the course of his closing argument. The first such interruption came when counsel was explaining the reasonable-discipline defense, which, as noted, permits a parent or similarly situated person to use <em>\u201creasonable </em>physical force * * * when and to the extent the person <em>reasonably believes </em>it necessary\u201d for the discipline or welfare of a child under the person\u2019s care or supervision. ORS 161.205(1)(a) (emphases added). Counsel explained that the issue of \u201cwhen and to the extent the person reasonably believes it necessary\u201d required the jurors to ask themselves, \u201cWell, what was [petitioner] thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The trial court abruptly stopped counsel and requested a sidebar, after which it permitted counsel to continue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The following argument and subsequent interruption ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Anyhow, the judge is going to read this to you, but pay close attention. Two parts to this, one part kind of talks about what the person reasonably believes is necessary, and the first part just says \u2018may use reasonable physical force on a minor.\u2019 So it seems to have the objective reasonable person standard. And a part that talks about, well, what did the person think at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: It\u2019s still the reasonable person standard, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>Right.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Now, [counsel], <em>I\u2019m not going to allow you to confuse the jury here. </em>I told you before and I\u2019ll tell you again: Reasonable person is the standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Another interruption followed shortly thereafter, as defense counsel prepared to read the legal definition of \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d to the jury. The court interjected, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me read them that, and you just make your argument, [counsel]? *** [L]adies and gentlemen. Wait a minute. My responsibility is to instruct you as to the law. You can make whatever argument within the range of that, but let\u2019s just let me instruct them, and you just go ahead and argue the <em>law\u2014argue what you think it\u2019s going to be\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">(Emphasis added.) Notably, the trial court had permitted the prosecutor to read various instructions to the jury without interruption or correction, including the same \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d instruction that the court would not allow defense counsel to read.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The court intervened twice more during closing argument. First, on its own motion, the court stopped defense counsel from discussing evidence that had been ruled inadmissible. The court offered to strike that portion of the argument, and the prosecutor agreed. Second, as defense counsel neared the end of his argument, he urged the jurors to remain impartial, even though they \u201cmight want to throw the book at [petitioner],\u201d as he was \u201csure * * * [the prosecutor had] felt when she charged all these crimes.\u201d As the prosecutor objected and began to argue that counsel\u2019s argument was improper, the court interrupted and emphatically agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">\u201cIt is not [an] appropriate comment, ladies and gentlemen. * * * <em>I normally don\u2019t invade to this degree, </em>but actually the grand jury of Wasco County, I believe, returned the indictment * * * not that the State does not have an involvement in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">\u201cBut what [the prosecutor]'s decisions and choices are\u2014 this is the grand jury that made this decision on how [petitioner] should be charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>All told, the trial court made a number of comments that potentially reflected negatively on defense counsel and the merits of petitioner\u2019s defenses over the course of a two-day trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the conclusion of trial, the jury found petitioner guilty of the assault and criminal mistreatment charges arising from the \u201cboarding\u201d incident, and further found him guilty of harassment as a lesser-included offense of the misdemeanor assault charge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Following an unsuccessful appeal, <em>see State v. Maney, </em>244 Or App 1, 260 P3d 547 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 545 (2012), petitioner filed for post-conviction relief under ORS 138.510. Petitioner alleged, among other things, that trial counsel had performed inadequately by \u201cfailing] to move for a mistrial based on the judge\u2019s hostile conduct toward the defense, displayed on multiple occasions in front of the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The post-conviction court denied petitioner relief after concluding that his attorney had not been inadequate and that counsel\u2019s performance at trial had not prejudiced petitioner. The post-conviction court\u2019s written \u201cfindings and conclusions\u201d included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201cAdmonition to petitioner] and children not excessive and does not show hostility to petitioner\u2019s cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201cAfter sidebar att[orney] continues to argue about what petitioner] thought and [court] does admonish him that the standard is that of a reasonable person. Does not demonstrate hostility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\"*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cAfter considering all of the issues, this court finds no inadequacy and no prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Based on those determinations, the post-conviction court denied relief on petitioner\u2019s inadequate assistance of counsel claim. Petitioner now appeals that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">To obtain post-conviction relief, a petitioner must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a \u201csubstantial denial\u201d of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights during the proceedings that resulted in conviction. <em>Green v. Franke, </em>357 Or 301, 311, 350 P3d 188 (2015) (citing ORS 138.530(1)(a)). We review the denial of post-conviction relief for errors of law. <em>Id. </em>at 312 (citing <em>Peiffer v. Hoyt, </em>339 Or 649, 660, 125 P3d 734 (2005)). We must accept the post-conviction court\u2019s express and implicit factual findings if there is evidence to support them. <em>Montez v. Czerniak, </em>355 Or 1, 8, 322 P3d 487, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>355 Or 598, 330 P3d 595 (2014). With those standards in mind, we proceed to consider the decision of the post-conviction court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Petitioner seeks relief on the ground that he received inadequate assistance of counsel in violation of Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The right to counsel is violated when an attorney fails to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment, and the defendant suffers prejudice as a result. <em>Lichau v. Baldwin, </em>333 Or 350, 359, 39 P3d 851 (2002). Petitioner contends that his trial attorney performed inadequately by failing to move for a mistrial in response to the trial court\u2019s unilateral actions and that, as a result, he did not receive a fair trial. We thus consider whether an attorney exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have believed that a motion for mistrial was warranted under the circumstances, and whether an appropriate motion \u201c\u2018could have tended to affect\u2019\u201d the outcome of petitioner\u2019s case. <em>Green, </em>357 Or at 323 (quoting <em>Lichau, </em>333 Or at 365); <em>Burdge v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 490, 493, 112 P3d 320 (2005). In conducting that inquiry, \u201cwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>make every effort to evaluate a lawyer\u2019s conduct from the lawyer\u2019s perspective at the time, without the distorting effects of hindsight.\u201d <em>Burdge, </em>338 Or at 492 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The underlying premise of petitioner\u2019s post-conviction claim is that the court\u2019s actions denied him a fair trial by giving the jury the impression that the court was biased against him. In assessing counsel\u2019s perspective, then, we consider whether the circumstances would have indicated to all reasonable counsel that petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial was at risk. <em>See Pachl v. Zenon, </em>145 Or App 350, 361, 929 P2d 1088 (1996), <em>rev den, </em>325 Or 621 (1997) (recognizing that trial counsel\u2019s duty to object to potentially prejudicial conduct depends largely on whether that conduct does, in fact, impair the defendant\u2019s fair-trial rights); <em>see also Simpson v. Coursey, </em>224 Or App 145, 153-54, 197 P3d 68 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 184 (2009) (stating that, because \u201cthere was still a risk that the jury would be improperly influenced\u201d by vouching testimony, trial counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to guard against that risk by moving to strike the testimony and requesting a curative instruction constituted a failure to exercise reasonable skill and judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The essence of petitioner\u2019s \u201cfair trial\u201d argument appears to be the right to trial by an impartial jury, which, like the right to counsel, is guaranteed by Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution. \u201c[T]rial by an \u2018impartial jury\u2019 means trial by a jury that is not biased in favor of or against either party, but is influenced in making its decision only by evidence produced at trial and legal standards provided by the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Amini, </em>331 Or 384, 391, 15 P3d 541 (2000). If a jury is exposed to improper conduct so prejudicial as to deny the defendant a fair trial, the appropriate remedy is a new trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State v. Logston, </em>270 Or App 296, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>303, 347 P3d 352 (2015) (citing <em>State v. Rosenbohm, </em>237 Or App 646, 649, 241 P3d 344 (2010), and reversing conviction due to prosecutor\u2019s improper jury argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\">In <em>State v. Mains, </em>295 Or 640, 664, 669 P2d 1112 (1983), the Supreme Court recognized that improper judicial conduct may result in jury bias. In that case, a trial judge openly displayed disdain for the testimony of two defense experts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On review, the Supreme Court reasoned that the judge\u2019s questions and comments had reflected his \u201ccontempt for the * * * testimony and went beyond the bounds of proper judicial control of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. Those questions and comments\u2014especially the judge\u2019s pointed question, \u201c[Y]ou realize that you are under oath, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u2014\u201ctended to * * * embarrass\u201d the witnesses and to weaken their credibility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In concluding that the trial court had overstepped its bounds, the Supreme Court expressed its concern that the jury would be influenced by the attitude of the trial judge, rather than by the evidence and the arguments of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 659. The court reasoned that \u201c[e]xcessive intervention by a trial judge substantially diminishes the effectiveness of the adversary system and may deprive a litigant of [the] right to an impartially administered trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In support of that reasoning, the court noted that ORCP 59 E provides that \u201c[t]he judge shall not instruct with respect to matters of fact, nor comment thereon,\u201d and further observed that the Oregon Rules of Evidence lack the equivalent of FRE 614, which, in jurisdictions that have such a rule, gives judges explicit power to call and question witnesses. <em>Id. </em>In the court\u2019s view, those provisions of Oregon law expressed the legislature\u2019s apparent trust in an adversary system in which the parties, and not the trial court, test the witnesses\u2019 testimony. <em>Id. </em>As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cThe judge is not a litigant, nor a witness, and above all, not an advocate for either side. Therefore, we believe that judicial intervention before a jury should be kept within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>bounds, and <em>the judicial questioning of witnesses or admonition of counsel in the presence of a jury </em>should be a rare occurrence. Almost any question the judge may pose is fraught with the danger of giving the impression to the jury that the judge is an advocate for one of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 658 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Although the court in <em>Mains </em>concluded that thp trial court had overstepped its bounds, the court ultimately held that that conduct constituted harmless error in light of the \u201cprobable impact of the judge\u2019s conduct on the minds of the jurors.\u201d 295 Or at 664. Because the judge\u2019s comments and questions had related to \u201cperipheral issues\u201d and the judge had otherwise conducted the 24-witness, 10-day trial with \u201ccomplete impartiality and judicial skill,\u201d the court found it unlikely that the error would have changed the result of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\"><em>Mains </em>does not suggest that every question a judge may ask of a witness or every statement made to counsel risks improperly influencing the jury. A court enjoys \u201cbroad discretion to control the proceedings before it.\u201d <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 300, 4 P3d 1261 (2000). Appropriate judicial conduct includes intervening as needed \u201cto conduct a proper, expeditious and just trial.\u201d <em>Mains, </em>295 Or at 656. Even direct admonishment of counsel may be necessary to control a trial. <em>See State v. Matson, </em>120 Or 666, 670, 253 P 527 (1927). A judge must not, however, \u201ctake on the role of counsel, nor appear to align [the court] with any litigant.\u201d <em>Mains, </em>295 Or at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Various decisions from this and other jurisdictions suggest that whether a jury has been improperly influenced by a trial court\u2019s appearance of bias or advocacy is a contextual inquiry. <em>See id.; see </em>also, <em>e.g., State v. Coss, </em>53 Or 462, 475, 101 P 193 (1909); <em>United States v. DeLuca, </em>692 F2d 1277, 1282 (9th Cir 1982); <em>People v. Stevens, </em>498 Mich 162, 170-78, 869 NW2d 233, 241-46 (2015), <em>cert </em>den,_US_, 136 S Ct 811 (2016) (applying a totality-of-the-circumstances test). Among the relevant considerations are the nature and tone of the judge\u2019s involvement, the relative extent of judicial intervention given the overall length and complexity of the trial, whether the court\u2019s comments were made in response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>to attorney misconduct, and the number and adequacy of any curative instructions that the court may have given. If, in light of those considerations, there is \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the verdict was affected by the trial court\u2019s actions, then the defendant did not suffer prejudice and, therefore, was not denied a fair trial. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003); <em>see also Mains, </em>295 Or at 664 (citing <em>State v. Van Hooser, </em>266 Or 19, 25-26, 511 P2d 359 (1973), and applying the <em>pre-Davis </em>standard for harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">We must evaluate the alleged inadequacy of defense counsel\u2019s <em>performance </em>and the resulting prejudice, if any, in that context. That is, given the trial court\u2019s actions and the arguments available to counsel under the circumstances, would every attorney exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment have concluded that those actions had given the jury an impression of judicial bias sufficient to deny petitioner the right to a fair trial, and moved for a mistrial in response? Or, in the words of the Supreme Court, would all reasonable counsel have concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, petitioner was harmed by the \u201cprobable impact of the judge\u2019s conduct on the minds of the jurors\u201d and taken corrective measures? <em>Mains, </em>295 Or at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">When considering the constitutional adequacy of a defense attorney\u2019s performance, we bear in mind that \u201c[t]he constitution gives no defendant the right to a perfect defense [.] \u201d <em>Krummacher v. Gierloff, </em>290 Or 867, 875, 627 P2d 458 (1981). That is to say, we will not \u201csecond-guess a lawyer\u2019s tactical decisions in the name of the constitution unless those decisions reflect an absence or suspension of professional skill and judgment.\u201d <em>Gorham v. Thompson, </em>332 Or 560, 567, 34 P3d 161 (2001). However, the failure to recognize that \u201cinfluences in the courtroom are so inherently prejudicial that a fair trial is at risk,\u201d and to take action in response, is not an acceptable tactical or professional choice. <em>See Pachl, </em>145 Or App at 361; <em>see also Simpson, </em>224 Or App at 153. We proceed with those considerations in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In isolation, the trial court\u2019s first interruption of counsel\u2014occurring, as it did, during his opening statement\u2014 would likely be of little significance to attorneys exercising reasonable skill and judgment. As petitioner points out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the court intervened <em>sua sponte. </em>And, under the circumstances, counsel\u2019s argument about the meaning of \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d was probably more confusing than outright erroneous; thus, the court\u2019s unprompted interjection could be viewed as being unnecessarily critical of counsel and his grasp of the law. Nonetheless, given that the interruption came early in the trial\u2014when, as the court noted, it was not time for the jury to apply the law\u2014reasonable counsel is unlikely to have viewed the court\u2019s efforts to control the proceedings and ensure that the jurors were correctly instructed as conveying a message of favoritism toward the prosecution. <em>Cf. Mains, </em>295 Or at 656 (\u201cCertainly, it is appropriate for a judge to * * * eliminate argument in opening statements [.] \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\">Somewhat more noteworthy is the court\u2019s next intervention on behalf of the state, when the court reminded petitioner\u2019s son that he was under oath and admonished him not to \u201cscat around\u201d in his answers. To be sure, the warning of a witness about the oath after a series of evasive responses or a clear refusal to answer appropriate questions is unlikely to provoke much response from even the most vigilant of counsel. Here, however, the trial court\u2019s unsolicited admonition in response to the answer, \u201cI do not remember,\u201d carried with it a substantial risk that the jury would perceive the judge as personally distrusting petitioner\u2019s witness. <em>See Mains, </em>295 Or at 655 (court\u2019s pointed reference to oath tended to embarrass expert witness and weaken his credibility). That is especially true given the court\u2019s suggestion that petitioner\u2019s son reconsider his previous response. And, notably, the court\u2019s interruption came just as the prosecutor was questioning him about typical disciplinary practices in petitioner\u2019s household, a context that the jury was likely to have considered highly significant when evaluating petitioner\u2019s conduct. Because that testimony favored petitioner\u2019s case, reasonable counsel would have recognized that the trial court\u2019s decision to single it out for reproach had the potential to weaken petitioner\u2019s reasonable-discipline defense in the eyes of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Similarly, the jury may well have perceived the trial court\u2019s disparate treatment of petitioner\u2019s own testimony as favoring the prosecution. Earlier in the trial, the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>allowed petitioner\u2019s wife\u2014over defense counsel\u2019s objection\u2014 to express <em>her </em>opinion regarding the nature and propriety of petitioner\u2019s disciplinary practices. In defense of that ruling, the court had stated, \u201cI think she has a right to an opinion on this. She\u2019s a participant in discussing with him the boarding * * Whether or not it was proper for petitioner to express his own opinion on the severity and reasonableness of the \u201cboarding\u201d incident, the court\u2019s selective and unilateral decision to bar petitioner, but not the victim\u2019s mother, from giving that testimony could well have conveyed a judicial preference for the state\u2019s view of the case, a risk that counsel should have recognized. That message would likely have been reinforced when the court unfairly characterized the questions that defense counsel had asked petitioner as being nothing more than \u201cyou just tell the jury whatever you want to tell them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">As noted, the belittling of petitioner\u2019s attorney continued into his closing, putting petitioner\u2019s defense in an even more negative light, and yet counsel voiced no objection. In fact, when the trial court abruptly cut short his argument about the reasonable-discipline defense, counsel\u2019s only response was to acknowledge the court\u2019s impromptu charge to the jury that the defense contemplated a reasonable-person standard. Still dissatisfied, the court again berated him, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u201cNow, [counsel], <em>I\u2019m not going to allow you to confuse the jury here. </em>I told you before and I\u2019ll tell you again: Reasonable person is the standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">(Emphasis added.) As with counsel\u2019s opening statement, it is largely immaterial whether counsel or the court had the more correct view of the law. More significant for purposes of petitioner\u2019s post-conviction claim is the manner in which the court approached the issue and how competent counsel would have been expected to respond. By telling counsel that it would not allow him to confuse the jury, the court risked signifying to the jurors its belief that counsel was, in fact, trying to mislead them, yet counsel made no effort to counter that message.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The same risks arose from the trial court\u2019s second interruption of counsel\u2019s closing, which once again provoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>no response. Much as it had allowed the state, but not the defense, to introduce testimony regarding \u201creasonableness,\u201d the court during closing permitted the prosecutor, but not defense counsel, to read the legal definition of \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d As with counsel\u2019s articulation of the reasonable-discipline defense, his argument was not a model of clarity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But in its eagerness to control defense counsel\u2019s argument, the court once again risked signaling to the jury its distrust of petitioner\u2019s case. Such a message could have diminished counsel\u2019s ability to persuade the jury considerably, thereby significantly increasing the risk that petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial would be affected. <em>Cf. State v. Knight, </em>343 Or 469, 483, 173 P3d 1210 (2007) (stating that, because the jury had been exposed to the defendant\u2019s harsh criticism of his own attorney, \u201c[n]o juror thereafter was going to view defense counsel as more credible and persuasive than the prosecuting attorney\u201d). Moreover, because it had allowed the prosecutor to read substantially the same instruction that it refused to let defense counsel read, the court could also have given the \u201cimpression to the jury that the judge [was] an advocate for one of the parties,\u201d substantially undermining petitioner\u2019s position. <em>Mains, </em>295 Or at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\">Having reviewed those actions of the trial court, we next consider whether, in light of those actions, the post-conviction court correctly concluded that trial counsel was not deficient in failing to respond by moving for a mistrial. Here, petitioner contends that any attorney exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have objected or moved for a mistrial in response to the court\u2019s improper comments and questions throughout the trial. In response, the superintendent does not suggest that counsel recognized the potential effect of the trial court\u2019s actions but made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>strategic choice not to respond. Instead, the state argues that counsel could reasonably have considered the court\u2019s actions to be proper and, accordingly, neither objectionable nor grounds for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In support of that reasoning, the superintendent relies on an affidavit signed by counsel and submitted to the post-conviction court, in which counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u201cI had observed the trial court judge\u2019s demeanor in other trials and knew of his reputation as a judge that interjects during trial more so than other judges. I did not believe that his conduct warranted a mistrial, nor did I believe he would grant a motion for a mistrial based on his own interjections during [petitioner] \u215b trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">On appeal, the superintendent echoes counsel\u2019s beliefs and contends that a motion for mistrial was unwarranted \u201cin light of the demanding standards for proving judicial bias.\u201d But other than the concise explanation in counsel\u2019s affidavit, the superintendent offers no substantial justification for the belief that a mistrial was unwarranted and would, therefore, have been denied, nor does the superintendent separately seek to justify counsel\u2019s failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">As noted, the post-conviction court denied petitioner relief due to its determinations that, contrary to petitioner\u2019s allegations, the trial court\u2019s admonition of petitioner and his son was \u201cnot excessive and [did] not show hostility to [his] cause,\u201d and that the court\u2019s admonition of counsel regarding the applicable legal standard \u201c[did] not demonstrate hostility.\u201d As a result, the post-conviction court concluded that defense counsel\u2019s representation had not been inadequate or prejudiced petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">In light of the foregoing discussion, we cannot agree with the post-conviction court\u2019s conclusion that counsel performed adequately. As detailed above, several of the trial court\u2019s statements appear to have crossed lines that the Supreme Court drew in <em>Mains </em>many years before petitioner\u2019s trial. <em>See Clark v. Nooth, </em>284 Or App 762, 769-70, 395 P3d 32 (2017) (explaining the relevance of existing decisional law in evaluating counsel\u2019s performance). It is not necessary for us to decide whether all reasonable counsel would have concluded that each of those statements warranted a response. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>That is because we conclude that, at least cumulatively, the court\u2019s actions would have alerted any reasonable attorney that defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was at risk and that there was a need for counsel to bring that risk to the court\u2019s attention through an appropriate motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\">Specifically, as our account of petitioner\u2019s trial reveals, by its conclusion, the court had repeatedly\u2014and unilaterally\u2014intervened on behalf of the state, weakened the credibility of a significant defense witness, afforded preferential treatment to a state\u2019s witness, and conveyed the court\u2019s apparent belief that defense counsel was an unreliable and perhaps untrustworthy advocate. Any attorney exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have recognized the potential that those actions had to prejudice the jury and, as a result, petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial. Accordingly, to the extent that counsel\u2019s averment that he did not believe a mistrial was warranted suggests his understanding that the trial court\u2019s conduct was not potentially prejudicial, that understanding was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Furthermore, having recognized that the court\u2019s actions had the potential to deprive petitioner of a fair trial, competent counsel would have taken appropriate steps to keep that from happening. And, at least by the conclusion of trial, the proper step for defense counsel was to seek a mistrial. Cf<em>. Logston, </em>270 Or App at 303 (proper remedy for the denial of a fair trial is a new trial). Counsel may justifiably have believed that this particular judge would not declare a mistrial, but that belief did not justify inaction. Despite counsel\u2019s belief that the trial court would deny his motion, it remained his duty to take appropriate action on behalf of his client, regardless of its likelihood of immediate success. <em>See Walraven v. Premo, </em>277 Or App 264, 283, 372 P3d 1 (2016) (\u201c[W]hether an objection to the instruction would have been successful with a particular trial judge is also irrelevant; an objection would have * * * preserved the error [.] \u201d); <em>Haynes v. State of Oregon, </em>121 Or App 395, 397-99, 845 P2d 949 (1993) (rejecting argument that trial counsel reasonably failed to object to jury instruction that raised a substantial appellate issue, but that arguably complied with existing law, because \u201ca competent defense attorney at least would have raised the issue * * <em>* </em>and preserved it for appellate review\u201d). Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>circumstances of this case, counsel\u2019s inaction did not reflect an exercise of reasonable professional skill and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\">Our conclusion that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient takes us to our final inquiry: whether petitioner suffered prejudice as a result. We conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to act did prejudice petitioner. Prejudice occurs when trial counsel\u2019s inadequate performance \u201c\u2018could have tended to affect\u2019\u201d the outcome of the case. <em>Green, </em>357 Or at 323 (quoting <em>Lichau, </em>333 Or at 365). \u201c[T]he tendency to affect the outcome standard demands more than a mere possibility, but less than a probability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322. That determination involves \u201can extensive consideration of the evidence presented by both the state and petitioner at the criminal trial,\u201d as well as \u201cany other aspects of the criminal trial that are pertinent to the issue * * * considered in light of the issues at trial in their entirety[.]\u201d <em>Wright v. Nooth, </em>264 Or App 329, 334, 336 P3d 1, <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 517 (alterations in original; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Here, the superintendent reasons that petitioner could not have been prejudiced because the court was unlikely to have granted a mistrial. But that argument falls short. As petitioner correctly argues, the operative question is not whether the court would have granted a mistrial; the operative question is whether the court\u2019s response to an appropriate objection or motion, whatever that response might have been, would have tended to affect the outcome of petitioner\u2019s case. <em>See Green, </em>357 Or at 323; <em>Walraven, </em>277 Or App at 283 (\u201c[A]n objection would have *** likely yielded a reversible error on appeal[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">When a defendant in a criminal case moves for a mistrial in response to arguably prejudicial conduct, the trial court has the discretion \u201cto grant the motion, to cure the effect of inappropriate conduct or testimony by giving a proper instruction instead, or to do nothing at all.\u201d <em>State v. Evans, </em>211 Or App 162, 164, 154 P3d 166 (2007), <em>aff'd, </em>344 Or 358, 182 P3d 175 (2008). However, if the right to a fair trial has been compromised, then \u201cthe trial court <em>must </em>take corrective action, provided defense counsel objects.\u201d <em>Warren v. Baldwin, </em>140 Or App 318, 330, 915 P2d 1016, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 229 (1996) (emphasis added). The trial court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>is reviewable for an abuse of discretion, taking into consideration the seriousness of the prejudice and the manner in which the court sought to cure the error, <em>see Evans, </em>211 Or App at 166-69 (listing cases), with the \u201cdecisive issue [being] whether defendant\u2019s ability to receive a fair trial was impaired,\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>119 Or App 424, 427, 850 P2d 1158, <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 486 (1993). <em>Accord State v. Bowen, </em>340 Or 487, 508, 135 P3d 272 (2006), <em>cert den, </em>549 US 1214 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Thus, had petitioner\u2019s attorney moved for a mistrial, it would have been incumbent upon the trial court to determine whether petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial had been impaired, and, if so, to take appropriate corrective action. <em>Warren, </em>140 Or App at 330. As noted above, 285 Or App at 607-08, that assessment\u2014which focuses on the likelihood that the jury has been improperly influenced in the course of trial\u2014considers the nature and tone of the trial judge\u2019s involvement, the degree of judicial intervention given the overall length and complexity of the trial, whether the court\u2019s comments were made in response to counsel\u2019s misconduct, and the number and adequacy of any curative instructions that may have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">As is apparent from our description of petitioner\u2019s trial, the nature and tone of the court\u2019s comments varied measurably. At times, the court addressed the jury merely to clarify the law, as it did during petitioner\u2019s opening. At other times, however, the court addressed its comments to petitioner\u2019s counsel or his witnesses, often in a manner that the jury may have viewed as belittling, distrustful, and one-sided. In light of that behavior, the jury might well have concluded that the court found petitioner\u2019s attorney and witnesses unreliable at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">We note that the post-conviction court at least implicitly considered this factor in determining that the trial court had not displayed \u201chostility\u201d to petitioner or his cause. In our view, however, by focusing on hostility\u2014an understandable focus, given the allegations of the petition\u2014 the post-conviction court took too narrow a view. A jury may be influenced by a court\u2019s attitude, whether or not that attitude is \u201chostile.\u201d Accordingly, the post-conviction court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>determination that the court in petitioner\u2019s case did not show hostility does not mean that the nature and tone of the court\u2019s comments had no tendency to influence the jury\u2019s decision. Thus, to the extent that the post-conviction court\u2019s finding of no \u201chostility\u201d reflects its conclusion that the trial court would necessarily have had grounds to deny a timely mistrial motion, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Next, in response to a timely motion, the trial court might have recognized that, because petitioner\u2019s trial was relatively short and straightforward, the court\u2019s intervention was substantial, given the overall length and complexity of the trial. Unlike <em>Mains, </em>where the trial judge conducted the better part of a 10-day trial with \u201ccomplete impartiality and judicial skill,\u201d 295 Or at 662, here the court took an active role throughout petitioner\u2019s trial. Moreover, by suggesting that counsel did not understand the defense that he had raised\u2014or that he might even be purposely misstating the applicable law\u2014the court\u2019s comments risked damaging defense counsel\u2019s credibility on the issues that were most critical to petitioner\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">For example, for petitioner to be acquitted on the second-degree assault charge\u2014by far the most serious charge he faced\u2014counsel had to persuade the jury that his view of the law was correct as to one of two key issues: whether petitioner\u2019s conduct constituted reasonable parental discipline, or whether the board that petitioner admittedly used to punish his daughter was a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d As counsel implored the jury, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to * * * decide where is the line, how much is too much. The law kind of leaves this open for juries to decide.\u201d By potentially discrediting counsel in the jurors\u2019 eyes, the court may well have closed their minds to counsel\u2019s argument as to where that line fell in petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">As for whether counsel\u2019s conduct somehow warranted reproach, the record discloses little to explain the trial court\u2019s frequently pointed comments. Here, none of the court\u2019s more notable criticisms were prompted by objections from the state, and the transcript reveals relatively little reason to object, much less anything that would seem to justify the court\u2019s unilateral decision to repeatedly admonish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>counsel in front of the jury. <em>See Mains, </em>295 Or at 658 (stating that \u201cadmonition of counsel in the presence of a jury should be a rare occurrence\u201d). Of course, had the state objected, it would have been reasonable for the court to instruct counsel to rephrase any improper questions or incorrect characterizations of the law. But here, even though the transgressions that the trial judge perceived are, for the most part, not readily apparent, the trial court repeatedly chastised counsel as though he had defiantly flouted court orders. And, on at least one of those occasions, the judge\u2019s harshest criticism came <em>after </em>counsel had acknowledged the court\u2019s direction and had begun to correct his approach.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Finally, had counsel moved for a mistrial, the trial court could have considered whether a curative instruction would sufficiently offset any impact of the court\u2019s seemingly negative view of petitioner or his attorney. Here, because counsel did not give the trial court that opportunity, the only instructions relevant to the post-conviction court\u2019s assessment of prejudice were two uniform jury instructions that the court read at the start and finish of trial. Those general instructions, routinely given in every case, inform jurors that they are not to interpret the court\u2019s rulings or comments as indications that the court has formed any opinion about the outcome of the case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And, as we have often observed, absent an overwhelming probability that they will not do so, jurors are presumed to follow their instructions. <em>See State v. Barone, </em>329 Or 210, 229, 986 P2d 5 (1999), <em>cert den, </em>528 US 1086 (2000) (noting that presumption). Here, however, the uniform instructions, which were generic and remote-in-time, were insufficient to dispel the negative effects of the court\u2019s specific disparaging comments made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>contemporaneously with petitioner\u2019s presentation of his defense.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Frangos v. Edmunds, </em>179 Or 577, 611, 173 P2d 596 (1946) (\u201cThe prejudicial effect of frequent comments on the evidence cannot be wholly removed by a final instruction to the jury to disregard what the court has previously said.\u201d); <em>Warren, </em>140 Or App at 331 n 12 (\u201cThe curative effect of such a general instruction is outweighed by the more specific risks of prejudice outlined above.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">In view of the foregoing considerations, we conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial had a tendency to affect the outcome of petitioner\u2019s case. Collectively, the trial court\u2019s actions created an unacceptable risk that the jury\u2019s decision would be influenced by the court\u2019s attitude toward petitioner and his attorney, rather than solely by the relative merits of the parties\u2019 cases. <em>See Amini, </em>331 Or at 391 (stating that an impartial jury is one influenced \u201conly by evidence produced at trial and legal standards provided by the trial court\u201d). Further, to the extent that those actions gave the jury the impression that the court was biased in favor of the prosecution, the court\u2019s recitation of generic jury instructions at unrelated times seems unlikely to have been sufficient to dispel that risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Thus, in this case, counsel\u2019s inaction prejudiced petitioner regardless of what steps the trial court might have taken had counsel objected or moved for a mistrial. As our review of the relevant factors suggests, petitioner had valid grounds for concern that his right to trial before an impartial jury had been put at risk. Thus, had the trial court responded inadequately\u2014or not responded at all\u2014to an appropriate objection or motion for mistrial, that exercise of discretion would have been subject to appeal, <em>White, </em>119 Or App at 427, and, given the review we have just undertaken, there is at least \u201cmore than a mere possibility\u201d that petitioner\u2019s appeal would have succeeded. <em>See Green, </em>357 Or at 322. If, on the other hand, the judge had chosen to give an effective curative instruction, that response might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>mitigated any adverse effects on the jury. <em>See Evans, </em>211 Or App at 167-68 (explaining that a court may properly deny a motion for mistrial if a curative instruction sufficiently remedies any prejudice). Here, the court was not faced with that choice, because counsel never gave the court an opportunity to consider it. As a result, counsel\u2019s deficient performance forced petitioner to accept the verdict of a jury whose impartiality could reasonably be questioned and, in doing so, caused petitioner prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In denying relief to petitioner, the post-conviction court concluded that counsel had not performed inadequately and that counsel\u2019s performance had not prejudiced petitioner. We conclude otherwise. By not taking corrective action in response to the trial court\u2019s frequent, unilateral, and critical interruptions, trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment, and that failure prejudiced petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> Defendant in this post-conviction relief case is the superintendent of the Columbia River Correctional Institution, where petitioner is serving his sentence in the underlying case. <em>See </em>ORS 138.570 (requiring that petitions for post-conviction relief name, as the defendant, the superintendent of the facility in which the petitioner is serving sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-5\"> Under ORS 161.205(1), it is a defense to any charge involving the use of physical force that a \u201cparent, guardian, or other person entrusted with the care and supervision of a minor *** may use reasonable physical force upon such minor <em>* * </em>* when and to the extent the person reasonably believes it necessary to maintain discipline or to promote the welfare of the minor * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\"> As charged in petitioner\u2019s case, a person\u2019s conduct constitutes assault in the second degree if the person \u201c[intentionally or knowingly causes physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon.\u201d ORS 163.175(1)(b). In turn, ORS 161.015(1) defines \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d as \u201cany weapon, device, instrument, material or substance which under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used or threatened to be used, is readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\"> ORS 163.160(3) provides that fourth-degree assault is a Class C felony if the assault \u201cis committed in the immediate presence of, or is witnessed by, the person\u2019s or the victim\u2019s minor child or stepchild or a minor child residing within the household of the person or victim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\"> As noted, a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is one \u201creadily capable of causing death or serious physical injury\u201d under the circumstances in which it is used. ORS 161.015(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b619-12\"> The trial court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">\u201c[W]e\u2019re getting a little beyond ourselves here, ladies and gentlemen, but *** I want to make sure that your function at this stage <em>* * * </em>of the proceedings is to hear the facts and make decisions about the facts. * * * I think that we\u2019re getting a little ahead of ourselves here where we\u2019re asking you to start making decisions or start applying the facts to the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b620-16\"> The prosecutor asked, \u201cIs there a reason why your mom would have told the police that [your sister] took a cedar stick and hit you the day she was interviewed; would that be incorrect?\u201d There were no other references at trial to the witness\u2019s mother having made that statement to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\"> We assume from the surrounding context that the trial court advised counsel that the reasonable-discipline defense involved a strictly objective standard. <em>See State v. Waller, </em>22 Or App 299, 302, 538 P2d 1274 (1975) (stating that the elements of the defense were not met, despite the defendant\u2019s subjective belief that force had been necessary, because the force used was not reasonable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\"> In addition to the foregoing, we also note instances of the court interrupting defense counsel to question witnesses and elicit testimony favorable to the prosecution, accusing counsel of interrupting witnesses, and opining, in regard to the dimensions of the board used to strike the victim, \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s very relevant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b623-10\"> The jury acquitted petitioner of strangulation, which was alleged to have occurred at around the same time as the \u201cboarding\u201d incident. Petitioner\u2019s trial attorney did not argue that the reasonable-discipline defense applied to the strangulation charge, only that there was a factual dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b623-11\"> Petitioner\u2019s post-conviction relief petition outlined the various interruptions and exchanges recounted above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\"> Petitioner also claims that he was denied the right to effective counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The standards for evaluating counsel\u2019s performance are \u201cfunctionally equivalent\u201d under the state and federal constitutions. <em>Montez, </em>355 Or at 6-7. Because petitioner prevails under the state constitutional standard, we do not consider his federal claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\"> As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Amini, </em>331 Or at 395, the right to trial by an impartial jury guaranteed by Article I, section 11, is less broad than the right to a fair and impartial trial under the Due Process Clause. Our case law, however, often equates prejudicial conduct\u2014conduct that tends to influence the jury so as to affect the verdict\u2014with the denial of a fair trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Logston, </em>270 Or App 296, 298, 347 P3d 352 (2015); <em>id. </em>at 307 n 4. Although we are not aware of any distinction between the two provisions for purposes of petitioner\u2019s case, we nonetheless note that our use of the term \u201cfair trial\u201d in this opinion is in the more limited Article I, section 11, sense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\"> For example, after one expert witness had used the expression \u2018\u2018a thousand other things you learn,\u201d the trial judge repeatedly asked the expert to list the thousand things he had learned. <em>Mains, </em>295 Or at 650-52. Later, the judge repeatedly questioned the other expert regarding his methodology. <em>Id. </em>at 652-54.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b631-4\"> Counsel stated, \u201cSo this is basically the definition of what a dangerous weapon is, and I left out a few words, I\u2019ll read you the whole thing here.\u201d The court interrupted, leading to the exchange previously quoted. 285 Or App at 602. Once counsel resumed his argument, he explained that the full \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d instruction describes an \u201cinstrument, article, or substance\u201d that is attempted to be used, threatened to be used, or actually is used. He \u201cleft out a few words\u201d to tailor the definition to the case: the board was the \u201cinstrument\u201d at issue for purposes of the charge. Notably, however, the prosecutor also paraphrased portions of the instruction in her argument, defining \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d as an \u201cinstrument\u201d and leaving out the terms \u201carticle or substance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b637-5\"> The trial court did much the same thing with petitioner\u2019s son on the stand, where the instruction not to \u201cscat around\u201d and to answer a question again came <em>after </em>that witness had assured the court that he understood the obligation to testify truthfully.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> The precautionary instruction given at the beginning of trial, Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction 1004, states, \u201cYou must not interpret any statement, ruling or remark I make during this trial as any indication that I have formed any opinion about the facts or outcome of this case.\u201d Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction 1005 (\u201cFunctions of the Court and Jury\u201d), given at the conclusion of trial, states, \u201cDo not allow anything I have said or done during the course of this trial to suggest that I have formed any opinion about this case.

Once a prejudicial act has been allowed to pass by, it is often \u201ctoo late for the trial judge to caution the jury and mend the harm.\u201d <em>State v.
