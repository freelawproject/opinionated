He assigns error to the juvenile court\u2019s determination in those judgments that DHS has made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to return his child to the care of her family. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.340(1) (requiring juvenile court to assess whether DHS has made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to permit a child to stay in, or return to, child\u2019s home in certain orders in dependency cases subject to ICWA). In <em>Dept. of Human Services v. A. B. B., </em>285 Or App 409, 396 P3d 306 (2017), decided today, we dismissed an appeal by child from the same judgments, concluding that, under <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Vockrodt, </em>147 Or App 4, 8, 934 P2d 620 (1997), child\u2019s rights were not sufficiently affected by the judgments to render them appealable under ORS 419A.200(1). For substantially the same reasons as those we articulated in <em>A. B. B., </em>we conclude that the judgments are not appealable by father.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
