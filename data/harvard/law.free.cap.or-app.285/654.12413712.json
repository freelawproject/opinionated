J.</author>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Defendant challenges his convictions for telephonic harassment under ORS 166.090(1)(b), which provides that a telephone caller commits the crime of telephonic harassment if the caller intentionally harasses or annoys another person: \u201cBy causing such other person\u2019s telephone to ring, knowing that the caller has been forbidden from so doing by a person exercising lawful authority over the receiving telephone [.] \u201d Defendant argues that, because there was no evidence that his unauthorized phone calls to the victim\u2019s telephone caused that phone to emit an audible sound, the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal. The state counters that the legislature did not intend to require an audible sound, but rather intended to protect a person\u2019s property interest in his or her telephone from trespass by a person making calls to that telephone after having been told not to do so. Accordingly, the state argues that the trial court correctly concluded that the statute can be violated by a person making an unauthorized call regardless of whether it causes the receiving party\u2019s telephone to emit an audible sound. We conclude that the statutory text does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that it is the act of making an unauthorized call that violates the statute. Rather, the plain and unambiguous text of ORS 166.090(1)(b) requires the other person\u2019s telephone \u201cto ring,\u201d which we interpret to mean that the telephone must emit an audible sound. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s convictions for telephonic harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal to determine whether, after viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those facts in the light most favorable to the state, \u201c\u2018a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Koenig, </em>238 Or App 297, 301, 242 P3d 649 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 601 (2011) (quoting <em>State v. Schneider, </em>229 Or App 199, 201, 211 P3d 306 (2009)). However, when the dispute \u201c\u2018centers on the meaning of the statute defining the offense, the issue is one of statutory construction,\u201d\u2019 which we review for legal error. <em>State v. Hunt, </em>270 Or App 206, 210, 346 P3d 1285 (2015) (quoting <em>State v. Wray, </em>243 Or App 503, 506, 259 P3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>972 (2011)). We state the relevant facts consistently with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">On June 7, 2013, defendant began calling and sending text messages to the victim. Given the tone of some of those calls and messages, the victim contacted the police. The next morning, the victim answered a call from defendant and told him not to call her anymore. Later that morning, the victim discovered two voicemail messages from defendant that had come through after she had instructed him to stop calling her.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Defendant was charged by information with one count of harassment (Count 1), ORS 166.065,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two counts of telephonic harassment (Counts 2 and 3), ORS 166.090(1)(b). The telephonic harassment counts were based on the allegation that defendant, \u201con or about June 8, 2013, *** did unlawfully and intentionally harass and annoy [the victim] by causing the telephone of [the victim] to ring, knowing that said defendant had been forbidden from so doing by [the victim.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At trial, the state proceeded on the theory that, after the victim told defendant not to call her on the morning of July 8, defendant violated ORS 166.090 (1)(b) by calling the victim\u2019s phone and leaving two voicemails. That is, the state\u2019s case was based on evidence of the two voice-mails left by defendant, not any other call or message. At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\u201cYour honor, it\u2019s required that my client caused [the victim\u2019s] telephone to ring, and the State has to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. I heard absolutely no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>to the best of my recollection of a telephone ringing from anyone. I think for that reason alone [defendant] is entitled to a Judgment of Acquittal at this time. It\u2019s part of the statute Your Honor. We simply did not hear any evidence of a telephone ringing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-3\">The court denied defendant\u2019s motion, concluding: \u201cI don\u2019t think it has to be a traditional ring tone to count as a ring for purposes of the statute. Causing the phone call to be initiated or triggered on the phone I think is the meaning of ring as used here.\u201d A jury acquitted defendant of harassment, but found him guilty of the two counts of telephonic harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Defendant appeals, arguing that, to violate ORS 166.090(1)(b), he had to have caused the victim\u2019s telephone to emit an audible sound <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cring\u201d) after the victim told him not to call her anymore. He asserts that there was no evidence that he did so, and thus, the court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal. He posits that the applicable legislative history of the statute demonstrates that ORS 166.090 was drafted in a manner that was intended to avoid the constitutional problems that prior versions of the telephone harassment statute had encountered,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but \u201cnothing in the context or legislative history suggests that the legislature intended for the phrase \u2018to cause a telephone to ring\u2019 [to mean] anything other than to cause a telephone to make an audible sound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The state counters that requiring an \u201caudible sound\u201d would frustrate the legislature\u2019s intent in ORS 166.090(1)(b) to protect a person\u2019s property interest in the person\u2019s telephone from trespass by a person making calls to that telephone after having been told not to do so. In making that argument, the state acknowledges that the plain meaning of \u201cring\u201d implies that the \u201ctelephone must make an audible sound.\u201d Nevertheless, the state relies on legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>history that shows that the statute was enacted with a \u201cbasis\u201d in <em>trespass\u2014i.e., </em>\u201c[t]he conduct being proscribed is the unauthorized use of another\u2019s property\u2014the telephone.\u201d Based on that legislative history, the state proffers that the legislature intended to proscribe a person\u2019s unauthorized <em>call </em>to the telephone of another, and violation of the statute was not intended to turn on whether the other person\u2019s telephone emitted an audible sound. The state maintains that an \u201cunauthorized call is no less a trespass because it is carried out in silence instead of announcing itself with a ring: a person\u2019s telephone has still been used without their permission, and that is precisely the conduct the legislature sought to proscribe by enacting ORS 166.090(1)(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Alternatively, apparently as an alternative basis for affirmance, the state argues that, even if we agree with defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute, we should affirm defendant\u2019s convictions because there is sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to find that defendant caused the victim\u2019s phone to make an audible sound. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001) (explaining when an appellate court can affirm the lower court\u2019s ruling under the \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We briefly address and dispose of the state\u2019s alternative basis for affirmance. Under <em>Outdoor Media, </em>as a matter of our discretion, we may affirm a trial court\u2019s ruling on a basis that was not relied upon by the court if (1) \u201cthe facts of record [are] sufficient to support the alternative basis for affirmance\u201d; (2) \u201cthe trial court\u2019s ruling [is] consistent with the view of the evidence under the alternative basis for affirmance\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe record materially [is] the same one that would have been developed had the prevailing party raised the alternative basis for affirmance below.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We begin by noting that, when a defendant moves for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, and then presents evidence in his defense, we consider the whole record to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a verdict against the defendant. <em>State v. Patton, </em>259 Or App 80, 83 n 2, 312 P3d 581 (2013). Here, to support its argument, the state relies on evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>victim answered a call from defendant early in the morning of June 8, 2013, (during which she told defendant not to call her again). The state argues that a factfinder could infer that the victim\u2019s telephone made an audible sound at that point because she answered the call. From that inference, the state further argues that a reasonable factfinder could draw an additional inference that the victim\u2019s telephone made an audible sound later in the morning when defendant placed the calls resulting in the two voicemails.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We decline to consider the state\u2019s argument because it fails to satisfy the criteria necessary for us to exercise our discretion to review an alternative basis for affirmance. Here, even if we assume that the inferences urged by the state are reasonable as opposed to mere speculation, had the prosecutor made the argument below that the state now makes, the \u201crecord might well have developed differently.\u201d <em>See Outdoor Media, </em>331 Or at 659-60 (noting that one of the criteria for discretionary review of alternative bases for affirmance is whether, had an argument been made in the trial court, the record could have developed in a materially different way). As noted, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal after concluding that \u201c[clausing the phone call to be initiated or triggered on the phone I think is the meaning of ring as used here.\u201d That ruling removed from the case the factual issue of whether the victim\u2019s telephone emitted an audible sound, and, as the state\u2019s argument indicates, at the time of the court\u2019s ruling, the record contained no direct evidence that the victim\u2019s telephone had emitted an audible sound as a result of defendant\u2019s calls. Accordingly, after the court explained its basis for denying defendant\u2019s motion, defendant did not have a reason to further develop the record on that point in his casein-chief. Given that, it would be inappropriate to review the state\u2019s alternative basis for affirmance, particularly given the stacking of inferences upon which the state relies. <em>See State v. Nascimento, </em>360 Or 28, 37-38, 379 P3d 484 (2016) (refusing to consider alternative basis for affirmance where the evidence relied on by the state was \u201cequivocal and weak, at best,\u201d and, had the state relied on it in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, the defendant could easily have countered it in her own case-in-chief).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Accordingly, we proceed to the issue that is before us\u2014the proper construction of the statutory phrase \u201ccausing such other person\u2019s telephone to ring\u201d in ORS 166.090(1)(b). In interpreting a statute, our goal is to determine legislative intent by analyzing the text of the statute in context, considering any relevant legislative history, and, if necessary, applying maxims of statutory construction. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\">Generally, \u201cthe text of the statutory provision itself is the starting point for interpretation and is the best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Unless a word or phrase has a specialized meaning, we typically give \u201cwords of common usage\u201d their \u201cplain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611. The ordinary meaning of a word is presumed to be what is reflected in a dictionary. <em>See Jenkins v. Board of Parole, </em>356 Or 186, 194, 335 P3d 828 (2014). Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n construing statutes, we do not simply consult dictionaries and interpret words in a vacuum.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 96, 261 P3d 1234 (2011). When the dispute \u201ccenters on the meaning of a particular word or words, a dictionary definition\u2014although providing some evidence of meaning\u2014should not be relied on to resolve a dispute about plain meaning without critically examining how the definition fits into the context of the statute itself.\u201d <em>State v. Gonzalez-Valenzuela, </em>358 Or 451, 461, 365 P3d 116 (2015). However, \u201c[t]he formal requirements of lawmaking produce the best source from which to discern the legislature\u2019s intent, for it is not the intent of the individual legislators that governs, but the intent of the legislature as formally enacted into law[.]\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171. Accordingly, \u201ca party seeking to overcome seemingly plain and unambiguous text with legislative history has a difficult task before it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">ORS 166.090(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">\u201cA telephone caller commits the crime of telephonic harassment if the caller intentionally harasses or annoys another person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201c(a) By causing the telephone of the other person to ring, such caller having no communicative purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\u201c(b) By causing such other person\u2019s telephone to ring, knowing that the caller has been forbidden from so doing by a person exercising lawful authority over the receiving telephone; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">\u201c(c) By sending to, or leaving at, the other person\u2019s telephone a text message, voice mail or any other message, knowing that the caller has been forbidden from so doing by a person exercising lawful authority over the receiving telephone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Here, defendant asserts that the phrase \u201c [b]y causing such other person\u2019s telephone to ring\u201d in ORS 166.090(1)(b) unambiguously requires the \u201cother person\u2019s telephone\u201d to make an audible sound. Given the context in which \u201cring\u201d is used in subsection (1)(b), we agree that the relevant dictionary definitions all reflect the concept that \u201cto ring\u201d consists of an audible sound. For example, \u201cring\u201d is defined as \u201c1: to sound clearly and resonantly &lt;the ~ing of many bells&gt; * * * 2 : to sound loudly and sonorously * * * 3a : to be filled with a ringing or reverberating sound.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1958 (unabridged ed 2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although \u201cring\u201d is also defined as \u201ca telephone call\u2014often used with <em>give\u201d id. </em>(emphasis in original), that definition does not fit within the context here given that the statute requires the caller to \u201ccause\u201d the other person\u2019s telephone \u201cto ring.\u201d If the legislature intended \u201cring\u201d to mean simply \u201ca telephone call\u201d the use of \u201ccause\u201d and the reference to \u201csuch other person\u2019s telephone\u201d would not have been necessary. <em>See Gonzalez-Valenzuela, </em>358 Or at 461 (\u201c [C] ontext may dictate applying one definition rather than another, if the dictionary contains multiple definitions for a relevant term.\u201d). Thus, the ordinary meaning of \u201cto ring,\u201d as used in ORS 166.090(1)(b), appears to require that the caller caused the \u201cother person\u2019s\u201d telephone to emit an audible sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The state acknowledges that \u201cthe plain meaning of \u2018ring\u2019 implies that a \u2018telephone must make an audible sound.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless, the state relies heavily on the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>history of House Bill (HB) 2903 (1987), which was later codified as ORS 166.090, to argue that ascribing the plain meaning to \u201cring\u201d would render the term an anachronism and frustrate the legislature\u2019s intent. Instead, the state urges us to look past the ordinary meaning of \u201cring\u201d and \u201cgive effect to the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d In doing so, the state focuses on legislative history that shows that HB 2903 was crafted to protect a person\u2019s property interest in his or her telephone from trespass by a person making calls to that telephone after having been told not to do so. In the state\u2019s view, given that the legislature intended to prevent \u201ctrespasses\u201d on the victim\u2019s telephone, it makes no difference whether the victim\u2019s telephone emits an audible sound\u2014it matters only whether the person is being precluded from using their telephone by the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The legislative history relied on by the state is compelling in some respects, although it ignores the broader context in which the legislature passed HB 2903. By the time the legislature took HB 2903 under consideration in the 1987 legislative session, the Supreme Court had struck down two prior versions of telephonic harassment statutes as unconstitutional. Under the first, ORS 166.065 (1979), a person committed the crime of \u201charassment\u201d if, among other things, he communicated by telephone with the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person \u201cin a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u201d In <em>State v. Blair, </em>287 Or 519, 524, 601 P2d 766 (1979), the Supreme Court declared the statute unconstitutionally vague, noting that the communication \u201cneed not cause any harm at all, in the form of annoyance, alarm, or otherwise. It is sufficient if the manner of communication is in fact likely\u2019 to do so, whether the defendant knew this or not.\u201d In short, the court declared the statute \u201cconstitutionally inadequate because it did not require an \u2018effect\u2019 on the listener and the prohibited conduct was not narrowly defined.\u201d <em>State v. Ray, </em>302 Or 595, 599, 733 P2d 28 (1987) (explaining the holding in <em>Blair).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In response to <em>Blair, </em>the legislature amended the harassment statute in the 1981 legislative session, adding a provision to ORS 166.065 that made it harassment to subject another to alarm or annoyance \u201cby telephonic use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>obscenities or description of sexual excitement or sadomasochistic abuse or sexual conduct as defined in ORS 167.060 * * * which use or description is patently offensive and otherwise obscene as defined in ORS 167.087(2)(b) and (c)[.]\u201d ORS 166.065(1)(e) (1981). In <em>Ray, </em>the Supreme Court declared that statute unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, noting that the prohibited conduct was too broadly defined, and that it potentially reached privileged speech. 302 Or at 600-01. The statute did not adequately restrict the proscribed conduct to that which was \u201cunwanted, unsolicited or non-consensual\u201d and the criminalized conduct was not restricted to \u201cthe person placing the call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the court concluded that the statute was vague because it incorporated a definition of \u201cobscene\u201d that failed to warn a person that \u201ccertain types of conduct will subject the offender to criminal prosecution and sanctions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">As such, it was against that historical backdrop that HB 2903 was crafted in an effort to provide some relief to persons receiving harassing telephone calls. The legislative history of HB 2903 reflects that the bill was drafted to provide relief while still passing constitutional muster. Staff Measure Analysis, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, HB 2903, Mar 19, 1987. To do so, and to avoid the problems identified in <em>Ray </em>and <em>Blair (i.e., </em>the failure to require an \u201ceffect on the listener,\u201d the failure to narrowly define the prohibited conduct, and the impermissible restriction on privileged speech), the bill was drafted with a \u201cbasis * * * in trespass.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Accordingly, HB 2903 was intended to proscribe harassing conduct, not the content of communication. Various statements during the debate of the bill noted that HB 2903 was drafted to reflect a \u201ctrespass theory,\u201d which was directed at \u201c[t]he person who calls, who knows that he\u2019s not authorized, who has been advised that he\u2019s not authorized to use this piece of property and calls nevertheless is in fact using property without your permission.\u201d Tape Recording, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, HB 2903, June 4, 1987, Tape 172, Side A (statement of Frank Gruber). In short, the legislature chose to prohibit the conduct of \u201cunauthorized use of another\u2019s property\u2014the telephone.\u201d Staff Measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Analysis, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, HB 2903, Mar 19, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Thus, the legislative history provides some support for the state\u2019s position that, under a \u201ctrespass theory,\u201d whether a person\u2019s telephone emits an audible sound is immaterial to the harm on which the legislature was <em>focused\u2014i.e., </em>the unauthorized use of another\u2019s property. Nevertheless, that history also demonstrates that, in drafting the particular text of the statute, the legislature intended to narrowly define the prohibited conduct to avoid a repeat of the constitutional problems that plagued the earlier telephonic harassment statutes. Further, the legislative history is also replete with references to the specific conduct that the legislature chose to prohibit\u2014\u201ccausing such other person\u2019s telephone to ring\u201d\u2014and none of those references contradict the assumption that the legislature meant to use a word of common usage\u2014in this case, \u201cring\u201d\u2014in its ordinary sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Ultimately, as noted, \u201ca party seeking to overcome seemingly plain and unambiguous text with legislative history has a difficult task before it.\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172. \u201cEven assuming that the legislative history supported [the state\u2019s] interpretation, we are required not to construe a statute in a way that is inconsistent with its plain text.\u201d <em>Suchi v. SAIF, </em>238 Or App 48, 55, 241 P3d 1174 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 231 (2011). Here, the state cannot overcome the seemingly plain and unambiguous text of ORS 166.090(1)(b), which requires the caller to cause the \u201cother person\u2019s\u201d telephone \u201cto <em>ring\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>emit an audible sound.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">It may be that this is a case in which the statutory text, at least subsection (1)(b), \u201cappears not to have been written for the digital world in which we live.\u201d <em>State v. Barger, </em>349 Or 553, 570, 247 P3d 309 (2011) (DeMuniz, C. J., concurring). To the extent that this is an instance where the statutory text chosen by the 1987 Legislative Assembly has been outpaced by advancements in telephone technology\u2014 and this indeed seems like such an instance\u2014it is not for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the courts to alter the plain text of a statute in light of those advances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Convictions on Counts 2 and 3 for telephonic harassment reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\"> Count 1 was based on the allegation that defendant, during one of the calls or messages on June 7, 2013, threatened to inflict serious physical injury to the victim. The jury acquitted defendant of that count and it is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\"> ORS 166.090(1) also provides that aperson commits the crime of telephonic harassment if the caller \u201cintentionally harasses or annoys another person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">\u201c(c) By sending to, or leaving at, the other person\u2019s telephone a text message, voice mail or any other message, knowing that the caller has been forbidden from so doing by a person exercising lawful authority over the receiving telephone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">The state did not charge defendant with telephonic harassment under paragraph (c) for leaving a \u201cvoice mail or any other message.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\"> <em>See State v. Blair, </em>287 Or 519, 524-25, 601 P2d 766 (1979) (declaring ORS 166.065(1)(c) (1979), to be constitutionally inadequate because it did not require an \u2018effect\u2019 on the listener and the prohibited conduct was not narrowly defined); <em>State v. Ray, </em>302 Or 595,600-01,733 P2d28 (1987) (holding that ORS 166.065(1)(e) (1985) was unconstitutional because it potentially reached areas of communication that would be constitutionally privileged, and it incorporated a definition of obscenity that was unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> <em>See State v. James, </em>266 Or App 660, 667 n 3, 338 P3d 782 (2014) (\u201cBecause the content of Webster\u2019s\u2014excluding the addenda section\u2014has remained static since 1961, in general, it is appropriate to treat it as a contemporaneous source for statutes dating from at least that point forward[.]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\"> Given the basis on which the court denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, this case does not require us to decide what kind of audible sound would qualify as a \u201cring\u201d under ORS 166.090 (1)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b686-5\"> We note that the legislature amended ORS 166.090(1) in 2005 to add paragraph (c), which prohibits leaving or sending text messages, voicemails or \u201cany other messages\u201d after having been forbidden from doing so. Or Laws 2005, ch 752, \u00a7 1. Presumably, that amendment was intended to keep pace with some of the advances in telephone technology. Nevertheless, as noted, the state did not charge defendant under that provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
