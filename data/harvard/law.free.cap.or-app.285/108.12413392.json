Defendant appeals the resulting judgment of conviction, raising two assignments of error. First, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his admissions, because, in defendant\u2019s view, they were involuntary under ORS 136.425(1) and the Oregon and United States constitutions. Second, defendant argues that the trial court plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury that it could not consider his statements without first finding that he had made them voluntarily. We conclude that the trial court erred in admitting defendant\u2019s admissions, because they were induced by promises or \u201cmade under the influence of fear produced by threats[,]\u201d ORS 136.425(1), and, therefore, inadmissible. In light of that conclusion, we do not address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The material facts are undisputed. Defendant was a stay-at-home parent. One day, when defendant was home alone caring for his son, he called his wife at work because their child was not responsive. She returned home and, shortly thereafter, their child was taken to the hospital, where an emergency medical examination disclosed that the child had suffered head injuries consistent with shaken baby syndrome. Following that assessment, Jenkins, a caseworker for the Department of Human Services (DHS), contacted defendant and told him to go to the police station for an interview. The following morning, defendant drove with his mother to the police station, where he was interviewed by Jenkins and Officer McGarvey of the Sutherlin Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">McGarvey and Jenkins spoke to defendant in a small, sparsely furnished interview room with the door closed. Even though defendant was not handcuffed or otherwise physically restrained and, in fact, McGarvey told him that he was free to go, McGarvey advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. McGarvey explained to defendant that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>was being interviewed \u201c [bjecause [his] child was so young and\u2014taken up to a hospital because of injuries,\u201d and \u201cwe want to make sure that there\u2019s nothing going on that\u2019s criminal.\u201d McGarvey questioned defendant for several minutes regarding the cause of his son\u2019s injuries; defendant responded that he did not know their cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">McGarvey left the room briefly, while Jenkins continued to question defendant. Upon returning, McGarvey told defendant that he was in trouble, because the evidence clearly showed that he was responsible for his son\u2019s injuries. McGarvey said, \u201cWe need to talk about some things. I have to actually before I can make final decisions on certain things; I\u2019ve got to know what kind of person I\u2019m dealing with here.\u201d McGarvey pressed defendant to explain why he had injured his son, specifically asking whether defendant had \u201cset out to kill\u201d his child or, instead, \u201caccidentally shook his kid too hard.\u201d McGarvey explained to defendant that \u201c[T]he crime has already been established. * * * I establish the person and what they\u2019ve committed at what level.\u201d McGarvey added that defendant needed to tell him \u201cthe honest truth * * * was it an accident, or was it on purpose, because <em>if it\u2019s on purpose, </em>I\u2019ll tell you right now, *** <em>that is bad. That\u2019s something I need to strongly look into </em>*** [a]nd you will not only have the chance of having your baby taken out of your life forever, but you will also be looking at a long time.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">McGarvey elaborated, telling defendant that he needed to know if \u201can accident has happened. A person has made a bad choice. <em>Do we convict </em>this person and make them a huge [example] for the world to see? <em>No. </em>We make sure this person has help.\u201d (Emphases added.) As further encouragement, McGarvey made up a story for defendant, claiming that he himself had once picked up his son</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201cout of anger and my wife caught me. I had anger issues. I went to anger management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">\u201cIt didn\u2019t say [sic] that I could not see my son, and I still see my son. I raised him. [I didn\u2019t] call[] myself a monster. I just said that I needed help.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>McGarvey continued to push defendant for an explanation. He asked, \u201cIs somebody going to believe you when you say, \u2018I didn\u2019t do it,\u2019 or is somebody going to believe you when you say, \u2018I didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2019?\u201d McGarvey assured defendant that \u201cNobody\u2019s trying to remove the child from your custody\u201d and that \u201cYou\u2019re going to be able to see your child some day, * * * and it\u2019s going to be soon. * * * But don\u2019t you think you need the help?\u201d He encouraged defendant to \u201cTell me we\u2019ve established it\u2019s on accident and not [on] purpose. But you need to tell me what happened so I can\u2014I can start the healing process. Don\u2019t you care about your son?\u201d Despite McGarvey\u2019s persistence, defendant continued to deny that he had caused his son\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">McGarvey reasoned with defendant that, if he had not caused the injuries to his son, then his wife must have caused them, because she was the only other person who had recently cared for their child. Jenkins echoed that theme, stating, \u201c[I]f you didn\u2019t shake your son, then it possibly may be your wife * * *. I cannot leave [your child] with [your wife] if I don\u2019t know who did th[is] to him, so I\u2019m going to have to put him in stranger foster care.\u201d McGarvey reminded defendant that he and his wife were the only two people who could have injured his child and explained that, if defendant did not admit that he had done it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">\u201cboth of you would have to be going through the whole same process. You\u2019d both get to go to court. Your wife would probably lose her job working at the circuit court because she is now going in to trial for having child injuries. * * * It d [oes] n\u2019t sound right to me, a husband should stand up for his wife. Either, A, you do know that your wife did this and you\u2019re protecting your child\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201c\u2014or B, you can clear your wife and say that you did this to your child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In response, defendant asked, \u201cSo I have to say that I did something *** to save my wife?\u201d McGarvey replied, \u201cNo. * * * I don\u2019t want you to do that either, because now you\u2019re going to set it up saying that you were coerced into this.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to sit here and lie. I don\u2019t want you to [fall on your sword]. If your wife did this, I want you to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>tell me, \u2018My wife did this and I\u2019m trying to cover up for her because I don\u2019t want her getting in trouble.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">An hour or so into the interview, defendant acknowledged that he had, in fact, shaken his son and that he \u201cneed[ed] help.\u201d McGarvey formally arrested defendant, placing him in handcuffs and again advising him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. McGarvey then led defendant into a larger room and brought in his mother. As soon as his mother entered the room, defendant apologized and told her, \u201cI got scared. I was frustrated and I shook the baby. * * * I didn\u2019t mean to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The state charged defendant with criminal mistreatment in the first degree and assault in the first, second, and third degrees. Before trial, defendant moved to suppress his statements on the ground that they had been involuntary. Defendant argued that McGarvey\u2019s interview tactics had effectively given him only \u201ctwo choices\u201d\u2014either admit that he had purposely injured his son or admit that he had done so accidentally\u2014and had conveyed that McGarvey would accept no other explanation. Defendant further argued that McGarvey and Jenkins had unlawfully used both a promise of leniency and threats against his family to induce his confession. Following the suppression hearing, however, the trial court issued a short letter opinion, in which it concluded that defendant\u2019s statements had been voluntary. Accordingly, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court noted, however, that the ultimate question of voluntariness would be for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Defendant\u2019s theory at trial was that McGarvey and Jenkins had coerced him into falsely admitting that he had shaken his child. Although the jury acquitted defendant of the first-degree assault charge, it convicted him of the remaining charges. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal largely reprise those that he made to the trial court. Defendant contends that (1) McGarvey\u2019s questions suggested a false distinction between defendant <em>intentionally </em>injuring his son by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>shaking him and <em>accidentally </em>injuring his son by shaking him, both of which were crimes; (2) McGarvey implicitly promised defendant leniency in exchange for an admission when he suggested that, if defendant had injured his son accidentally, defendant would receive treatment; and (3) McGarvey and Jenkins expressly threatened adverse consequences for defendant\u2019s wife and son if he maintained his innocence. Defendant argues that those tactics rendered his admissions involuntary and, therefore, inadmissible under ORS 136.425(1) and the state and federal constitutions. In response, the state asserts that the mere suggestion that defendant would receive treatment if he had injured his son accidentally cannot be deemed an implicit promise of leniency, because McGarvey neither suggested that defendant would receive treatment <em>in lieu </em>o/prosecution nor conditioned any such treatment on defendant <em>admitting </em>criminal conduct. Thus, the state reasons, McGarvey\u2019s tactics involved no improper quid pro quo. The state further contends that, to the extent that McGarvey\u2019s and Jenkins\u2019s statements about defendant\u2019s family exerted any psychological pressure on him, it did not rise to the level of improper inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">We first consider whether the trial court\u2019s admission of defendant\u2019s statements violated ORS 136.425(1). <em>See State v. Foster, </em>303 Or 518, 526, 739 P2d 1032 (1987) (courts should decide cases on subconstitutional grounds when possible). As noted, the facts material to that assessment are not in dispute. Accordingly, we focus on the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary, which we review for legal error. <em>See State v. Belle, </em>281 Or App 208, 210, 383 P3d 327 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Under ORS 136.425(1), \u201c[a] confession or admission[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] of a defendant *** cannot be given in evidence against the defendant when it was made under the influence of fear produced by threats.\u201d Although ORS 136.425(1) only expressly references threats, the Supreme Court has held that the statute prohibits \u201cinducement through fear <em>or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>promises </em>[.] \u201d <em>State v. Mendacino, </em>288 Or 231, 235, 603 P2d 1376 (1979) (emphasis added). The goal of ORS 136.425(1) is to exclude confessions that are involuntary and, hence, unreliable. <em>State v. Powell, </em>352 Or 210, 222, 282 P3d 845 (2012); <em>Belle, </em>281 Or App at 213. Confessions are unreliable when the person making the confession \u201cperceives that he or she may receive some benefit or avoid some detriment by confessing, regardless of the truth or falsity of the confession.\u201d <em>Belle, </em>281 Or App at 213 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Whether an unlawful threat or promise renders a statement unreliable \u201crequires an individualized inquiry\u201d that takes into account the \u201cdetrimental consequences\u201d that a person might avoid, as well as any \u201ccompelling benefits\u201d that a person might receive, in exchange for confessing. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Ultimately, the test for voluntariness is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the confession is the product of an essentially free, unconstrained, and informed choice, or whether a person\u2019s capacity for self determination is critically impaired. <em>State v. Ruiz-Piza, </em>262 Or App 563, 573, 325 P3d 802 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Finally, under ORS 136.425(1), admissions are presumed involuntary. <em>State v. Ely, </em>237 Or 329, 332, 390 P2d 348 (1964). Thus, it is the state\u2019s burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that any statement it offers into evidence was made voluntarily. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">We begin with defendant\u2019s contention that his confession was induced by an unlawful promise of leniency premised, in part, on a false distinction between causing an intentional injury and causing an accidental injury. As we understand defendant\u2019s argument, he contends that, by suggesting that the two were materially different, with the consequence of an accidental injury being treatment rather than imprisonment, McGarvey induced his confession with an implicit promise of leniency. <em>See id. </em>at 334 (a confession induced by a promise of immunity from prosecution is involuntary as a matter of law); <em>State v. Pollard, </em>132 Or App 538, 543, 888 P2d 1054, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 138 (1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">A promise of leniency may be express or implied. <em>Pollard, </em>132 Or App at 544. \u201cThe precise form of words in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>which the inducement is presented *** is immaterial. It is sufficient if [the inducement] convey [s] to [a person] the idea of temporal benefit or disadvantage, and [that the person\u2019s] confession follows in consequence of the hopes thereby excited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Ruiz-Piza, </em>262 Or App at 576 (noting \u201c [t]hat the officers never explicitly made a promise of leniency or immunity is not dispositive\u201d). In this case, defendant does not suggest that McGarvey expressly promised him .immunity from prosecution in exchange for a confession. Instead, defendant contends that McGarvey\u2019s interrogation tactics conveyed an implicit promise that he would receive treatment rather than punishment if he admitted to hurting his son. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">During the interrogation, McGarvey contrasted two potential outcomes that, collectively, conveyed a strong impression that defendant would not face prosecution if he acknowledged that he had shaken his son. McGarvey\u2019s questioning suggested that the outcome of the investigation was largely in defendant\u2019s control and, as noted, depended on whether defendant had \u201cset out to kill\u201d his son or merely \u201caccidentally shook his kid too hard.\u201d If the former\u2014a purposeful act\u2014then \u201cthat [would be] bad,\u201d and defendant would be \u201clooking at a long time\u201d and face losing his child forever. But if the latter\u2014a mere accident\u2014then, McGarvey implied, the repercussions would be far less severe. In fact, when posing the hypothetical situation of an accident resulting from a person\u2019s \u201cbad choice,\u201d McGarvey expressly told defendant that such a person would not be convicted but would, instead, get \u201chelp\u201d from the state. And, in an apparent effort to emphasize the benefit of taking the \u201caccident\u201d route, McGarvey told defendant that he himself had once mistreated his own son, and yet he had not suffered adverse consequences. In McGarvey\u2019s fictitious story, he had been caught handling his child in anger, he had admitted a need for help, and, following\u2014or perhaps during\u2014appropriate treatment, he went on to raise his son. In sharing that tale, McGarvey necessarily conveyed the impression that things would be much better for defendant if he admitted a need for help and accepted treatment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The state contends, however, that there are two reasons that McGarvey\u2019s interview tactics cannot be viewed as promising leniency. First, the state notes that McGarvey told defendant that a \u201ccrime [had] already been established\u201d and that what remained for him to determine was the level of the crime. Thus, in the state\u2019s view, McGarvey did not promise treatment in lieu of prosecution. <em>See Pollard, </em>132 Or App at 543 (only a promise of treatment made in lieu of prosecution may render a resulting confession involuntary). Second, the state argues that defendant\u2019s admissions cannot have been induced by any implicit promise that McGarvey may have conveyed, because McGarvey did not condition leniency on defendant making an admission. <em>See id. </em>at 548 (a promise cannot induce an admission in the absence of a contemporaneous quid pro quo); <em>State v. Capwell, </em>64 Or App 710, 716, 669 P2d 808 (1983) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We are not persuaded by either argument. For one thing, McGarvey quickly followed his assertion that a crime had been established with the assurance that a person who just \u201cmade a bad choice\u201d would <em>not </em>be convicted but would, instead, receive help. In light of his other statements, McGarvey\u2019s announcement that a crime had been established at most created an ambiguity. As the party with the burden of proving that defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary, the state bears the consequence of that ambiguity. <em>See Ely, </em>237 Or at 335 (concluding that, where conflicting inferences could be drawn from the evidence, the state had \u201cfailed to show that the confession was, <em>prima facie, </em>a voluntary one\u201d); <em>compare State v. Bounds, </em>71 Or App 744, 747, 694 P2d 566, <em>rev den, </em>299 Or 732 (1985) (concluding that, where the defendant had expressly been told that \u201cthere would be charges,\u201d regardless of whether he admitted to certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>conduct, the district attorney\u2019s statement that he would not \u201c\u2018crucify\u2019\u201d the defendant if he confessed did not amount to a promise of leniency), and <em>State v. Neblock, </em>75 Or App 587, 589, 706 P2d 1020 (1985) (the defendant was not induced to confess by a promise of leniency where he had been told that both treatment and incarceration were among the options the court would consider and that \u201c\u2018taking responsibility for one\u2019s own behavior\u2019 would simply be one variable bearing on the court\u2019s choice among options\u201d), <em>with Pollard, </em>132 Or App at 548-49 (noting, in concluding that the defendant had been induced to confess by implicit promises of leniency, that the defendant had not been told that he would face charges regardless of whether or not he confessed). Thus, whether McGarvey\u2019s statements are viewed as a promise of a less severe outcome or as a promise of no punishment whatsoever, defendant likely understood those statements as offering him some benefit in exchange for his admissions. <em>See Belle, </em>281 Or App at 213 (confessions are unreliable when made under the belief that confessing will garner some benefit).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Furthermore, for closely related reasons, the quid pro quo underlying McGarvey\u2019s questions and statements\u2014 admit to what you have done and things will go better for you\u2014would likely have been apparent to any person in defendant\u2019s position. That is, by explicitly tying treatment to an acknowledged need for help, McGarvey signaled to defendant that the possibility of receiving treatment and avoiding severe consequences depended wholly on his willingness to admit that he had accidentally injured his son. McGarvey told defendant that, if he made such an admission, he could \u201cstart the healing process,\u201d but that, if he denied responsibility altogether, no one would believe him. Taken together, those statements necessarily conveyed to defendant that he might avoid incarceration, but only if he made an admission. <em>See Ruiz-Piza, </em>262 Or App at 576 (noting that the officer\u2019s \u201cobvious intent in drawing a distinction between the two alternatives was to induce defendant to confess to less-serious conduct than it would be assumed that he had committed in the absence of a confession\u201d). In that context, the quid pro quo inherent in McGarvey\u2019s proposal was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s contention that McGarvey and Jenkins threatened his wife and his child and that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>threats, like McGarvey\u2019s promises, induced his confession. As defendant notes, we have previously held that threats against a person\u2019s family can rise to the level of inducement under ORS 136.425(1). For example, in <em>Ruiz-Piza, </em>as in this case, the defendant brought his child to the hospital after she sustained injuries consistent with shaken baby syndrome. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 566. During a subsequent interrogation regarding those injuries, a detective told the defendant that his child\u2019s recovery depended on his admission that he had caused her injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 568-70. On appeal of an order suppressing the defendant\u2019s resulting confession, we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">\u201c[w]hat the officers did *** was cultivate and leverage defendant\u2019s fear that, unless he admitted to shaking her, [his daughter\u2019s] medical care would suffer. *** Having made clear that [his daughter] had serious medical issues that could have been ameliorated by a confession\u2014an assertion that, as a matter of medical fact, is without any support in the record\u2014the officers also appealed to defendant\u2019s paternal responsibilities, his religion, stated that defendant was the <em>only </em>one who could help [his daughter], and stated, in effect, that the way to provide that help was to tell the officers that he had shaken her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 574-75 (emphasis in original). We concluded that that approach constituted a threat that, in conjunction with the officer\u2019s other statements, induced the defendant\u2019s confession, rendering it inadmissible under ORS 136.425(1). <em>Id. </em>at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Although, in the present case, McGarvey and Jenkins did not imply that the life of defendant\u2019s child could depend on his confession, they nonetheless leveraged his sense of family obligation in a manner analogous to the officer\u2019s approach in <em>Ruiz-Piza. </em>McGarvey told defendant that, if he. would not admit to injuring his child, his wife would become a target of the investigation and \u201cprobably lose her job\u201d as a result. And, by telling defendant that his wife would go to trial with him, McGarvey conveyed the message that, if the state could not establish that defendant had caused his child\u2019s injuries, his wife would face the blame. McGarvey appealed to defendant\u2019s duties as a husband to prevent that fate from befalling her, telling him that \u201ca husband should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>stand up for his wife.\u201d Jenkins echoed McGarvey\u2019s comments about defendant\u2019s wife and added an appeal to defendant\u2019s paternal instincts, telling him that, if he did not confess, she would have to put his son in \u201cstranger foster care.\u201d As in <em>Ruiz-Piza, </em>those comments targeted defendant\u2019s vulnerabilities as a husband and father. <em>See id. </em>at 574-75. And, as in that case, McGarvey\u2019s and Jenkins\u2019s statements had the effect of informing defendant that the only way to avoid that harm to his family was to confess, regardless of whether he had actually caused his son\u2019s injuries. We see little significance in McGarvey\u2019s subsequent statement that he did not want defendant to take the fall for his wife, because, by then, McGarvey\u2019s and Jenkins\u2019s emotional pleas would likely have taken their toll.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The state, relying on <em>State v. Bates, </em>92 Or App 385, 387-88, 758 P2d 421, <em>rev den, </em>307 Or 170 (1988), contends that McGarvey\u2019s and Jenkins\u2019s \u201ctruthful references\u201d to the likely consequences for defendant\u2019s wife and son if defendant did not confess cannot be considered unlawful inducements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In <em>Bates, </em>a case not decided under ORS 136.425(1), the defendant confessed to burglary during an interrogation in which an officer told him that he \u201cwould have to question his mother and brother if the incident was not resolved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387. We concluded without further discussion that the officer\u2019s threat \u201cto question defendant\u2019s relatives about the burglary, which he had a right to do * * * did not constitute coercion and d[id] not render defendant\u2019s subsequent statements involuntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388. To the extent that <em>Bates </em>has any relevance to our analysis under ORS 136.425(1), it is readily distinguishable from this case. In that case, the trial court found that the officer had merely threatened to question the defendant\u2019s relatives, not arrest them as the defendant had contended. <em>Id. </em>at 387-88 (stating that trial court made implicit credibility finding to that effect). Further, in concluding as a matter of law that the officer\u2019s \u201c\u2018threat\u2019\u201d to conduct that questioning did not constitute coercion, we did not consider whether that threat may have caused the defendant to \u201cperceive[] that he *** [might] avoid some detriment by confessing [,] \u201d <em>Belle, </em>281 Or App at 213 (considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that possibility without regard to whether investigating officer lawfully could or could not do what was threatened). <em>See Bates, </em>92 Or App at 387-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Here, in contrast, the undisputed record discloses that McGarvey and Jenkins threatened to do substantially more than merely question defendant\u2019s wife. McGarvey made it clear that his investigation would have real and harmful consequences for her, including costing her valuable employment and subjecting her to trial for abusing her child. Jenkins intimated that she would aggravate those consequences by taking defendant\u2019s child away from his wife\u2014and from him\u2014and placing the child with strangers. And, as noted, under ORS 136.425(1), the question is whether any fear produced by those threats induced defendant\u2019s statements, not whether those threats were true or false. <em>See Belle, </em>281 Or App at 231 (\u201cIt does not matter whether the person making the threat actually has the ability or authority to carry it out, as long as the defendant reasonably perceives the threat to be real.\u201d). Thus, contrary to the state\u2019s contention, <em>Bates </em>does not affect our consideration of McGarvey\u2019s and Jenkins\u2019s statements about defendant\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">And, as the state candidly recognizes, those statements were of a sort likely to exert psychological pressure on defendant. But, as noted, the state contends that any such pressure did not rise to the level of inducement such that defendant\u2019s resulting statements must be excluded under ORS 136.425(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Ultimately, however, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether, standing alone, the statements regarding defendant\u2019s family were sufficient to induce his admissions to shaking his child. In evaluating whether defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary, we do not consider any factor in isolation\u2014we consider the totality of the circumstances. Here, those circumstances include not only the threats regarding defendant\u2019s family, but also McGarvey\u2019s implicit promise of leniency if defendant admitted responsibility and, as a result, alleviated those threats. <em>See id. </em>at 213 (either the receipt of a benefit or the avoidance of a detriment may render an admission involuntary under ORS 136.425(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>In light of those circumstances\u2014and in the absence of any countervailing circumstances identified by the state or apparent from the record\u2014we conclude that defendant\u2019s statements were not voluntary. That is, by implicitly promising defendant leniency, while simultaneously exploiting his vulnerabilities as a husband and a father, McGarvey and Jenkins critically impaired defendant\u2019s capacity for self determination, such that his admissions cannot be considered \u201cthe product of an essentially free, unconstrained, and informed choice,\u201d <em>Ruiz-Piza, </em>262 Or App at 573 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">To summarize, we conclude that the admissions defendant made at the Sutherlin Police Department were induced by promises and threats and that the trial court, therefore, erred in admitting them over defendant\u2019s ORS 136.425(1) objection. In light of that conclusion, it is unnecessary to decide whether the trial court plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury of its duty to determine whether those statements were voluntary before considering them as evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Convictions on Counts 2, 3, and 4 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\"> In its letter opinion, the trial court noted that a transcript and recording of the police interview were in evidence and that the court, therefore, need not include specific findings regarding that interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-6\"> By its terms, ORS 136.425(1) applies to both confessions and admissions. Neither party relies on any distinction between confessions and admissions as far as defendant\u2019s statements are concerned, and we use those terms interchangeably in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-5\"> The state argues that McGarvey\u2019s story could not reasonably have suggested to defendant that he would avoid prosecution if he admitted to injuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>his son accidentally, because McGarvey did not say that his son had been injured, and because McGarvey said he had been caught by his wife, not law enforcement. As we discuss below, in the context of the interrogation as a whole, McGarvey\u2019s story implied that defendant would not be prosecuted if the injuries to his son were accidental. <em>See Ruiz-Piza, </em>262 Or App at 574 n 4 (noting, in the context of an officer\u2019s statements that the defendant\u2019s child\u2019s medical care depended on the defendant admitting culpability, that, even though the \u201cdefendant might have, in circumstances more conducive to contemplation, realized that whether he confessed could not logically bear on the treatment his daughter received [,] the \u201cofficers had exploited the vulnerability of the defendant\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
