Defendant argues that the legislature did not intend for ORS 814.070(1) to apply to pedestrians who are in the process of crossing the roadway. We agree with defendant; ORS 814.070(1) was not intended to apply to pedestrians who are in the process of crossing the roadway, and there is insufficient evidence in the record for the court to find that defendant was \u201cimproperly proceeding along\u201d the roadway. ORS 814.070(1). Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In reviewing a motion for judgment of acquittal, \u201cwe state the facts in the light most favorable to the state.\u201d <em>State v. Massei, </em>247 Or App 30, 32, 268 P3d 774 (2011). Southeast Division Street in Portland, Oregon, runs east-west. Southeast 121st Avenue runs north from where it intersects with Southeast Division Street. Division is a four-lane road with two lanes of travel in each direction that are separated by a median lane that can be used by cars turning left off of Division onto the side streets. In this case, a car that had been traveling eastbound on Division pulled into the median lane to turn left onto 121st. Defendant was walking westbound on Division and he started crossing 121st. As defendant \u201cwas walking diagonally northbound across\u201d 121st, he was struck by the car turning left off of Division onto 121st. Defendant was approximately 20 feet north of where 121st intersects with Division when he was struck by the car. Officer Schmautz arrived at the accident scene and issued defendant a citation for being a pedestrian in an improper position upon, or improperly proceeding along, a roadway in violation of ORS 814.070(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">After the state presented its case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal. Defendant, quoting <em>State v. Tyler, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>168 Or App 600, 607, 7 P3d 624 (2000), argued that ORS 814.070(1) \u201cdescribes various prohibited methods of walking along a highway,\u201d but does not apply to a pedestrian \u201ccrossing a street at a place other than a crosswalk, other than at right angles.\u201d Defendant continued, asserting that the court could not find him guilty of violating ORS 814.070(1) because \u201cthe only thing that the state has shown that [defendant] has done, [is] that he\u2019s crossed the street * * * not in the crosswalk, and * * * not at a right angle.\u201d The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Tyler </em>and ruled that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">\u201cfor purposes of [ORS 814.070(1)], *** [defendant] was walking diagonally across the street in the lane of traffic, and not in a position along and upon any shoulder, as far as practicable away from the traveled roadway, and *** not near the edge. [Defendant] was not using any available shoulder or whatever sidewalk was available to him. And he was certainly not near the side. And that he is in violation of [ORS] 814.070. And by a preponderance of the evidence I find him guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">On appeal, defendant reprises his argument that \u201c[t]he [s]tate has failed to show that defendant has violated * * * ORS 814.070, which prohibit [s] various ways of walking along or standing on a roadway, but does not apply to the crossing of a street.\u201d The state contends that the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal because \u201c[t]he state presented testimony that defendant was crossing 121st \u2018diagonally northbound\u2019 *** and that 121st runs north-south.\u201d The state asserts that that evidence \u201centitled a factfinder to find that defendant was walking \u2018along\u2019 121st at the time, in the sense that he was generally moving in the same direction that the roadway follows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In a case like this one, involving a violation as opposed to a crime, \u201cfw]hat is required to prove a violation of a statute enacted by the legislature at trial is a question of legislative intent subject to the usual rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>State v. King, </em>199 Or App 278, 283, 111 P3d 1146, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 544 (2005). After we settle the legal issue of what is required to prove a violation of a statute, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether the court could have found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>essential elements of the violation had been proved by \u201ca preponderance of the evidence.\u201d ORS 153.076(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The issue on appeal centers on what is required to prove that defendant improperly \u201cproceed[ed] along\u201d 121st. ORS 814.070(1)(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As noted, our first task is to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intentions by applying the \u201cusual rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>King, </em>199 Or App at 283. \u201cWe ascertain the legislature\u2019s intentions by examining the text of the statute in its context, along with relevant legislative history, and, if necessary, canons of construction.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 75, 261 P3d 1234 (2011) (citing <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We start with the statutory text of ORS 814.070 because it is \u201cthe best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). As previously noted, ORS 814.070 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201c(1) A pedestrian commits the offense of pedestrian with improper position upon or improperly proceeding along a highway if the pedestrian does any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201c(a) Takes a position upon or proceeds along and upon the roadway where there is an adjacent usable sidewalk or shoulder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The term \u201calong\u201d is not statutorily defined so we look to dictionary definitions to ascertain the plain meaning of that term. <em>See Gaines, </em>346 Or at 175 (using dictionary definitions to discern the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of terms). As we will discuss, in this context, an appropriate definition for the ordinary meaning of \u201calong\u201d is \u201cin a line parallel with the length or direction of * * * distinguished from <em>across.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>60 (unabridged ed 1993) (emphasis in original). Thus, proceeding \u201calong\u201d a roadway is not synonymous with proceeding \u201cacross\u201d a roadway. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>As the context reveals, in enacting ORS 814.070 the legislature was primarily concerned with people walking along the roadway when there is a \u201cusable sidewalk or shoulder,\u201d ORS 814.070(1)(a), and pedestrians staying \u201cas far as practicable from the roadway edge\u201d when the highway has an \u201cadjacent shoulder area on one or both sides.\u201d ORS 814.070(1)(b). Nothing in the immediate context of ORS 814.070(1) suggests that it was intended to apply to.pedestrians walking across a roadway. Rather, the immediate context suggests that the legislature intended to prohibit pedestrians from proceeding upon the roadway \u201cin a line parallel with the length or direction of\u2019 the roadway when there is a usable sidewalk or shoulder. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">For example, ORS 814.070(1)(d) provides that a pedestrian commits the offense of \u201cimproper position upon or improperly proceeding along\u201d a highway if the pedestrian \u201c[d]oes not *** proceed along and upon the right highway shoulder, as far as practicable from the roadway edge, on a divided highway that *** does have a shoulder area.\u201d And, in the case of \u201ca highway that has neither sidewalk nor shoulder available,\u201d ORS 814.070(1)(e) provides that a pedestrian commits the offense of \u201cimproper position upon or improperly proceeding along\u201d a highway if the pedestrian \u201c [f] ails to * * * proceed along and upon\u201d the roadway \u201cas near as practicable to an outside edge of the roadway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The exceptions to compliance with the provisions.of ORS 814.070 also reveal that the legislature was primarily concerned with activities that occur \u201cin a line parallel with the length or direction of\u2019 the roadway. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 60. For example, ORS 814.070(1)(c) provides an exception to compliance for hitchhikers and ORS 814.070(1)(d) provides an exception for individuals \u201cpicking up litter or removing noxious weeds on either side of the roadway.\u201d ORS 814.070(4) provides an exception for individuals \u201cproceeding along\u201d a \u201cnarrow residential roadway\u201d so long as \u201cthe pedestrian does not create a traffic hazard\u201d and \u201c[s]igns are posted giving notice that pedestrians may be present upon or along the narrow residential roadway.\u201d Contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant violated ORS 814.070 by \u201cwalking diagonally across the street in the lane of traffic,\u201d none of the provisions of ORS 814.070 expressly prohibits a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>pedestrian from crossing a roadway at anything other than a right angle.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In <em>Tyler, </em>168 Or App 600, we concluded that the legislature\u2019s policy decision to decriminalize all minor traffic infractions, including pedestrian violations, preempted a Portland City ordinance that made crossing a street, other than at right angles, a crime punishable by six months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of up to $500. In reaching that conclusion we noted that, \u201calthough th[e] [Vehicle] Code imposes a number of requirements on pedestrians, <em>it does not prohibit crossing the street at other than right angles\u201d Id. </em>at 606-07 (citing various statutes, including ORS 814.070) (emphasis added). We stated that the city ordinance was preempted because \u201ca pedestrian * * * who walked down the middle of a street with no intention of crossing it * * * would be subject to a fine of no more than $75, while a pedestrian who crossed a street diagonally outside of a crosswalk would be subject to a fine of $500 and six months in jail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608-09. Although <em>Tyler </em>is not directly on point, as it does not specifically interpret the disputed provisions of ORS 814.070 at issue in this case, it tends to undercut the trial court\u2019s conclusion and the state\u2019s argument that defendant violated ORS 814.070 by crossing the street diagonally.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">As noted in <em>Tyler, </em>ORS 814.040 concerns a pedestrian\u2019s obligation to yield to vehicles when <em>crossing </em>a roadway. 168 Or App at 606. ORS 814.040(1)(b) provides that a pedestrian commits the offense of \u201cfailure to yield to a vehicle\u201d if the pedestrian \u201c[f]ails to yield the right of way to a vehicle upon a roadway <em>when the pedestrian is crossing the roadway at any point </em>other than within a marked crosswalk or an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Based on defendant\u2019s underlying conduct, defendant may have violated ORS 814.040 if he was outside of the \u201cunmarked crosswalk at [the] intersection\u201d of 121st and Division when he was struck by the car. However, defendant was not cited for violating ORS 814.040, and, as we have explained, ORS 814.070 does not address a pedestrian\u2019s obligations while crossing a roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Based on the text and context of ORS 814.070, we conclude that ORS 814.070(1)(a) requires the state to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>that a pedestrian improperly \u201cproceed [ed] along\u201d the roadway by adducing evidence that the pedestrian\u2019s direction of travel was in a line that generally paralleled the direction of the roadway \u201cwhere there is an adjacent usable sidewalk or shoulder.\u201d We now apply that understanding of the \u201cproceeds along\u201d element to the facts of this case to determine whether the court could have found that the essential elements of the violation had been proved by \u201ca preponderance of the evidence.\u201d ORS 153.076(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The record in this case discloses certain key facts. The state\u2019s witnesses testified that defendant was crossing the road and that defendant was about 20 feet to the north of the intersection with Division when he was struck by the car while crossing 121st. That evidence suggests that defendant was, in fact, proceeding across 121st; it does not demonstrate that defendant was crossing the street at such an angle that the court could find that defendant\u2019s direction of travel was in a line that generally paralleled the northbound direction of 121st. Furthermore, the state\u2019s eyewitness testified that defendant \u201cwas walking diagonally northbound <em>across </em>[121st] at a diagonal\u201d when he was struck by the car turning north onto 121st from Division, which also fails to demonstrate that defendant was walking in a line that generally paralleled 121st.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">On this record, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the court could not have found by the preponderance of the evidence that defendant\u2019s direction of travel was in a line that generally paralleled the northbound direction of 121st. Therefore, the trial court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> ORS 814.070(1) provides, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201cA pedestrian commits the offense of pedestrian with improper position upon or improperly proceeding along a highway if the pedestrian does any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201c(a) Takes a position upon or proceeds along and upon the roadway where there is an adjacent usable sidewalk or shoulder.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\"> Defendant does not dispute that he was \u201cupon the roadway where there is an adjacent usable sidewalk or shoulder\u201d and the state makes no argument regarding defendant taking a \u201cposition upon\u201d the roadway. ORS 814.070(1)(a). Below, and again on appeal, the parties disputed only whether defendant was \u201cproceed[ing] along\u201d the roadway and the trial court\u2019s ruling was made on that ground. Thus, we address only the issue of what is required to prove that a defendant \u201cproceeds along\u201d a roadway. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
