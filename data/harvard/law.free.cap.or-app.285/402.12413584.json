In that order, the board upheld insurer SAIF Corporation\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s \u201ccombined condition\u201d claim, which SAIF issued after determining that claimant\u2019s accepted workplace injury was no longer the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s disability or need for treatment. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B); ORS 656.262(6)(c); <em>Brown v. SAIF, </em>361 Or 241, 243, 391 P3d 773 (2017) (explaining the nature of a \u201ccombined condition\u201d claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits). We review under ORS 183.482(8), ORS 656.298(7), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">On February 11, 2013, claimant injured his low back at work, and claimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits in connection with the injury. SAIF accepted the claim, designating the accepted condition as a \u201clumbar strain.\u201d Later, SAIF modified its acceptance to accept a combined condition beginning on the date of claimant\u2019s workplace injury. SAIF identified the combined condition as the lumbar strain that claimant suffered at work combined with claimant\u2019s preexisting lumbar spondylosis. SAIF subsequently denied the continued compensability of claimant\u2019s combined condition, finding that, as of August 7, 2013, claimant\u2019s workplace injury was no longer the major contributing cause of his disability or need for treatment. Thereafter, SAIF closed the claim, awarding time loss but no permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Claimant requested a hearing on the denial before an administrative law judge (ALJ) and the ALJ affirmed. Claimant then sought review before the board, and the board, over the dissent of one board member, adopted and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order, with supplementary analysis addressing whether SAIF\u2019s denial was permissible under our decision in <em>Brown v. SAIF, </em>262 Or App 640, 325 P3d 834 (2014), <em>reversed, </em>361 Or 241, 391 P3d 773 (2017).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Before us, claimant again challenges the board\u2019s August 2013 denial of the compensability of his combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>condition. In his first assignment of error, he asserts that the wording of the board\u2019s order reflects that, in upholding SAIF\u2019s denial, the board erroneously analyzed whether claimant\u2019s \u201caccepted condition\u201d (i.e., lumbar strain) remained the major contributing cause of his combined condition, rather than analyzing whether claimant\u2019s \u201cwork-related injury incident\u201d remained the major contributing cause of his combined condition, as required by our decision in <em>Brown. See </em>262 Or App at 656 (holding that correct test to determine if a combined condition remains compensable is \u201cwhether claimant\u2019s work-related injury incident is the major contributing cause of the combined condition\u201d). Relatedly, in his third assignment of error, claimant asserts that even if the board applied the correct legal standard under our decision in <em>Brown, </em>the board\u2019s determination that claimant\u2019s work-related injury incident was no longer the major contributing cause of his combined condition is not supported by substantial evidence. That is because, in claimant\u2019s view, the medical opinions in the record show only that claimant\u2019s <em>accepted lumbar strain </em>was no longer the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s combined condition, and do not support the inference that claimant\u2019s \u201cwork-related injury incident\u201d was no longer the major contributing cause of the combined condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In addition, apart from the <em>Brown </em>issues, claimant asserts in his second assignment of error that the board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence for a different reason. He points out that our case law requires an insurer to present \u201cevidence at the hearing that persuades the board that the claimant\u2019s condition has <em>changed </em>since the [insurer] accepted the combined condition\u201d in order to carry its burden of proving that an accepted condition is no longer the major contributing cause of a combined condition. <em>Washington County v. Jansen, </em>248 Or App 335, 345, 273 P3d 278 (2012) (emphasis added); <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Young, </em>219 Or App 410, 418, 182 P3d 298 (2008) (explaining that medical evidence must demonstrate a change in the claimant\u2019s condition in order to support a finding that claimant\u2019s combined condition is no longer compensable). Claimant then asserts that the record does not contain substantial evidence that his condition changed between the date his accepted combined condition started and August 7, 2013, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the date as of which SAIF determined claimant\u2019s combined condition was no longer compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Whatever the merits of claimant\u2019s first and third assignments of error under our decision in <em>Brown, </em>they have been foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent reversal of that decision. <em>Brown, </em>361 Or at 283. There, the court held that \u201can employer is entitled to deny a combined condition claim when the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of that combined condition,\u201d rejecting our contrary conclusion that an employer has to prove that the \u201cwork-related injury incident\u201d no longer remained a major contributing cause of any combined condition in order to deny compensability. <em>Id. </em>Here, regardless of any causal role that the \u201cwork-related injury incident\u201d continues to play in claimant\u2019s combined condition, it is undisputed that, at the time of SAIF\u2019s denial of the compensability of claimant\u2019s combined condition, claimant\u2019s accepted lumbar strain was no longer the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s combined condition. Accordingly, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brown, </em>we reject claimant\u2019s first and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">As to claimant\u2019s second assignment of error, the question is whether substantial evidence supports the finding that claimant\u2019s medical condition changed between the date of SAIF\u2019s effective acceptance of claimant\u2019s combined condition and August 7, 2013, the date that, according to SAIF, claimant\u2019s combined condition became no longer com-pensable. <em>See Oregon Drywall Systems, Inc. v. Bacon, </em>208 Or App 205, 210, 144 P3d 987 (2006) (holding that \u201cthe effective date of acceptance provides a baseline for determining whether a worker\u2019s condition has changed so that\u201d the accepted condition no longer remains the major contributing cause of a combined condition). \u201cSubstantial evidence supports a finding when the record, viewed as a whole, permits a reasonable person to make the finding.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>309 Or 292, 294, 787 P2d 884 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that the requisite change occurred. In particular, substantial evidence supports the finding that claimant\u2019s accepted lumbar strain had improved by August 7, 2013. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The evidence includes an independent medical evaluation performed by Dr. Rosenbaum on March 26, 2013. At that time, Rosenbaum opined that claimant\u2019s accepted lumbar strain remained the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s need for treatment, and anticipated that the lumbar strain would persist for another 30 days:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\">\u201cThe work injury continues to be the major contributing cause of the need for treatment. This is assuming the accuracy of the claimant\u2019s subjective symptoms with regard to the diagnosis of a lumbar strain. He has persistent symptoms and his treatment regimen has not persisted for the full length of time that one would reasonable expect a lumbar strain to persist. Therefore an additional 30 days of treatment would be reasonable referable to his diagnosis of a lumbar strain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">While a prognosis that a medical condition <em>will change </em>in the future is not substantial evidence that the condition in fact <em>did change, </em>in this case, the record also contains evidence of a report from claimant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Bert, from August 2013. The report, which is based on Bert\u2019s examination of claimant on August 7, 2013, notes Rosenbaum\u2019s earlier opinion that claimant\u2019s lumber strain would need only an additional 30 days of treatment after March 26, 2013, and also indicates that Bert determined that claimant\u2019s lumber strain was no longer the major contributing cause of his need for treatment by August 7, 2013. In addition, the record contains evidence of a letter signed by Bert in October 2013 to clarify his August 2013 report. That letter confirms that Bert\u2019s August 2013 opinion that claimant\u2019s accepted lumbar strain was no longer the major contributing cause of his combined condition was based on Bert\u2019s clinical exams of claimant, and further states that \u201cthe lumbar strain showed the expected improvement with treatment and passage of time as expected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">From that evidence, a reasonable factfinder could find that claimant\u2019s condition changed between the effective date of the acceptance of the combined condition and August 7, 2013. Rosenbaum\u2019s opinion was that the lumbar strain was expected to improve within 30 days of March 26, 2013, and the October letter signed by Bert indicates that that \u201cexpected\u201d improvement in fact occurred. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>claimant notes correctly that Bert\u2019s October letter does not state expressly that the improvement of the lumbar strain occurred by August 7, 2013, the point of Bert\u2019s October letter was to clarify his August opinion, which focused on claimant\u2019s condition as of August 7, 2013. In any event, Rosenbaum\u2019s opinion that the lumbar strain was expected to improve within 30 days of March 26, 2013, and Bert\u2019s opinion that the \u201cexpected improvement\u201d in fact occurred, permits the reasonable inference that the improvement had occurred by the time that Bert examined claimant on August 7, 2013, if not sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> The dissenting board member disputed that SAIF\u2019s denial comported with the standard articulated in our decision in <em>Brown, </em>and would have concluded that the record lacked substantial evidence to support the findings required by that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
