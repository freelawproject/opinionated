He acknowledges that he did not preserve the assigned error, but requests that we review\u2014and reverse\u2014for plain error, as we have done in a host of other cases. <em>See, e.g., State v. Runnels, </em>283 Or App 512, 390 P3d 1120 (2017), <em>State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 320 P3d 670 (2014). In response, pointing to our decisions in <em>State v. Wehr, </em>275 Or App 528, 365 P3d 148 (2015), <em>State v. Perez, </em>275 Or App 566, 365 P3d 141 (2015); and <em>State v. Cook, </em>267 Or App 776, 341 P3d 848 (2014), the state argues that defendant assented to the state\u2019s recommended fee award and that, for that reason, any error is either invited or not plain. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that defendant did not invite the error, that the error is plain, and that we should exercise our discretion to review and correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The relevant facts are largely procedural. Defendant was charged with a number of offenses. The trial court appointed counsel for defendant. At the same time, as authorized by ORS 151.487(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court determined that defendant had the financial capacity to contribute $1,750 toward the cost of his appointed counsel and signed a limited judgment ordering defendant to pay that amount, along with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>additional $20 for the processing of his application for court-appointed counsel, to the state \u201cimmediately.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Later, defendant and the state reached a plea agreement, under which defendant agreed to plead guilty to 10 of the 17 charges against him in exchange for the state\u2019s agreement to dismiss the remaining counts and cap its sentencing recommendation at 600 months\u2019 incarceration total. Apart from the parties\u2019 agreement that the state would not recommend more than 600 months\u2019 incarceration total, the parties did not agree on a sentencing recommendation, and each party submitted its own sentencing recommendation to the court. The state\u2019s sentencing recommendation included a suggestion that the court impose $1,664 in court-appointed attorney fees in its judgment, along with $2,000 in fines. Defendant\u2019s recommendation omitted any suggestion that the court should order defendant to pay any additional amounts of attorney fees at sentencing. At sentencing, neither the state nor defendant raised the issue of attorney fees, and the trial court made no on-the-record determination that defendant had the ability to pay $1,664 in attorney fees beyond the $1,750 that the court initially determined defendant had the ability to pay. The trial court nevertheless ordered defendant to pay $1,664 in attorney fees and included that amount in the judgment of conviction. Defendant did not object at that time, but has appealed that judgment, assigning error solely to the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We have held that it is plain error for a trial court to order a criminal defendant to pay court-appointed attorney fees when the record contains no evidence to permit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>inference that the defendant is or may be able to pay those fees. <em>Runnels, </em>283 Or App at 515-16. That would seem to be the case here. In fact, the record as a whole affirmatively supports the inference that defendant is not able to pay the $1,664 in fees awarded at sentencing. As noted, at the time it appointed counsel, the court determined that the maximum contribution that defendant could afford to make toward court-appointed counsel was $1,750 and ordered defendant to pay that amount. That suggests that defendant is not capable of paying more than the $1,750 that the court initially ordered him to pay. Yet, as a result of the judgment on appeal, defendant has been ordered to pay more than $1,750 toward his court-appointed attorney fees\u2014$1,664 more, to be exact.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Relying primarily on <em>Wehr, </em>the state contends that defendant affirmatively consented to the state\u2019s recommended sentence\u2014and thus the fee award\u2014when he entered the plea agreement. Therefore, the state argues, defendant \u201caffirmatively invited or consented to the trial court\u2019s imposition of fees\u201d and that, for that reason, we should either conclude that defendant invited the error or, at a minimum, that defendant\u2019s conduct renders any error by the trial court not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The weak point in the state\u2019s argument is its factual predicate\u2014that is, that defendant agreed to the state\u2019s recommended sentence when he entered the plea agreement. Defendant, in fact, did not do so. Although the plea petition\u2014which is a form document\u2014has a box that a defendant may check to indicate that a defendant stipulates to the state\u2019s recommended sentence, defendant did not check that box in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the parties made competing sentencing recommendations both in writing and orally, and defendant at no time suggested that the court should award additional attorney fees for court-appointed counsel. In other words, nothing that defendant said or did communicated affirmatively that defendant was assenting to the state\u2019s recommendation that the judgment include an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>It is in that respect that this case differs significantly from <em>Wehr </em>and the other cases in which we have concluded that a defendant, through affirmative words or conduct, either invited any error by the trial court or, at a minimum, rendered any error not plain. In <em>Wehr, </em>the defendant\u2019s own sentencing memorandum recommended a sentence including $1,600 in attorney fees. 275 Or App at 529. In <em>Perez, </em>the defendant orally indicated his assent\u2014twice\u2014 to the imposition of attorney fees in a specific amount and the court awarded that amount of fees. 275 Or App at 567. In <em>Cook, </em>the defendant initially objected to a proposed attorney fee award on the ground that he lacked the ability to pay it but, when the trial court reduced the award by a significant amount, the defendant represented that he was \u201cgood with\u201d the reduced amount. 267 Or App at 779. Finally, in <em>State v. Almaraz-Martinez, </em>282 Or App 576, 581-82, 385 P3d 1234 (2016), we declined to review as plain error the trial court\u2019s imposition of an award of attorney fees where the defendant had stipulated to an award of attorney fees. As should be evident, in each of those cases, the defendant, through affirmative representations to the trial court, effectively walked the court into imposing the fee awards challenged on appeal, either inviting any error or, at a minimum, precluding the conclusion that the trial court plainly erred in the absence of case law holding that a trial court errs by awarding fees based on a defendant\u2019s affirmative assent to the amount of fees awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">Here, defendant did not affirmatively represent to the trial court that a fee award would be appropriate; instead, he stood by passively as the court imposed the award. That makes this case like the ones in which we routinely have concluded that a trial court plainly errs when it imposes an award of fees for court-appointed counsel in the absence of evidence that the defendant is or may be able to pay such fees. <em>See Runnels, </em>283 Or App at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The remaining question is whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error, taking into account the gravity of the error and other circumstances. <em>Id. </em>We readily conclude that we should. As a result of the judgment on appeal, defendant has been ordered to pay court-appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>attorney fees totaling $3,414, notwithstanding the court\u2019s previous determination that defendant had the ability to contribute only $1,750 toward the costs of court-appointed counsel. Moreover, defendant was sentenced to a lengthy term of incarceration, $1,644 is a substantial amount of money, and there is no indication in the record that defendant has any ability to pay that amount, particularly in view of the previously imposed fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Finally, one other consideration weighs in favor of exercising our discretion to correct the error in this case. In entering judgment on the $1,664 fee award, the trial court did not determine the extent to which that fee award was duplicative of the $1,750 that the court ordered defendant to pay at the time that it appointed counsel, even though ORS 151.505(1) provides that fee awards made at the end of a criminal case may not duplicate those amounts imposed previously.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, there is at least some probability that the fees imposed in the judgment on appeal duplicate the fees imposed in the court\u2019s previous order, and it would not be just to require an indigent defendant to satisfy a duplicative award.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\"> ORS 151.487(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">\u201cIf in determining that a person is financially eligible for appointed counsel under ORS 151.485, the court finds that the person has financial resources that enable the person to pay in full or in part the administrative costs of determining the eligibility of the person and the costs of the legal and other services to be provided at state expense that are related to the provision of appointed counsel, the court shall enter a limited judgment requiring that the person pay to the Public Defense Services Account established by ORS 151.225, through the clerk of the court, the amount that it finds the person is able to pay without creating substantial hardship in providing basic economic necessities to the person or the person\u2019s dependent family.
