He argues, among other things, that the convictions were not relevant for the nonpropensity purposes that the state advanced and that admission of the evidence was not harmless. The state responds that the trial court did not err in admitting the convictions because they were relevant to defendant\u2019s intent. We agree with defendant that the trial court erred in concluding that the evidence was relevant on any theory that the state advanced, and we agree that the error was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We review a trial court\u2019s ruling admitting evidence of other acts as relevant to a nonpropensity purpose contemplated by OEC 404(3) for errors of law, <em>State v. Baughman, </em>361 Or 386, 406, 393 P3d 1132 (2017), and in light of the record that was before the court at the time it made its decision, <em>State v. Johnson, </em>281 Or App 51, 53, 380 P3d 1023 (2016).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">At the outset of the trial, the state moved <em>in limine </em>to introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s three prior second-degree robbery convictions and three prior third-degree robbery convictions. The state\u2019s memorandum in support of its motion provided some factual context based on what it expected the evidence of the charged conduct to show, and the theory of defense it expected defendant to raise at trial. The court ultimately ruled on the motion on the second day of trial. The following facts are drawn from the memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>and the colloquies concerning the motion, and from the evidence and arguments present\u00e9d at trial up to the point that the trial court made its ultimate ruling, on the morning of the second day of trial, that evidence of three robbery convictions\u2014one second degree and two third degree\u2014would be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">At trial, the state presented evidence that, on the evening in question, defendant entered a pizza restaurant and told the manager, Zimmerman, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m here to rob you\u2019 \u201d or \u201c\u2018I\u2019m going to rob you.\u2019\u201d Zimmerman was between defendant and the cash register. Zimmerman \u201cwas kind of shocked\u201d and defendant repeated, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m going to rob you.\u2019\u201d Defendant was holding one fist up, and with the other hand, he reached in his waistband, as if he were grabbing for a weapon, and Zimmerman thought he was \u201ctrying to intimidate\u201d him. At that point, Zimmerman pulled a gun out from behind the counter and pointed it at defendant. Defendant put both hands up, and said, \u201c\u2018shoot me now, just shoot me. I want.to commit suicide, just shoot me.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Zimmerman put his gun away, grabbed defendant, and put him outside. Defendant started to walk away, and Zimmerman went back inside, locked the door, and called 9-1-1. He told the 9-1-1 operator that defendant \u201cwas going to rob\u201d him. He also said that defendant \u201cwanted me to shoot him,\u201d and that defendant was \u201cprobably drunk or he was on drugs or something.\u201d Zimmerman had not noticed anything specifically that suggested defendant was using drugs or alcohol, but he thought that \u201cthere was just something off that just didn\u2019t add up.\u201d While Zimmerman was speaking with the 9-1-1 operator, defendant returned and yelled outside the restaurant. Zimmerman told the 9-1-1 operator that defendant was yelling through the window for Zimmerman to shoot him. At trial, Zimmerman said he could not hear what defendant was yelling through the window. Police located and arrested defendant a short while later at a nearby bus stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Defendant was charged with second-degree robbery. ORS 164.405.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s opening statement suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that he would present witnesses who would testify that he had expressed that day that he planned to kill himself, and had asked for help with killing himself. The state\u2019s memorandum similarly stated that defendant had provided notice of several witnesses who were prepared to testify that defendant was depressed and suicidal on that day. The state anticipated that defendant would present a defense disputing that he had the intent to commit robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"aso-dedup-0\">In its memorandum, the state argued that defendant\u2019s prior robbery convictions were relevant for the non-propensity purposes of proving intent, motive, plan, and absence of mistake or accident under established theories of relevance contemplated by OEC 404(3). The state argued that each theory of relevance related to whether defendant had the requisite intent when he engaged in the charged acts. The state did not advance an argument that, in spite of the propensity prohibition contained in OEC 404(3), under OEC 404(4) the evidence would nonetheless be admissible <em>as propensity evidence </em>if relevant to a fact at issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>citations to OEC 404(4) were in the context of its argument that, under that rule as it was then interpreted, the trial court was precluded from conducting OEC 403 balancing except to the degree that it was constitutionally required; the state continued to refer to intent, motive, plan, and absence of mistake or accident as the theories of relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\">Defendant argued that the state had failed to establish, as the proponent of the evidence, that the convictions were admissible for a nonpropensity purpose. He specifically argued that the relevance of the prior robberies, for the purposes that the state had identified, could not be determined without reference to the circumstances or facts underlying the convictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The trial court initially noted that \u201cintent, in this case, is going to be at issue,\u201d and that because OEC \u201c404(4) seeks to take any balancing tests out of the analysis[.] *** I don\u2019t really have a basis for excluding it.\u201d Defendant asked, before the court made a final ruling, that the state be required to produce the police reports related to the convictions. \u201cI think if you want to analyze this and see the relation between the past cases and this case, that, I think, is what we are trying to do\u2014to see if those can demonstrate intent in this case. I\u2019d need to see the facts of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>cases before I could really\u2014and I think, before Your Honor could really\u2014make that determination [.] \u201d After seeing the police reports the next morning, defendant argued that the prior robberies were not relevant. \u201cI think that these police reports are kind of an example of why it\u2019s dangerous just to offer the convictions as proof of intent, especially on the 443 [sic].\u201d Defendant argued that using the prior crimes to prove intent required an analysis of the facts of the prior crimes, and that for the prior crimes to be relevant based on the state\u2019s theories, the state\u2019s evidence would have to include more than just proof of the convictions. Defendant contended, \u201cI think that this is clearly a case where the allegations in this case are different than the factual pattern in those cases, so it actually misleads the jury even further to only offer the convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\">The trial court noted that the state was not offering the police reports. The motion concerned only whether the evidence of defendant\u2019s convictions for robbery would be admitted on any of the state\u2019s proffered theories of relevance. The court stated that it would not consider the circumstances of the convictions, because those facts were not being offered. It then ruled that the state would be allowed to use the three most recent robbery convictions\u2014one second-degree and two third-degree\u2014based on the analysis in the state\u2019s memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the admission of those prior robbery convictions. He argues, among other things, that the trial court erred in concluding that the state had established the logical relevancy of the convictions to any of the OEC 404(3) nonpropensity purposes it identified below, without considering the underlying facts. To use his prior conduct to prove his intent in this case, he contends, the state had to show more than just the convictions themselves; it had to show that the circumstances of the prior crimes made them relevant to a fact in issue on something besides a propensity-based theory of \u201conce a robber, always a robber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The state contends that, under <em>State v. Williams, </em>357 Or 1, 346 P3d 455 (2015), which was decided after the conclusion of defendant\u2019s trial, it does not need to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>that the other acts evidence was admissible under OEC 404(3). It states that, \u201c[b]efore <em>Williams, </em>this court long assumed that evidence of a defendant\u2019s other acts was \u2018relevant\u2019 for purposes of OEC 404(4) only if it was also admissible under OEC 404(3).\u201d But, the state argues, <em>Williams </em>held that OEC 404(4) supersedes OEC 404(3), 357 Or at 15, and, therefore, under OEC 404(4) other acts evidence is \u201cgenerally admissible for any purpose, so long as it is logically relevant, * * * subject only to the Due Process Clause.\u201d The state does not on appeal specifically assert, or engage in any analysis related to, the established nonpropensity theories of relevance associated with OEC 404(3) that it advanced before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The Supreme Court recently clarified <em>Williams </em>in <em>Baughman, </em>which was issued after both briefing and argument were complete in this case. In <em>Baughman, </em>the court set out the analytical framework that applies to the admission of other acts evidence, and clarified the interplay of OEC 404(3), OEC 404(4), and OEC 403. To begin with, the court explained that its statement in <em>Williams </em>that OEC 404(4) supersedes OEC 404(3) meant only that OEC 404(4) supersedes the first sentence of OEC 404(3), which provides that \u2018\u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is <em>inadmissible </em>to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.\u2019\u201d <em>Baughman, </em>361 Or at 404 (quoting OEC 404(3) (brackets and emphasis in <em>Baughman)). </em>OEC 404(4) does not supersede the remaining sentence in OEC 404(3), \u201cwhich provides that other acts evidence \u2018may be admissible for other purposes,\u201d\u2019 and lists examples of such purposes. <em>Id. </em>The court noted that, when other acts evidence is not offered for a propensity purpose, \u201cbut instead is offered for a nonpropensity purpose, then analysis under OEC 404(4) is unnecessary; the evidence \u2018may be admissible\u2019 under the second sentence of OEC 404(3).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, <em>Baughman </em>instructs that, when presented with an objection to other acts evidence, a court should first analyze any proffered nonpropensity purposes under OEC 404(3). <em>Id. </em>Then, only if necessary, should it proceed to analyze any OEC 404(4) theories.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 404-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>We begin, therefore, by considering the OEC 404(3) nonpropensity purposes and theories of relevance that the state advanced below, on which the trial court admitted the evidence. When \u201cexamining evidence to be admitted under the categories or exceptions to OEC 404(3), a trial judge first must determine whether the prior act is relevant to the issues being tried.\u201d <em>State v. Pitt, </em>352 Or 566, 576, 293 P3d 1002 (2012). As the Supreme Court has explained, in applying OEC 404(3) principles of relevance, \u201c\u2018[t]he admissibility of evidence of other crimes must not be based upon the relationship of the evidence to one of the listed categories, rather it must be based on its relevancy to a fact at issue in the trial * * * other than proving a propensity to commit certain acts.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Johns, </em>301 Or 535, 549, 725 P2d 312 (1986) (alterations in <em>Pitt)). </em>The proponent of the evidence \u201chas the burden of showing that the proffered evidence is relevant and probative of some noncharacter purpose.\u201d <em>Pitt, </em>352 Or at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">OEC 404(3) permits evidence of other acts that bear on a person\u2019s character, if the evidence is offered for a non-character purpose. <em>Pitt, </em>352 Or at 576. In analyzing whether defendant\u2019s prior convictions were relevant to a nonpropen-sity purpose, we must consider what that evidence was, and how it might be relevant to a fact at issue. We begin by considering the precise evidence that the trial court admitted: certified copies of the judgments of conviction for one prior second-degree robbery and two prior third-degree robberies. The state did not present any evidence of the circumstances of those prior offenses, the factual bases, or even the theories on which defendant had been charged or convicted in the prior cases. <em>See </em>ORS 164.395 (a person commits third-degree robbery if in the course of committing or attempting to commit theft or unauthorized use of a vehicle, the person uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force with the intent of preventing or overcoming resistance, or compelling a person to deliver property or otherwise engage in conduct that might aid in the theft or unauthorized use of a vehicle); ORS 164.405 (a person commits second-degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>robbery when the person violates ORS 164.395 and represents by word or conduct that the person is armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon, or when the person is aided by another person actually present).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The state argued that the convictions were probative of facts that were of consequence in the case\u2014whether defendant intended to commit theft, and whether he intended to threaten the use of force. We respectfully disagree that the state\u2019s theory does not rely on a character and propensity inference. The relevance that the prior convictions, by themselves, would have, if any, depends upon a character inference of the kind that OEC 404(3) prohibits. <em>See </em>OEC 404(3) (\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.\u201d). That is, the relevance theory, for evidence of the convictions alone, is based on reasoning that, because defendant has previously been convicted of robberies, he has a propensity for committing robberies, which makes it more likely that he intended to commit another robbery at the time of the charged acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In order to establish that defendant\u2019s prior conduct was relevant for one of the OEC 404(3) purposes the state identified below\u2014to provide evidence of intent, absence of mistake or accident, plan, or motive\u2014the state would have had to present more evidence about the prior conduct. Specifically, to establish that the prior conduct was relevant to show, using the doctrine of chances, that defendant acted intentionally and not by accident or mistake, the state would have had to establish that the prior conduct and the charged conduct were similar, as required by <em>Johns. State v. Turnidge (S059155), </em>359 Or 364, 435, 374 P3d 853 (2016), <em>cert den, </em>_US_, 137 S Ct 665 (2017) (Turnidge) (explaining that evidence offered to prove intent on a doctrine-of-chances theory must satisfy the multi-factor <em>Johns </em>test); <em>see also State v. Tena, </em>281 Or App 57, 65 n 4, 384 P3d 521 (2016), <em>rev allowed, </em>360 Or 752 (2017) (noting that the doctrine of chances supports the admission of other acts evidence only when the other acts and charged acts are similar and claimed to have been the result of an accident or mistake). Likewise, to establish that the prior conduct was relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>to show that defendant acted pursuant to a plan, the state would have had to show that there was a high degree of similarity between defendant\u2019s prior conduct and the charged conduct. <em>Turnidge, </em>359 Or at 438-40 (discussing \u201cspurious plan\u201d evidence, that is, \u201cevidence of a series of prior similar acts offered to establish a plan or design to commit those acts\u201d). And, to establish that the prior conduct was relevant to show defendant\u2019s motive to commit the charged act, the state would have had to show a \u201csubstantial connecting link between the two acts,\u201d which, here, would require more than simply showing that defendant had been convicted of robbery in the past. <em>Id. </em>at 451 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>State v. Wright, </em>283 Or App 160, 171-72, 387 P3d 405 (2016) (\u201c\u2018[T]he required connection can be inferred when,\u201d\u2019 considering \u201c\u2018the nature of the evidence at issue, evaluated in light of the circumstances of the\u2019\u201d charged conduct, the inference is a logical one. (Quoting <em>Turnidge, </em>359 Or at 450.)). In sum, the state failed to establish the admissibility of the evidence\u2014the judgments of conviction\u2014on any of the OEC 404(3) theories of relevance for a nonpropensity purpose that the state advanced below.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">We turn next, then, to OEC 404(4). <em>Baughman, </em>361 Or at 404-05. To the extent that the state\u2019s argument on appeal advances a new theory of admissibility that it did not advance below\u2014that the evidence is relevant and admissible <em>as propensity evidence </em>of defendant\u2019s intent\u2014it has not argued that that alternative theory meets the requirements for us to consider it as an alternative basis for affirmance. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001) (explaining that the \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d principle allows\u2014as a matter of discretion\u2014a reviewing court to affirm a lower court\u2019s ruling on an alternative basis, and stating requirements); <em>State v. Goff, </em>258 Or App 757, 763, 311 P3d 916 (2013) (treating alternative theories of admissibility as proposed alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>bases for affirmance). In the absence of any developed argument on that issue, we decline to consider the alternative theory for the first time on appeal. <em>See State v. Kolb, </em>251 Or App 303, 312, 283 P3d 423 (2012) (\u201cEven assuming that the development of the factual record before the trial court would not have been materially affected if that contention had been raised initially, * * * the fact remains that to address that contention meaningfully would require us, in the first instance\u2014without legal record development or any real assistance from the parties\u2014to decide difficult, nuanced, and systemically significant issues. We respectfully decline to do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Finally, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of defendant\u2019s prior robbery convictions was not harmless. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003) (\u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error consists of a single inquiry: Is there little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict?\u201d). If erroneously admitted evidence relates to a central issue in the case, it is more likely that that error substantially affected the verdict. <em>State v. Richards, </em>263 Or App 280, 283, 328 P3d 710 (2014). Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s error had little likelihood of affecting the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Because the trial court erred by admitting the prior robbery convictions, and because that error was not harmless, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\"> Because we agree with defendant\u2019s relevance argument, we do not reach his other arguments regarding the admissibility of the evidence and the necessity of limiting instructions regarding the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\"> OEC 404(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.

In <em>Baughman, </em>the court noted that it \u201chas suggested, but not yet decided, that the federal constitution may, as a matter of law, prohibit the admission of other acts evidence to prove propensity in a criminal case\u201d involving \u201ccrimes other than child sexual abuse.\u201d 361 Or at 403 n 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A4b\"> The only information in the record concerning the facts of the prior robberies is in the state\u2019s memorandum in support of its motion <em>in limine. </em>In the section setting out its theory of relevance to proving \u201cintent,\u201d the state said that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3k\">\u201cplans to use the defendant\u2019s prior burglary <em>[sic] </em>convictions to show not only the similarity of the charges, but also the similarity of the underlying facts. The events leading to defendant\u2019s prior convictions, almost without exception, involve defendant entering offices without authorization under false pretenses or stealing televisions from hotel employee break rooms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgF\">At the time the trial court ruled, it was clear that the state did not intend to offer evidence of the underlying facts of the robberies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b707-5\"> The court also concluded that, when evidence is relevant for either OEC 404(3) or OEC 404(4) purposes, OEC 403 balancing applies. <em>Baughman, </em>361 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>at 404-05. The court did not decide, however, \u201cwhether, in addition to objecting to the admission of such evidence, a party also must explicitly seek balancing under OEC 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404 n 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b710-5\"> The state asserts in a footnote that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s theory appeared to be based on defendant\u2019s knowledge.\u201d The prosecutor argued to the jury that the prior convictions showed that \u201cdefendant knew \u2018what robbery is.\u2019\u201d That theory of relevance was not presented to the trial court before it ruled. For similar reasons as those we further discuss below, we decline to consider that theory as an alternative ground for affirmance. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v.
