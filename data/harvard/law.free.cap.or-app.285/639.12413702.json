The issue presented in this appeal is whether tenant engaged in conduct that could be considered \u201coutrageous in the extreme\u201d so as to permit landlord to terminate the tenancy on an expedited basis under ORS 90.396(1)(f). For the reasons that follow, we agree with tenant that his conduct did not qualify as \u201coutrageous in the extreme,\u201d within the meaning of ORS 90.396(1)(f). Accordingly, we reverse the restitution judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The facts pertinent to this appeal are undisputed. Tenant and his wife own a manufactured home for which they rented a space in landlord\u2019s manufactured home park. While living at the park, tenant had experienced psychotic episodes but had not sought professional help. During one such episode, tenant heard voices that told him to prepare and distribute a notice that was the basis for the eviction. The notice, which was drafted to appear that it had been issued by landlord to all of the tenants, announced a new monthly rental rate that was approximately $100 less than the current rate, announced that rent for the preceding two months would be prorated to reflect the new rate, and announced that tenant \u201cwill be managing this mobile home park,\u201d with his lot number identified as \u201cthe manager\u2019s office.\u201d After distributing the notice to several residents, tenant\u2019s auditory hallucinations abated, and he did not deliver the rest of the notices. However, he did not retrieve or correct the notices that he had already distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The following day, landlord delivered a notice to all of the park\u2019s tenants emphasizing that tenant had no authority to issue the notice that he had distributed, that tenant was not the park manager, and that the monthly rent remained at the rate set by landlord\u2014with the dollar amount specified. Landlord also served tenant with a notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>that his tenancy was being terminated under a law that allows termination on as little as 24 hours\u2019 notice when the tenant engages in an \u201cact that is outrageous in the extreme.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 90.396(1)(f). The notice identified tenant\u2019s conduct of creating and distributing the false notice as the \u201cact that is outrageous in the extreme\u201d and gave tenant a week to vacate the premises. Landlord then filed a complaint for eviction, which tenant opposed. The trial court concluded that tenant\u2019s conduct justified termination under the expedited-termination statute because it was \u201coutrageous in the extreme for a landlord,\u201d and the court granted a judgment awarding landlord restitution of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">On appeal, the dispute turns on whether tenant\u2019s conduct falls within the intended scope of ORS 90.396(1)(f). That statute authorizes a landlord to terminate a tenant\u2019s rental agreement and take possession \u201cafter at least 24 hours\u2019 written notice\u201d when, among other circumstances, \u201c[t]he tenant, someone in the tenant\u2019s control or the tenant\u2019s pet commits any act that is outrageous in the extreme on the premises or in the immediate vicinity of the premises.\u201d ORS 90.396(1)(f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Termination under ORS 90.396(1) is authorized on an expedited basis compared to other statutory authority to terminate a tenancy, which generally requires \u201cnot less than 30 days\u201d advance notice before the termination is effective. <em>See </em>ORS 90.392(3)(b) (general termination of a tenancy \u201cfor cause\u201d); ORS 90.630(1) (termination of rental agreement for space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home for specified reasons).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">As with all matters of statutory construction, our \u201cparamount goal\u201d is to determine the legislature\u2019s intent, and to accomplish that goal we give \u201cprimary weight\u201d to the statute\u2019s text and context. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Here, the text of ORS 90.396(1)(f) provides significant guidance regarding the meaning of the term \u201coutrageous in the extreme.\u201d At the outset, the statute specifies, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\u201cFor purposes of this paragraph, an act is outrageous in the extreme if the act is not described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection, but is similar in degree and is one that a reasonable person in that community would consider to be so offensive as to warrant termination of the tenancy within 24 hours, considering the seriousness of the act or the risk to others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Several aspects of that sentence are significant. First whether the act is \u201coutrageous in the extreme\u201d is judged from the perspective of \u201ca reasonable person,\u201d a phrase that is consistently used to describe an objective test. <em>See, e.g., State v. Shapiro, </em>270 Or App 701, 706, 349 P3d 608 (2015) (describing standard for determining whether a building meets the definition of \u201cnot open to the public\u201d for purposes of crime of burglary); <em>McDowell v. Employment Dept., </em>348 Or 605, 612, 236 P3d 722 (2010) (describing test under administrative rule defining when an employee has left work for \u201cgood cause\u201d); <em>Padrick v. Lyons, </em>277 Or App 455, 466, 372 P3d 528, <em>rev den, </em>360 Or 26 (2016) (describing test for discovery of a civil cause of action). Moreover, the text makes clear that the focus of the objective test is on \u201ca reasonable person in that community,\u201d not just what landlords as a subgroup might consider sufficient to warrant termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The quoted sentence also reveals that, as the term suggests, the legislature intended to set a high bar for conduct that is \u201coutrageous in the extreme.\u201d It is conduct that \u201cso offensive\u201d that \u201ca reasonable person in that community would consider\u201d that it warrants \u201ctermination of the tenancy within 24 hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">As guidance for applying that somewhat imprecise standard, the legislature has specified that the act must be \u201csimilar in degree\u201d to the acts\u2014listed in paragraphs (a) to (e) of the statute\u2014that also justify termination in as few as 24 hours. Those paragraphs describe conduct in which someone<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cseriously threatens to inflict substantial personal injury\u201d or actually inflicts a \u201csubstantial personal injury,\u201d ORS 90.396(l)(a), (c); \u201crecklessly\u201d creates \u201ca seri-ousrisk of substantial personal injury,\u201d ORS 90.396(1)(b); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201cintentionally inflicts any substantial damage to the premises,\u201d ORS 90.396(1)(d); or supplies \u201csubstantial false information\u201d on the tenancy application regarding a criminal conviction that \u201cwould have been material to the landlord\u2019s acceptance of the application,\u201d ORS 90.396(1)(e). In other words, conduct that is \u201coutrageous in the extreme\u201d means conduct that is \u201csimilar in degree\u201d to putting other persons at risk of \u201csubstantial personal injury,\u201d actually inflicting (not just creating a risk of) \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to the landlord\u2019s premises, or making material fraudulent statements on the rental application (but only if the fraud relates to criminal convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Landlord urges us to conclude that tenant\u2019s conduct was \u201csimilar in degree\u201d to the other acts that permit termination on 24 hours\u2019 notice because it \u201cinterfered with Landlord\u2019s economic relations.\u201d But there is no evidence that the notice caused any economic harm to landlord. Thus, even if an act causing economic harm to the landlord could be \u201csimilar in degree\u201d to an act that inflicts \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to the landlord\u2019s premises, the mere risk of economic harm is not \u201csimilar in degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">As additional guidance for identifying conduct that is \u201coutrageous in the extreme,\u201d ORS 90.396(1)(f) offers a list of examples of acts that the legislature considered to be \u201coutrageous in the extreme\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\u201cActs that are \u2018outrageous in the extreme\u2019 include, but are not limited to, the following acts by a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\u201c(A) Prostitution, commercial sexual solicitation or promoting prostitution, as described in ORS 167.007, 167.008 and 167.012;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">\u201c(B) Manufacture, delivery or possession of a controlled substance, as described in ORS 475.005, but not including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">\u201c(i) The medical use of marijuana in compliance with ORS 475B.400 to 475B.525; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">\u201c(ii) Possession of prescription drugs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">\u201c(C) Intimidation, as described in ORS 166.155 and 166.165 [based on race, color, religion, sexual orientation, disability or national origin]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201c(D) Burglary as described in ORS 164.215 and 164.225.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Those listed examples are important context for what the legislature intended by the phrase \u201coutrageous in the extreme.\u201d <em>See Schmidt v. Mt. Angel Abbey, </em>347 Or 389, 403-04, 223 P3d 399 (2009) (when the legislature specifies that a particular concept \u201cincludes,\u201d or uses the phrase, \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d a list of specific examples, \u201cour interpretation of the general term includes consideration of those specific examples\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Landlord emphasizes that the legislature specified a \u201cnonexclusive list\u201d of criminal acts that are \u201coutrageous in the extreme.\u201d Landlord argues that tenant\u2019s conduct belongs on the list because he \u201cacted with intent to defraud landlord and other Park tenants\u201d when he created the false notice, which makes his conduct comparable to the crime of forgery, ORS 165.007, or criminal simulation, ORS 165.037, both of which involve creating something that is fake with an intent to defraud or injure. Tenant contends that the crimes that the legislature specifically identified as \u201coutrageous in the extreme\u201d share the common characteristic of \u201cdegrad [ing] the quality of the community\u201d and that crimes like forgery or criminal simulation do not share that characteristic and should not qualify as \u201coutrageous in the extreme.\u201d We need not resolve which other crimes would qualify as \u201coutrageous in the extreme,\u201d however, because tenant\u2019s conduct was not comparable to a crime. The trial court found that tenant intended to create and deliver the notice but that the <em>\u201cmens rea </em>to a crime certainly wasn\u2019t\u201d proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Finally, ORS 90.396(1)(f) specifies that \u201c[a]n act that is outrageous in the extreme is more extreme or serious than an act that warrants a 30-day termination under ORS 90.392.\u201d The acts that permit termination with 30 days\u2019 notice range in severity from a \u201cmaterial violation\u201d of the tenant\u2019s statutory obligation to keep the premises clean to \u201cdisturb [ing] the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors,\u201d failing to pay rent, or \u201cdeliberately or negligently\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>damaging the premises. ORS 90.325; ORS 90.392. Acts comparable to those are not \u201coutrageous in the extreme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\">Considered in the light of the substantial guidance that the legislature has provided regarding the meaning of the phrase \u201coutrageous in the extreme,\u201d we conclude that tenant\u2019s act of distributing a false notice does not rise to the level of outrageousness for which the legislature intended to permit expedited termination under ORS 90.396. Tenant\u2019s conduct was not \u201csimilar in degree\u201d to putting other persons at risk of \u201csubstantial personal injury\u201d or to actually inflicting \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to property. It did not rise to the level of criminal conduct and did not involve a misrepresentation of something as significant as a criminal history that would have affected the landlord\u2019s decision to rent the property. Rather, it is more comparable to acts like failing to pay rent, \u201cdisturb [ing] the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors,\u201d or even deliberately damaging the landlord\u2019s premises (in a way that is not \u201csubstantial\u201d). Like those acts, tenant\u2019s acts may permit termination after 30 days\u2019 notice. But tenant\u2019s conduct was not so outrageous as to qualify under ORS 90.396 for termination on an expedited time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\"> Tenant also assigns error to the court\u2019s conclusion that service of the eviction notice on tenant was adequate to terminate the tenancy interest of tenant\u2019s wife. We do not address that assignment of error, given our conclusion that tenant\u2019s conduct was not an appropriate basis for the termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\"> The parties refer to notice under this provision as a \u201c24 Hour Termination notice\u201d or a \u201c24 hours\u2019 notice of termination,\u201d but the statute specifies 24 hours as the minimum notice period, and the notice to tenant in this case provided for more than 24 hours before the termination was effective. For precision, we will refer to termination under ORS 90.396(1) as termination on an \u201cexpedited basis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\"> All of the paragraphs apply to \u201c[t]he tenant or someone in the tenant\u2019s control.\u201d Some also apply to \u201cthe tenant\u2019s pet.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\"> The quoted language in ORS 90.396(1)(f)(A) and (B) has been amended slightly since the time of Tenant\u2019s eviction, but the change has no bearing on our analysis. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2016, ch 24, \u00a7 54; Or Laws 2015, ch 98, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
