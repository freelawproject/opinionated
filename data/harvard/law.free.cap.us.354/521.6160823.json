Under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1915 he applied to the District Court for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Petitioner, who was assisted by court-appointed counsel in preparing his application, contended that the evidence was insufficient to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>his conviction and that the trial court had committed reversible error by permitting the United States Attorney to ask him irrelevant and prejudicial questions about another criminal offense. Petitioner requested that the District Court make available a transcript of the trial record so he could substantiate his claimed errors. In reply the United States Attorney filed an affidavit asserting that the evidence was sufficient to sustain petitioner\u2019s conviction. However the affidavit did not directly controvert petitioner\u2019s claim that the prosecuting attorney had been allowed to inject irrelevant and prejudicial matter into the trial. Counsel for petitioner then filed an affidavit in answer supporting petitioner\u2019s allegation of errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The District Court refused the request for a transcript of the trial record and denied the application for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>on the ground that the appeal was \u201cnot taken in good faith\u201d because it was \u201cfrivolous and without merit\u201d and \u201c[t]he evidence amply supported the verdict.\u201d Petitioner then asked the Court of Appeals for permission to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>but that court denied his request indicating that his claimed errors were without substance. 242 F. 2d 338. And see 238 F. 2d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">As things now stand conflicting affidavits have been introduced concerning petitioner\u2019s contention of errors at the trial. If the allegations made by petitioner and his counsel are correct then it seems quite clear to us that his appeal cannot be characterized as frivolous. Before his allegation of errors can be accurately evaluated, however, to ascertain if they do have any merit he should be furnished with a transcript of the trial record \u2014 unless counsel can agree on a statement of the relevant facts or some other means are devised to make the minutes of the trial available to petitioner \u2014 so that he has an opportunity to substantiate his allegations and point out their significance and so that they can be appraised on a dependable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>record. Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>352 U. S. 565. In our judgment petitioner has not yet been afforded an adequate opportunity to show the Court of Appeals that his claimed errors are not frivolous so as to enable that court to review properly the District Court\u2019s certification that the appeal was in bad faith. Accordingly the judgment below must be vacated and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-5\">Mr. Justice Clark and Mr. Justice Harlan dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
