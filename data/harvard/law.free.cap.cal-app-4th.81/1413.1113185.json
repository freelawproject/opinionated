The insurer cross-claimed against the broker for indemnity. The insured and the broker settled. The trial court found that the settlement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>made in good faith and dismissed the insurer\u2019s cross-claims against the broker. The insurer sought relief by way of a petition for writ of mandate, which was summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">After the entry of final judgment, the insurer filed this appeal, challenging the good faith settlement determination and the dismissal of its cross-claims. The broker has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that a determination of good faith can be reviewed only by writ of mandate, not postjudgment appeal. We conclude that, in conjunction with its appeal as to the dismissed cross-claims, the insurer can challenge the determination of good faith. Accordingly, we deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">Edward Dempsey owns two companies engaged in concrete coring and cutting. In 1990, he approached William von Henkle, an insurance broker, to obtain a policy for his businesses. At the time, von Henkle worked for Granger-Hanna Insurance Associates, a brokerage. Von Henkle obtained a policy for Dempsey from Highlands Insurance Company, effective until April 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">In early 1991, von Henkle left Granger-Hanna and went to work for Andreini &amp; Company of Southern California. He took Dempsey\u2019s account with him. Shortly thereafter, Highlands Insurance Company notified Dempsey that it would not renew his policy. On Dempsey\u2019s behalf, von Henkle completed an insurance application, commonly called an \u201cACORD,\u201d and sent it to several insurers. After receiving the ACORD, Maryland Casualty Company agreed to provide coverage subject to its receipt of additional information, including a \u201closs control\u201d survey (i.e., a history of prior insurance claims). Maryland Casualty proceeded to bind coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-9\">Less than a month later\u2014and before Maryland Casualty had obtained the additional information\u2014a fire destroyed the business premises. Dempsey\u2019s son, Mike, accepted blame for the fire, stating that he had accidentally started the blaze while trying to refuel his speedboat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">Dempsey submitted a claim under the insurance policy for approximately $1.7 million, which later rose to $4.2 million. Maryland Casualty investigated the loss and discovered that Dempsey\u2019s ACORD contained false statements. For example, the application indicated that (1) Dempsey\u2019s business operations did not involve exposure to flammable material, and (2) Dempsey had never had an insurance policy cancelled or not renewed. By letter dated May 24, 1991, Maryland Casualty informed Dempsey that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>rescinding the policy, based on the \u201cdiscovery of fraud or material misrepresentations by . . . [\u00b6] . . . the insured or his or her representative in obtaining the insurance. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">On July 25, 1991, Dempsey filed this action against Maryland Casualty and Andreini &amp; Company, alleging several causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For its part, Andreini &amp; Company filed a cross-complaint against Maryland Casualty based on a theory of contractual indemnity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maryland Casualty, in turn, cross-complained against Dempsey, Andreini &amp; Company, and von Henkle, alleging claims for rescission, breach of contract, fraud, indemnification, and conspiracy, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">In November 1993, Dempsey and Andreini reached a settlement. The terms were simple; Andreini\u2019s insurer would pay Dempsey $650,000. The deal was contingent upon the trial court\u2019s determination that the settlement was made in \u201cgood faith\u201d for purposes of section 877.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure (hereafter section 877.6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">Within days of the tentative settlement, Andreini filed a motion under section 877.6, seeking a determination of good faith and the dismissal of Maryland Casualty\u2019s cross-claims. Maryland Casualty filed opposition. The trial court, Judge Ernest George Williams presiding, denied the motion without prejudice and directed that the motion be renoticed for hearing on December 2, 1993. Before the second hearing, the parties filed additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>papers. On December 2, Judge Williams again denied the motion without prejudice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">On January 3, 1994, Andreini filed a third motion seeking a determination of good faith. The motion was supported by a supplemental declaration from Andreini\u2019s attorney. In addition, Andreini submitted evidence to the effect that, in binding coverage for Dempsey, Maryland Casualty had violated its own internal guidelines and the standards in the insurance industry by failing to conduct a timely loss control survey. Maryland Casualty filed opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">On January 24, 1994, Judge Williams granted the motion, stating that the declarations in support of the two prior motions \u201cdidn\u2019t contain competent evidence that there was a sufficient settlement. That has been taken care of by these [new] declarations.\u201d The trial court\u2019s signed order, filed on January 28, 1994, recited that the settlement was made in good faith and that Maryland Casualty\u2019s cross-claims against Andreini were barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">On January 31, 1994, Maryland Casualty filed with this court a petition for writ of mandate, asserting that the trial court had erred in barring its cross-claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 2, 1994, we summarily denied the petition <em>(Maryland Casualty Co. v. Superior Court </em>(Jan. 31, 1994, B081515) [nonpub. opn.]). On April 27, 1994, the California Supreme Court denied Maryland Casualty\u2019s petition for review (S037964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">Meanwhile, Dempsey\u2019s claims against Maryland Casualty went forward. In that regard, Andreini &amp; Company\u2019s cross-complaint against Maryland Casualty was severed and placed on hold, pending the outcome of the Dempsey-Maryland trial. Dempsey\u2019s claims were tried to a jury from September to October 1994, with Judge William A. Drake presiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">On October 31, 1994, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Dempsey, awarding him $3 million in compensatory damages and $58 million in punitive damages. Maryland Casualty brought a motion for new trial, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>Judge Drake granted, finding that the evidence was insufficient to support liability and that the award of damages was excessive. Dempsey and Maryland Casualty filed notices of appeal. Before briefing the case, they decided to settle the matter for $8.6 million. The appeal was voluntarily dismissed. On July 31, 1996, Dempsey filed a dismissal in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">In April 1998, Andreini &amp; Company\u2019s cross-complaint against Maryland Casualty was tried to the court, Judge Macklin Fleming presiding. By its cross-complaint, Andreini &amp; Company sought to be indemnified for the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses it had incurred in defending the claims brought by Dempsey and Maryland Casualty. Judge Fleming found in favor of Maryland Casualty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">On May 21, 1998, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Maryland Casualty on Andreini &amp; Company\u2019s cross-complaint. Notice of entry of judgment was served on May 26, 1998. On July 15, 1998, Maryland Casualty filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">Maryland Casualty argues that it can seek review of the trial court\u2019s good faith settlement determination by way of appeal after judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Maryland Casualty also contends that its appeal was timely filed and that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the settlement was made in good faith.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">A. <em>Review of Good Faith Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">\u201c \u2018The fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>of the law. . . .\u2019 . . .In determining that intent, we first examine the words of the statute itself. . . . Under the so-called \u2018plain meaning\u2019 rule, courts seek to give the words employed by the Legislature their usual and ordinary meaning. ... If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction. . . . However, the \u2018plain meaning\u2019 rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose. ... If the terms of the statute provide no definitive answer, then courts may resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history. . . . \u2018 \u201cWe must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u201d The legislative purpose will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the statute.\u201d <em>(Bodell Construction Co. v. Trustees of Cal. State University </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1508, 1515-1516 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 450], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">Andreini has moved to dismiss Maryland Casualty\u2019s appeal on the ground that a pasfjudgment challenge to a good faith settlement determination is barred by section 877.6, subdivision (e) (hereafter section 877.6(e)). That statute provides: \u201cWhen a determination of the good faith or lack of good faith of a settlement is made, any party aggrieved by the determination <em>may </em>petition the proper court to review the determination by writ of mandate. The petition for writ of mandate <em>shall </em>be filed within 20 days after service of written notice of the determination, or within any additional time not exceeding 20 days as the trial court may allow.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">The use of the words <em>\u201cmay </em>petition,\u201d together with <em>\u201cshall </em>be filed,\u201d suggests that a writ petition might not be the exclusive means of reviewing a good faith settlement determination.  \u201c[T]he word \u2018may\u2019 is ordinarily construed as permissive, whereas \u2018shall\u2019 is ordinarily construed as mandatory, particularly when both terms are used in the same statute.\u201d <em>(Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 443 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, <em>777 </em>P.2d 610].)  While section 877.6(e) seemingly does not foreclose review on a postjudgment appeal, it does make plain that <em>if </em>a party decides to seek prejudgment relief, the writ petition must comply with the statute\u2019s 20-day time limitation. In any event, given that section 877.6(e) does not bar postjudgment review on its face, we turn to the statute\u2019s legislative history.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">Section 877.6(e) began its legislative journey as a proposal by the Sacramento County Bar Association. From there, it was endorsed by the State Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>Conference of Delegates in Resolution No. 9-18-81. (State Bar Conf. of Delegates, Res. No. 9-18-81, from the legis. bill file of Assemblyman Larry Stirling, sponsor of Assem. Bill No. 3712 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 9-18a-81.) The resolution recommended that the Legislature amend section 877.6 to provide: \u201cAn order by the court determining that a settlement was or was not made in good faith <em>shall not be appealable. </em>When such a determination is made, the party aggrieved by such order may, within the time hereinafter provided, petition the proper reviewing court to review such determination by writ of mandate. Such petition for writ of mandate may be filed within 20 days after service of written notice of the order, or within such additional time not exceeding 20 days as the trial court may allow.\u201d (State Bar Conf. of Delegates, Res. No. 9-18-81, <em>supra, </em>at p. 9-18b-81, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">The delegates\u2019 resolution stated that the new provision would amend the code so that \u201can order by the [trial] court determining that a settlement was or was not made in good faith is not appealable and that a party aggrieved by such an order may petition the reviewing court for a writ of mandate.\u201d (State Bar Conf. of Delegates, Res. No. 9-18-81, <em>supra, </em>at p. 9-18a-81.) Under the proposal, \u201cwrit review would remain discretionary with the reviewing court.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The resolution acknowledged that the Alameda County Bar Association opposed the proposed statute because \u201c[discretionary review of a party\u2019s dismissal from an action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 877.6 should not be the sole means of reviewing a trial court\u2019s order. . . . A party objecting to a settlement should have the absolute right of a review on the merits to protect his or her interests.\u201d (State Bar Conf. of Delegates, Res. No. 9-18-81, <em>supra, </em>at p. 9-18c-81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">On March 22, 1982, Assemblyman Larry Stirling introduced Assembly Bill No. 3712 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.), which was modeled on the State Bar Conference of Delegates\u2019 resolution. As the bill\u2019s sponsor, Stirling explained in a written statement: \u201c[T]his bill seeks a more expedient resolution of a trial court determination that a settlement between a plaintiff and one or more alleged tortfeasors was or was not made in good faith. This proposal indicates that the <em>preferred </em>mode of review is a writ of mandamus rather than an appeal subsequent to final judgment in the case. Under present law, a settling plaintiff or settling defendant or cross defendant who [is] denied approval of the settlement must undergo further discovery in trial as against the settling tortfeasor, thus denying those parties the goals to be achieved by settlement. Likewise, if a settlement is approved but ultimately held after the judgment to have been in bad faith, the case will have to be retried to include the alleged tortfeasors who were improperly removed from the case. AB 3712 seeks an immediate resolution to this issue to the benefit of all parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>involved.\u201d (Assemblyman Larry Stirling, Statement to Assem. Com. on Judiciary, May 5, 1992, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">As worded in Assembly Bill No. 3712, section 877.6(e) read much the same way it reads today. However, the bill departed from the conference of delegates\u2019 resolution in one important respect: It never included a provision barring postjudgment review of good faith settlement determinations. Indeed, during the legislative process, the resolution was edited in that regard: Handwritten parentheses were placed around the proposed nonappealability provision, as were the handwritten notations, \u201cstrike according to author\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t want to preclude.\u201d (State Bar Conf. of Delegates, Res. No. 9-18-81, <em>supra, </em>at p. 9-18b-81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">The analysis of Assembly Bill No. 3712 in the Senate Judiciary Committee stated: \u201cThe State Bar asserts that since many settlements are made immediately before trial, it is imperative that the review of the court\u2019s determination occur expeditiously and before trial. The writ of mandate procedures are well suited and appear <em>preferable </em>to a direct appeal of the order which could result in an unacceptable risk of long trial delay and the incurrence of avoidable expenses should the court\u2019s determination not be upheld. [\u00b6] The proponent also asserts that the current remedy, appellate review following judgment, thwarts the policy of the law to encourage settlements.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3712 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 3.) Of significance, the analysis continued: \u201cNo impact on ability to appeal [\u00b6] A non-settling defendant is presently free to appeal a determination which dismissed a co-defendant pursuant to a settlement after judgment is entered, and this bill would not affect that right of appeal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 4, underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">Before Assembly Bill No. 3712 was passed by the Legislature, it was amended to include a provision giving the presiding judge of the superior court the authority to disapprove personnel assignments made by the clerk. (Conf. Com., Analyis of Assem. Bill No. 3712 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 10, 1982, \u00a7 6.) On September 10, 1982, the bill was sent to Governor Brown. He vetoed it, stating that the issue of assignments for superior court clerks \u201cmerits further legislative review.\u201d (Governor\u2019s veto message to Assem. on Assem. Bill No. 3712 (Sept. 30, 1982) 10 Assem. J. (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 18794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">During the 1983-1984 regular session of the Legislature, Assemblyman Stirling introduced Assembly Bill No. 232, which picked up where Assembly Bill No. 3712 left off, but without the provision concerning the assignment of superior court clerks. (See Assem. Bill No. 232 (1983-1984 Reg. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>Sess.) as introduced Jan. 10, 1983.) Nor was there a provision making a good faith settlement determination nonappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">This time around, the legislative history reflected the legislators\u2019 concern that, without the passage of the bill, the appellate courts could not review a determination of good faith before judgment. For instance, the analysis prepared for the Assembly Judiciary Committee stated that \u201c[t]here is no existing express provision for appellate review of a good faith determination prior to judgment.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 232 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) p. 1.) The analysis prepared for the Senate Judiciary Committee noted that \u201c[ejxisting law does not expressly provide for pretrial appellate review of a court\u2019s determination of the good faith of a settlement. . . .\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 232 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) pp. 1-2.) In that vein, the California Judges Association opposed the legislation because \u201cunder current law an aggrieved party may file a writ upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 3.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">The proposed statute was also based on the legislators\u2019 belief that \u201c[tjhe writ of mandate procedures are . . . <em>preferable </em>to a direct appeal of the order which could result in an unacceptable risk of long trial delay. It is also <em>preferable </em>to an appeal following judgment . . . . . [T]he current remedy, appellate review following judgment, thwarts the policy of the law to encourage settlements.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 232 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) p. 3, italics added.) The legislators understood, however, that writ review under the new statute \u201cwould be in the discretion of the reviewing court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 4; see Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 232 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">On June 25, 1984, the Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 232, which worded section 877.6(e) in substantially the same form as it now appears. (1 Assem. Final History on Assem. Bill No. 232 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) p. 222; compare Stats. 1984, ch. 311, \u00a7 1, p. 1552, with 17A West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (2000 supp.) foll. \u00a7 877.6, p. 107.) On July 6, 1984, Governor Deukmejian signed the bill. (1 Assem. Final History, <em>supra, </em>at p. 222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">Based on the foregoing legislative history and the language of section 877.6(e), we conclude that, while the Legislature viewed a writ petition <em>before </em>trial as a <em>preferable </em>means of reviewing good faith settlement determinations, section 877.6(e) does not foreclose postjudgment review. Although the State Bar Conference of Delegates recommended a nonappealability provision, the Legislature never entertained the idea. The author of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>the bill expressly opposed the nonappealability language, and the analysis of Assembly Bill No. 3712 in the Senate Judiciary Committee made clear that the statute would not preclude postjudgment review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Thus, with knowledge that postjudgment appeals were already allowed by law, the Legislature enacted a statute so that \u201cany party aggrieved by the [good faith] determination <em>may </em>petition the proper court. . . [for a] writ of mandate.\u201d (\u00a7 877.6(e), italics added.) We fail to see how such permissive language could shut the door on postjudgment appeals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">Significantly, two years after section 877.6(e) became effective, Division Seven of this court held that a good faith settlement determination could be challenged on appeal: \u201cThe ruling on the motions for determination of good faith settlement is reviewable on appeal from the judgment (order of dismissal) as an \u2018intermediate ruling, proceeding, order or decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from . . . .\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 906.) Without merit is respondent's] . . . argument that [cross-complainant] has no right to an appeal because she filed an earlier petition for writ of mandate challenging the ruling as to the good faith of the settlements, which writ was summarily denied.\u201d <em>(Greshko </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 827, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">More recently, Division Two of the Fourth Appellate District stated: \u201cA determination that a settlement has been made in good faith is a nonappealable interlocutory decree. [Citations.] \u2018Mandamus is the exclusive procedure for obtaining <em>immediate </em>review' of such an order. . . .[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . Any party wishing to challenge the merits of a \u2018good faith settlement\u2019 determination must do so via a petition for writ of mandate in the manner and within the time prescribed by section 877.6, subdivision (e). [Citations.] In particular, an aggrieved party may not <em>forgo writ review </em>and seek instead to have the determination reviewed <em>for the first time in an appeal </em>from the final judgment arising out of the trial of the plaintiff\u2019s claims against the nonsettling defendants.\u201d <em>(Main Fiber Products, Inc. v. Morgan &amp; Franz Ins. Agency </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1130, 1134, 1136-1137 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 108] fn. omitted, italics added <em>(Main Fiber).)</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">Our conclusion that a good faith settlement determination can be reviewed by prejudgment writ and postjudgment appeal does not offend any principle of appellate jurisprudence. Before judgment, a writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) is available to review a variety of trial court rulings, orders, and decisions. (See 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7\u00a7 99, 101, 105-112, pp. 889-891, 893-902; Cal. Civil Writ Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 1996) \u00a7\u00a7 4.45, 4.52-4.58, 4.60-4.69, pp. 122, 126-132, 132-142.) By the same token, on a postjudgment appeal, \u201cthe reviewing court may review . . . any <em>intermediate </em>ruling, . . . order or decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 906, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">To illustrate the point, we compare the separate statutory schemes governing the review of (1) a good faith settlement determination (\u00a7 877.6) and (2) an order on a motion for summary adjudication (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (f)). Like a good faith settlement ruling, an order on a summary adjudication motion is, by statute, subject to writ review. (Compare \u00a7 877.6(e) with Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (/).) In fact, both statutory schemes require that a writ petition be filed within 20 days after service of a written notice of the trial court\u2019s order. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, the reversal of a summary adjudication order on appeal, like the reversal of a determination of good faith, may lead to further proceedings in the trial court. And, like section 877.6(e), the summary adjudication statute is silent as to postjudgment review. Yet, our Supreme Court has recognized that summary adjudication orders can be challenged on a postjudgment appeal. <em>(Jennings v. Marralle </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 128 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074]; <em>Lackner v. LaCroix </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 747, 753 [159 Cal.Rptr. 693, 602 P.2d 393]; see also <em>Trani v. R. G. Hohman Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 314 [125 Cal.Rptr. 34].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">To take another example, \u201c[w]hile a denial of a dismissal motion [for lack of prosecution] is not <em>directly </em>appealable, it may be challenged either by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>petition for writ of mandate or in an appeal after a final judgment.\u201d <em>(Oskooi v. Fountain Valley Regional Hospital </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 233, 237 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 769], italics in original.) The same holds true for orders related to the amendment of pleadings, discovery, and the right to trial by jury. (See <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 128; 8 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7\u00a7 105-109, 156-157, at pp. 893-898, 953-957; Cal. Civil Writ Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4.54-4.57, 4.68-4.69, at pp. 127-131, 140-142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">In sum, Maryland Casualty promptly petitioned this court for a writ of mandate\u2014a discretionary remedy\u2014when the trial court ruled that the Dempsey-Andreini settlement was made in good faith. The petition was summarily denied. Maryland Casualty may now seek review of the good faith determination on appeal as a matter of right. It follows that Andreini\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">The trial court\u2019s January 28, 1994 order, finding that the settlement was made in good faith under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, and barring the cross-claims of Maryland Casualty Company against William von Henkle and Andreini &amp; Company of Southern California, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">Spencer, P.

That aspect of the litigation is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">Andreini &amp; Company and Maryland Casualty had entered into a written agency agreement that required Maryland Casualty to indemnify Andreini &amp; Company for liability or expenses incurred as a result of Maryland Casualty\u2019s errors or omissions in preparing and handling insurance policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">That statute provides: \u201cAny party to an action in which it is alleged that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a contract debt shall be entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors . . . . [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... A determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.\u201d (\u00a7 877.6, subds. (a)(1), (c).) Maryland Casualty does not contend that its status as an insurer renders section 877.6 inapplicable. (Cf. <em>Rohr Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>First State Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1480 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 872].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">In denying the motions, the trial court found that the supporting declarations did not satisfy the test set forth in <em>Tech-Bilt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodward-Clyde &amp; Associates </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488 [213 Cal.Rptr. 256, 698 P.2d 159]. There, the Supreme Court held that several factors should be considered in deciding whether a settlement was made in good faith, including \u201ca rough approximation of plaintiffs\u2019 total recovery and the settlor\u2019s proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 499.) \u201cOther relevant considerations include the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, as well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">For purposes of appeal, we grant Maryland Casualty\u2019s request that we take judicial notice of related appellate proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1221-13\">Dempsey is not a party to this appeal. For reasons unknown, he filed a respondent\u2019s brief. We do not consider it. On a related note, von Henkle, who <em>is </em>a party to the appeal, did <em>not </em>file a brief. In that respect, Maryland Casualty argues that von Henkle has \u201cdefaulted\u201d and that the trial court\u2019s decision as to him should therefore be reversed. We disagree. When a respondent fails to file a brief, we may simply accept the appellant\u2019s statement of facts as true. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 17(b).) We have done so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1221-14\">The question before us is not whether a determination of good faith is directly appealable . as an interlocutory decree. Rather, we decide whether Maryland Casualty can attack the determination of good faith on a postjudgment appeal from the order dismissing its cross-claims against Andreini. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 904.1, 906; <em>Greshko v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822, 827, fn. 1 [239 Cal.Rptr. 846].) Further, although judgment was entered <em>in favor </em>of Maryland Casualty on Andreini &amp; Company\u2019s cross-complaint, Maryland Casualty was sufficiently \u201caggrieved\u201d by the dismissal of its cross-claims to pursue this appeal. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 902; <em>Rohr Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>First State Ins. Co., supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1483-1484, 1486.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1221-15\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address the timeliness of the appeal and the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">We take judicial notice of material from the legislative history of section 877.6(e).

Nevertheless, <em>Main Fiber </em>did note that other courts had stated in dicta that the sole means of challenging a determination of good faith was by writ petition. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1135, citing <em>Housing Group </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 549, 552 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 460], and <em>Rohr Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>First State Ins.
