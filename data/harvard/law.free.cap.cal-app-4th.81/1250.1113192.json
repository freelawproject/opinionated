Shank, Debra C. Shank, Keller Industries, Inc. (Keller) and Kmart Corporation (Kmart)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and against plaintiffs, after the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for nonsuit. Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred by (1) granting defendants\u2019 motions in limine to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness testimony at trial, and (2) denying plaintiffs\u2019 request for a continuance to complete discovery. We find no error, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">On February 16, 1994, Martin True fell from a ladder at a property owned by the Shanks. The ladder was manufactured by Keller and sold by Kmart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">On February 6, 1995, plaintiffs filed suit against defendants for negligence, premises liability, products liability and loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">On November 25, 1998, plaintiffs designated Dr. Mark Greenspan and Paige Eskridge as experts retained to testify at trial. On December 2, 1998, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> section 2034, the Shanks noticed expert witness depositions for Dr. Greenspan and Eskridge. On December 14, four days before the scheduled depositions, plaintiffs served an opposition to the noticed depositions, objecting to the date and location of the depositions and requesting that mutually convenient dates for the depositions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>be arranged between counsel. Plaintiffs, however, did not state that the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 objection was defendants\u2019 failure to tender expert witness fees with the notice of depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">On December 17, the Shanks\u2019 counsel sent a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explaining that the depositions were properly noticed and that the objections were improper. The Shanks\u2019 counsel indicated that she would be unavailable from December 19, 1999 (one day after the date specified in the notice of deposition) through January 4, 1999 (last date for expert depositions). Hence, the Shanks\u2019 counsel provided plaintiffs with no available dates for the expert depositions, except for the originally scheduled date of December 18.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel also stated that the Shanks would seek to exclude expert testimony at trial if plaintiffs failed to produce the experts for deposition, as required under section 2034.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">Keller and Kmart\u2019s counsel also served a notice to take Eskridge\u2019s deposition on January 4, 1999. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel again served an opposition to Keller and Kmart\u2019s notice of deposition based on the same grounds as the previous opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">On December 29, 1998, Keller and Kmart\u2019s counsel responded to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, advising her that the objections lacked merit and that she failed to provide alternative dates for Eskridge\u2019s deposition. When plaintiffs\u2019 counsel failed to respond, Keller and Kmart\u2019s counsel sent another letter to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, noting her failure to provide alternative dates for the expert deposition. Two days later, on January 8, 1999, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel wrote to defendants\u2019 counsel indicating that she was \u201cworking on clearing dates\u201d for the depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">Pursuant to the Shanks\u2019 notice of deposition, the deposition of Keller and Kmart\u2019s designated expert, Dr. Mack Quan, took place on January 12, 1999. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not attend the deposition because of car problems en route to the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">On January 14, 1999, the Shanks filed a motion in limine to exclude testimony from plaintiffs\u2019 experts, Dr. Greenspan and Eskridge, and plaintiffs filed an ex parte application to continue the trial or in the alternative, for leave to complete expert witness depositions of Dr. Quan and plaintiffs\u2019 experts. One day later, Keller and Kmart also filed a motion in limine to exclude testimony from Eskridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>At the trial management conference on January 15, 1999, the trial court deferred ruling on defendants\u2019 motions in limine to give the parties an opportunity to depose plaintiffs\u2019 experts. The trial court also did not make any rulings \u201cwith regard to Dr. Quan.\u201d Thereafter, although defendants\u2019 counsel provided available dates for depositions, the experts were not deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">On January 19, 1999, the trial court continued the trial to January 25, 1999, because plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was ill. At this hearing, the trial court stated that its tentative ruling was to grant the motions in limine because the expert depositions \u201chave not gone forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">On January 25, 1999, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motions in limine to preclude plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses from testifying. The trial court, however, did not rule on plaintiffs\u2019 application to continue the trial date, or, in the alternative, for leave to complete expert witness depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Based on plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s statement that she would not put on a case-in-chief in light of the court\u2019s rulings on the motions in limine, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion for nonsuit. Thereafter, the court entered judgment against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">I. <em>Expert Witness Fees Could Be Tendered Either with the Notice of Expert Witness Deposition or at the Commencement of the Deposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">Plaintiffs raise an issue of first impression: Whether an expert witness deposition notice is improper unless it is accompanied by a tender of expert witness fees under section 2034. For reasons which follow, we conclude that under section 2034, expert witness fees could be tendered <em>either </em>with the deposition notice <em>or </em>at the commencement of the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-11\">\u201cThe proper interpretation of statutory language is a question of law which this court reviews de novo, independent of the trial court\u2019s ruling or reasoning. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Plunkett v. Spaulding </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 114, 126 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 377], overruled on other grounds in <em>Schreiber </em>v. <em>Estate of Kiser </em>(1999) 22 Cal.4th 31, 39-40 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 293, 989 P.2d 720].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>B. <em>Defendants Properly Noticed the Depositions of Plaintiffs\u2019 Expert Witnesses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">Plaintiffs contend that because defendants failed to tender expert witness fees with the notices of depositions, the notices were improper, and thus, plaintiffs were not required to produce their experts for depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">Section 2034, subdivision (i) sets forth the procedures for noticing expert witness depositions. Section 2034, subdivision (i), paragraph (3) (section 2034(i)(3)) states that \u201c[t]he service of a proper deposition notice accompanied by the tender of the expert witness fee described in paragraph (2) is effective to require the party employing or retaining the expert to produce' the expert for the deposition.\u201d However, \u201c[i]f the party noticing the deposition fails to tender the expert\u2019s fee under paragraph (2), the expert shall not be deposed at that time unless the parties stipulate otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Under section 2034, subdivision (i), paragraph (2) (section 2034(i)(2)), \u201c[t]he party taking the [expert] deposition shall <em>either </em>accompany the service of the deposition notice with a tender of the expert\u2019s fee . . . <em>or </em>tender that fee at the commencement of the deposition. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">Here, the trial court found that under section 2034, expert witness fees can be tendered at the time the depositions are noticed or at the depositions. Plaintiffs, however, contend that expert fees must be tendered with the deposition notice under section 2034(i)(3), unless the parties stipulate otherwise. In essence, plaintiffs argue that section 2034(i)(3) should be read in isolation, regardless of its explicit reference to section 2034(i)(2). Plaintiffs\u2019 narrow reading of section 2034 is supported neither by the language of section 2034 nor by common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">\u201c \u2018[A] court is to construe a statute \u201c \u2018so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citations.] \u2018In addressing this issue we begin, as always, with the language of the statute itself.\u2019 <em>(Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 73 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373].) \u2018Under familiar rules of construction, words in a statute must be given the meaning they bear in ordinary usage [citation]; the meaning of the enactment may not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible [citation].\u2019 <em>(Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 84, 91 [255 Cal.Rptr. 670, 767 P.2d 1148].) Moreover, \u2018every word and phrase of a statute should be given significance in order to effect the legislative intent.\u2019 <em>(Steinberg </em>v. <em>Amplica, Inc. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1198, 1205 [233 Cal.Rptr. 249, 729 P.2d 683].) \u2018In attempting to ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>legislative intent when construing a statute we presume that the Legislature did not intend absurd results. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(In re Head </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 223, 232 [228 Cal.Rptr. 184, 721 P.2d 65].) \u2018Accordingly, if a statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation, we must adopt the reasonable meaning and reject that which would lead to an unjust and absurd result.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Catelli </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1434, 1448 [278 Cal.Rptr. 452].)\u201d <em>(In re Daniel M. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 878, 882 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 291].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Here, although section 2034(i)(3) states that an expert need not be produced for a deposition if the deposition notice is not \u201caccompanied by the tender of the expert witness fee,\u201d it also states that the tender of fees shall be done in accordance with section 2034(i)(2), which states that fees may be tendered <em>either </em>with the deposition notice <em>or </em>at the commencement of the deposition. Hence, paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 2034, subdivision (i), appear to be in conflict with one another. However, when section 2034(i)(3), which incorporates section 2034(i)(2), is read in conjunction with section 2034(i)(2), it is clear that the Legislature, by explicitly providing two different ways expert fees may be tendered, intended that expert fees could be given either way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Moreover, although there are no cases interpreting section 2034(i)(2) and section 2034(i)(3), our interpretation is supported by numerous practice guides. Weil and Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1999) paragraph 8:1698, page 8J-26, comments as follows: \u201cThe expert witness fee may be tendered <em>either </em>on service of the deposition notice, or at <em>commencement </em>of the expert\u2019s deposition.\u201d (Italics in original.) Moreover, 2 Civil Discovery Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 1999), section 11.49, page 974, comments as follows: \u201cAt the option of the party noticing the deposition, the fee may be tendered at the commencement of the deposition, or such tender may accompany the deposition notice delivered to the attorney for the party designating the expert.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201c[t]he deposing party must tender the total fee either with the deposition notice or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>at the start of the deposition.\u201d (Cal. Judges Benchbook: Civil Proceedings Before Trial (CJER 1994) Discovery, \u00a7 17.48, p. 299.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Plaintiffs argue that this interpretation of section 2034 is wrong because it is contrary to the holding in <em>Tahoe Forest Inn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 509 [160 Cal.Rptr. 314]. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Tahoe Forest Inn, </em>however, is misplaced. In <em>Tahoe Forest Inn, </em>the court held that \u201ca party seeking to depose another party\u2019s expert must notice the deposition <em>and </em>tender the expert a reasonable fee \u2018based upon the <em>anticipated </em>length of the deposition. ...\u2019(\u00a7 2037.7; italics added.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 512.) The <em>Tahoe Forest Inn </em>decision was based on former section 2037.7, which stated: \u201cAny other provision of law notwithstanding, any party desiring to take the deposition of a person retained as an expert by another party to a case, shall pay the expert a reasonable fee. ... A fee based upon the anticipated length of the deposition shall be tendered to the expert. . . .\u201d <em>(Tahoe Forest Inn </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>99 Cal.3d at p. 512, italics omitted.) Former section 2037.7, however, was repealed by the Civil Discovery Act in 1986, and replaced with section 2034 (Stats. 1987, ch. 86, \u00a7 17, p. 350). Unlike former section 2037.7, section 2034 explicitly provides for the tender of expert witness fees at the commencement of the expert\u2019s deposition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence, the holding in <em>Tahoe Forest Inn </em>does not apply to section 2034, subdivision (i), paragraphs (2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Accordingly, the trial court correctly held that defendants\u2019 deposition notices, which were not accompanied by the tender of expert witness fees, were proper because section 2034, subdivision (i) allows expert witness fees to be tendered either with the deposition notice or at the commencement of the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Hollenhorst, Acting P. J., and Richli, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 21, 2000, and appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 3, 2000.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-13\">Martin Cecil True and Nannette True will collectively be referred to as plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1076-14\">Donald H.

Professor James E. Hogan, who was the reporter for the commission, wrote, \u201cIt would be wise for a party who wants to avoid a wrangle over whether a trial expert must appear for a deposition to tender the expert\u2019s fee with the deposition notice.\u201d (1 Hogan, Modern Cal. Discovery (4th ed. 1988) \u00a7 10.10, p. 637 [this text was the predecessor of the current California Civil Discovery].) Commentator James D. Ward, who was the chair of the commission, wrote, \u201cTo assure attendance of the expert who is entitled to expert witness fees, the tender of fees should accompany the service of the deposition notice on counsel for the party designating the expert.\u201d (2 Civil Discovery Practice in Cal. (Cont.Ed.Bar 1988) \u00a7 12.23, p. 802.) This comment has been carried forward as a \u201cpractice tip\u201d in the current Continuing Education of the Bar text. (2 Cal. Civil Discovery Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 1999) \u00a7 11.5, p. 974.) This comment was, and is, merely a recommendation for practitioners. Regardless of the recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>mendation, there is a clear option to tender the fees either with the service of notice or at the commencement of the deposition, in the current version of section 2034(i)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">Section 2034(i)(2), as originally drafted by the Joint Commission on Discovery of the State Bar and Judicial Council, codified the holding in <em>Tahoe Forest Inn </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>99 Cal.App.3d 509, and provided that the fees should be tendered with the service of the deposition notice. (Stats. 1986, ch. 1336, \u00a7 2, p. 4755.) The Legislature, however, provided for a period to complete \u201cclean up\u201d legislation. (See 2 Hogan, Cal. Civil Discovery (1997) appen. D, p. 465.) A change was made to section 2034(i)(2), and the final version, which became a part of the Statutes of 1987, gave the party taking the deposition the option of tendering the fee at the beginning of the deposition.

Civil Discovery (1997) Tender of Fee, \u00a7 10.10, p. 555.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1081-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1250.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
