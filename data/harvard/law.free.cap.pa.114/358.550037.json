This is the doctrine of all the cases, and it is unnecessary to cite authorities in support of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">In the very recent case of Bolton <em>v. </em>King, 9 Out., 78, we said that there could not arise a promise by implication, as the mere acknowledgment of a debt could create no liability, if in point of fact no debt existed; and further, that the promise upon such a consideration to pay a debt from which the debtor had been legally discharged, must be a clear, distinct and unequivocal promise to pay the specific debt without qualification or condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">The rule as to the measure and quality of proof requisite to establish such a promise is certainly, from the nature of the case, not less rigid than has been required to establish a valid acknowledgment or promise to defeat the operation of the Statute of Limitations; and in Burr <em>v. </em>Burr, 2 Casey, 284, it is said, to remove the bar of the statute, the acknowledgment must not only be clear, distinct and unequivocal as to the existence of a debt, but that it must also be plainly referable to the very debt upon which the action is based; it matters not where the uncertainty lies, whether in the acknowledgment or in the identification of its existence, it is equally fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. In the case just cited, the words of the acknowledgment were: \u201c Israel, can thee let me have a little interest money on that note which I hold of thine?\u201d He said: \u201cHow much would thee like, mother?\u201d She said: \u201cFour or five dollars,\u201d and he gave her seven. He said: \u201cIs that sufficient?\u201d She said: \u201cIt is for the present.\u201d There was no evidence of any note other than the note upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>suit was brought; yet it was held that the promise ivas not specific, as it might have been applied to other notes in existence at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">So in Landis <em>v. </em>Roth, 16 <em>W. </em>N. C., 309, the evidence was that the debtor said: \u201c I will pay you. $600 in thirty days on the note (this note) ; I will pay you the rest as quick as I can. We will pay you every dollar, if we have to pay it out of our pockets.\u201d Yet this court said that the debt was not sufficiently identified. Many other cases might be cited to illustrate the character and quality of proof required in such a case, but those to which we have referred are sufficient for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In the case now under consideration, the learned court below was clearly right in giving binding instructions to the jury to find for the defendant. Murphy, the defendant, was discharged in bankruptcy from all debts existing 13th August, 1879. The plaintiff\u2019s bond was dated 29th July, 1874, was proved in bankruptcy, and was entitled to share in the distribution of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, the debt was therefore discharged by the decree. The alleged promise was made on the 25th or 26t'h of May, 1881, and this suit was brought 21st January, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"A10m\">At the arbitration in March, 1885, the plaintiff testified as follows: \u201c Mr. Murphy came to me and told me that he understood I was \u2014 or had told parties that he owed me some money, and said that his friends got to hear of it, and came to him and talked to him about it, and he wished I would not talk about it, and he said that he would pay me; he said, I will pay you every cent I owe you, and I told him all right, and that was about all that was said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">If this was the conversation which actually occurred, it lacks all the essential elements of a valid promise ; there is not the slightest evidence of the existence of any particular debt \u2014 the promise was to pay every cent he owed, when in fact and in law he owed nothing. There was no reference to, and therefore no identification whatever, of the debt in suit. To say, \u201c I will settle with you,\u201d or \u201cpay you what I owe you,\u201d or \u201c every cent I owe you,\u201d are all such forms of admission as are wholly uncertain; such a promise is every way consistent with the belief that nothing is due: Harbold\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Kuntz, 4 Harris, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">When the cause came back into the Common Pleas on appeal, and was there brought to trial, the plaintiff modified his statement; he testified as follows:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">Q. State if you had any conversation with Mr. Murphy, the defendant here, after his discharge in bankruptcy, and, if so, what that conversation was, and when it was, with relation to this note ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">A. It was in May, 1881.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Q. Where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">A. At J. A. Gault\u2019s store, and it was the 25th or 26th May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">Q. What was that conversation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">A. He came to me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">Q. Where ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">A. In Gault\u2019s store in Kittanning, and he told me that his friends had come in and told him that I had been telling around that he owed me some money, and that he would like I would not tell it; he didn\u2019t like to have his friends come in and bother him; that he owed me the note, and would pay every cent of it. He further says': \u201cThe note was not present at the time, as I recollect of, and no amount was specified and no time fixed for payment.\u201d \u201c I do not say that the $7 was paid on the note; he told me he would get the money, hut that it was Mis. Murphy\u2019s, and he would take a due bill for it, but would never ask me for it.\u201d The plaintiff further states that prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy, Murphy assigned to him a note on Richardson for $75 to $100, which was subsequently collected and applied on this note; and also a note against one Frank McClymonds, which was to be collected and similarly applied, but that this note proved Uncollectible, and is still outstanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Now if it be true that Murphy, on the occasion referred to, said that he \u201c owed Truby \u201d t\u00edre note, and would pay every cent of it, to what note did he refer ? No note was exhibited or specifically referred to; no amount stated; no date or other circumstance of identification given. The plaintiff says, that, at the time of the conversation, there was no indebtedness between them except the note in suit; but that will not do; the promise must be specific and determinate, it must in some way carry with it the means of identification, and be referable only to the debt in suit. The promise may have referred to some other note, upon which the plaintiff made no claim; it may have referred to the McClymond\u2019s note, or to some other and entirely different transaction; if \u201c the account \u201d or \u201c the note \u201d or \u201c the debt,\u201d which a debtor may promise to pay, may be identified by the creditor\u2019s assertion, that this was the only indebtedness existing between them at the time, then identification is made so easy under the statute as to render the debtor\u2019s place a perilous one indeed; for he may be thereby held for the payment of one debt, when his promise was referable in his own mind to another. Upon this ground it was held in Shaffer <em>v. </em>Shaffer, 5 Wright, 51, that to toll the statute, by evidence of a payment, it must be proven unequivocally that the payment was made on the claim in suit, and when that is not done the jury is not at liberty to find the payment sufficient. In that case the suit was upon a note due February 28th, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>1852; the defendant relied on the Statute of Limitations; the plaintiff, to toll the statute, offered in evidence a due bill of the defendant, to the plaintiff, dated May 1st, 1857, for \u00a717.40, \u201c on settlement of a note as interest,\u201d together with an indorsement in plaintiff\u2019s hand-writing on the back of the note in suit, also dated May 1st, 1857, \u201c Received two years\u2019 interest to April 1st, 1857,\u201d signed John Shaffer; and although there does not appear to have been any evidence of the existence of any other note, and the due bill and the receipt on the note were of tlie same date and may have been one transaction, yet this court said: \u2014 The due bill acknowledges the defendant\u2019s indebtedness to the plaintiff in \u00a717.40 \u201c on settlement of a note as interest.\u201d Now, construing this as an admission of indebtedness for interest on a note (the most favorable construction for the plaintiff), it still does not identify the note. It does not point plainly and unmistakably to that in suit. It may have been interest on a different note. It will not answer to say that this was a question for the jury. Not so. The modem authorities are uniform to the contrary. The statute itself does not contemplate any removal of the bar by an acknowledgment, or even a new promise. And although such an effect has been\u2019allowed to them by the courts, yet it is now everywhere held, that \u201c where the bar of the statute is sought to be removed by a new promise, the promise, as a new cause of action, ought to be proved in a clear and explicit manner, and be in its terms unequivocal and determinate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We are of opinion that the compulsory nonsuit was properly entered, and the</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
