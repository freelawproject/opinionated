P. Lea, and his wife, but whose signatures thereto were not genuine, made a conveyance of the interest of said Lea and wife in said tracts to Pomeroy in fee. Heylman negotiated and, February 14th, 1856, obtained a conveyance from John Miller and his wife, another heir of said Proctor, paying her therefor $300, and also negotiated and, September 17th, 1856, obtained a conveyance from another heir of said Proctor named Jesse H. Batchelor and his wife, paying him therefor $200.-and also negotiated and, September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>18th, 1856, obtained a conveyance from Ann Myers, another heir of said Proctor, paying her therefor $200, amounting in all to $750, and said titles Heylman caused to be conveyed to Pomeroy in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">The said judgment notes given upon the accounts settled between Heylman and Pomeroy, September 23d, 1858, covered not only Heylman\u2019s half of what was furnished by Pomeroy and paid for the Blair tax titles and Proctor titles obtained subsequent to, and under, their agreement of October, 1856, but also $1,051.67 as Heylman\u2019s half of what <em>Pomeroy </em>had previously furnished to pay Z. P. Lea with interest, and an excess over one-half of the amounts previously really paid Miller, Batchelor and Myers as Heylman\u2019s share, indicating that Heylman had before the agreement of October, 1856, obtained from Pomeroy money as for purchase money for parts of the Proctor title previously conveyed to Pomeroy in fee, which Heylman, however, did not pay therefor. And of course, he was indebted to Pomeroy for this amount, thus theretofore fraudulently obtained from him by Heylman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">There was no evidence of any' written agreement between them before October, 1856, or of any oral agreement except the account settled on September 23d, 1858, and Heylman\u2019s negotiating the said purchases made prior to October, 1856. These indicated some understanding between them that Heylman was to pay Pomeroy one half of the amounts paid on those purchases, but it did not appear whether under separate oral agreements made upon each alleged purchase, or some general agreement like that of October, 1856, nor did it appear what interest Heylman should have in the purchases, except the presumption of an equal interest arising from paying half the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\">Pomeroy died in 1864. Pomeroy\u2019s vendees, every year between 1860 and 1863, mined and disposed of a large quantity of coal from the said tracts, largely more than sufficient to pay Heylman\u2019s debt to Pomeroy for said frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\">The plaintiff presented <em>inter alia </em>the following points:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-9\">6. But even if ymu should find that Heylman was a party to or cognizant of those alleged forgeries, and did not pay over the moneys he obtained from Pomeroy on account of these titles to other parties, though acts highly censurable and punishable, yet they related only to the titles of those Proctor heirs, and the conveyances thereof being consummated to Pomeroy before his agreement of October, 1856, the agreement giving Heylman any interest therein, whereto these acts of Heylman had relation, must have existed at the time.of those conveyances, and the defendants claim it was the same agreement in terms in parol as that which they subsequently executed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>writing in October, 1856, but that written agreement of October, 1856, however similar in terms to their previous oral understanding, which was in law of no obligation, as it related to realty, was a subsequent, distinct agreement, so that Heylman\u2019s said alleged misconduct was in relation to a different subject matter from the Blair tax titles, and under another agreement than that of October, 1856, under which the Blair tax titles were acquired, which the taint of that alleged misconduct cannot affect, and the defence to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim upon that ground fails. Refused \u2014 (Second assignment of error).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">7. That the bringing of the moneys obtained by Heylman from Pomeroy on account of these Proctor titles, into the subsequent account made between them of their transactions as to the Blair tax titles under the agreement of October, 1856, to fix the whole amount of Heylman\u2019s then indebtedness to Pomeroy on all accounts for settlement, does not affect Heylman\u2019s equity to the Blair tax titles, obtained under his agreement of October, 1856, with the taint of his said alleged misconduct, and the defence to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim upon that ground fails. Refused. (Third assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">In the general charge the court instructed the jury <em>inter alia </em>as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\">The amount which the defendants allege that Heylman defrauded Mr. Pomeroy of is, I believe, $2,850; $2,000 on the Lea purchase, $250 on the Batchelor purchase, $200 on the Miller purchase, and $400 on the Myers purchase, independent of the interest. It is alleged that he represented that these titles cost him $2,850 more than he actually expended, and that the whole amount of the notes that he gave for his half of the supposed purchase money did not exceed the amount of money he had taken. If this is true, then, as a matter of course, he has not paid anything for his title, and would not have any interest in it, nor be entitled to the conveyance of any portion of it, if he were a suitor here. This case, in our view of the law on this point, stands the same as if Heylman were living and in court now asking a conveyance from Pomeroy for the half of this land under the agreement. If the conduct of Heylman was such that a Court of Equity would not permit him to have the half of the lands because of frauds on Pomeroy, then we instruct you that the present plaintiffs, claiming under Heylman by the sheriff's sale of his interest, stand in no better relation to the parties defending here than he would have done; and [if you find that his conduct in reference to these purchases was fraudulent towards Pomeroy as to the amounts he alleged that these titles cost; if he made this deed as attorney in fact of Lea, knowing that the power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>attorney under which he pretended to act was a forgery; if he didn\u2019t have a power of attorney; or if in any respect he acted in bad faith and fraudulently towards his partner, Pomeroy, then he could not have a Court of Equity decree him a conveyance of the half of these lands; and in that event your verdict should be for the defendants generally.] But if the defendants have failed to satisfy you that the conduct of Heylman was fraudulent in these respects, then the plaintiffs, having shown that their purchase money was paid in the collection of these notes, would be entitled to recover seven-sixteenths of the land described in the writ, subject to the opinion of the court on the several questions of law which have been submitted by the counsel on the one side or the other. As you find this one fact, so your verdict will be, either for the defendant or for the plaintiffs for the seven-sixteenths of the land described in the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-4\">Verdict for the defendants and judgment thereon, whereupon the plaintiff took this writ assigning for error, <em>inter </em>alia, the answer of the court to these points as shown above and that portion of the charge included within brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-5\"><em>George L.

G. Pomeroy and J. C. Heylman, that they would purchase, together, the Proctor title and. such other titles as might be necessary to secure to them the lands in controversy; that the legal title to said lands should be vested in Pomeroy, one-half for his own use and the other half for the use of Heylman; Pomeroy to convey the one-half, held in trust, to such person as Heylman might designate, \u201cproviding the purchase money for said J. C. Heylman\u2019s interest is paid to the said T. G. Pomeroy, his heirs and assigns, at the cost of the same, with interest from the date of payment, before the execution of said deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">The plaintiffs claim title to an undivided part, as purchasers of the interest-of Heylman under the contract; the defendants claim as the holders of the title of Pomeroy.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">The Kittanning Coal Company are admittedly invested, not only with the absolute title to Pomeroy\u2019s half interest in the lands, purchased under the agreement, but with the legal title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>of Heylman\u2019s half, according to the terms and conditions of the contract. It is plain then, that the Kittanning Coal Company, holding the full title of Pomeroy, are privies in estate with him, and in this controversy stand in his stead. It is not pretended, much less shown, that Heylman, or any of those claiming under him, were at any time in the possession of the premises ; the Allegheny Railroad Company, and their successors in title, the Kittanning Coal Company, from the date of, and indeed long prior to, the inception of Heylman\u2019s equity, have admittedly held the exclusive actual occupancy of all the lands covered by this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">This ejectment is one, therefore, by the holder of a merely equitable title, out of possession, against the holder of the legal title, in the admitted peaceful, actual and adverse oceu]eancy of the land. In. such a case, it is clear that an ejectment will not lie to turn the trustee out of the possession, until one-half of the purchase money advanced and one-half the expenses incurred by Pomeroy have been paid, or tendered in compliance with the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The general rule is that in an ejectment founded on an equity only, the plaintiff, to be entitled to recover, must not only tender the money before suit brought, but to show his readiness to perform, he must also have it in court ready to be paid in the event of a verdict in his favor: Minster <em>v. </em>Morrison, 2 Yeates, 346 ; Gore <em>v. </em>Kinney, 10 Watts, 139 ; Eberly <em>v. </em>Lehman, 4 Out., 546. If, however, the equitable owner b.y the terms of his contract is entitled to, or by consent is once fairly put into, the possession under his title, and b3 force, fraud, or other illegal means is ousted therefrom, the rule as stated does not apply: Harris <em>v. </em>Bell, 10 S. &amp; R., 39; Gregg <em>v. </em>Patterson, 9 Watts, 208; D\u2019Arras <em>v. </em>Keyser, 2 Casey, 252; Chase <em>v. </em>Irwin, 6 Norris, 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In the very recent case of Bell <em>v. </em>Clark, 17 W. N. C., 44, the rule is thus stated: \u2014 \u201c Where the possession of the vendor is lawful, his vendee cannot maintain ejectment against him, without proof of a previous tender of the purchase monejq and he must maintain that tender by producing the money in court.\u201d These cases have been followed by the still more recent case of McGrew <em>v. </em>Foster, in the eastern district, not yet reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">It is contended, however, on part of the plaintiffs, that the purchase money has been fully paid, in accordance with the contract; that three certain notes, which Heylman gave to Pomeroy, on the 22d of September, 1858 ; one \u2022 for $997.58, at two months; one for $950.53, at four months, and one for $950.53, at six months, were for the purchase money and expenses of this joint purchase, and for reimbursement of Pomeroy for the money advanced on the contract; that all of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>notes were, before the institution of this suit, fully paid, and that the contract was on Heylman\u2019s part thus fully complied with, by means whereof he was entitled to a conveyance, and, therefore, to the possession as incident to his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">On the other hand, however, it is alleged, and the jury has so found, that Heylman in the settlement, which resulted in the execution and delivery of these notes, perpetrated upon Pomeroy a most gross and glaring fraud; that by falsehood and forgery he deceived Pomeroy as to the amount he actually applied to the purchase of these titles, and that in consequence the notes did not, in fact, represent the sums which Heylman owed Pomeroy, under his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In that settlement, Heylman received credit for $2,000, which he alleged he had paid for the interest of one Z. P. Lea; this money Pomeroy had advanced to Heylman upon the faith of a conveyance to him by Heylman, under authority of a letter of attorney from Lea, which Heylman himself had forged. He also received credit for $850 more than he paid of Pomeroy\u2019s monej\", for the interests of Miller, Myers, and Batchelor ; having falsely and fraudulently altered the true consideration mentioned in the respective deeds, to accomplish this purpose. These fraudulent transactions of Heylman are not denied; they are frankly admitted, and in addition, as we have already said, they have been found by the jury. The several sums of money of which Pomepoy was thus defrauded, with the interest thereon, actually exceed the amount covered by the obligations, taken at the settlement of the 22d of September, 1878; and although the obligations were accepted as securing the full amount of Heylman\u2019s half of the purchase money, in no proper sense can it be said that the purchase money has been paid; indeed, the entire amount of it remains unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">It is of little consequence, we think, that some of the transactions complained of occurred prior to the agreement of the 9th of October, 1856 ; for it is plain, from the subsequent settlement, either that the agreement was made upon the faith of, and embracing, these previous purchases; or, they were afterwards brought into it, and accepted by Pomeroy as part performance thereof; and if it be assumed that the fraud of Heylman was not in the making of the contract itself, but in the performance of it only, the result is the. same in this case, as without a full and fair performance on part of the plaintiffs or a tender thereof, there can be no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The case in either event is to be determined as if the parties to the suit were the original parties to the contract; the Kittanning Coal Company stand in Pomeroy\u2019s place, as the holder of the legal title in possession, and the plaintiffs by set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ting up the equity of Heylman cannot deprive them of that possession, except upon showing that they are in no default, under their contract. It is one of the elementary and fundamental principles of equity, that \u201c he who seeks equity must do equity,\u201d and another, that \u201c he who cometh into equity, must come with clean hands; \u201d the doors are shut against one, who, in his prior conduct in the very subject matter at issue, has violated good conscience, good faith or fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Therefore, if the fraud of Heylman may be considered as having entered into the contract itself, at its execution, a court of equity will not afford a remedy for its enforcement in his favor; if it affected only the performance, as the plaintiffs assume, the defendants cannot be compelled to yield the possession until the purchase money has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Fraud, it is true, is not a marketable commodity; the right to avoid or to invalidate a contract, upon the ground of fraud, unless the fraud be of such a character as to render it absolutely void, is in some sense personal; fraud will not form the substance of an assignment, so as to constitute a cause of action in the hands of the assignee. It may pass, however, as incident to a proper subject of assignment. It can only be pleaded by him, whose option it is to affirm, or disaffirm the contract, or by his representatives, or for his interest, or in Ins right; as here, by his privies in estate: Waterman on Contracts, Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., 1041, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Nor can we make any distinction, in principle, in this respect, between the ordinary case, arising upon articles between vendor and vendee, and this case, which is said to arise out of an agreement containing an express superadded declaration of trust. When an agreement for sale of land is fully executed in writing, the vendor thereby at once assumes the character of a trustee, and holds the legal title as trusteefor the vendee, under the terms and conditions of the contract. The trust which in equity is implied, is precisely of the same character as if it had been fully expressed on the face of the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Upon a careful examination of the whole case we are of opinion the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
