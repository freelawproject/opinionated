Parol evidence is admissible to establish a contemporaneous oral agreement which induced the execution of a written contract, though it may vary, change or reform the instrument; but this agreement must be shown by evidence that is clear, precise and indubitable, and this can only be done by the testimony of two witnesses, or of one witness corroborated by circumstances equivalent to another.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b51-19\">2.

Plea, non assumpsit with leave, and. issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\">The following are the facts of the case as they appeared on the trial before\"Hagenman, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-7\">The plaintiff was engaged in business in Springfield, Ohio, under the name of J. II. Thomas &amp; Sons. His business consisted in manufacturing hay-rakes and tedders, upon orders solicited by traveling sales agents throughout the United States, who, for this purpose, were furnished with blank contracts, which they were authorized to sign with the firm name. At the head of the paper containing the contracts are printed the following clauses:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-8\">\u201cThis contract subject to the personal appi\u2019oval of J. H, Thomas &amp; Sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-9\">\u201cIt is agreed and understood that, in writing and printing, this paper contains the full and entire agreement between the parties hereto, and no outside verbal understanding is of any force or effect whatever, and is not to be held binding.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-10\">On September 12th, 1882, W. B. Smith, plaintiff\u2019s traveling agent for Eastern Pennsylvania, &amp;c., called upon Loose, Seaman &amp; Co., the defendants, who were then.engaged in the sale of agricultural implements at Hamburg, Berks count]', for the purpose of introducing plaintiff\u2019s rakes in that section of the country. A contract in the usual form, with the above clauses, was then and there executed for the purchase by defendants of 25 rakes, which were to be delivered by plaintiff on cars at Springfield, and shipped to defendants-at Hamburg between January 1st and June 1st, 1883. The total consideration, $187.50, was to be paid by defendants, one half on October 1st, 1883, and one half on January 1st, 1884, with 6 per cent, interest from these several dates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-11\">A duplicate of the contract was at the same time executed and retained by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-12\">The plaintiff received the contract at Springfield on September 14th, 1882, entered it as an order upon his books, and manufactured the rakes thus ordered during October and November following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-13\">In December, 1882, defendants determined to devote them.selves exclusively to the foundry business, and, having received an extensive order for castings, notified plaintiff of that fact by letter dated December 21st, 1882, and requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the rescission and return of their contract of September 12th, 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-4\">Plaintiff, having the machines completed and ready for shipment, declined to release defendants, unless they procured some -other responsible party in that neighborhood to take their place. Defendants, however, refused, and insisted, by letter of December 29th, 1882, upon absolutely countermanding their order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-5\">' The rakes were delivered at Springfield, and shipped on May 4th, and arrived at Hamburg on May 15th, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-6\">Defendants refused to accept them, whereupon they were removed to Philadelphia and stored by plaintiff subject to defendants\u2019 order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">After ineffectual efforts to arrange the difficulty, plaintiff on May 30th, 1884, brought this action of assumpsit upon the contract, declaring in special and common counts, and claiming the contract price of the rakes, the expenses and losses incident to their shipment, re-shipment, &amp;c., and interest, aggregating $662.82.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-8\">The defendants pleaded non assumpsit, with leave, etc., et issue. A demand for specifications was made under the rule of court, and disregarded by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-9\">Upon the trial, December 2d and 3d, 1884, the execution of the paper declared upon not being denied, the same was offered and admitted in evidence without proof. The plaintiff then called witnesses to prove the fact and time of manufacture, delivery and shipment of the rakes, defendants\u2019 failure to accept, and expenses incurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-10\">Upon cross-examination of these witnesses, defendants were permitted by the court below to introduce, by questions relating to'the executing of the contract, to the circumstances surrounding the same, and to certain orders of countermand, a defence based upon an alleged contemporaneous parol agreement with W. B. Smith giving them an unconditional right of countermand up to February 1st, 1883. The evidence in support of this defence was further developed in defendants\u2019 case in chief, especial stress being laid upon the fact that notice of countermand was given before shipment, though not denied by plaintiff, who admitted the giving and receipt of the notice, after the completion of the rakes; and concluded with the admission of testimony of the magnitude of plaintiff\u2019s business and annual productions. All this evidence went in under exception by plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-11\">The defendants\u2019 allegations as to the parol agreement were positively denied by plaintiff on rebuttal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-12\">The following assignments of error show the evidence objected to and admitted under exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The Court erred in its ruling upon the following offer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">\u201c X.

Exception noted for the plaintiff. Bill sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-24\">4. The Court erred in permitting defendants to ask the witness W. B.

The Court erred in admitting the following offer of evidence :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-20\">The defendant proposes to prove by the witness on the stand that about some time in September, 1882, W. B., Smith, the duly accredited and lawful agent of J. H. Thomas &amp; Sons, visited the firm of Loose, Seaman &amp; Co., at Hamburg, Pa., and requested them to purchase a number of wire hay-rakes, the manufacture of the plaintiff in tins case, and showed to them a certain agreement which he desired to enter into with them. Loose, Seaman &amp; Co. refused to make the purchase upon the terms embodied in that agreement, saying they would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>nothing to do with the purchase of anything under such terms as that agreement sets forth; that the agent Mr. Smith, then said to them that he was fully authorized by his firm to make any contract that he pleased, and that he would so alter and modify this agreement that it would be perfectly satisfactory to them if they would take his word ; then stated to them that if they would give their order for 25 rakes, and if for any reason they would be dissatisfied with what they had done, they could notify his firm before the first day of February, 1888, and countermand their order, which the firm would recognize as binding; that upon this statement made' by the agent, the defendants were induced to enter into the agreement; that it was made at the time the agreement was signed, and was the inducing circumstance on the part of the defendants to sign the agreement, and the sole reason that they did sign it;,that a sample rake was shipped to them from the firm, for which they paid cash to the firm ; and finding that the]; could not handle these rakes, were unable to dispose of them for reasons which the witness will'give, they wrote to the firm of J. H. Thomas &amp; Sons, on the 21st of December, 1882, and also on the 29th of December, 1882, countermanding the order for the rakes; that they received letters in reply from the firm of J. H. Thomas &amp; Sons, stating that they had received these letters, but refusing to accept the countermand ; that when the rakes came to Reading, they notified Mr. Lessig, the local agent of the plaintiff, that they would not take them ; that the rakes were shipped to Hamburg at the order of the plaintiff, and never received by the defendants; and were subsequently shipped to Philadelphia by order of the plaintiff; and that the defendants have never had possession of them, and complied with the terms of the agreement made with the agent of O'. H. Thomas &amp; Sons at the time this written agreement was signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\">Objected to by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">1. The pleas of the defendants in this case are non assumpsit with leave [and payment with leave<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>] ; notice was given to the defendants under rule of court to specify the matter proposed to be given in evidence under these pleas, and no such specification has been furnished by the defendants. Therefore this evidence is inadmissible under the pleadings and the rule of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\">2. The contract under which the plaintiff in this case claims is a contract in writing, admitted by the defendants, and already in evidence. The evidence proposed attempts to van, alter, contradict, and add to the written contract, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>alleging fraud, accident, or mistake, nor even that the parol contract was the inducing circumstance for the execution of the written instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">3. The written contract offered in evidence has at the head of it an agreement in the following words:.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">\u201c It is agreed and understood that, in writing and printing, this paper contains the full and entire agreement between the parties hereunto, and no outside verbal understanding is of any force or effect whatever, and is not to-be held binding.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-8\">Any parol contract varying from the written contract which might previously have been entered into by these parties must therefore be held to have been waived and to be of no binding efficacy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-9\">4. It being shown that the rakes were manufactured by the plaintiff and delivered under and in pursuance of this contract, which has already been shown in evidence, the- agreement contained at the head thereof would operate to estop the defendants from setting up any outside agreement in derogation of the written contract, unless actual knowledge of the plaintiff can be shown coupled with consent to the terms of that outside agreement \u2014 this contract being expressly made subject to the personal approval of J. H. Thomas &amp; Sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-10\">5. So far as the offer proposes to give parol evidence of letters written and received, it is objectionable on the ground that the writing itself must be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-11\">6. It is generally inadmissible, irrelevant and incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-12\">The Court: Offer admitted, and exception noted for plaintiff. Bill sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-14\">11. The Court erred in charging the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-15\">\u201c Mr. Loose further testifies :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-16\"><em>Q. </em>If he said anything about his authority, what was it?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-17\"><em>A. </em>I said to him that he might make us this offer, but perhaps Thomas &amp; Sons would not approve of it. He said he would guarantee their approval; he was their general agent, and whatever he would do in the way of making contracts, they would certainly approve of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-18\"><em>Q. </em>Was this said to you before you put your signature to that paper ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-19\"><em>A. </em>Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-20\"><em>Q. </em>What induced you to sign this paper ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-21\">A.,I signed this contract on the basis of these promises from 'Smith, and no others.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-22\">21. The court erred in its ruling upon the fourth and fifth points submitted by plaintiff, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-23\">\u201c 4. The stipulations at the head of the contract, first, that the same was subject to the personal approval of J. H. Thomas &amp; Sons; and, second, that no outside or verbal agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>with the agent could or should be of any force, were notice to the defendants that the agent had no authority to make any outside or verbal agreement varying the terms of the written contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-4\">\u201c5. The evidence being that the agent had no authority from Thomas &amp; Sons to make any contracts outside of or beyond that contained in the instrument upon which this suit is based, and the form of the contract bearing notice of this fact to the defendants on its face, no such outside verbal agreement can be binding upon the plaintiff in the absence of proof that the plaintiff had actual notice of and approved the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">[The Court: \u201cIf the jury find that the defendants were induced to sign the agreement only on the representations made by Smith, who was the agent of the. plaintiffs, and as the plaintiffs in suit are seeking to use the instrument in violation of such promise or agreement made at the time the in-, strument was signed, without which defendants would not have signed it, the stipulations contained at the head of this\u2019 agreement do not stand in the way of the defendants setting up the verbal stipulations as a\u00b0defence to this action.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">22. The court erred in saying to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">\u201cAs the plaintiffs in suit are seeking to use the instrument in violation of such'promise or agreement made at the time the instrument was signed, without which they would not have signed it, the stipulations contained at the head of this agreement do not stand in the way of the defendants setting up the verbal stipulations as a defence to this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">Verdict for the defendants and judgment thereon, whereupon the plaintiff took this writ, assigning, <em>inter </em>alia, the assignments of error above set out.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-9\"><em>M.

In order to reverse for this cause, it must be an extreme case, in which the discretion has been abused, and in which it is apparent the party has been injured. Where a witness has stated a fact, he may be asked by the other party to detail all the circumstances within his knowledge which qualify it, though they may be new matter and form part of his own case: Jackson <em>et al. v. </em>Litch, 12 P.

On the part of the plaintiffs its terms were negotiated by their agent; the first line provided that it was subject to their approval, and they' did approve it by their signature. Immediately following that line, in legible print, quite as bold as the print in most other parts of the contract, is the following: \u201cIt is agreed and understood that in writing and [\u00a1riming this paper contains the full and entire agreement between the parties thereto, and no outside verbal understanding is of any force or effect whatever, and it is not to be held binding.\u201d This at least warned the parties that the entire agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>with all its terms and stipulations, is presumed to be set forth in the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">At the beginning of the negotiation the blank was handed to the active partner of Loose, Seaman &amp; Co., who looked it over and at first refused to sign it, but fin all 3' affixed the signature of the firm. There is no evidence that anything was omitted from, or inserted in, the instrument by accident or mistake. The defendants did not intend that the paper they signed should differ in any respect from what it is; they allege a parol agreement made at the time, which induced them to sign the writing. This parol agreement, as testified by themselves, is as follows: \u201cThat if for any cause, Loose, Seaman &amp; Co. would desire to change in any way or countermand the order, before the 1st of February, 1883, they should have that privilege. Thus, in the teeth of a distinct provision of the instrument which they read and signed, they set up an oral agreement which makes the instrument a mere option, which they could refuse at any time before the 1st of February then next.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Parol evidence is admissible to establish a contemporaneous oral agreement, which induced the execution of a written contract, though it may vary, change or reform the instrument. It has been often said that such oral agreement must be shown by evidence that is clear, precise and indubitable; that is, it shall be found that the witnesses are credible, that they distinctly remember the facts to which they testify, that they narrate the details exactty, and that their statements are true. Absolute certainty is out of the question : Spencer <em>v. </em>Colt, 89 Pa. St., 314. Where it is admitted, as here, that the instrument was read by the party who seeks to reform or avoid it, before the signing thereof, he should be stringent^ held to the rules of evidence respecting the matter which,-if found as a fact, nullifies or reforms the instrument. The laboring oar is with the party who asserts that the paper which he intelligently signed as containing the entire agreement, is not what it purports. The instrument itself is the strong evidence to be overcome. In such a case as this it can only be done by the testimony of two witnesses, or one witness, corroborated b3 circumstances equivalent to another: Phillips <em>v. </em>Meily, 106 Pa. St., 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Upon the defendants\u2019 statement of fact, it by no means follows that the agent of the plaintiffs was guilty of fraud at the time of the making of the contract. The real question is whether there was a parol stipulation, inducing the signing of the instrument, which ought to be made a part thereof to effectuate the intent of the parties. If so, the instrument may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>be reformed, upon evidence to that end which would be sufficient in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">When parties and interested persons were incompetent witnesses it was settled that at least two witnesses, or one with the equivalent of another, were necessary to establish an averment against a responsive answer on oath. That meant that the testimony of two disinterested witnesses, or the equivalent, is required to make out a case against the answer. The lawmaking parties and interested persons competent to testify is not intended to subvert the spirit of the rules of evidence in equity cases. Were it so intended two o\u00ed more plaintiffs or defendants with a breath could nullify a deed or other obligation, and thereby make written evidence as unstable as human memory, or as uncertain as the biased or corrupt testimony of litigant parties. If deeds and other instruments can be thus blown out of sight it would be as well to have none of them. Where one man has an agreement with several others, evidenced by writing, he ought to feel more at rest than if the proof of it was alone in the oral testimony of interested and heated persons. If, in the attempt tG overthrow the evidence of the instrument, the question involved is submitted merely as one of fact, he being a witness on one side, and the numerous opposing parties witnesses on the other, there was little or no use in reducing the contract to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">In equity the oaths of two of the complainants, will not be considered as destroying the effect of the responsive denial of the answer, unless they seem to be entitled to the weight of two credible witnesses, and in considering their weight the fact of their interest as parties must be taken into consideration: Vandegrift <em>v. </em>Herbert, 18 N. J. Eq., 466. So, in a law court, the testimony in support of an equitable claim or defence should be in like manner scanned and considered. Unless care be taken in the instructions to the jury, the facts that the burden is on the party who assails the writing, that the writing itself stands as evidence of the contract until beaten down, and that against the testimony of the party who affirms the writing, testimony equivalent to that of two credible witnesses is essential to successful assault, may escape due consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The signing of the contract was not denied, and under the rules it was admitted in evidence. <em>Prima facie </em>that was the contract. All the plaintiffs had to do in addition, was to show their performance, the breach by defendants, and the amount of damage. This they did, and in the doing of it gave no excuse, much less cause, for the court to permit the defendants to inject the matter of their defence into the testimony of the plaintiffs. Their case ought to have been fairly heard. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the cross-examination of Thomas, after it had already been latitndinous. the court permitted inquiry as.to the contents of letters showing a countermand of the order by defendants, and whether he had not received such countermand. In like manner the court permitted cross-examination of Smith respecting the terms of the contract, allowed the defendants to state at length, in a question, the alleged oral stipulation and asks if it was true; and if he did not say he was authorized to so make the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">It needs not citation of authorities to show that a party in the cross-examination of a witness will not be permitted to lead out new matter, constituting his own case, which he has not yet opened to the jury. Such conduct has been repeatedly denounced by the courts as unfair to the opposite party and disorderly. The admission of testimony with respect to its order, is so much within the discretion of the court that tries the cause, and when admitted out of order it is so rare that a party has been injured thereby, that in Pennsylvania no case has been reversed for the sole reason that too much latitude was allowed in cross-examination. It was remarked in Jackson <em>v. </em>Litch, 62 Pa. St., 451, that for error in permitting cross-examination, a case will not be reversed unless discretion had been abused, or it is apparent that the party has been injured. Embodied in the objectionable questions was the heart of the defence. Why were such questions then pressed, if not to gain advantage? True, the answers were in favor of the plaintiffs, but in an emphatic way, out of order, the defendants made the jury hear their answer to the case, and placed the plaintiffs\u2019 sole witness to the making of the contract in position to be contradicted b,y two of their number. We think injury is apparent, and unless the violation of a settled rule of practice in the order of admission of testimony, is not error, the third, fourth and fifth specifications must be sustained. This case seems to be such an one as will be reversed, as intimated in Jackson <em>v. </em>Litch, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The matter complained of in the first and second specifications was harmless, it was only a step toward the actual defence that the defendants were about to exhibit before the plaintiffs closed. There is no error in the ruling complained of in the fifth specification \u2014 the answer of the witness was part of a conversation on a subject of which he testified in chief. Nor is the eighth specification sustained \u2014 -no objection was made to the impertinent testimony therein set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Much of the offer which is the subject of the seventh specification was admissible ; the court was not bound to separate, and might well have refused the offer; admitting the whole was error. Therein it was proposed to prove by the witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>not onty the alleged oral agreement, but that it \u201cwas the inducing circumstance on the part of the defendants to sign the agreement, and the sole reason that they did sign it,\u201d and that Smith\u2019s statement induced them to enter into the agreement. It was competent to prove all that was said and done. It was for the jury to determine from what was said and done at the making of the contract whether the oral agreement, if proved, induced the defendants to sign the written one. The defendants are not permitted to testify their unexpressed intent, motive or belief, at the time they signed the contract. The thoughts of one parW cannot be proved to bind the other. In Spencer <em>v. </em>Colt, 89 Pa. St., 314, the very point was decided. The same principle was applied in Juniata B. &amp; L. Ass\u2019n <em>v. </em>Hetzel, 103 Id., 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Of course, had the impertinent testimonj' been excluded, the learned judge would not have quoted in the charge what Loose testified when he said he was induced to sign the contract on the basis of Smith\u2019s promises. No more need be remarked of the eleventh specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">None of the remaining assignments is well taken. The plaintiffs\u2019 points were mostly affirmed, and no error appears in the answers. What was said in the charge was correct, and did not mislead the jury to points without the case. If the instructions were inadequate to enable the jury to properly consider the testimony, the plaintiffs might have obtained more specific instructions by properly prepared points. The case rarely occurs where the court will be reversed for what was left unsaid, if what was said did not mislead the,jury from consideration of the controlling facts in the case, provided that the points were rightly answered. It is in the power of a party to obtain specific instructions on everything pertinent to the issue. When he omits to ask them he cannot complain because they were not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In reference to the twent3'--second specification of error, of which much was said at the argument, we note that it is the latter part of a sentence, the answer to plaintiffs\u2019 fourth and fifth points, beginning with the word \u201c as.\u201d Had \u201cthat\u201d been used instead of \u201cas\u201d then the fact would clearly have been submitted to the jury. It seems a clerical error, and it is not likely that the jury understood they were not to pass upon the question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire facias da nevo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
