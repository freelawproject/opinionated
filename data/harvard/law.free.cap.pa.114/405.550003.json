The representations or pretences, alleged to have been made by defendant are insufficient to sustain an indictment for procuring money by false pretences.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">2. The charge that defendant represented that the bank was insolvent is too general and too uncertain and insufficient. And so is the representation of excess of assets over liabilities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-9\">.And the charge that defendant represented that none of the money gotten or deposited would be applied on debts previously incurred is not a statement of fact but a promise of future conduct, and therefore insufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-10\">3. The facts of solvency of the hank, and of excess of its assets over its liabilities are not sufficiently negatived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-11\">4. The indictment is bad because it charges that the money was obtained from the prosecutor by both a pretence and a promise, and does not charge that it was induced by a false pretence. So far as can be known by the court, the promise alone may have induced the prosecutor to have parted with the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-12\">The court, McMichael, J., sustained the motion and quashed the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-13\">To this judgment of the court the Commonwealth excepted which was noted and a bill sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-14\">The Commonwealth thereupon took this writ assigning for error the action of the court in quashing the indictment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-15\"><em>B.

Law, \u00a7 433, Ed. 1868; People <em>v. </em>Haynes, 14 Wendell, 546,cited in 28 Am.

This motion was argued with the main question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-9\">I. (.1.) The Act of May 19th, 1874, P. L., 219, does not authorize a bill of exceptions or a writ of error or a <em>certiorari </em>in this case: Pearson\u2019s Practice in Supreme Court, \u00a7 122; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Moore, 8 Out., 570.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-10\">(2.) The writ should be quashed because it was not specially allowed as required by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-11\">(3.) A writ of error is the proper writ and not the writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-12\">II. Should the court hold the <em>eertiorari </em>sufficient to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>up the record, then there was no error in quashing the indictment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-4\">In the outset, the alleged false pretence, that none of the money deposited after June 21st should be applied to debts previously incurred, may be dismissed, as not a statement of an existing fact, but a promise of future conduct. Such a pretence is not within the statute against false pretences, as was held in Com. <em>v. </em>Hutchison, 1 Pa. Law J. Rep., 302, and Com. <em>v. </em>Moore, 99 Pa. St. R., 570, and many other cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-5\">The onl3 false pretence then charged, in either count of the indictment, was, that the People\u2019s Savings Bank was perfectly solvent and had assets in excess of its liabilities. It is respectfully urged that this is not the \u201c assertion of the existence of some fact, calculated to impose upon a man of common and ordinary caution.\u201d Solvency and excess of assets over liabilities mean one and the same thing \u2014 ability to pay one\u2019s debts. And in every transaction where credit is obtained, in buying goods, borrowing money, or in any other dealing, the representation of solvency by the person obtaining the credit is as clear andas strong as if expressed in words. A promise to pay carries with it the assertion of ability to pay; and this ability is solvency- \u2014 excess of means ov\u00e9r debts. Consequently, if such pretence were within the Act, in every case of failure to pay there would be cr\u2019iminalitjn</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-6\">Again, solvenc}' is not an existing fact. It is rather a judgment, or opinion, derived from a great multitude of facts. There is necessarily involved the estimate as to value of properties, the solvency of debtors, and the estimate of debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-7\">Again, such an opinion would not impose upon a man of ordinary caution. No man of ordinary prudence would give credit upon the applicant\u2019s own opinion or statement of his solvency. He would go a step further, and ask for a statement of the facts upon which solvency is inferred, the different properties and other means possessed, and the amounts of debts owing; so that he may judge for himself and not act upon the opinion of another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-8\">Upon a very extended search, no case has been found where there was not some specific averment \u2014 none where the alleged averment was so general as in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-9\">The other side has cited none. The following are some of the representations held sufficient:</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-10\">\u201cThat he had in Col. Ellis\u2019s hands, his guardian, who had retired from business with a large estate, a large amount of property, to wit: $2,000 per year belonging to him:\u201d Com. <em>v. </em>Hutchison, 1 Clark, 302.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-11\">\u201cThat he possessed a capital of $8,000; that said $8,000 had come through his wife, her estate; part had come into his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>possession, a part would in a month, and all soon Com. <em>v. </em>Burdick, 2 Barr, 163.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-6\">\u201c That he was joint owner with his father of a number of cows and other stock: \u201d People <em>v. </em>Kendall, 25 Wend., 399.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-7\">\u201c That he had then no note protested for non-payment; was then solvent and worth from $9,000 to $10,000; was perfectly easy in his money concerns; had no indorsers and had never indorsed more than one note:\u201d People <em>v. </em>Haynes, 14 Wend., 546.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-8\">\u201c Owned real estate on Pasysuuk road worth $7,000, and had personal property and other means to meet his liabilities, and was in good credit at the Phila. bank: \u201d Com. <em>v. </em>McCrossin, 8 Pa. L. J., 219.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-9\">\u201c That he had a capital of $2,000 : \u201d Com. <em>v. </em>Poulson, 6 Pa. L. J.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-10\">And so all the cases referred to in the text writers have some specific fact stated: See Wharton\u2019s Crim. Law, vol. 2, sec. 1135 <em>et </em>seq.; See Bishop\u2019s Crim. Law, vol. 2, see. 124, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-11\">In Com. <em>v. </em>Hickey, 1 Clark, 436, Trunkmaker said he would pay his note (for former purchases) when due, that he was doing well, had 20 hands in his employ. Held insufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-12\">The indictment should be quashed because it is found by the grand jury that the money was gotten by means of both the pretence and the promise. If the indictment had charged the pretence alone, admitting its sufficiency, the proof would have been sufficient, even though it showed that the deposit was partly induced by the promise. And if no motion to quash, the court might not arrest the judgment, because it would be presumed that the court excluded from the jury the consideration of the promise. But the point made here is that the indictment is not properly found. No person can be put to trial till the grand jury have first passed on the offence, and duly presented the defendant. In this case they have presented that the prosecutor deposited the money by reason of \u201c the said false pretences,\u201d to wit: the pretence and the promise. The court cannot see but that it was by reason of the promise alone;</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AFF\">November 1st, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b426-13\">Mr. Justice Trunkey</author>\n<p id=\"AuB\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">It is contended by the defendant that the Commonwealth is not entitled to a writ of error, or <em>certiorari </em>in this case. Reference is made to Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Moore 99 Pa. St., 570, where one of the judges was of opinion that the writ should be quashed; the court, however, sustained the writ and affirmed the judgment. 0</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The Criminal Procedure Act of 1860, \u00a7 33, provides that any person indicted, may remove the proceedings therein into the Supreme Court, provided that said court, or one of the judges thereof, or the attorney general, allows the writ upon sufficient cause. Other sections provide for bills of exceptions by defendants, and allowance of writs of error on their application, in cases of felonious homicide. The Act of May 19th, 1874, provides that in the trial of all criminal cases, the defendant may except to any decision of the court, in the same manner as is provided and practiced in civil cases, and in case of nuisance, or forcible entry, or detainer, the Commonwealth also may except to any decision in like manner; and in cases exclusively triable in the courts of Oyer and Terminer and general jail delivery, \u201cthe accused, after conviction and sentence, may remove the indictment, record, and all proceedings into the Supreme Court,\u201d and in all other cases \u201c writs of error and <em>certiorari </em>may be issued to all criminal courts, when specially allowed by the Supreme Court or any judge thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">A view of the statutes reveals the purpose to secure to defendants, or accused persons, the right of removal and review ; not to take away any right from the Commonwealth. For reasons patent to every one familiar with the character of cases of nuisance, forcible entry, and detainer, the Commonwealth, as well as the defendant, is clothed with right to except to decisions of the trial court; but that grant takes away no power as respects other cases. Since the Act of 1860, it has been decided that the powers of this court are competent to the review of any judicial record, when no statutory restraints have been imposed, and that the district attorney may take out a writ of error or <em>certiorari </em>without special allowance: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Capp, 48 Pa. St., 53. In the conduct of criminal cases, the district attorney in each county is vested with all the powers which formerly belonged to the deputy attorney general: Gilroy <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 105 Pa. St., 484. To erroneous decisions made in the trial which may cause the acquittal of the accused, except in the three misdemeanors already mentioned, the Commonwealth cannot except, and such decisions cannot be reviewed. But for error in quashing an indictment, arresting judgment after verdict of guilty, and the like, the Commonwealth may remove the record for review without special allowance of the proper writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The defendant further contends that if any writ can be taken it is a writ of error and not a <em>certiorari. </em>It cannot be gainsaid that it is bad practice to take a <em>certiorari </em>in a case like the present, although in fact it brings up the record as would a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>error. It is conceded that either writ lias been used, sometimes one and sometimes the other, for the same purpose. This court, where the cause has'been prepared and heard on its merits, has considered it as if brought up by writ of error, as in the late case of Commonwealth v. Moore, <em>supra. </em>Were this writ quashed the Commonwealth could immediately take out the proper writ; and, as the case has been fully heard on the merits, it seems better that the real question be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"Aih\">The indictment charges that the defendant did pretend \u201c that the assets of said People\u2019s Savings Bank were largely in excess of its debts and liabilities, and that said bank was perfectly solvent and able to pay all its debts and liabilities.\u201d Was this a pretence within the statute ? Persons in the transaction of business understand that a solvent man is able to pay his debts. The phrase respecting the large excess of assets over habilites, and the statement that the bank was able to pay all its debts, emphasized the representation that it was solvent. It may be that when a man buys goods on credit, or borrows money, by such act he represents himself to the creditor as solvent, but it is not so understood by persons in business. If the debtor says nothing as' to his solvency or property, the creditor does not understand that he represents anything. A note or other obligation for the payment of money, by usage, does not mean a pretence of ability to pay; but the giving of a bank check by usage is a pretence that there is money in the bank subject to the check. Acts may amount to a pretence as well as words.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In State <em>v. </em>Tomlin, 5 Dutcher, 13, the pretence by the defendant to the prosecutor was, that a third person was insolvent, largely indebted, possessed of small means, and unable to pay his debts in full. It was held that the pretence was matter of fact, not mere opinion, and the indictment was sustained. The word \u201c insolvent \u201d signified that the third person was unable to pay, but the added phrases gave emphasis to the representation. It maybe more difficult to establish to to the satisfaction of a jury that a false representation pf solvency, without more, was made with fraudulent intent, or that it induced the prosecutor to part with his property, than it would be were such representation accompanied by a detailed false statement of the property and liabilities of the person represented as solvent. This being so, it is not for the court to say that a positive statement of the fact of solvency is only the expression of an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The indictment avers that \u201cin truth and in fact the assets at the time of making the representation aforesaid, were not in excess of its debts and liabilities, and said People\u2019s Savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Bank was not solvent and able to pay all its debts and liabilities.\u201d That seems a sufficient negative of the pretended facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The remaining objection to the indictment is, as alleged in the reasons for quashing it, that it charges that the money was obtained by both a pretence and a promise, and so far as the court can know, the promise alone may have induced the prosecutor to part with his money.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The defendant concedes that if the indictment had charged the pretence alone, admitting its sufficiency, the proof would, have been sufficient, even though it showed that the deposit was partly induced by the promise. Nor is it claimed that, should the defendant be convicted on this indictment, the court would arrest the judgment because the promise is set out therein. It is settled that when a pretence and promise are made together, and both operate in the inducement, the case is within the statute, if the pretence of a false existing or past fact be sufficient. Indeed, when they are blended, it may be difficult to prove one without the other; and equally difficult to fairly state the pretence without the accompanying promise, in the indictment. Both may be proved, and the jury determine whether the prosecutor would have parted with his property without the pretence. If the grand jury act intelligently, they would no more likely find a true bill on the promise alone, than the petit jury would a verdict of guilty. They hear the testimony of the blended pretence and promise, and that both are in the indictment can work no prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">In State <em>v. </em>Dowe, 27 Iowa, 273, the defendant demurred to the indictment, and the demurrer was overruled, the court remarking, \u201c The fact that a promise is combined with a false pretence does not take away the crimimal character of the act.\u201d That ease is meagrely reported, yet it seems the indictment, setting forth pretence and promise, was sustained. The case of Reg. <em>v. </em>West, 8 Cox\u2019s C. C., 12, is when the pretence was blended with a promise, and it appears both were alleged in the indictment, but no question was raised as to the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">We are not convinced that the indictment is fatalty defective, and, therefore, are bound to say that the order quashing it is erroneous: Com. <em>v. </em>Church, 1 Pa. St., 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Judgment reversed, and procedendo awarded. Record remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
