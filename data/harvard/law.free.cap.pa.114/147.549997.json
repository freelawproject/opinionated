To be followed by evidence showing that at the time of making the assignment the liabilities of the Pittston Knitting Company, Limited, exceeded their assets, the purpose being to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>this paper was an assignment for the benefit of creditors and therefore void as against defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-4\">Objected, to as immaterial to the issue now being tried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">Bv The Court : \u2014 As we understand the claim of the defendants, it is that this assignment was, in contemplation of law, an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and not being properly recorded was void; and that hence the attaching creditors would be entitled to the fund. We have already held that the recording of the instrument shown to have been made was not invalid. The offer is overruled, and bill sealed for the defendants. (Eighth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">The defendant requested the court to charge, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-7\">That the deed to Bryden is void because delaying the defendants from realizing their judgment from the moneys in court, no time being provided for the payment of the bonds therein mentioned or for the return of the surplus to the assignor. The verdict of the jury must therefore be for the defendants and against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-8\">The Court. \u2014 We decline to charge as requested in that point. In the first place, if as matter of fact the bonds amounted to $12,000, and the fund which was assigned only amounted to something like $10,000, the reservation to the plaintiff of any surplus which might be left after the payment of these bondholders would be entirely harmless; because there would be no surplus. In the next place, this assignment, as we view it, did not remove this surplus, if any, from the grasp or reach of an attaching creditor. In effect, in equity at least, the assignment was only of so much of the fund as was necessary to satisfy the bondholders; and the residue, if any, could have been attached and reached as the property and effects of the Pittston Knitting Company, even though the assignment might have been in terms for the whole fund. Hence we decline to charge as requested in that point. We are of opinion as the case is now presented, that the assignment was valid, and if there were nothing else in the case, would entitle the'plaintiff to the fund in court.

S., 5 W. &amp; S., 223, 250.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-7\">The Act of 17th April, 1843, however, while making the preferences void, continued the assignment as valid, but to enure to the benefit of all, instead of the preferred creditors. And this is true as against attaching creditors: Wiener <em>v. </em>Davis, 18 Pa. St., 331; Law <em>v. </em>Mills, Id., 185; First Nat. Bank of Newark, O., <em>v. </em>Holmes et al., 85 Pa. St., 231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-8\">There being no requirement in the Act of 1875, that the paper should be recorded in any particular book, it was properly recorded in any book kept by the Recorder: McLenahan <em>v. </em>Reeside, 9 Watts, 511; Glading <em>v. </em>Frick, 88 Id., 463; Clader <em>v. </em>Thomas, 89 Id., 343; Paige et al. <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 92 Id., 282; Marks\u2019 Appeal, 85 Id., 231, 234.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-9\">The Act should be construed strictly because it provides a new remedy: East Union Twp. <em>v. </em>Ryan, 86 Pa. St., 459, 465. Because it virtually imposes a penalty on the Recorder for failure to index. It is in the nature of a penal statute : McGhee <em>v. </em>Hamilton, 21 Pitts. L. J., 169; Gallagher <em>v. </em>Neal, 3 P. &amp; W., 183.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-10\">The moment an assignment for the benefit of creditors is placed by the assignor or any one interested in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the proper county and within the prescribed time, the beneficial interest of the creditors, the <em>oestuis que trust, </em>is certainly and completely vested:\u2019\u2019per Sharswood, J., in Marks\u2019 App., 85 Pa.

This finding of the jury is conclusive of th\u00e9 case, unless the learned judge erred in the admission or rejection of testimony, or in his instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">There was no error in charging as complained of in the first and second specifications, nor in refusing to affirm defendants\u2019 first point, viz: \u201c That the deed of Biyden is void, because delaying the defendants from realizing their judgment from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the moneys in court, no time being provided for the payment of the bonds therein mentioned or for the return of the surplus to the assignor. The verdict of the jury must therefore be for the defendant and against the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The testimony tended to prove that the bonds, for payment of which the policies were assigned, amounted to $2,000 more than the insurance. In view of this evidence the learned judge said, if that was the fact the reservation to the Pittston Knitting Company, the assignor, of any surplus that might remain after payment of the bondholders, would be harmless, because there would be no surplus. In the next place, the reservation of a possible surplus did not remove it from the grasp of attaching creditors. In effect, the assignment was only of so much of the insurance money as would satisfy the bondholders. The residue, if any, could have been attached as the property of the assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The fourth and fifth specifications, relating to the admission in evidence of the deed of assignment, cannot be sustained; nor is there any merit in the objection covered by the sixth specification, that the deed of assignment was at first indexed in the \u201cLimited Partnership Docket\u201d and not in the \u201cDeed book Index.\u201d This did not invalidate the recording of the instrument. In contemplation of law it was recorded and took effect from the time it was left with the Recorder for the purpose of being duly recorded. This principle is recognized in Glading <em>v. </em>Frick, 88 Pa. St., 468; Clader <em>v. </em>Thomas, 89 Id., 343; Paige, et al. <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 92 Id., 282, and Marks\u2019 Appeal, 85 Id., 231. Plaintiffs in error were not prejudiced by the failure of the Recorder to enter the assignment on the General Deed Index. Their attachment issued before the instrument was left for record, but, as the jury found, after it was executed and delivered; and they appear to have had actual notice before any further steps wbre taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">There is nothing in the remaining specifications of error that requires special notice. There is no merit in either of them. .The issue was well tried, and we discover nothing in any of the rulings of the court that would warrant a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
