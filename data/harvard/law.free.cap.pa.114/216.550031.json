Shenk made his note for $250 payable thirty days after date, and on same date had it discounted by the Lancaster County National Bank; the proceeds, $248.58, were placed to his credit on the books of the bank and no check was drawn against that sum. Next day he made, an assignment for benefit of creditors to Michael L. Huver, and at once the bank, on discovering his insolvency, credited his account with $1.42, the discount, charged him with $250, the amount of the note, and tendered the note to Slienk and his assignee. They refused to receive it; Huver, the assignee, demanded the $248.58 and, on refusal, brought this suit filing an affidavit of his claim..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-14\">The defendant filed the following affidavit of defence :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-15\">That the sum of two hundred and forty-eight dollars and fift3,-eight cents, demanded by plaintiff, is the proceeds of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>note for two hundred and fifty dollars made by Henry H. Slienk, above named, dated March 80th, 1885, payable thirty days after date, discounted for the said Henry H. Slienk on said March 30th, 1885, and the proceeds (two hundred and forty-eight dollars and fifty-eight cents, after deducting one dollar and forty-two cents, the discount,) placed to the credit of said Henry H. Shenk;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">That on March 31st, 1885, and before any part of said sum was drawn from said defendant, and said Henry H.

The assignment fixed their relations. At that time it owed Shenk $248.58, and Shenk was not indebted to it. The assignment passed all the money standing to the credit of Shenk to Huver, the assignee: Wilt <em>v. </em>Franklin, 1 Binn., 502.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-12\">This action was commenced by Huver, the assignee, on the 27th of April, 1885.* The note was not due at that time, and the bank, therefore, liad no set-off.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>A demand to be set off, must be a subsisting cause of action at the time of the commencement of plaintiff\u2019s suit, and upon which an action might have been sustained: Waterman on Set-off, 74, 75, \u00a7 60; Pennel <em>v. </em>Grubb, 1 Har., 552; Huling <em>v. </em>Hugg, 1 W. &amp; S., 418; Varney <em>v. </em>Brewster, 14 New Hamp., 49, 54; Ryan <em>v. </em>Barger, 16 Illinois, 28; In Re Commercial Bank Co., L.

St., 227. The facts of that case are upon all fours with this. There is no substantial difference between them. It is true, in the case in hand, there was an assignment for the benefit of creditors after the discount and 'before the withdrawal of the credit. But the assignee has no higher standing than his assignor. Hada check been drawn against the fund produced by the discount, prior to the withdrawal of the credit such check would have been good in the hands of <em>k bona fide </em>holder for value. But there was nothing of the kind here. The rights of third parties have not intervened. We have the case of a man who procures a discount at a bank one day and makes an assignment for the benefit of his creditors the next morning.' He was insolvent when he procured the discount. The note which he gave the bank was a worthless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tiling, and lie'knew it when he offered it to the bank. There was an utter failure of this consideration ; the bank received nothing for the credit which it gave him. When it learned next morning of his insolvency the bank withdrew the credit and tendered, him back the note. It is conceded that if the rights of third parties^ had intervened the case would have been different. So it would have been had the bank paid over the money to Shank, or upon his order. But as between the parties the bank had the right to withdraw the credit to Shank. The cases cited in the opinion of the court below, and by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error are good law, but they have no application to this case. We need not repeat what was saicj in Dougherty <em>v. </em>The Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The judgment is reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
