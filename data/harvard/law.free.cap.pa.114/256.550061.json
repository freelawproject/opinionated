It has paid no office license fee for the years named, as required by section sixteen of the Act of 1879 (P. L. 120). Upon this section these settlements are based.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">The following is the opinion of the court in The Shenandoah Valley R. R. Co.\u2019s case, the legal questions in the two cases being the same, but one opinion was filed :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">Our conclusions of law may be briefly stated. The first, second, fourth and fifth specifications of appeal in each case are identical with those passed upon by this court and by the Supreme Court in Conglomerate Mining Co. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 13 W. N. C., 522, and upon the authority of that decision must be overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-9\">The third specification in each case denies the validity of the settlement, asserting that the office license fee now in controversy is in conflict with the commercial clause of the Federal Constitution, Art. I., section 8, clause 4. This question was not decided in the case above cited, because no facts were proved upon which to rest the claim. Certain facts are now proved, as set forth in paragraph two, but we do not think they are sufficient. The defendant is a foreign corporation, carrying freight and passengers upon a line of railroad lying wholly without this commonwealth. In strictness it has no existence herein, and it certainly does not of itself carry any person or anything hereinto or hereout. At the end of its road it receives or delivers to or from connecting roads certain freight and passengers, which by such roads are carried into or have been carried out of this state, and it has traffic contracts with these roads which affect such reception and delivery. But since it does not itself transport between Pennsjdvania and other points, we are of the opinion that it cannot claim the protection of the commercial clause against the license fee iu suit. The view contended for results in this: That as soon as a through freight or passenger line is established by contracts between distinct corporations, each corporation in the line is engaged in inter-state commerce so far as through business is concerned, and may establish an office in every state touched or crossed by any part of the line, although that state may have refused the privilege, or may have agreed to grant it only on -condition that payment be made therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-10\">Thus, the question whether a corporation was engaged in inter-state commerce would often depend, not upon the business which it was lawfully doing, but upon its contracts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>other corporations, and even upon the good faith with which they were kept. If by contract a \u201cthrough line \u201d was established and continued to be maintained, inter-state commerce would exist as to all contracting parties. If there was no such contract, or if it should be broken, there would be no such commerce, save as to the party directly carrying between the states, while in both instances the nature of the business done by each would be the same. We think the existence of connections or of traffic contracts connot be decisive. If a through line is made up of several distinct corporate agencies, each must be judged by the actual corporate business which it actually does; and where, as in this case, it only carried persons or goods over a space which is wholly within one state, such carriage is the proper test of its commercial character in an inquiry like this. No doubt, in one sense it is engaged in inter-state commerce, for it helps to carry from a point in one state to a point in another state, but the meaning of the commercial clause cannot be thus wide. In the same sense it might be said, with equal force, that a merchant in New York who sells and ships goods to the West is also engaged in interstate commerce because he helps to carry by hauling the goods from his store to the railway station. Surely if no other clause of the Federal Constitution gave him the right to have an office in Pennsylvania, the commercial clause alone would not support his claim to enjoy that privilege in the face of hostile legislation by the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">We have been referred to no authority which takes the defendant\u2019s view, and we do not think the principle which underlies the commercial clause extends so far. If the chartered power of a corporation embraces commerce between two states, it then becomes, of course, an inter-state agency, and the question now pressed upon us would require decision; but, while it has no such chartered power, its corporate activity is properly to be exercised within the limits of the sovereignty which gave it being, and its power to act beyond those limits depends, speaking generally, upon the silent or express permission of the sovereignty whose borders it may desire to cross. We will not decide that the inherent right of a state to exclude foreign corporations, or to prescribe the terms upon which they may be admitted, can be taken away by a private contract to which it is not a party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">For the purposes of this case, we assume that the licence fee before us would be a regulation of commerce if sought to be imposed upon a corporation lawfully engaged in the business of inter-state transportation. Whether, in every case, an office licence fee would be such a regulation, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>decide. I\u00a3 the view above stated is correct, the question does not now arise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">The sixth and seventh specifications in each case assert that the expenditure of money, as set out above in paragraph five, is the investment, use, and employment of a part of defendant\u2019s capital in this Commonwealth, within the meaning of the section upon which' these settlements stand, and therefore that the defendant is chargeable, not under that section, but only under section four, upon a proper proportion of its capital stock. This question, however, has been ruled against the defendant in Com. <em>v. </em>Standard Oil Co., 101 Pa., 148, and in the second writ of error taken by the Conglomerate Mining Co., (decided in October, 1884,) and does not need further discussion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">The defendant\u2019s points in each case are refused, and we hold that the commonwealth is entitled to recover. Judgment was accordingly entered as shown above for the Commonwealth in the sum of $7,503.12.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">The Norfolk and Western R. R. Co. thereupon took this writ, assigning for error the action of the court in overruling the specifications of appeal, and in directing judgment to be entered for the Commonwealth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-7\"><em>M.

N. C., 522, all the questions raised by this writ of error were authoritatively settled, except those which object to the tax on the ground that it is a regulation of commerce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-6\">As we understand the argument submitted for the plaintiff in error, it practically assumes that the license fee in question is a regulation of commerce, and, as such, is within the prohibition of the constitution of the United States. The position thus taken is based upon the fact that the taxable corporation, by means of traffic contracts with connecting lines is engaged in the business of inter-state transportation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\">The license tax, or fee, exacted from foreign corporations which do not \u201c invest and use \u201d their capital in this state, is iu the nature of a franchise tax, imposed for the privilege of having an office, or offices, within the state \u201c for the use of their officers, stockholders, agents, or employees.\u201d Practically, it is imposed for the privilege of exercising the franchise of being a corporation within the state, and is in no sense a tax upon either the business or property of the corporation. The distinction thus suggested is a very clear one. As a license, it is required as a condition precedent before the corporation can have an office within the state for the use of its officers, stockholders, etc. As a tax upon property or business, it could only be imposed upon the property within the jurisdiction of. the state, or upon the business done within her territorial limits, after all conditions precedent had been complied with: Cooley on Taxation, 386 ; Burroughs on Taxation, \u00a7 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-8\">A license tax is not a regulation of commerce: License Tax cases, 5 Wall., 471; Osborne <em>v. </em>Mobile, 16 Wall., 479; Ward <em>v. </em>Maryland 12 Wall., 418.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-9\">There is no limit to the power of a state to impose license taxes where there is no discrimination as between different states; and where the tax is not directly laid upon the subjects of commerce. A corporation \u201cmust dwell in the place of its creation, and cannot migrate to another sovereignty,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>when it does attempt to go into another jurisdiction, it can go there only upon compliance with the terms which may be imposed upon it for exercising that privilege: Canada Southern R.

The transportation which this railroad company may lawfully conduct, by virtue of its own corporate franchise, is not inter-state transportation at all, but is confined to territorial limits which are entirely without the state of Pennsylvania. . In other words, this company has no corporate franchise to carry any freight or passengers from or to any point in Pennsylvania; hence, as to Pennsylvania, its transportation authorized by its charter cannot.be regarded as inter-state transportation in any point of view. The through transportation in which it does participate within its own territorial limits, is carried on by force of certain contracts into which it has entered with other railroad companies, owning other lines of road, with which this company connects, and iu the sense that the carriage of freight and passengers over such through routes from one state to another is inter-state commerce, the proportion which this company contributes to such carriage may be regarded as a portion of such commerce. But that is not the sense in which, as we understand it, the commercial clause of the Federal Constitution is to be interpreted when its immunity is invoked by a particular corporation or person engaged in the transporting business. We understand that its protection is extended only to such transportation as is completely and lawfully authorized to be conducted from one state to another. We have carefully examined all the authorities cited for the plaintiff in error, and do not find that they either expressly or inferentially decide that a local corporation, which contributes only its own local right of traffic to a system of through traffic, by means of contract arrangements with other local companies, can for that reason be permitted to exercise its corporate franchise within a foreign jurisdiction free of such burdens-as may be imposed by such foreign jurisdiction, upon the theory, that it is engaged in inter-state commerce. Anything short of this will not suffice for the exigencies of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We concur entirely with the views so lucidly and forcibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>expressed by the learned court below in the opinion in the Shenandoah Valley case, adopted in this case, and on that opinion, with the brief remarks above expressed, we affirm this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
