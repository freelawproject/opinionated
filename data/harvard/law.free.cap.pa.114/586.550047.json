J., it was admitted that the title to the whole tract of land described in the writ was in John Cable who died, seized thereof, December 12th, 1856, having made the following last will and testament, which was duly probated, December 19th, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-6\">The last will and testament of John Cable, of Indiana Township, County of Allegheny, and State of Pennsylvania, \u201cI, John Cable, considering the uncertainty of this mortal life, and being of sound mind and memory, (blessed be Alighty God for the same) do make and publish this my last will and testament in manner and form following, (that is to say) after the payment of all my just debts. First. I give and bequeath unto my two sones John and Edward Cable, all my farm after my death to them as long as the do live, and after there death to there children, but that the said John and Edward Cable is to pay to my four daughters as follows: to Eliza Portsmouth, my daughter, wife of John Portsmouth, five hundred dollars; to Sarah McClure, my daughter, wife of William McClure, five hundred dollars; to Jessica Reed, my daughter, wife of Joseph Reed, five hundred dollars; to Harriet Cable, three hundred dollars, to be paid in two years after my death, and also my sones, the aforesaid John and Edward Cable, or there heirs, are to find a house for my wife Sarah and daughter Harriet and keep them and cloath them, also to provide for them everything that is necessary for there cumfort as long as they shall live or remain unmarried.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-7\">That at his death he left surviving a widow, Sarah Cable, since deceased; two sous, Edward and John \u2014 Edward still living. John died Juty 8th, 1876, aged 56, unmarried and without issue, also four daughters, namely: Eliza, married to John Portsmouth; Sarah, married to William McClure; Jessica, married to Joseph Reed, and Harriet, who never married, who died April 2nd, 1881.That the parties plaintiff are Mrs. Eliza Portsmouth and the heirs of the other daughters who are dead. That if plaintiffs are entitled to recover at all it is for the three fourths of the undivided one half of the tract. That Edward Cable was and is in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-8\">The jury returned a special verdict for the plaintiff for the undivided three fourths of the undivided one half of the land described iu writ, with\u2019 six cents damages and costs, subject to the opinion of the court upon the questions of law reserved, to wit: whether or not under the will of John Cable, in evidence, and under the agreed and admitted facts set forth in the Judge\u2019s notes of trial, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover; if so, the judgment to be entered in favor of plaintiffs, otherwise for the defendant. The court decided the law to be with the defendants, filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>1. If it be assured that John Cable, the second, and Edward Cable took but life estate under the will of their father, we do not deem it a vital question as to whether or not that was a joint life estate or a tenancy in common.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-6\">2. If the sons took but a life estate, and the children take as purchasers and not as heirs of the first taker, the remainder is in the whole farm, and that is devised to their children, i. e., the children of John and Edward, whoever they may be, and regardless of their number, and they take per capita.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-7\">Jarman on Wills, vol. 2, page 194; Hill <em>v. </em>Bowers, 120 Mass., 135; Abrey <em>v. </em>Newman, 16 Beav., 431; Cunningham 1 De Gex. &amp; S., 366.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-8\">3. If the devising clause of the will, to wit, \u201cI give and bequeath to my two <em>sons </em>John and Edward Cable all my farm, after my death, to them as long as they do live, and after their death to their children,\u201d stood alone, or if there is nothing in the other portions of the will to modify and control the ordinary meaning and effect of these words, there can be no doubt that it vested a life estate onty in the sons and created a remainder for their children as purchasers : Cote <em>v. </em>Von Bonhorst, 5 Wright, 243; Custis <em>v. </em>Longstreght, 8 Id., 297.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-9\">4. Following the devising clause are these provisions: \u201cBut the said John and Edward is to pay to mj' four daughters as follows: To Eliza Portsmouth five hundred dollars; 1o Sarah McClure five hundred dollars; to Jessica Reed five hundred dollars, and to Harriet Cable three hundred dollars, to be paid in two years after my death; and also my sons, the aforesaid John and Edward Cable, or their heirs, are to find a house for my wife, Sarah, and daughter, Harriet, and keep them and clothe them, also to provide for them everything that is necessary for their comfort as long as they shall live or remain unmarried.\u201d No doubt that the testator meant by the words \u201cthere heirs\u201d in the latter clause, the same persons whom he designated as \u201cthere children\u201d in the devising clause, and it is argued by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that this of itself is sufficient to control and modify the meaning of the words \u201cthere children\u201d; and further, that the bequest to the widow and the daughters indicate that the testator in fact intended to make a division of his property, making all his .children substantially equal, and that a life estate in the sons was not equal in value to the legacies given which they were required to pay. (In Cable\u2019s Appeal, 10 Norris, 327, it has been decided that these legacies are not a charge on the land.) Counsel argue earnestly, and at least plausibly, that all this not only justifies, but requires the court to read the will as though the devise was to the sons for life, and at their death to their issue or heirs of the body, which at common law would vest an estate tail and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>under our statute of 1855, an estate in fee simple in the first taker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-5\">5. We are of the opinion that these provisions are not sufficient to control and change the well established meaning and effect of a devise to children after a distinct devise of a life estate to the parent, as ruled in so many cases. The meaning of the testator must be deduced in this case from what he says, from the apt words he uses in a connection in which they have a well settled meaning fixed by adjudicated cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-6\">6. Whether the brothers took an estate in common or a joint estate, they took but a life estate; a remainder was devised to their children, meaning the children of both or either,-as purchasers notas heirs; and there being children of Edward living, they take either at the death of'John or at the death of their father;, and although John died leaving no children, the plaintiffs have no title to the land devised by John Cable the first.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-7\">7. And now, 10th July, 1886, after argument of counsel and upon consideration, the court being of the opinion that on the reserved question the law is with the defendant, it is ordered that, upon payment of the verdict fee, judgment be entered in favor of the defendant <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-8\">Judgment was accordingly entered, whereupon the plaintiffs took this writ assigning for error <em>inter </em>alia, the action of the court in entering judgment in favor of- the defendant, <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-9\"><em>John Barton </em>and <em>Wesley I.

C. C., 215; Tuckerman <em>v. </em>Jeffries, 3 Bac.

It is plain that this was the intention of the testator, for the devise over to the children does not take effect until after \u201ctheir\u201d death, which evidently means the death of the survivor. It is true the Act of 1812 has abolished joint tenancy in this state, but that Act has never been held to prevent a testator creating a joint tenancy by the express language of his will, or by necessary implication. On the contrary it was held in Arnold <em>v. </em>Jack's Executors, 24 Penn. St. R., 57,'that while survivorship as an incident to joint tenancy was abolished by the Act of 1812, it may be expressly given by will or deed. The third survivorship results as a necessary implication from this will so far as the life estate is concerned, and as Edward Cable has survived John, and is still living, it is clear the plaintiffs cannot recover the possession of any portion of this farm at present, whatever may be their lights upon the death of Edward.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">This is as far as it is necessary for us to go at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
