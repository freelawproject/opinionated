L., 22, prohibiting the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine, or the keeping the same with intent to sell, falls within the police power of the state, which may be described to be the power vested in the legislature by the constitution to make, ordain and establish all manner of wholesome and reasonable laws, statutes and ordinances, either with penalties or without, not repugnant.to the constitution, as they shall judge to be for the good and welfare of the commonwealth and the people of the same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-22\">4. The test of the reasonableness of a police regulation prohibiting the making and vending of a particular article of food, is not alone whether it is in part unwholesome and injurious. If an article of food is of such a character that few persons will eat it knowing its real character ; if at the same time it is of such a nature that it can be imposed upon the public as an article of food which is in common use, and against which there is no prejudice; and if, in addition to this, there is probable ground for believing that the only way to prevent the public from being defrauded into purchasing the counterfeit article for the fenuine is to prohibit altogether the manufacture and sale of the former, len such a prohibition may stand as a reasonable police regulation, although the article prohibited is in fact innocuous, and although its production might be found beneficial to the public, if in buying it they could distinguish it from the production of which it is the imitation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-42\">5. The fact that scientific experts may pronounce a manufactured article intended for human food tp be wholesome and not injurious, and that in a pure state it may be tbus good for food, does not render it incompetent for the legislature to prohibit the manufacture and sale of the article if in the judgment of the legislature, and not of the courts, it be necessary to the protection of the lives, health and property of the citizens, ancl to the preservation of good order and the public morals.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-43\">6.

The Act of Assembly of 21st May, 1885, entitled \u201c An act for the protection of the public health, and to prevent adulteration of dairy products, and fraud in the sale thereof,\u201d which is the Act of Assembly under which this prosecution was commenced, is in violation of the provisions of section 1, of article 1, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-8\">2. It is an unjust and unlawful interference with, and infringement of, the personal rights of property, business, industry, and liberty of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-9\">8. The said Act of Assembly is unconstitutional and void, because it destroys property without making or providing any compensation therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-10\">4. The said Act of Assembly is not a constitutional and legal exercise of the police power belonging to the state, but is a deprivation of the property of the citizen without compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-11\">5. The said Act of Assembly is intended to, and actually does, deprive the defendant and other citizens of the state of Pennsylvania, who have made similar investments, and engaged in similar business, of their property, without compensation, and without any legal reason for such deprivation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-12\">6.

(Fourth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-15\">The defendant, who is engaged in the grocery and provision business in the city of Harrisburg, was tried in the court of Quarter Sessions of Dauphin county on an indictment based upon the Act of May 21st, 1885, the first section of which is as follows: \u201cNo person, firm, or corporate body shall manufacture out of any oleaginous substance, or any compound of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the same other than that produced from unadulterated milk, or of cream from the same, any article designed to take the place of butter or cheese produced from pure unadulterated milk, or cream from the same, or (of) any imitation or adulterated butter or cheese, nor sell, or offer for sale, or have in his possession with intent to sell the same, as an article of food.\u201d The fourth section makes it a criminal misdemeanor to violate the provisions of the first section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">The offense charged was the selling, and having in his possession with intent to sell, the article the manufacture and sale of which is prohibited by the Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">The following agreement was, at the trial, put in evidence by the Commonwealth: \u201cIt is agreed, for the purposes of this trial, that the defendant sold to the prosecuting witness, in the city of Harrisburg, July 3Oth, 3885, as an article of food, two original packages, <em>fro ut </em>the said packages here produced in court, containing an article manufactured out of an oleaginous substance and compound other than that produced from unadulterated milk, or cream from the same, and designed to take the place of butter produced from pure unadulterated milk, or cream; that said packages were sold and bought as butterine, and not as butter produced from pure unadulterated milk, or cream from the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-8\">\u201cIt is further agreed that said defendant bad in his possession, with intent to sell the same as an article of food, one hundred other pounds of said article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-9\">\u201c It is further agreed that the packages so sold to the prosecutor, and as now produced in court, contain twenty-three pounds each, and that each' package was then, and is now, marked with the words \u2018oleomargarine butter\u2019 upon the lid and side of the package in a straight line in Roman letters half an inch long.\u201d Whereupon the Commonwealth rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-10\">The defendant then produced an expert witness, and offered to prove by him certain matters, which, on objection by the District Attorney, were excluded by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-11\">These offers will be quoted at length hereafter in this opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-12\">The case was then submitted to the jury, on the admission contained in the agreement in evidence, and a verdict of guilty was rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-13\">Motions were then made, on behalf of the defendant, for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment, which were fully and ably argued and are now to be decided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-14\">The able counsel for the defendant contended at the trial, and on the argument of these ipotions\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-15\">1. That the act under which defendant was indicted and convicted is unconstitutional <em>per se; </em>and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>2. That the evidence offered and rejected was relevant to the question of its constitutionality as applied to the special facts of this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-4\">We must determine whether either or both of these positions can be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">It results from the very nature of the case that when the question properly arises, and a statute is found by the courts to be unconstitutional, they must declare it void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land, and next to it, and higher in authority than legislative statutes, is the Constitution of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-7\">Hence, when a statute come in conflict with either, it must give way, and the courts must decide whether such conflict exists or not, when the rights of parties litigant depend upon such decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\">\u201c Courts are organized and established to administer the laws of the land. In their decision they are bound to preserve and protect those paramount laws which they are sworn to support\u201d: Flint River Steamboat Company <em>v. </em>Foster, 5 Ga., 194; (48 Am. Dec., p. 256.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-10\">But, as is shown by Chief Justice Black in Sharpless <em>v. </em>The Mayor, 9 H., 147, a statute will be declared void by the court \u201c only when it violates the Constitution clearly, palpably, plainly and in such manner as to leave no doubt or hesitation on our minds.\u201d And he adds that this is a rule which \u201chas the singular advantage of not being opposed even by a dictum.\u201d Again, in Erie and North-East Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Casey, 26 Pa. St., 287, the same judge says: \u201cThe right of the judiciary to declare a statute void, and to arrest its execution, is one which, in the opinion of all courts, is coupled with responsibilities so grave that it is never to be exercised except in very clear cases; one department of the Government is bound to presume that another has acted rightly. The party who wishes us to pronounce a law unconstitutional takes upon himself the burden of proving, bejmnd a doubt, that it is so.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-11\">And in the opinion of the court, in Pennsylvania Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Riblet, 66 Pa. St., 164, Chief Justice Sharswood says: \u201cNothing but a clear violation of the Constitution \u2014 a clear usurpation of power prohibited \u2014 will justify the judicial department in pronouncing an Act of the legislative department unconstitutional and void.\u201d And the courts cannot inquire whether the legislature has violated the general principles of liberty, or whether its enactments are unwise or inexpedient, but only whether it has overstepped the limits prescribed for it in the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-12\">This is declared by Chief Justice Black in the clearest and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>most forcible language, in Sharpless <em>v. </em>The Mayor, supra, thus: \u201c To me, it is as plain that the General Assembly may exercise all the powers which are properly legislative, and which are not taken away by our own, or by the federal Constitution, as it is that the people have all the rights which are expressly reserved. We are urged, however, to go further than this, and to hold that a law, though not prohibited, is void if it violates the spirit of our institutions, or impairs any of those rights which it is the object of a free government to protect, and to declare it unconstitutional if it be wrong and unjust. But we cannot do this.\u201d And 'he proceeds to show, by reference to numerous authorities, that, as he says, \u201cthe weight of authority is overwhelming\u201d in support of the doctrine thus laid down. And in the latter case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Maxwell, 3 Casey, 456, Chief Justice Woodward said: \u201cA law that is unconstitutional is so because it is either an assumption of power not legislative in its nature, or because it is inconsistent with some provision of the federal or state Constitution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">We could cite numerous cases to show that the same doctrine is held by the highest courts of all the states, but we do not deem it necessary so to do. We have abundantly shown that it is the doctrine by which we must be governed in deciding this case. We will endeavor, first, to determine whether the act is unconstitutional, <em>per se, </em>irrespective of the evidence offered and excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">The burden of proof is, as we have seen, on the defendant. We have carefully considered the suggestions and arguments advanced by his able counsel, intended to show that the power to enact a statute, such as the one in question, which, as they contend, deprives the defendant of the use of his faculties, and takes from him a means of livelihood, is excepted out of the general grant of the legislative power contained in the Constitution, by the express or implied limitations or prohibitions of the bill of rights or the body of the Constitution itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">But assuming for the present that the statute is in its nature legislative, we are wholly unable to find any limitation or prohibition which can be successfully pleaded against its enactment or enforcement. For whilst the bill of rights does declare that \u201call men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights,among which are those of enjoying life and liberty, and of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness,\u201d this has never been construed to be a declaration that these rights'are absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-9\">On the contrary, as is said by Chief Justice Shaw, in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Alger, 7 Cushing, 53: \u201c We think it a set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tied principle, growing out of the nature of well-ordered civil society, that every holder of property, however absolute and unqualified his title may be, holds it under the implied liability that his use of it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having an equal right to the enjoyment of their property, nor injurious to the rights of the community. All property .....is held subject to those general regulations which are necessary to the common good and general welfare. Rights of property, like all other social and conventional rights, are subject to such reasonable limitations in their enjoyment as shall prevent them from being injurious, and to such reasonable restraints and regulations established by law as the legislature, under the governing and controlling power vested in them by the Constitution, may think necessary and expedient.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">Hence, if the Act in question be legislative in its character, the limitations which it prescribes for the defendant in the acquisition, possession, and use of his property, are clearly within the boundary lines drawn by the Constitution, if, in the judgment of the legislature, these limitatiohs are considered necessary and expedient for the welfare of the community. And, if so, then in so far as they do, if at all, interfere with the defendant's full enjoyment of his property, this interference results from the \u201claw of the land.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">It lias not been even suggested in argument that the statute is in conflict with any of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, and hence we need not refer to that instrument, except to say that, if it were so suggested, we think the contrary is clearly shown by Mr. Justice Miller, In Re Broswaken, 18 Fed. Rep., 62.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">But counsel contend that this enactment is not properly legislative in its character, but that, under the guise of a pretended exercise of the police power of the state, the legislature has made an unwarranted attack upon private rights that, as stated by the learned counsel who closed the argument on behalf of the defendant, \u201c in the form of government ordained by this people, and under which we live, the grant of legislative power never included a power for the destruction of a harmless industry, which is sought in this case to be exerted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">This brings us to the fundamental question in the case, namely, the question of the nature and the extent of the police power of the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-9\">This power is a proper subject for description rather than definition, and it has nowhere been more aptly described than by Chief Justice Shaw in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Alger, supra, at page 85, where it is said to be \u201c the power vested in the legislature by the Constitution, to make, ordain, and establish all manner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>-wholesale and reasonable laws, statutes, and ordinances, either with penalties or without, not repugnant to- the Constitution, as they shall judge to be for the good and welfare of the Commonwealth, and of the peoplmmbrthe same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">This power, as was said Justice Field, in his concurring opinion in Bartemi^^MMbwa, 18 Wall., 138, extends to all regulations affectiimHBHI'iealth, good order, morals, peace, and safety of societyHSfflBfunder it all sorts of restrictions and burdens are impdlfflMf and when these are not in conflict with any constituticBpl prohibition or fundamental principles, they cannot be successfully assailed in a judicial tribunal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-8\">We think the line- between the valid exercise of this police power and the invasion of private rights is well drawn in the opinion of the court by Earl, J., in Jacobs\u2019 Case, 98 N. Y., 98, thus: \u201cGenerally it is for the legislature to determine what laws and regulations are needed to protect the public health and secure the public comfort and safety, and when its measures are calculated, intended, convenient, and appropriate to accomplish these ends, the exercise of its discretion is not subject to review by the courts. But they must have some relation to these ends. Under the mere guise of police regulations, personal rights and private property cannot be arbitrarily invaded, and the determination of the legislature is not final and conclusive. If it passes, an Act ostensibly for the public health, and thereby destroys or hikes away the property of a citizen and interferes with his personal liberty, then it is for the courts to scrutinize the Act and see whether it really relates to, and is convenient and appropriate to promote the. public health. It matters not that the legislature may, in the title to the Act, or in its body, declare that it is intended for the improvement of the public health. Such a declaration does not conclude the courts, and they must yet determine the fact declared, and enforce the supreme law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-9\">To the same effect is Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Bearse, 132 Mass., 542, where, speaking of the exercise of the police power, it is said: \u201cThe legislature is largely the judge of its own powers Avith reference to these matters. If it can be seen, indeed, that the rights of property are iirvaded under the pretense of a police regulation, it Avould be our duty to interfere to protect them.\u201d And in Pennsylvania Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Riblet, supra, the court sa}: \u201cWe cannot try the constitution alty of a legislative Act by the motives and designs of the lawmakers, however plainly expressed. If the Act itself is within the scope of their authority it must stand, and we are bound to make it stand, if it will, upon any intendment.\u201d The point of contact- between the power of the legislature and that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the courts, with respect to the exercise of the police power, may be illustrated, by the decisions relating to the power of taxation. This power, when exercised in the mode prescribed by the Constitution, is practically unlimited, but the courts will always determine whether a so styled taxing Act is in reality such, and if it be not, as, for instance, if the purpose for which the tax is laid be a private and not a public purpose, the Act will be declared unconstitutional and void. This is the principle lying at the foundation of the decisions of the numerous cases which hold that taxation in aid of the construction of railroads is constitutional, among which Sharpless <em>v. </em>The Mayor, supra, is a leading case. The taxation is upheld because the building of railroads is deemed a matter of public interest. And whenever the courts have considered that the construction of railroads is not a public matter, they have held that laws authorizing taxation' for such a purpose are not in reality tax laws, an instance of which is People <em>v. </em>Salem, 20 Mich., 452, decided by Mr. Justice Cooley. See note to Sharpless <em>v. </em>Mayor, 59 Am. Dec., 782, citing a multitude of cases. See, also, cases relating to frontage rule of valuation of real estate, for assessment purposes : Washington Avenue, 19 P. F. S., 352; Seely <em>v. </em>City of Pittsburgh, 1 Norris, 360; Craig <em>v </em>City of Philadelphia, 8 Norris, 265; City of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Rule, 12 Norris, 15.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">Another illustration is furnished by the cases relating to the exercise by the legislature of the power of eminent domain. The legislature may condemn, or authorize the condemnation of private property for public use, and it may, in the exercise of its discretion, determine when and upon what property the power of eminent domain may be exercised; but its exercise is not beyond the reach of judicial inquiry. Whether or not a use is a public one which will justify the exercise of the power, is a judicial question. Although the legislature may daclare it to be public, that does not necessarily determine its character; it must in fact be public, and, if it be not so, no legislative fiat can make it so: Palairet\u2019s Appeal, 17 P. F. S., 488.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">On these principles the Court of Appeals of New York, in Jacobs\u2019 Case, supra, decided the statute there in question to be unconstitutional. It was entitled \u201cAn Act to improve the public health by prohibiting the manufacture of segars and preparations of tobacco in any room in tenement houses in certain cases, and regulating the use of tenement houses in certain cases.\u201d It prohibited such manufacture in any tenement house occupied by more than three families, except on the first floor of houses on which there is-a store for the sale of segars and tobacco. The court, on examining the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>and scope of the Act, say: \u201c It is plain that this is not a health law, and that it has no relation whatever to the public health; \u201d and, therefore, it is pronounced unconstitutional. Had it been,, in reality, a health law, the decision would have been otherwise. So, in People <em>v. </em>Marx, 1 East. Rep., 196, (32 App. L. J., 6,) where the defendant was indicted for a sale made in violation of the provisions of an Act entitled \u201c An Act to prevent deception in the sale of dairy products,\u201d the body of which is substantially the same as that of the Act now before us, the court held the Act unconstitutional because they found that it was not a <em>bona fide </em>police regulation. They say : \u201c It appears to us quite clear that the object and effect of the enactment under consideration was not to supplement the existing provisions against fraud and deception by means of imitation of dairy butter, but to take a further and bolder step, and by absolutely, prohibiting the manufacture and sale of any article which could be used as a substitute for it, however openly and fairly the character of the substitute might be averred and published, to drive the substituted articles from the market and protect those engaged in the manufacture of dairy.products against the competition of cheaper substances capable of being applied to the same uses as articles of food.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">\u201c The learned counsel for the respondent frankly meets this view, and claims in his points, as he did orally upon the argument, that even if it were certain that the sole object of the enactment was to protect the dairy industry in this state against the substitution of a cheaper article made from cheaper materials, this would not be beyond the power of the legislature. This, we think, is the real question presented in the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">And, after referring to constitutional provisions and cases, the court adds: \u201c Who will have the temerity to say that these constitutional principles are not violated by an enactment which absolutely prohibits an important branch of industry for the sole reason that it competes with another, and may reduce the price of an article of food for the human race ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">\u201c Illustrations might be indefinitely multiplied of the evils which would result from legislation which should exclude one class of citizens from industries, lawful in other respects, in order to protect another class against competition. We cannot doubt that such legislation is violation of the letter as well as the spirit of the constitutional provisions before referred to, nor that such is the character of the enactment under which the appellant was convicted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">This decision is manifestly correct, if we concede that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>purpose and intent of the act were those thus found and de dared by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">And, if we could be satisfied that the object and intent of the Act in question here were what the Court of Appeals of New York declared the object and intent of the Act before that court to be, we would not hesitate to pronounce it unconstitutional and void. But having in mind the axiom that all the presumptions are in favor of the good faith of a co-ordinate department of the government, and that to doubt is to be resolved in favor of the validity of its acts, how can we say that it is not the <em>bona fide </em>purpose of this statute, as expressed in its title, to protect the public health, and to prevent the adulteration of dairy products and fraud in their sale ? And the legislature having, by passing the Act, declared its judgment that the means used are necessary to attain these ends, we cannot review this judgment, when exercised in good faith, for the conclusive reason that it is clearly within the jurisdiction of the legislature to effect these purposes by appropriate means. \u201c The fair presumption is that, in the honest judgment of the law-making power, exercised in the light of past legislation on the same subject, no less stringent enactment would have sufficed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">In accord with this view is the State <em>v. </em>Addington, 12 Mo. App. Rep., 214, affirmed in 77 Mo. R., 110. There a statute substantially identical with ours was held to be a valid exercise of the police power of the state vested in the legislature. This ruling was based upon the conclusion that the statute \u201cwas obviously passed'in the form of a sweeping prohibition, because the legislature were of opinion, after two years\u2019 experience with the previous statute, that it was ineffectual to prevent our people from being defrauded by having an artificial compound sold to them as real butter. The design of the manufacturer and seller may be perfectly honest, but the person to whom they may sell the article \u201d \u2014 the retail dealer \u2014 \u201c may be dishonest; and, therefore, the legislature thought it best to lay the axe at the root of the tree by prohibiting entirely the manufacture and sale of such compound within the state.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-7\">The opinion delivered in this ease in the intermediate court by Thompson, J., is worthy of attentive perusal bjr reason of its strength of reasoning and fullness of illustration and citation of authorities.

But this we are now called upon to decide. The offer made was to show merely that the article admitted to have been sold in this case was such. No one doubts that it might be made as stated in the offer. But it is no less certain that it may be made out of oleaginous substances and compounds that are neither pure nor wholesome. How, then, could evidence that the substance sold in any given case, and admitted to be that proscribed by the Act, was pure and wholesome, tend to show that the statute which forbids all sales is unconstitutional? As well might a defendant on trial for selling spirituous liquors in a jurisdiction where all such sales were prohibited, while admitting that he had sold the prohibited article, offer to prove, by way of defense, that the particular glass of liquor sold was pure and wholesome. Witnesses could be called in almost every case who would be willing so to testify, but no court would admit such testimony for the purpose of showing that a prohibitory statute was unconstitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">Indeed, the question of the constitutionality of a statute cannot be determined on the testimony of witnesses, for the very conclusive reason that it is a question of law and not of fact, and must be decided by the court on quite other grounds than those of the opinions and beliefs of witnesses. We are satisfied it was not error to refuse the testimony recited in the first offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">We may here remark that this offer brings into view one of the reasons that impelled the legislature to pass this Act. It states that the amount of butterine in the manufactured article was increased by the introduction of milk and cream, and that the only effect of butterine is to give flavor to the butter. Manifestly the purpose was to give this article as nearly as possible the flavor and semblance of butter, so that it might be sold as such by the retailer without detection, and no doubt this is the \u201cfraud in the sale \u201d which the Act was designed to prevent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">We adopt, on this point, and apply to the statute now in question, the language of the Supreme Court of Missouri, in State <em>v. </em>Addington, 77 Mo., 110 :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-9\">\u201c The central idea of the statute before us seems very manifest; it was, in our opinion, the prevention of facilities for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>selling or manufacturing a spurious article of butter, resembling the genuine article so closely in its external appearance as to render it easy to deceive purchasers into buying that Avhich they Avould not buy but for the deception. The history of legislation on this subject, as well as the phraseology of the Act itself, very strongly tends to confirm this view,. If this Avas the purpose of the enactment, Ave discover nothing in its provisions which enables us, in the light of the authorities, to say that the legislature, when passing the Act, exceeded the power confided to that department of the Government. And unless we can say this, we cannot hold the Act as being anything less than valid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">As to the second offer, it is to be observed that defendant did not propose to prove that the article was manufactured by him, nor that he purchased it, or owned it, prior to May 21st, the date of the passage of the Act, nor even prior to July 1st, when it Avent into effect. Therefore, as was said of a like offer, by Mr. Justice Bradley, in his concurring opinion, in Bartemeyer <em>v. </em>Iorva, 18 Wall., 129, on page 136: \u201cThe hnv Avas not in this case\u2019 an invasion of property existing\u201d \u2014 in the defendant \u2014 \u201cat the date of its passage, and the question of depriving a person of property, Avithout due process of laAV, does not arise.

The prohibition was not necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-9\">There is, therefore, a limitation to the exercise of all legislative power which does not depend upon the provisions of either the federal or state Constitution, and that limitation is to be determined and declared by the judiciary. The police power of the state, like that of taxation, is not unlimited in its range and extent, but is subject to- judicial examination, and must be controlled by the courts, where it exceeds its proper bounds: R.

This view was rejected by the court, and would not have been accepted, it is respectfully asserted, even if that declaration had been made in the body \u2019of the statute. It is, therefore, the law that when an Act of Assembly is passed ostensibly for the public health, the courts are at liberty to examine the Act, and decide whether it really relates to or promotes the public health; and where it fails of this intention or object, and interferes with the liberty, or takes away the property of a citizen, it is the duty of the court to declare it an illegal exercise of the legislative power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">It is respectfully submitted that the contrary view held by the court below, that a legislative declaration that a statute was intended to benefit the public health or morals is conclusive of its character and necessity, and forbids subsequent judicial inquiry, is denied by the preceding authorities, and is not sustained by those which are cited in this opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">The intolerable hardship of this case consists in the fact that on the 22d of May, 1878, (P. L., 1878, page 37,) an Act of Assembly was passed \u201c to prevent deception in the sale of butter and cheese.\u201d This Act was succeeded by one passed on 21th May, 1883, (P. L., 1883, page 13,) \u201cfor the protection of dairymen, and to prevent deception in sales of butter and cheese.\u201d Each of these laws prescribed the manner in which oleomargarine butter should be made, and sanctioned its making as a lawful industry. Relying on their provisions, and believing that the policy of the state thus declared, to be the regulation and not the prohibition of this industry, great investments were made in real and personal property for conducting the business, and there was a large amount of manufactured product on hand at the time when the Act of Assembly in question was passed. This law not only forbade the continued manufacture of this article, but it destroyed, without compensation, the value of that already manufactured, by denying to the owner the right of sale. For this additional reason it is asserted that this Act is unconstitutional and void : Mynehaven <em>v. </em>People, 13 N.

The legislative conclusion is, as clearly appears from the words of the Act, that all articles in imitation of butter, or designed to take the place of butter, made from any substance except pure milk, or cream, are injurious to the public health. Therefore, in order to carry but the purposes declared in the title, the legislature prohibits the sale of any such article to be used as food. Thus the declared purpose of the Act is in exact harmony with its provisions; and the subject of the legislation being admittedly within the line of legislative authority, the constitutionality of the enactment cannot be successfully denied: Sharpless <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 9 Harris, 161.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-6\">The only case which the industry of counsel for plaintiff in error has been able to discover, holding that legislation similar to this has been held unconstitutional, is that of People <em>v. </em>Mark, 99 N.

The argument on behalf of the people seems to have conceded that the sole purpose of that legislation was to prohibit an important branch of industry for the purpose of making another branch more profitable ; and as it is clearly shown by the learned judge who decided this cause in the court below, the decision of the N. Y. Court, in the case cited, rested solely upon that remarkable concession. There is no such concession in the present cause, and the ease cited, we respectfully contend, has no application here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-7\">On March 24th, 1881, the legislature of Missouri passed an Act in substantially the same language as that now under consideration.

The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard; the ablest and the purest men have differed on the subject; and all that the court could properly sajr in such an event would be that the legislature, possessed of an equal right of opinion, had passed an Act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent with the abstract principles of natural justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-6\">The Constitution allows the Legislature every power which it does not positively prohibit: Norris <em>v. </em>Clymer, 2 Pa.

It is the duty of the legislature to make laws for the good of the people. But whether a particular law is for the good of the people, it is not for the courts to decide in passing upon the constitutionality of the law.

He has shown, very clearly, we think, that the Act of May 21st, 1885, under which plaintiff in error was indicted, is not in conflict with any provision of either the state or federal Constitution, and that the General Assembly, in enacting the law, did not transcend the limits of legislative authority; but if there should be any doubt as to the constitutionality of the Act on either of these, or on any other ground, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the validity of the Act, as a proper exercise of legislative power. As was said in Erie and North East Railroad <em>Co. v. </em>Casey, 26 Pa., 287-300: \u201cThe right of the judiciary to declare a statute void and to arrest its execution is one which, in the opinion of all courts, is coupled with responsibilities so graye' that it is never to be exercised except in very clear cases.. One department of the government is bound to presume that another has acted rightly. The party who wishes to' pronounce a law unconstitutional takes upon himself the burden of proving beyond all doubt that it is so.\u201d Or, as the principle is tersely stated by the late Chief Justice Shars\u25a0wood, \u201cNothing but a clear violation of the Constitution \u2014 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>clear usurpation of power prohibited \u2014 will justify the judicial department in pronouncing an Act of the legislative department unconstitutional and void\u201d: Penna. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Riblet, 66 Pa., 164-169. In same case it is further said: \u201cWe cannot try the constitutionality of a legislative Act by the motives and designs of the law-makers, however plainly expressed. If the Act itself is within the scope of their authority, it must stand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">These principles are necessary incidents of the law-making power. In creating a legislative department, and conferring upon it the legislative power, the people must be understood to have conferred the full and complete authority as it vests in and may be exercised by the sovereign power of any state, subject only to such restrictions as they have seen fit to impose, and to the limitations which are contained in the Constitution of the United States. The legislative department is not made a special agency for the exercise of specially defined legislative powers, but is intrusted with the general authority to make laws at discretion: Cooley\u2019s Con. Lim., 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The Act of May 21st, 1885, is entitled, \u201cAn Act for the protection of the public health, and to prevent adulteration of dairy products and fraud in the sale thereof.\u201d It cannot be doubted that the General Assembly is invested with full power to legislate for the protection of the public health, or to prevent the adulteration of articles of food, as well as imposition or fraud in the sale of such articles. In the absence of any constitutional inhibition or limitation, the sovereign power of the state to enact laws for the public good appears to embrace these subjects of legislation; but, however that may be, they come fairly within the police powers of the state. These powers, as described by Judge Redfield in Thorpe <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., 27 Vermont, 149, extend \u201cto the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort and quiet of all persons, and the\" protection of all property within the state,.....and by which persons and property are subjected to all kinds of restraints and burdens, in order to secure the general comfort, health and prosperity of the state; of the perfect right to do which, no question ever was, or, upon acknowledged general principles, ever can be made,'so far as natural persons are concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The statute books of this and other states furnish numerous examples of the exercise of the power referred to; but perhaps the laws most nearly identical in principle with our Act are those which prohibit the sale of adulterated provisions. The sale of pure milk and pure water mixed may be made a penal offence (Com. <em>v. </em>Farren, 91 Mass., 489; Same <em>v. </em>Waite, 93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Id., 264), or adulterated confectionary; Com. <em>v. </em>Chase, 125 Mass., 202; Same <em>v. </em>Evans, 132 Id., 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The statute of Massachusetts declares: \u201cWhoever sells or keeps or offers for sale adulterated milk, or milk to which water or any foreign substance has been added,\u201d shall be punished, etc. In Com. <em>v. </em>Farran, supra, it was held, under this statute, that guilty knowledge on the part of the seller need not be averred or proved. In Com. <em>v. </em>Waite, <em>supra, </em>the contention was that inasmuch as it is innocent and lawful to sell either pure milk or pure water, or both, separately, the legislature has no power to make the sale of milk and water when mixed a penal offence, unless it is done with a fraudulent intent ; but the court said: \u201c It is notorious that the sale of milk adulterated with water is extensively practiced with a fraudulent intent. It is for the legislature to judge what reasonable laws ought to be enacted to protect the people against this fraud, and to adapt the protection to the nature of the case......The court can see no.grounds for pronouncing the law unreasonable, and has no authority to judge of its expediency.\u201d Speaking of the prohibitory liquor law of Massachusetts, passed in 1869, the Supreme Court of the United States says: \u201c If the public safety or the public morals require the discontinuance of any manufacture or traffic, the hand of the legislature cannot be stayed from providing for its discontinuance by any incidental inconvenience which individuals or corporations may suffer. All rights are held subject to the police power of the state......Whatever differences of opinion may exist, as to the extent and boundaries of the police power, and however difficult it may be to render a satisfactory definition of it, there seems to be no doubt that it does extend to the protection of the lives, health and property of the citizens, and to the preservation of good order and the.public morals. The legislature cannot, by any contract, divest itself of the power to provide for these objects. They belong emphatically to that class of objects which demand the application of the maxim, <em>salus popult suprema lex; </em>and they are to be attained and provided for by such appropriate\" means as the legislative discretion may devise. That discretion can no more be bargained away than the power itself\u201d: Beer Company <em>v. </em>Massachusetts, 97 U. S., 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">So far as the constitutionality of the Act under consideration depends on the police power of the state, it may safely be rested on the principle underlying the cas\u00e9s above referred to and others that might be cited. The manufacture, sale and keeping with intent to sell, may all alike be prohibited by the legislature, if in their judgment the protection of the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>from injury or fraud requires it. To deny the authority of the legislature to do so, is to attack all that is vital in the police power. To refuse recognition of the power, in a given case, because, in the judgment of some, the legislature, though acting within its proper sphere, may have mistaken the public necessity for a law prohibitory in its character, is to make the individual judgment superior to that of the legislature, to which the people in their sovereign capacity have delegated the law-making power.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The fact that the prohibited substances, in a pure state, may be wholesome and not injurious, is irrelevant in a judicial inquiry. Their wholesomeness will not render the Act unconstitutional. The statute is intended to prevent fraud and protect the public health by prohibiting the manufacture and sale of substances and compounds which furnish the temptation to commit the former, and which may be injurious to the latter. As was said by the Supreme Court of Missouri, in State <em>v. </em>Addington, 77 Mo., 110, the position, that to render the law .unconstitutional the prohibited articles must be unwholesome, would utterly overthrow the police power of the state \u2014 overthrow every law, the wisdom of which could not bear the test of scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The case last referred to arose under a statute similar to ours, entitled, \u201c An Act to prevent the manufacture and sale of oleaginous substances, or compounds of the same, in imitation of the pure dairy products.\u201d In a well-considered opinion, the constitutionality of this Act was sustained by the Court of Appeals (12 Mo. Ap. Rep., 214, 228), and afterwards by the Supreme Court of that state: State <em>v. </em>Addington, 77 Mo., 110. The mere fact, as was said in that case, that experts may pronounce a manufactured article, intended for human food, to be wholesome or harmless, does not render it incompetent for the legislature to prohibit the manufacture and sale of the article. The test of the reasonableness of a police regulation, prohibiting the making and vending of a particular article of food, is not alone whether it is in part unwholesome and injurious. If an article of food is of such a character that few persons will eat it knowing its real character; if, at the same rime, it is of such a nature that it can be imposed upon the public as an article of food which is in common use, and against which there is no prejudice; and if, in addition to this, there is probable ground for believing that the only way to prevent the public from being defrauded into the purchasing of the counterfeit article for the genuine is to prohibit altogether the manufacture and sale of the former,\u2014 then we think such a prohibition may stand as a reasonable police regulation, although the article prohibited is in fact in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>nocuous, and although its production might be found beneficial to the public, if in buying it they could distinguish it from the production of which it is the imitation.\u201d.....\u201cThe manufacturers may brand it with its real name. It may carry that brand into the hands of the broker or commission merchant, and even into the hands of the retail grocer; but there it will be taken off, and it will be sold to the consumer as real butter, or it will not be sold at all. The fact that in the present state of the public taste, the public judgment, or the public prejudice with respect to it, it cannot be sold except by cheating the ultimate purchaser into the belief that it- is real butter, .....stamps with fraud the entire business of making and vending it, and furnishes a justification for a police regulation prohibiting the making and vending of it altogether \u201d: State <em>v. </em>Addington, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">In view of these and other considerations suggested in the opinion referred to, and also in that of the court below, we cannot sa}1\" the Act in question is not a valid exercise of the police power of the state. The legislature was doubtless satisfied that the manufacture and sale of the prohibited articles were prejudicial to the public good to such degree that a remedy was needed; and we have no right to say that a penal statute, less severe and sweeping in its terms, would have afforded an effective remedy. That is a legislative and not a judicial question. If it is thought the legislature erred in the solution of that question, the proper course is an appeal to them to correct the error, if an3- there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">For reasons above suggested, and others more fully elaborated by the court below, we think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Judgment affirmed and record remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b312-12\">Mr. Justice Gokdon</author>\n<p id=\"A6Lh\">dissented, and filed the following opinion :\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">I regard the Act of the 21st of Ma3&gt;-, 1886, not onty as improvident and unreasonable, -but as unconstitutional. \u201cNo person, firm or corporate bod}\", shall manufacture out of any oleaginous substance, or any compound of the same, other than that produced from unadulterated milk, or cream from the same, any article designed to take the place of butter or cheese produced from pure unadulterated milk, or cream from the same, or imitation or adulterated butter or cheese, nor shall sell, or offer for sale, or have in his, her or their possession, with intent to sell the same as an article of food.\u201d A glance at this Act shows that its purpose was to protect the dairyman at the expense of the consumer. Cannot a pure, wholesome butter be made from some other oil than that ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>tracted from milk ? Certainly it can. The chemist has discovered that it maj' as well be manufactured from the fat of the cow as from the fat of her milk. \u201c Oleomargarine, when made under the formula of the French patent, is composed mostly of beef fat churned with milk, and colored with anil atto: \u201d U. S. Agricultural Report, 1885, p. 100. Here, then, is a pure and wholesome article of food, in every particular as good as the best butter; why, then, shall we not be permitted to make use of if ? The Act cannot properly be regarded as a police regulation, for it is not alleged that the prohibited article is in the slightest degree injurious to the welfare or happiness of the people of the Commonwealth. On the other hand, proof to the contrary was offered, so that the question for discussion really involves the right of the legislature to prohibit the manufacture of an article of food without regard to its character or quality , a question certainly of very serious import. The offer of proof was for the purpose of showing that the proscribed manufacture was not subject to the police power of the state, and from its very nature could not be. But the court ruled out the proposed evidence as irrelevant, thus declaring that the legislature was the sole judge of its own powers. But this amounts to an assumption that the legislative power is such that the manufacture and sale of any article of food whatever may be prohibited. So the question, in fact, is not one of police power, but whether the legislature can in contravention of fact assume that any given article of commerce is within the scope of its police powers, and thereupon prohibit its manufacture and use. Truly, if this position taken by the court b'elow be correct, then is the defendant\u2019s case indefensible, for if the legislature can define its own powers without regard to constitutional limit, an appeal to this court is to no purpose. In this, however, the commonwealth is at fault; the Quarter Sessions has imposed a burthen upon it which it cannot sustain. Its counsel have said a great deal about the police powers of states, and have cited many cases to prove that which no one has pretended to deny, but they have utterly failed to prove that the General Assembly has the unrestricted power claimed for it. But if this astounding assumption fails, the defendant was wrongfully convicted. Let us then consider to what result a doctrine of this kind must necessarily lead. We must take it that that which was sold by the defendant was good, pure and wholesome food, for such was the purport of the proposed proof; hence, it follows, as of course, that if the legislature can prohibit the making of butter from anything but milk, it can prohibit its manufacture altogether, for pure milk is certainly no better than pure tallow, and if it can prohibit its manufacture from the latter, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>can also from the former; if it can make unlawful the making and sale of one kind of pure food it can, in like manner, make unlawful the making and sale of any other. Lard, as it is found in the market, is a manufactured article, and is largely used in cooking as a substitute for butter; for ages this has been the case as well in this country as in Europe, and no , legislature has, as yet, taken exception to the practice on the ground of its unhealthfulness. Indeed, in this commonwealth many persons subsist, during the winter season, almost entirely on buckwheat and lard, and with hard working people, who require large quantities of carbonaceous food, this diet is neither unpleasant nor unwholesome. It is true that some may not regard it as good as butter, nevertheless it is cheaper, and, therefore, within the reach of those who cannot afford to pay for butter. Why then shall it not be used as heretofore? This wonderful Act of 1885 will allow us to eat it as a substitute for pork, or beef, or bread, or as a substitute for anything but butter. And yet this is called a police regulation; a law passed for the preservation of the health of the community!\u2014 to me it, looks much more like,a regulation passed for the welfare of the dairyman without regard to the welfare of the balance of the people; class legislation, that political curse, which the framers of the Constitution endeavored to prevent, bub which our General Assembly seems disposed to perpetuate. Nor are we to forget that by our decision we do not merely give force to an Act of assembly, but are also establishing a precedent of the most dangerous character. For if the legislature can arbitrarily prevent the citizen from making or selling any given article of food, it can also prevent his buj'ing or using the same however excellent it may be, and however necessary for the preservation .of his own life and happiness, and that of his family. Yet this is the doctrine which this court is about to establish by its decision; a doctrine which must necessarily be founded on the ruins of the bill of rights. What a commentary on ninteenth century progress and civilization ! This Act has made Chinese conservatism respectable. The chemist has discovered a process by which an important article of food can be manufactured more cheaply than by the old methods, and the man of scant means is thus promised an addition to his meager fare which he could not previously afford. Naturally we might suppose that this inventor would be hailed as the benefactor of his race, since he has thereby added much to the happiness of the laboring class of the people. Rut no; say our law makers, he is a malefactor, and shall neither make nor sell his product. And why? If, indeed, the legislature had not in view the protection of the dairyman, I would like to be told by some one what it had in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>view. Of course, the commonwealth will not admit this as a solution of the question, for if a fact of that kind could be made to appear, the unconstitutionality of the Act would be undoubted; hence, this idea of police power has been set up as a lure which has been only too successful in attracting the attention of the court below, as well as this court, from the real issue. What we hav-e here said with reference to the legislative intention, is made all the more certain from the fact that the Acts of May 22d, 1878, and of June 10th, 1881, had already afforded sufficient protection to the community from deception in the sale and adulteration in the manufrcture, of butter, so that as a police regulation the Act of 1885 was not necessary. We cannot, therefore, but think that there can be but little if any doubt that this Act was designed to protect the interests of the producer at the expense of the welfare and rights of the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Thus viewing the matter before us, T feel myself constrained to dissent from the judgment of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
