Rule returnable April 18th, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-6\">The following are the exceptions filed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. They were overruled by the court, which action was <em>inter alia </em>assigned for error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-7\">1. The petition for the road in this case, and the report of the viewers, as to the termini and route of the road, are too vague and uncertain. (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-8\">2. The proposed road passes over the main tracks of the Pennsylvania railroad, four in number, and two sidings connected therewith, at grade, and will, if opened, be highly dangerous, not only to the people who may attempt to cross said tracks, owing to the frequent running of trains, but also to the public traveling in the cars of'said company. (Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-9\">3. That in the construction of- said road, it will be necessary not only to cross the said four main tracks and the two sidings connected therewith, at - grade, but there are a number of switches already constructed, and which are now in use, and have been for some time absolutely necessary to the company in the management of its trains and business, that will be practically destroyed, and by reason thereof, the business of the company cannot be accommodated as it should be, for the benefit of the public. (Third assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-10\">4. Neither the petitioners nor the viewers had any right, as matter of law, to locate- the said road at grade over the tracks of the Pennsylvania railroad, the ground occupied by the said tracks, and which is proposed to be used for said road, having been appropriated for a public use long prior to the petition filed in this case. (Fourth assignment of error.) ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-11\">6. That there is no necessity for the opening of said road at the point indicated on the plan attached to the viewers\u2019 report in this case, for the reason that there is already a sufficient and safe crossing not over four- hundred feet distant on the east side of the same, and also a crossing by the Pittsburgh and Greeusburgh turnpike over the tracks, on the western side thereof, and not far distant from where the proposed grade crossing is sought t.o be made, and that the risk to public travel, whether' on the railroad or to persons passing along the proposed road, will be so extremely great, and the danger of loss of life and personal injury so imminent, that to open said road would practically be a public calamity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-12\">6. That there was no notice given by the viewers, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>time and place of their meeting, to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and their report in this case does not show that they gave notice to the proper officer, or to any person whatever connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, of the time and place of their meeting in reference to the proposed location of the road at grade over the main tracks of the company. (Fifth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-4\">7. That the road for the most part between the termini is located upon Franklin street, which had been laid out, opened and used by the public, prior to the date of the petition filed in this case, and that, by reason thereof, the viewers had no legal right to locate the proposed road over and upon said street. (Sixth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-5\">8. That the viewers\u2019 report is erroneous in stating that \u201cno damages will arise, as the entire route is now thrown open for the use of the public;\u201d whereas, your exceptants allege that the ground that the Pennsylvania railroad occupies by its tracks, and over and upon which it is proposed to lay its road, has never been thrown open for the public. (Seventh assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\">The court gave no written opinion, making only the following final order: \u201c And now, August-3d, 1886, rule discharged, and stay of proceedings set aside.\u201d (Eighth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-8\">The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, thereupon, took this writ and filed the following assignments of error in addition to- those shown above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-9\">9. The court erred in making the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-10\">\u201cAnd now, Feb-ruarj'' 5th, 1885, no exceptions to the report of viewers having been filed, the same is hereby confirmed absolutely, <em>see. reg.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-12\">10. The court erred in confirming absolutely the report of the viewers, because the plan attached to said report does not show the improvements on the line of the proposed road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-13\">11. The court erred in confirming absolutely the report of viewers, because one of the termini is vague and indefinite, the report stating it to be \u201cto the Edgewood public road, <em>near </em>the Home for Aged Women,\u201d without further giving a fixed and certain point for the termination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-14\">12. The court erred in confirming absolutely the report of the viewers, because they did not find and report \u201cwhether the road desired be necessary for a public or private road,\u201d as required by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-15\">13. The court erred in confirming absolutely the viewers\u2019 report, because it was not within the power of the viewers or the petitioners to locate a public road <em>at grade </em>over the main tracks of the Pennsylvania railroad, unless a physical necessity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>existed, arising out of the nature of the ground over which the road was to be made, which would prevent it being so constructed, and the petition should have stated such necessity, and the report should have shown such necessity, if any existed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-6\">14. The court erred in confirming the viewers\u2019 report absolutely, because the same does not find that an overhead crossing for the road,.or one underneath the railroad tracks, was impracticable, and wholly ignores the fact that the ground of the railroad company, proposed to be taken, and now covered with tracks, is devoted to a public use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-7\">15. The court erred in confirming the report of the viewers absolutely, because there is no warrant in law in Pennsylvania for the location and construction of a common public highway, such as the proposed road, over the Pennsylvania railroad, <em>at </em>grade, nor for the appropriation of its right of way for such a purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-8\">16. The court erred in confirming the viewers\u2019 report, for the reason that the record shows the sole object of the petitioners was to force a crossing for Franklin street, a long used highway by dedication, in the village of Wilkinsburgh, over the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company at grade, and not for the opening of a public road between\u2019 two well defined termini, and through private property, and by reason thereof the proceedings are void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-9\">17. The court erred in overruling the additional exceptions filed December 12th, 1885, by leave of court, which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-10\">\u201c The viewers appointed by the court, Charles Davis, Escp, Wm; Collingwood, and Charles M. Loomis, did not view the site of the proposed road, nor did they make the report filed in this case. Charles Davis, the county surveyor, did not act, but in his place and stead W. W. Shaw, his deputy, and the report shows on its face the facts above stated, and that.by reason thereof, the view and report are defective.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b647-11\"><em>Dalzell (.Hampton </em>with him), for plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbM\">The <em>termini </em>are not designated with sufficient definiteness- in the petition and the report: Bean's Road, 11 Casey, 281; Road in Lower Marion, 8 P.

St., 38.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b648-5\">The Act of 1836 requires, as one of the duties of the viewers, that \u201c the} shall also annex and return to the court a plot or draft thereof, stating briefly the courses and distances, and noting briefly the improvements through which it may pass.\u201d This court has held in the Schuylkill Falls road, 2 Bin., 250, and in Road from McCully\u2019s Fishery, 13 S. &amp; R., 25, that it is sufficient if there be a reference to the improvements, either in the draft or report. Here there is none in either, and the requirements of the Act have been wholly disregarded. That there were improvements on the line long prior to and at the time the petition was filed, the record shows conclusively, and no truthful denial can be made to the contrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b648-6\">An entire omission to note the improvement is fatal on <em>certiorari: </em>Bell Vernon Road, 41 Leg.

They were not overruled, but were not accepted as sufficient reason for making absolute the rule granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b648-8\">The <em>termini </em>are designated with certainty: In re Springfield Road, 23 P.

On application of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company the court then, as matter of grace, permitted exceptions to be filed, and granted a rule to show cause why the petition and all subsequent proceeding should not be quashed, and. made an order staying proceedings in the meantime. The exceptions having been dismissed and rule to show cause discharged, the record of the proceedings was brought here for review on writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The assignments of error \u2014 Seventeen in number \u2014 are more numerous than meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">The first is, \u201c The petition for the road and report of viewers, as to the <em>termini </em>and route of the road, are too vague and uncertain.\u201d The petition is for \u201ca public road, or highway from a point on the east line of the city of Pittsburgh at the intersection of Waverly lane and Peebles avenue in said city, to a point on the Edgewood public road at or near the Home for Aged Women.\u201d There is nothing vague or uncertain in either of these <em>termini. </em>The first is mathematically certain, and the last is approximately so. The report of viewers, adopting the starting point of the petitioners, and giving the course and distance of the road terminates it at \u201c the Edgewood public road near the Home for Aged Women.\u201d There is nothing approaching vagueness or uncertainty in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The proceedings are not irregular or invalid by reason of anything alleged in the 2d, 3d, or 4th specifications. The crossing at grade of the tracks and sidings of the Pennsylvania Railroad is undoubtedly dangerous, as all such crossings are; but it is not <em>per se </em>illegal. The subject of grade crossings is one that appeals strongly to the sound discretion of the court of Quarter Sessions, and where it is reasonably practicable to avoid such crossings the court should insist upon its being done.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">There is no merit in the 5th and 9th specifications inclusive. The notice required by law appears to have been given. Personal notice is not reouired. It might be well to require per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>sonal notice to be given to parties over whose land a proposed road passes, but as yet the legislature has not seen fit to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The 10th specification assumes as a fact that there are improvements along the line of the proposed road. There is nothing on the record to show that there are any; and if there were, the objection comes too late after final confirmation of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The 11th specification is substantially the same as the first, which has already been disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The 12th specification is without merit, The viewers reported that, \u201c after due- consideration and diligent inquiry, as to necessity for said road, they are of opinion the prayer of the petitioners should be granted, for the reasons set forth in their petition,\u201d and they have \u201ctherefore located and distinctly marked on the ground and do recommend for public use the following described road,\u201d &amp;c. This is substantially finding and reporting that the road petitioned for is necessary for a public road.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The 13tli, 14th, and 15th specifications are substantially the same as the 2d, 3d and 4th, which have been sufficiently noticed already.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The 16th specification is covered by the 6th, and 7th, and requires no further notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">The 17th specification is without merit. The Act of February 24th, 1873, relating to the office of surveyor and civil engineer for the county of Allegheny, provides that the county surveyor \u201cshall, either in person or by deputy, act as artist in all road and bridge views.\u201d The report shows that the county surveyor\u2019s deputy did represent him as artist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">There appears to be no error in the record that vitiates the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Proceedings affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
