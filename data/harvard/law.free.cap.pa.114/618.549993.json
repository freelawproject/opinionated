A. Schumacher died in Butler county in 1858, leaving a widow and three minor children. The widow administered and took out letters in Butler county. The deceased owned a tract of land in Allegheny county. The widow presented a petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county, December 15th, 1860, setting forth the above facts, and that the said \u201creal estate is subject to the lien of debts due by said decedent and not of record, and that it is for the best interest and advantages of those interested therein that the same should be mortgaged for the purpose of raising a sufficient amount of money to pajr off and discharge the debts due by the estate of said decedent,\"\u2019 and praying the court for authority to mortgage the same for seven hundred dollars. The same .day the court appointed a guardian, <em>ad </em>litem, for the minor children, and issued a citation upon him to answer within ten days. The same day the guardian answered that it was for the best interest of all concerned that the property should be mortgaged to. raise that sum, and made affidavit that there were' lien of debts not of record which required that sum of money. The same day the court made an order'\u201cthat the said Julia C. Schumacher (the widow), have authority to execute her bond with a mortgage to secure the same on the'\"'real estate mentioned and described in the said petition, in manner and amount as prayed for in said petition, and that the money raised on said mortgage be applied according to law in discharge of such debts as -may be liens on said real estate, and the remainder of said money, if any, she shall hold subject to the future order of this court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-5\">The widow was required to give bond with sureties in the sum of -S1,500, which she did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-6\">The \u201cliens not of record\u201d were not described in any manner; there was no schedule of debts, and no order of the court of Butler county on the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-7\">Two days later, December 17th, 1860, the mortgage was executed and acknowledged in open court. On the face of it, and as signed and acknowledged, it appears to be the individual mortgage of Julia Caroline Schumacher. The only thing to indicate otherwise is this clause inserted after the recital of title: \u201cAnd this mortgage being made and executed by virtue of an order and decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county, aforesaid, duly made and entered on the 15th day of December, 1860, on the petition of said Julia Caroline Schumacher, as will more fully appear b.y the proceedings of said court as recorded at number of October Term, A. D. 1860.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-8\">A <em>seire facias </em>was issued on the mortgage in 1866, served upon Julia C. Jones, (she was then married to W. H. Jones,). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>judgment obtained, and the property sold to Joseph Logan, from whom the defendants derive title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A960\">The question of law arising upon these facts are : 1st, had the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county jurisdiction to decree the mortgaging of the premises; 2d, were the proceedings regular and the mortgage valid as against the children of Wm. A. Schumacher?\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-5\">The proceedings were intended to be under the Act of 18th April, 1853, (Price Act,) and it is contended by the defendants, that under that Act no schedule of debts was required, nor any order from the court of Butler county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-6\">The clause in the Act of 18th April, 1853, relied upon to sustain the proceedings, is the clause in the 2d section, which enumerates the eases in which a decree for sale or mortgage may be made, and is in these words : \u201cWhenever a decedent\u2019s real estate is subject to the lien of debts not of record.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-7\">Wlnit that clause means, or for what purpose inserted, is difficult to determine. ' Before the passage of that Act all the debts of a decedent, whether of record or not, were liens upon his real estate, and under the Act of 29th March, 1832, the Orphans\u2019 Court had ample power to authorize the sale or mortgaging of the real estate for their payment. It was probably intended for some peculiar cases not embraced in the Act of 1832. It certainly was not intended to be a substitute for the Act of 1832, and to repeal all the wise restrictions and limitations of that Act. The two Acts being, <em>pari </em>materia, at least, so far as this case is concerned, they should be construed to harmonize with each other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-8\">The Act of 1832 authorized the Orphans\u2019 Court having jurisdiction of the accounts of an executor or administrator, to decree a sale or mortgage of the real estate in that county, and where the real estate was situate in another county to make a decree authorizing the executor or administrator \u201c-to raise so much money as the said court may think necessary from real estate situated in such county,\u201d upon which the court of that county on proper application could order a sale or mortgage. And \u201csection 33 \u201d saj-s: \u201cNo authority for the sale or mortgage of real estate, lying in the same or another county, should be granted until the executor, administrator, &amp;c., shall have exhibited to the said court \u201d a schedule of the real and personal estate, and a sworn statement of the debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-9\">None of these requirements were complied with in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-10\">Even if the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county had jurisdiction, it is doubtful whether the decree or mortgage was in proper form to bind anything more than the widow\u2019s interest in the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-11\">If the case were sent back for a new trial and a verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>given for defendants, the same question would arise as now. As the case will have to go to the Supreme Court in any event, it may as well go up in the present form as any other, and save further trouble and expense to the losing party. Therefore a new trial is refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-4\">During the trial the defendants made the following offer of testimony:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-5\">Defendants\u2019 counsel offers the record at No. 90, October T., 1860, Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county, in the estate of Wm.

First, because it does not appear anyr where in these proceedings that any application was made by Julia Caroline Schumacher, the administratrix of Wm. A. Schumacher, a resident of Butler county, and in which county she appears to have been appointed administratrix, to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Butler county, or any order made by said court permitting the raising of money by a mortgage upon the real estate in dispute or for any purpose whatever, that the application for the mortgaging of the property in dispute in the county of Allegheny, in the first instance without the sanction or authority of the court of the domicile, to wit, the court of Butler county, renders the proceedings and mortgage given thereunder without validity, and makes the action of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county by reason thereof null and void. Second, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county had no jurisdiction of the administratrix, and could acquire none, either under the Act of 1832 or 1853, to order the mortgaging of the said premises under said application, or for any other reason; that the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county had no authority to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>of the heirs of Wm. A. Schumacher, deceased, for the purpose of ratifying or acquiescing in the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county in making such order and decree, which should be done under the law by the appointment of guardians who should give bond to t.he Orphans\u2019 Court of Butler or Allegheny county for such purpose; and third, as incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-7\">Objection overruled, exception and bill sealed.

The questions of law can better be heard and. decided by the court <em>in lane. </em>The point is affirmed and leave granted for plaintiffs to file motion for new trial. (First assignment of error.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-12\">In the general charge the court instructed the jury that their verdict should be for the defendants.

Hence the action of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county, in authorizing the mortgaging' of said premises, was irregular and void for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-15\">The jurisdiction of any court, exercising authority over a subject, may be inquired into in every other court, when the proceedings of the former are relied on and brought' before the latter by a party claiming the benefit of such proceedings: Elliott <em>et al. v. </em>The Lessee of Piersol <em>et al., </em>1 Peters, 328; Thompson <em>v. </em>Tolme <em>et al., </em>2 Peters, 167; Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Leland <em>et al., </em>Id., 62.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-16\">No court, however great may be its dignity, can arrogate' to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>itself the power of disposing of real estate without the forms of law. It must obtain jurisdiction of the thing in a legal mode. A decree without notice would be treated as a nullity. And so must a sale of land be treated which has been made without an order or decree of court, though it may have ratified tbe sale: Shriver <em>et al. v. </em>Lynch <em>et al., </em>2 How., 66; Pittsburgh <em>v. </em>Walter, 19 P.

The administratrix, December 15th, 1860, presented her petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county, representing that her letters were granted by the Register of Butler county; that the decedent died intestate, leaving a widow and three minor children who had no guardian ; that he owned a tract of land in Allegheny county, and \u201c that the said real estate is subject to the lien of debts due by said decedent, and not of record, and that it is for the best interest \u00e1nd advantage of those interested therein that the same should be mortgaged for the purpose of raising a sufficient amount of money to pay off and discharge the debts due by the estate of said decedent.\u201d On the same day the court appointed a guardian . <em>ad </em>litem, who immediately answered; whereupon, the same day, the court granted the petition and decreed, among other things, \u201c that the money raised on said mortgage be applied according to law to the discharge of such debts as may be liens on said real estate, and the remainder, if any, she hold subject to the further order of this court.\u201d And approved bond in $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The petition stated nothing as to the amount of debts, nor that the personal estate was insufficient to pay them, but it prayed a decree authorizing a mortgage for $700. She got that money, in due time the land was sold in satisfaction of the mortgage, and, after its payment, she received of the proceeds of sale $2,726. If the real object was to divest the minor children of their patrimonj\u2019-, no better way could have .been devised, provided the court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">It is so plain that the proceeding and decree were unauthorized by the Act of 1832, which provides for sale or mortgage of real estate by an administrator for payment of the debts of a decedent, and also prescribes the mode of procedure, that the defendants deny that said Act has anything to do with the case, and claim that the Orphans' Court of Allegheny county had jurisdiction under the \u201c Act relating to the sale and conveyance of real estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The Act of 1853 declares that nothing therein contained shall be taken to repeal or impair the authority of any other Act of Assembly, authorizing the sale of real estate by decree of court or otherwise. Its chief object is to extend the power to sell real estate, and to avoid special legislation by enabling the courts -to adjudicate matters relative to such sales after a full hearing of all parties; not to supersede the wholesome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>statutory regulations, which had been already provided, for the sale or mortgage of real estate of decedents, or of minors, by administrators or guardians. The Act of 1853 contains no provision authorizing the court to decree the sale of the real estate of a decedent for the payment of his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In Price on Act relating to sales of real estate, p. 97, it is said that sales may be made, \u201cwhenever a decedent\u2019s real estate is subject to the lien of debts not of record; that is, during the five vears after his decease, for which time all his real estate is subject to the lieu of all his debts; and theoretically so subject, though no debts be known to exist.\u201d The learned author did not conceive that, under that clause, the court could decree a sale for any purpose other than the discharge of the particular lien. - The intent is obvious. Within five years after a decedent\u2019s death, the parties interested in his real estate may wish to sell or mortgage, discharged of all liens, and by virtue of this provision the court may decree the sale, and, thereafter, the debts will continue a lien on the money in place of the land. All the owners may be able to contract and convey within said period, but the land is subject to the lien of all debts of the decedent, and, to give the purchaser the land discharged from such lien, the decree is necessary. As respects this point, the case would be precisely the same were some of the owners minors, or, for other cause, unable to convey. At first the Act provided that, in all cases within its provisions, sales could be decreed discharging all liens; but, after some experience and observation, the supplement of March 3d, 1867, was enacted, providing that private sales, made by order of court, shall discharge the premises sold from the lien of debts of the decedent, except debts of record and debts secured by mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The defendants contend that under the Act of 1853, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny couidy had power to decree the sale of the decedent\u2019s real estate, which was subject to the lien of debts not of record, and that the title is unprejudiced by any error in the proceedings of the court. This cannot be denied, if the petition sets forth a case within the purview of the Act. But the petition affirmatively shows a case within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court of the county of Butler. The prayer is based on indebtedness of the estate. No other reason is given for the sale, or why money should be raised. The petition, though fatally defective under the Act of 1832, is for leave to mortgage the real estate of the decedent for the purpose of paying his debts, and for nothing else. .True, it was stated that it would be for the best advantage of those interested in the land, that the same should be mortgaged for the purpose of raising sufficient money to pay off and discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the debts, but that is no reason for any'decree, except that money be raised to pay said debts either by sale or mortgage. The fact that the debts were not of record, does not change the nature of the petition. Had it stated that the debts were of record, its purpose to provide for their payment would have been no more clearly expressed. Upon proper application under the Act of 1853, the court may decree a public or private sale of land, and a public sale will discharge the lien of the decedent\u2019s debts of record, and not of record, but it has no power, under this Act,-to make a decree upon a petition by the administrator, merely to provide for the payment of the debts of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">To sustain the proceeding the defendants refer to Hoover\u2019s Appeal, 55 Pa. St., 337, where it wiis said that the petition sets forth sufficient ground for a decree of sale. There, the petition stated that the real estate of the decedent was subject to the lien of a judgment, and other debts not of record; that all the heirs, except one, had agreed with a purchaser for the sale of said real estate; that it would be greatly to the interest and advantage of all concerned, and asked a rule on the heir who refused to agree, to appear and show cause why the sale should not be confirmed. The petition was by the administrator, but it was in the interest of the heirs who had agreed to sell, and who could not convey the land discharged of the lien', without the decree. It was not an administrator\u2019s petition for an order to sell r\u00e9al estate for payment of the debts of a decedent. Had the sale been decreed, the money would have been substituted in place of the land, and the administrator would have had no right to use a dollar of it, without first obtaining a decree made on application in substantial compliance with the Act of 1832. The land having, been converted, it would only be necessary to show insufficiency of personal estate, in the proper mode, to obtain a decree by the court having jurisdiction of the accounts of the administrator, authorizing him to use so much of the money as necessary for payment of the decedent\u2019s debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county had no power to decree that the money raised by the mortgage should be applied to the payment of the debts that were liens on the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">It was solely within the province of the court that had jurisdiction of the accounts of the administratrix, to determine whether any money should be raised by sale or mortgage of real estate, by the administratrix. No other court could consider that question. The Act of 1853, declares that the mortgage money shall in all respects be substituted for the real estate mortgaged, as regards the enjoyment and ownership thereof, after the payment of liens, and shall be held for the use of the same persons, and for the'same estate and interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>as the real estate mortgaged had been held. Had the mortgage been valid, none of the money could have been lawfully applied to payment of liens, save upon the decree of the proper court. That decree could not have been made without application showing that the personal assets were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The defect of want of jurisdiction to make the decree lies at the foundation of the title set up by the defendants, of which they were bound to take notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
