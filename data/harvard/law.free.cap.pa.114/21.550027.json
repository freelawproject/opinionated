If a fee simple, then the devise to her brothers and sisters in her will vests an absolute estate in them ; if only a life estate, they take nothing by her will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-15\">The plaintiff claims that the rule in Shelley\u2019s case applies, to \u2022 the devise by Isaac Thompson to his widow: He directs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201cthat the small house on lot 31, corner of Allegheny and Montgomery streets, in the borough of Hollidaysburg, now being built, shall be finished as soon as possible, and that his wife Nancy shall enjoy the rents an'd profits of said lot and all the buildings thereon erected, during her natural life, and after her death the same shall go to her heirs absolutely.\u201d The limitation being to her and her heirs general without limitation, strictly brings the estate within the definition of an estate in fee \u2022, there is no devise over in default of heirs, thus leaving it a fee in Nancy Thompson. It was a devise for life to her, and then to descend to her heirs absolutely, which creates a fee, and a purchaser from her would be bound to accept a deed from her and pay the purchase money: Steiner <em>v. </em>Kolb, 7 P. F. Smith, 124 ; Quillman <em>v. </em>Custer, Id., 125.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">This construction does no violence to the intention of the testator, as is obvious from the whole will. He provides fully for his collateral kindred, and directs that in case the buildings on the lot devised to his wife should be destroyed, then she has full power to sell and convey it, and can appropriate the proceeds to her own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">We are of the opinion that Nancy Thompson took an estate in fee simple under the devise from her husband, and her will vested the title fully in her devisees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-8\">The next question is, did the Orphans\u2019 Court have jurisdiction to partition this estate?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-9\">It is alleged in the argument that by the will of Nancy Thompson the course of descent under the intestate laws was changed, therefore the Common Pleas alone could partition it among the devisees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-10\">We do not think the coui-se of descent was changed by the will; all the devisees would have taken without a will, but not quite so much; two out of eight were excluded; the course of descent was not changed by this exclusion ; she merely limited the number of the takers to less than would have enjoyed the estate under the intestate laws. In our understanding of the words of the Act, the course of descent would be changed only when a will gave the estate to strangers, or to those who would have taken nothing under the intestate laws; the course of descent is not changed when devisees under a will take more or less than they would have taken without a will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-11\">.Judgment is therefore entered for plaintiff for sum of $5,800; he to perfect his recognizance as already decreed, and file for use of defendant a proper deed for the land in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-12\">The defendant thereupon took this writ and filed the following assignments of error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-13\">1. The Court erred in deciding that Nancy Thompson took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>an..estate in fee simple to the premises, under the will of her husband, Isaac Thompson. 2. The Court erred in deciding that a title in fee simple to the lot vested in the devisees of Nancy Thompson under her will. 3. The Court erred in deciding that the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction in proceedings in partition of the premises among the devisees of Nancy Thompson. 4.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>only difference is, (there being eight brothers and sisters) the quantitj\u2019- of estate is changed, limiting her devises to six instead of eight. As the Court expresses it, \u201cmerely limiting the number of takers to less than would have enjoyed the estate under the intestate laws.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AqY\">October 4th, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b43-6\">Mr. Justice Trunkey</author>\n<p id=\"A0\">delivered the opinion of the Court,</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Isaac Thompson devised the rents and profits of the land described in the case stated, to his wife during her life, and at her death to her heirs. The learned judge of the Common Pleas'rightly decided that under the operation of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, Nancy Thompson took an estate in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The rule, operates to give the ancestor an estate for life in the first instance, and by force of the devise to his heirs the inheritance also, by conferring the inheritance on him as the stock from which alone they can inherit: Hileman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, 13 Pa. St., 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Other clauses of the will fail to show an intent different fora the meaning of the words of the devise. That the devisees might sell the land and use the proceeds in case of destruction of the building, is not enough to show the testator\u2019s intent to give a mere life estate to her, in absence of such destruction. It is obvious that one object of the testator in making a will was, to vest in her a larger estate than she could take under the intestate laws. He was childless. He made provision that in case a child should be born to them the will should be null and void. The contingency did not happen. Surely such a provision does not evidence that his words which pass a fee simple, were intended only to pass a life estate to his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">The next inquiry is, had the Orphans\u2019 Court jurisdiction of the proceeding in partition? The plaintiff contends that such jurisdiction was conferred by the Act of April 13th, 1840, P. L., 320, which includes all cases of testacy \u201c where the course of descent is not altered by the provisions of the last will and testament of the decedent.\u201d It is not alleged that any other statute gives that court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">The testatrix had eight brothers and sisters and she devised the land to six. Under the intestate law each of the heirs would be entitled to one eighth of the land; under the will each devisee is entitled to one sixth. A few elementary principles dispose of the question. Purchase includes every other method of coming to an estate; but merely that by inheritance. If the ancestor devises his estate to his heir at law by will, with other limitations, or in any other shape than the course of descent would direct, such heir shall take by purchase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>But if a man, seized in fee, devises bis whole estate to his heir at law, so that the heir takes neither a greater nor a less estate by the devise than he would have done without it, he shall be adjudged to take by descent. Even this rule, in England, was long ago abrogated bj a statute which enacts that an heir to whom land is devised by his ancestor, shall take as devisee, and not by descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The principal difference, in effect between the acquisition of an estate by descent and by purchase, consists in two points : 1. By purchase the estate acquires a new inheritable quality, and is descendible to the owner\u2019s blood in general, and not the blood only of some particular ancestor; and 2. An estate taken by purchase will not make the heir answerable for the acts of the ancestor, as an estate by descent will. And the intestate law of Pennsylvania, which differs from the common law in many particulars, provides \u201c that no person who is not of the blood of the ancestors or other relations from whom any real estate descended, or by whom it was given or devised to the intestate, shall in any of the cases before mentioned take any estate of inheritance therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">It is impossible for the six children to take the whole of the estate except by virtue of the devise. Necessarily they hold the estate by purchase, and it acquires a new inheritable quality. The course of descent was broken, altered. Had the devise been made to strangers they would have taken as purchasers. The six heirs hold precisely in the same way, for their title is the will. And the effect on the legal course of descent is the same as if the devise were to strangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Soon after the enactment of April 13th, 1840, Gibson, G. J., remarked of the provision relative to cases where the descent had not been altered, that it \u201cwas, perhaps, superfluous; for wherever exactly the same interest passes by the law that would pass by the will, the devisee takes by descent, and the testator may be said, in language strictly technical, to have died intestate as to the particular land: \u201d Selfridge\u2019s Appeal, 9 W. &amp; S., 55. In Waln\u2019s Appeal, 4 Pa. St., 502, the same justice spoke of this provision as unnecessary and amounting to nothing. These dicta, contemporaneous with the enactment of the statute, though not authority, show how quickly the great jurist saw that no devise could be made of an estate different from that which would descend to the heir, without altering the course of descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The judgment must be reversed for the reason that the Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction of the proceeding for partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Judgment reversed, and now judgment is entered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
