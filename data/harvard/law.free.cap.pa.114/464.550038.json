K. Stayton to the use of W. W. Martin, now to the use of George S. Bryan, .against W. H. H. Riddle, Alexander Mitchell, J. C. Vanderlin and Margaret Vanderlin, his wife, terre tenants, who defended as to so much of the mortgage as was usurious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-11\">The following ar.e the facts as they appeared on the trial before Hazen, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-12\">Dr. Samuel Graham was the owner of several pieces of property in Butler and its vicinity, upon which he gave a mortgage to E. R. Stayton for $7,000, upon the 23d day of February, 1876. The mortgage, on the 24th of February, 1876, was assigned by Stayton to W. W. Martin, and by Martin to George S. Bryan. The mortgage and assignments were duly recorded. Among the other properties upon which the mortgage was a lien was a house upon Jefferson street, in Butler, in which Dr. Graham and his family resided. The mortgage was the first lien upon the properties described in it, but after the date of its record a number of judgments wei'e entered against Dr. Graham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-13\">Upon one or more of these judgments the properties mortgaged were about to be sold by the sheriff, subject to the mortgage, and Dr. Graham, anxious to save the home property, that on Jefferson street,, went to W. H. H. Riddle, one of the defendants, for the purpose of arranging it, if possible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-14\">The mortgage contained $1050, of usurious interest. Riddle alleged, and introduced evidence to sustain the allegation, that Dr. Graham agreed with him that if he would purchase the property at sheriff\u2019s sale, he would defend in a <em>scire facias </em>on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the mortgage against this usury for the benefit of Riddle. This Dr. Graham denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">Riddle purchased the property at sheriff\u2019s sale shbject to said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-7\">After the sheriff\u2019s sale this writ of <em>scire facias </em>was issued to collect the balance due on the Stayton mortgage. A defence thereto was put in by the defendants, Mr. Riddle and those claiming under him, as to usury, Dr. Graham not joining therein. This, was the action tried in the court below from which this writ of error is taken. As to that part of the mortgage not alleged to be usury; judgment was taken by plaintiff under rules of court. \u25a0 Some time after the <em>scire facias </em>was issued, Dr. Graham appeared and confessed judgment, in favor of plaintiff for $1,676.07, which was the amount of usiuy claimed by Riddle et. ah, to be included in the mortgage,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">'Before the trial of the case below, a decree had been entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Butler county, sitting in equity, concerning the subject matter of the defence in this case. Riddle filed a bill in equity against Dr. Graham and E. R. Stayton for use of W. W. Martin now for use of George S. Bryan, setting up the facts as alleged by him. as a defence in the trial of this case below, and praying that the judgment confessed by Dr. Graham for $1,676.07 be set aside and vacated; that Riddle be permitted to defend against the <em>scire facias sur </em>mortgage to the amount of the usury and illegal interest therein ; that Stayton, for use of Martin, now for use of Bryan,' plaintiff in said <em>scire </em>facias, be restrained from having any other or greater judgment therein, and for such other and further relief in the premises as to the court may seem proper. To this bill Dr. Graham and Bryan made answer denying the agreement setup by Riddle that Graham had agreed to defend the mortgage for.Riddle\u2019s benefit as to usury. The issue having been joined, a Master was appointed before whom the testimony was taken. The Master recommended a decree dismissing the bill, to which Riddle filed exceptions. The court, upon argument, confirmed the Master's report and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s bill without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s rights at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\">The plaintiff presented, <em>inter </em>alia, the following points:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-10\">1. Dr. Samuel Graham, the mortgagor in. the mortgage sued upon in this case and' the original debtor, having confessed judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount in dispute, and not being a party to this issue being tried, the defence raised by the defendants being that of usury contained in the mortgage, the verdict of the jury must be in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants, they being terre-temints, who became so by virtue of the sheriff's sale of the property mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>gaged, the purchase by them or by Mr. Riddle, under whom they claim having been made subject to the lieu of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">Answer. As a proposition of law in the light of the facts in this case, we refuse this.. We don\u2019t know of any facts -that would sustain it or make it applicable to this easel (Eighth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">2. If the facts in the case are as contended by the defendants, that Dr. Graham agreed with Riddle by parol before the sheriff\u2019s sale made to Riddle that he (Graham) would defend the mortgage' as to the usury contained in it, and that notwithstanding that agreement Graham has confessed judgment for the usury contained in the mortgage in favor of the plaintiff, and is not defending this suit, to enable the defendants in their own proper persons to interpose this defence against the plaintiff\u2019s claim, they must have shown such facts as would entitle them to a decree for the specific performance against Graham in a suit brought by them against him to enforce the agreement made between Graham and Riddle. This they have not shown, and their defence, being an equitable one, is not available- in this action, and the verdict should therefore be in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\">Answer. As a whole we refuse this. It assumes, in order to make it a proposition, conclusions that are solely for the jury. .(Ninth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-9\">\u25a03. The evidence shows that the agreement between Riddle and Graham, under which Graham was to defend upon account of usury, was a fraud upon the judgment creditors of Dr. Graham, whose liens followed the lien of the Stayton mortgage, and the defendants are not permitted to take advantage of this fraud. The verdict of the jury must therefore be in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-10\">Answer. Refused. (Tenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-11\">4. Dr. Graham\u2019s agreement with Mr. Riddle to defend as to the usuiyy contained in the mortgage, and his subsequent refusal so to do, does not enable the defendants to defend upon their own account. If Riddle, or other of the defendants claiming under him, is prejudiced by such refusal, an action may lie upon his or their behalf against Dr. Graham for breach of his agreement; and in such action alone can the defendants recover the damages sustained on account of such refusal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-12\">Answer. Refused. (Eleventh assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-13\">5. The decree of the court in the ease of W. H. H. Riddle <em>v. </em>Samuel Graham et al., Equity No. 3 of March Term, 1881, concludes the defence in this case set up under Graham\u2019s contract to put in defence of usury. The verdict must therefore be in favor .of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Answer. Refused. (Twelfth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-6\">6. Under all the evidence the verdict must be in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-7\">Answer. Refused. (Thirteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-8\">The defendant presented the following points:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-9\">1. If the jury find that Dr. S. Graham, mortgagor, before the sheriff\u2019s sale informed Mr. Riddle that the mortgage contained $1,050 usury, and that if he (Riddle) would purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale, he (Graham) would defend against the usury for the benefit of Mr. Riddle, and Riddle agreed to do, and did in good faith, relying upon this arrangement, purchase at the sale, gauging his bid accordingly, he is entitled in the <em>sei. fa. </em>to set up the amount of said usury as a defence <em>fro tanto </em>against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-10\">Answer. Affirmed. (Fifteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-11\">2. If the jury find the facts set out in point No. 1, and that all the mortgage except the usury is embraced in the judgment taken April 24tli, 1879, the verdict should be in favor of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-12\">Answer. Affirmed. [Sixteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-13\">3. If the jury find the arrangement was made before the sale, as claimed by the defendants, they can defend as effectively'as Dr. Graham could; his right to make such defence would be by such agreement transferred to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-14\">Answer. Affirmed. (Seventeenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-15\">4. If the jury' find Dr. Graham received only' $5,950, and gave his mortgage for $7,000, with intereest from date, there is no consideration for the $1,050 not received by'Dr. Graham, and the defendants can defend to that extent in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-16\">Answer. Affirmed. (Eighteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-17\">5. If the jury' find that after the purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale, and after the agreement in evidence was made, and after the defendants had become parties to the <em>sei. fa., </em>Dr. Graham appeared voluntarily and confessed judgment for a sum, including the usury he had agreed to defend if the purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale was made, and this was done with the knowledge of the plaintiff, such judgment is collusive, and not binding on \u2019the defendants in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-18\">Answer.

(Nineteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-19\">Verdict for.the plaintiff in the sum $219.99, being the amount due on the mortgage, less the usurious interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-20\">Judgment was entered on the verdict, whereupon the plaintiff took this writ, assigning for error, <em>inter alia, </em>the answer of the court to the points of the plaintiff and of the defendants, as shown above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-21\"><em>C.

Since the passage of the Act above, referred to, it is not unlawful for a debtor to pay, or a creditor to receive more than six per cent, interest. When done in good faith and in the usual course of business other creditors of the debtor have no reason to complain. Nor have they .any right to interfere in any case except where, under the guise of usury, there has been a collusive scheme between tlie debtor and his creditor to cheat and defraud other creditors of the former; and the mere fact that the debtor has paid or agreed to pay more than six per cent, interest is no evidence in such collusion. Those who allege that usury is a fraud upon them must do more than show the payment of interest in excess of the legal rate. That is a matter of which the debtor alone can complain: Second National Bank of Titusville\u2019s Appeal, 85 Pa. St., 528; Wheelock <em>v. </em>Wood, 93 Id., 298; Lening\u2019s Appeal, Id., 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">It is contended, however, that when Riddle, one of the <em>terre tenants, </em>purchased the property at sheriff\u2019s sale subject to the mortgage, Dr. Graham, the mortgagor, for a good and valuable consideration, agreed to defend against the mortgage to,the extent of the usurious excess; notwithstanding he subsequently refused to do so, the <em>terre tenants, </em>as <em>quasi </em>assignees of the right given by the statute to the debtor himself, might for him and in his name make the defence. This position is more plausible than sound. To permit the <em>terre tenants </em>to thus interpose the defence of usury, without the consent and against the will of the debtor, would be tantamount to decreeing specific performance of his agreement to defend against the usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The substance of Dr. Graham\u2019s agreement with Riddle was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>to assert the personal right given him by the statute, and thus reduce <em>pro tanto </em>the incumbrance, subject to which the defendants in error took the mortgaged premises. He not only refused to do so, but he subsequently went into court and confessed judgment for the full amount claimed by the mortgagee. Would a chancellor enforce specific execution of such a contract? If he would, it may be conceded that our courts of Common Pleas, invested as they are with equity powers, would permit a. defeuce, in an action at law, the result of which would be practically the same ; in other words, administer equitable relief in a common law form of action. But we have no doubt a chancellor, with a bill for specific performance of such a contract before him, would dismiss it, not only because there is a full and adequate remedy at law, but, for the further reason that contracts relating, to personal chattels, stocks, securities, &amp;c., are not enforceable specifically in equity. To this general rule there are but few exceptions, some of which are noted in McGowin <em>v. </em>Remmington, 12 Pa. St., 56, 61. Moreover, the evident purpose sought to be accomplished by the contract, and its effect upon other bidders at the sheriff\u2019s sale, as well as creditors of the mortgagor, were not such as to commend it to the special favor of a chancellor. But, aside from every other consideration, it is sufficient to say, that if the contract in question is worth anything, the defendant Riddle has an adequate remedy at law by an action on the contract for the alleged breach thereof; and, hence, he cannot be permitted to pursue a line of defence that would be tantamount, in its results, to a decree of specific performance against Dr. Graham, the mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The view thus taken of the main question renders it unnecessary to notice other specifications of error, presenting questions which might otherwise, become important.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
