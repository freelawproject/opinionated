The following principles of allowance will be applied in the taxation of costs in prize cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-29\">1. No specific tariff of fees having been appointed to the suits by statute, the costs fixed by'statute for similar services in admiralty will be allowed in tbis court, except as otherwise directed by acts posterior to the fee-bill of February 26, 1833.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-30\">2. The compensation directed to be made by the act of March 25, 1862, to the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>therein named, will be computed and adjusted, as nearly as may be, conformably to allowances by the laws of the United States to employes for like services under the government, or in accordance with established rules and usages of the courts in regard to their officers rendering like services. In \u25a0cases of doubt or difficulty, evidence may be taken on the question of quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-3\">3. The gross costs taxed to any of the \u25a0officers of court for services in prize eases will be, in collection or payment, subject to \u25a0all limitations, as to amounts or periods of payment, under the acts of congress in force :at the time of such taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">4. The method of ascertaining the compensation of any of the officers of court for their services in prize suits, by a percentage on the value of the property coming officially into their possession or under their charge, will not be adopted by the court without \u2022express authority of law, or the assent thereto, in writing, by the parties whose interests \u2022are to be affected thereby.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"ApVq\"> [Reported by Samuel Blatchford, Esq. ]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
