Both vessels had been going eastward through the night, the brig in the rear but gaining on the schooner, and both were on the starboard tack. The night was dark and rainy, and about 4 A. M. the Jerry Fowler undertook to tack, her master thinking her so near the Cutterhunk Shoals as to render it proper to change her course; and while tacking she was run into by the Morning Light. The libellant, having paid the loss to the owners of the schooner, now sues to recover it back. The testimony as to the darkness was conflicting.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-33\"> [Affirmed by circuit court in Alliance Ins.
