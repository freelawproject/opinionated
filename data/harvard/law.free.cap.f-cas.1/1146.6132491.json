Libel by Robert Armstrong-against the brig Rydesdale for seaman\u2019s-wages. The agent of the brig moves to dismiss the libel for want of jurisdiction. Denied.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1194-12\">The libel alleged that the vessel was an American vessel, and that the libellant served on board from July 25 to Dec. 6, when he was discharged, leaving $32 wages-due and unpaid, but it did not say where he-was discharged, nor that he was an American seaman. On that libel, process of attachment issued against the vessel. An application was made, on the affidavit of a person representing himself to be an agent and' consignee of the vessel, that she was not an-American, but a British, vessel, that the-court dismiss the libel, as out of its jurisdiction, and also because the libellant gave no stipulation for costs before instituting the-suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1194-13\">Mr. Hart, for libellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1194-14\">Judge Beebe, for claimant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1194-15\">BETTS, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Av8\">The motion cannot prevail for either of those causes. The-affidavit of the agent does not countervail or displace the oath of the libellant, that the vessel is an American vessel. The jurisdiction of the court does not depend upon the-nationality of the vessel. The court may, in its discretion, take cognizance of such, suits brought by foreign seamen against foreign masters or owners, and under urgent circumstances, against the foreign vessel itself, if the service has terminated or the-contract does not stipulate that it shall not be enforced within a foreign jurisdiction. The proceeding might have been disregarded by the libellant because the notice of motion was not given in the name of any proctor of the court, and because no claimant is before the court. But on the papers,, and on the concession of the libellant\u2019s counsel, that he is a foreigner, there is prima facie reason for an order that he file security-for costs, or show cause why he should be-excused from so doing. Order accordingly..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
