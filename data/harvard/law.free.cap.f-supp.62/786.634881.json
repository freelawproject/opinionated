Plaintiff had enlisted service from May 15, 1918, to August 25, 1918. He was a commissioned officer in the Army from August 26, 1918, to October 30, 1919. On July 1, 1920, plaintiff was appointed a second lieutenant, Infantry, Regular Army, and he accepted the commission October 5, 1920. He was promoted to a first lieutenant, dating from July 1, 1920. He was promoted to captain October ,1, 1934, and to major July 1, 1940. Plaintiff had continuous active commissioned service \u25a0 from. August 26, 1918, to October 30, 1919, and from October' 5, 1920, to November 30, 1941.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-18\"><em>2.i </em>Plaintiff received the following letter of October 2, 1941, from The Adjutant General:</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-19\">\u201cThe Secretary of War directs that Major James C. White, Infantry, now on leave of absence in Washington, D. C., report to The Adjutant General, Room 1522, Munitions Building, at 9:00 A. M., October 9, 1941 on temporary duty for the purpose of appearing before a board of general officers convened under the provisions of Public Law 190, 77th Congress, and upon completion of this temporary duty he will revert to a leave status.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-20\">3. October 9, 1941, plaintiff appeared before the Board of General Officers appointed under authority of Joint Resolution of July 29, 1941, 55 Stat. 606, 10 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 571 note, and the board at that time conducted a hearing pursuant to the provisions of this statute. At the hearing plaintiff resisted retirement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-21\">The Adjutant General sent plaintiff the following communication on November 12, 1941:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-22\">\u201c1. The Board of General Officers appointed under authority of Public Law No. 190, 77th Congress, has recommended your removal from the active list of the Regular Army.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-23\">\u201c2. By par. 1, S. O. 262, W. D. 1941, you were granted leave of absence for 23 days effective on or about November 10, 1941, and it is contemplated issuing your retirement order this month effective November 30, 1941.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-24\">\u2018\u25a0\u20183. It is desired that this letter be acknowledged giving address to which you desire your retirement order to be sent when issued. In this connection attention is invited to the fact that a retirement order received while on leave of absence at a place other than the last station allows mileage from the place of receipt of the order by the officer to the designated home1 only and never for a distance greater than from the last station to home selected. (Par. 1, AR 35-4840, W. D., December 15, 1924).</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b834-25\">\u201cBy order of the Secretary of War.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b834-26\">The Secretary of War issued the following order November 27, 1941:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>\u201cThe action of the Board Of General Officers convened under the provisions of Section 2 of the Act of Congress approved July 29, 1941, recommending that Major James C.

At that time and since July 1, 1940, plaintiff held the rank of major in the Regular Army and was receiving the active-duty pay of the fourth-pay period provided by law for an officer with more than 14 years\u2019 service and less than 23 years\u2019 service. When plaintiff was removed from the active list he had less than 23 years of continuous service as a commissioned officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Plaintiff relies upon the provisions of section 2 of the act of June 13, 1940, 54 Stat. 379, 380, amending Sec. 3, act of July 31, 1935, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552a, and contends that under those provisions, which he insists were applicable even though he was removed under the act of July 29, 1941, he was and is entitled to receive as retired pay three-fourths of the active duty pay of a lieutenant colonel. This act of 1940 repealed section 2 of the act of July 31, 1935, entitled \u201cAn Act To promote the efficiency of national defense,\u201d and amended sections 3 and 5 of such act which provided for a promotion list of commissioned officers and made provisions for their promotion and also for their retirement on their own application after a certain specified number of years of service. 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 971b. Section 24b, hereinafter referred to, as amended by the National Defense Act of June 4, 1920, 41 Stat. 773, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 571, was in effect in 1935 and provided for removal from the active list and involuntary retirement of commissioned officers placed in Class B by a Board established by the President. Sections 3 and 5 of the act of July 31, 1935, supra, as amended by sections 2 and 3 of the act of June 13, 1940, supra, relied upon by plaintiff, provided, so far as material, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">\u201cSec. <em>2. * * *.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">\u201cThe number of promotion-list officers that shall be in the respective grades at any time after the effective date of this Act shall be such as results from the operation of the promotion system hereinafter in this section prescribed. Promotion-list second lieutenants and first lieutenants shall be promoted to the respective grades of first lieutenant and captain immediately upon completing respectively three years\u2019 and ten years\u2019 continuous commissioned service in the Regular Army, but not otherwise. Except as hereinafter provided promotion-list captains, majors, and lieutenant colonels shall be promoted to the respective grades of major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel immediately upon completing respectively seventeen years\u2019, twenty-three years\u2019, and twenty-eight years\u2019 continuous commissioned service in the Regular Army: Provided, That at no time shall the number of promotion-list colonels exceed seven\" hundred and five: Provided further, That promotion-list majors and lieutenant colonels shall not be promoted to the respective grades of lieutenant colonel and colonel until they shall have completed respectively six years\u2019 and five years\u2019 continuous commissioned service under permanent appointments in the grades of major and lieutenant colonel, except that for the purpose of determining years of such service in grade officers promoted to or serving in the respective grades of major and lieutenant colonel shall, in addition to receiving credit for all actual continuous commissioned service in the Regular Army in those grades, receive constructive credit of one-half the amount of their continuous commissioned service in the Regular Army in excess of seventeen and twenty-three years, respectively: Provided further, That each promotion-list officer shall be assumed to have, for promotion purposes, at least the same length of continuous commissioned service in the Regular Army and service in grade as any officer junior to him, in his grade, on the promotion list, * * *; Provided further, That no officer shall be promoted, under the provisions of this section, in advance of any officer in the same grade whose name appears above his on the promotion list, except that the promotion of an officer shall not be withheld by reason of the fact that an officer senior to him on the promotion list is for any reason not eligible for promotion : And provided further, That hereafter all promotion-list officers in any grade shall take' rank among themselves according to their standing on the promotion list.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">\u201cSec 3. * * * That whenever any officer on the active list of .the Regular \u2022Army or Philippine Scouts shall have completed not less than fifteen nor more than twenty-nine years\u2019 service, he may upon his own application be retired, in the discretion of the Secretary of War with annual pay equal to 2% per centum of his active-duty annual pay at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>retirement, multiplied by a number equal to the years of his active service not in excess of twenty-nine years: Provided, That the numbers of years of service to be credited in computing the right to retirement ajid retirement pay hereinbefore pro-, vided in this section shall include all service now or hereafter credited for active-duty pay purposes, any fractional part of a year amounting to six months or more to be counted as a complete year: Provided further, That any officer on the active list of the Regular Army or Philippine Scouts who served in any capacity as a member of the military or naval forces of the United States prior to November 12, 1918, shall upon his own application be retired with annual pay equal to 75 per centum of his active-duty annual pay at the time of his retirement unless entitled to retired pay of a higher grade as hereinafter provided. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">\u201cProvided further, That any promotion-list officer retired for any reason except by operation of section 24b, National Defense Act, or wholly retired, who has completed twenty-eight or more years of continuous commissioned service in the Regular Army and who has failed to reach the grade of colonel by reason of the limitation on the number of promotion-list officers in the grade of colonel or by reason of the restriction of years of service in grade of major \u25a0or lieutenant colonel shall be retired in the grade of colonel with retired pay computed as otherwise provided by law for a colonel with the same length of service including all service now or hereafter credited for active-duty pay purposes, and any such officer who has completed more than twenty-three but less than twenty-eight years of \u25a0continuous commissioned service in the Regular Army and who has failed to reach the grade of lieutenant colonel by reason of the restriction of years of service in grade of major shall be retired in the grade \u25a0of lieutenant colonel with retired pay computed as otherwise provided by law for a lieutenant colonel with the same length of service including all service now or hereafter credited for active-duty pay purposes: Provided further, That each promotion-list officer shall be assumed to have for retirement purposes, at least the same length of continuous commissioned service in the Regular Army as any officer junior to him on the. promotion list: Provided further, That the number of years of service to be credited in computing the right to retirement and retirement pay in the case of officers retired by reason of having reached the age of sixty years or over shall include all service heretofore credited for retirement at age sixty-four: Provided further, That nothing in this Act shall operate to deprive any officer of the retired rank to which he is now entitled under the provisions of law: And provided further, That all officers retired under the provisions of this section shall be placed on the unlimited retired list.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The above-quoted amended section 3 provides only for retirement of an officer \u201cupon his own application\u201d under the length of service provision, and the section also provides that \u201cAll promotion-list officers shall be retired at the age of sixty years,\u201d with certain exceptions. Plaintiff was not retired under the act of June 13, 1935; neither was he retired \u201cupon his own application\u201d or because of his age, but he was removed from the active list and placed on the retired list on the ground', as provided in the Joint Resolution of July 29, 1941, 55 Stat. 606, that his \u201cperformance of duty, or general efficiency, compared with other officers of the same grade and length of service\u201d was such as to warrant such action in the opinion of the Secretary of War (finding 6). It will be noted also that the statute of July 29, 1941, also provides that: \u201cAny officer so retired * * * who served in any capacity as a member of the military or naval forces of the United States prior to November 12, 1918, <em>shall he retired with' annual pay equal to 75 per centum of his active duty annual pay at the time of his retirement; * * </em>[Italics supplied.] The fact that plaintiff, upon being removed and retired, was given the retired rank of lieutenant colonel under section 3 of the act of June 13, 1940, is not, in the circumstances, controlling as to the retired pay to which he was and is entitled. Plaintiff contends that he was retired under both the act of June 13, 1940, and the Joint Resolution of- July 29, 1941, and that the act of June 13 controls as to retired pay, but the facts do not support this position. Sec. 3 of the act of June 13, 1940, specifically excluded from its provisions officers removed and retired under sec. 24b of the National Defense Act of June 4, 1920, 41 Stat. 773, and the Joint Resolution, which suspended sec. 24b during the National emergency, was a substitute for sec. 24b in effect when the act of June 13, 1940, upon which plaintiff relies, was enacted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>This is shown by the fact that sec. 24b and the Joint Resolution were dealing with the same subject matter; i. e., involuntary removal and retirement of commissioned officers. In effect, the Joint Resolution was an amendment, during the period of the National emergency, of sec. 24b which it suspended during such period. Section 24b, as amended June 4, 1920, provided that: \u201cThe President shall convene a board, * * * which shall arrange all officers in 'two classes, namely: Class A, consisting of officers who should be retained in the service, and Class B, of officers who should not be retained in the service.\u201d That section made further provision for either the discharge of Class B officers or for the retirement and for retired pay of such officers as were found eligible to be placed upon the retired list upon removal from the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Since plaintiff was removed and retired under the provisions of the Joint Resolution of July 29, 1941, the provisions of the act of June 13, 1940, are not applicable and he is entitled only to the retired pay of a major and not that of a lieutenant colonel. The petition is therefore dismissed. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">WHALEY, Chief Justice, and WHITAKER, Judge, concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">MADDEN and JONES, Judges, took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
