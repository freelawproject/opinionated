The district court denied his IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Garrett is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Garrett contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the decision was based on the court\u2019s erroneous finding that his early release would pose a danger to society. He also argues that the district court\u2019s denial fails to address the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) factor of avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records and that the district court judge is biased as evidenced by his denial of Garrett\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">The district court implicitly recognized that Garrett was eligible for a sentence reduction. Although Garrett was eligible for a sentence reduction, the district court was under no obligation to grant him one. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir. 2009). Garrett\u2019s argument that his post-sentencing conduct supported a sentence reduction was set forth in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court considered Garrett\u2019s motion but concluded, as a matter of discretion, that a lower sentence was not warranted. In doing so, the district court explained that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the seriousness of the offense and the danger Garrett posed to society if he were released earlier. Garrett has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by basing its decision on an error of law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011). Further, his vague and conclusional allegations of judicial bias are insufficient to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">Because Garrett has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the instant appeal does not involve legal points arguable on their merits. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983). Accordingly, Garrett\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. His motion for judicial notice is also DENIED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
