Because we conclude that the district court properly held that Gra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>nados failed to establish a triable issue as to whether Wal-Mart knew or should have known about the puddle in which Granados slipped, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">On August 3, 2013, Maria Granados visited a store owned and operated by Wal-Mart Stores Texas, L.L.C. (Wal-Mart) for a routine shopping trip. Near the end of her visit, after walking into a checkout aisle, Granados slipped in a puddle of clear liquid and injured herself. A Wal-Mart employee described the puddle as being approximately six inches in diameter, though Granados asserts that the amount of paper towels used to clean the puddle suggests it was larger.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Prior to the slip, a Wal-Mart employee named Mercedes Acosta had been mopping the store\u2019s checkout area. According to video surveillance of the incident, she briefly mopped the entrance of the aisle in which Granados slipped about five minutes prior to the incident, coming within approximately five feet of the puddle\u2019s location with her torso generally facing it. At her deposition, Acosta testified that although she normally looks for puddles and other hazards while cleaning, she did not see the puddle in which Granados slipped when she mopped the aisle. No other witness testified to seeing the puddle. However, an assistant manager at the store who viewed the puddle after Granados slipped testified that someone actively looking for hazards \u201cshould have\u201d noticed the puddle from approximately five feet away if it were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">After the incident, Granados brought a premises liability suit against Wal-Mart in Texas state court. Wal-Mart removed the ease to the Northern District of Texas, where Granados filed an amended complaint. After the close of discovery, Wal-Mart filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion in full, holding that Granados failed to offer any evidence that the spill in which Granados slipped had been present long enough that Wal-Mart reasonably should have discovered and corrected it. Granados timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">The parties agree that Texas substantive law governs this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under Texas law, Wal-Mart owed Granados, its invitee, \u201ca duty to exercise reasonable care to protect her from dangerous conditions in the store known or discoverable to it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To recover damages on a slip-and-fall claim, an invitee plaintiff must establish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-16\">(1) Actual or constructive knowledge of some condition on the premises by the owner/operator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-17\">(2) That , the condition posed an unreasonable risk of harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>(3) That the owner/operator did not exercise reasonable care to reduce or eliminate the risk; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">(4) That the owner/operator\u2019s failure to use such care proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Wal-Mart asserts that that Granados failed to put forth evidence as to either of the first two elements. The district court agreed as to the first element and did not reach the second. We do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Granados may satisfy the knowledge element \u201cby establishing that (1) the defendant placed the substance on the floor, (2) the defendant actually knew that the substance was on the floor, or (3) it is more likely than not that the condition existed long enough to give the premises owner a reasonable opportunity to discover it.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Granados claims that she has put forth evidence of both actual and constructive knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">As to actual knowledge, we need not reach Wal-Mart\u2019s contention that Granados waived her knowledge argument by failing to present it in the district court because we conclude that even if Granados did preserve the argument, she offered no evidence to support it. Granados argues that she put forth sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue as to whether two Wal-Mart employees saw the puddle. First, she cites Acosta, who can be seen in the video of the incident mopping the WalMart checkout area five minutes before Granados slipped. In the video, Acosta, head down and looking at the floor, pushes her mop into the aisle in which Granados slipped. She comes within about five feet of the location of the slip. According to Gra-nados, the fact that Acosta came so close to the spill\u2019s location demonstrates that she must have seen the puddle, especially in light of her testimony that looking for such spills is part of her job while cleaning. Additionally, Granados argues that Acosta\u2019s testimony that she \u201cwould have seen\u201d a spill if one were present, and testimony from Wal-Mart\u2019s assistant manager that the spill would have been noticeable to a person looking for spills from three and one half feet away, demonstrate that Acosta actually saw the spill</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">However, Acosta\u2019s mere proximity to the spill cannot alone support a reasonable inference that Acosta saw the spill in the face of her denial and of the inconspicuousness of the puddle, even if, as the district court accepted, the spill was present at the time Acosta cleaned the area. Nor can the assistant manager\u2019s testimony that someone looking for hazards \u201cwould [have] notice[d]\u201d the puddle. These arguments are mere speculation as they pertain to actual knowledge, and are therefore insufficient to defeat summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">Granados also references as supporting actual knowledge a second Wal-Mart employee who appears in the video about ten seconds before the slip, walks to an area near the puddle, then turns around and walks away. According to Granados, this second employee was in the aisle of the puddle with cleaning tools, and the fact that she looked to the ground and then turned around and walked away is evidence that she saw the spill. However, even if this employee\u2019s presence in the aisle could conceivably support an infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ence of actual knowledge, the video demonstrates clearly that she was <em>not </em>in the aisle in-which Granados slipped, but the aisle next to it, and was not looking in the direction of the puddle at all. \u201cWhen opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, we need not credit Grana-dos\u2019s contention that this second employee was in the aisle containing the spill, and this employee\u2019s appearance, in the video does not support Granados\u2019s argument that Wal-Mart had actual knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Accordingly, we turn to constructive notice. Constructive notice under Texas law is evaluated pursuant to the \u201ctime-notice\u201d rule, which requires that Granados \u201cprove that the spill had been on the floor for a sufficient period of time that WalMart had a reasonable opportunity to discover it.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The rule \u201cis based on the premise that temporal evidence best indicates whether the owner had a reasonable opportunity to discover and remedy a dangerous condition.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Reece, </em>the Supreme Court of Texas held that \u201csome proof of how long the hazard was there [is necessary] before liability can be imposed on the premises owner for failing to discover and rectify, or warn of, the dangerous condition.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That court also made clear that individual facts and circumstances are relevant to determining what constitutes a reasonable amount of time in which the premises owner should have discovered the condition in a given case. For example, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">[I]f the dangerous condition is conspicuous as, for example, a large puddle of dark liquid on a light floor would likely be, then an employee\u2019s proximity to the condition might shorten the time in which a jury could find that the premises owner should reasonably have discovered it. Similarly, if an employee was in close proximity to a less conspicuous hazard for a continuous and significant period of time, that too could affect the jury\u2019s consideration of whether the premises owner should have become aware of the dangerous- condition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">Still, \u201ctemporal evidence, not proximity evidence, is the <em>sine qua non </em>of a premises owner\u2019s constructive knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">Here, Granados has offered no evidence regarding how long the spill was present before she slipped in it. Instead, she speculates from the lack of affirmative video evidence of a cause for the puddle in the five minutes before she slipped that it must have been present for at least five minutes, and was therefore on the ground when Acosta cleaned the area. But even if we accept this premise, as the district court did despite acknowledging its \u201cweaknesses,\u201d Texas courts consistently reject as a matter of law that a period of such short duration is long enough to give a premises owner a \u201creasonable opportunity to discover and remedy a dangerous condition.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>This conclusion is unchanged by the fact that Aco'sta was in the vicinity of the spill and looking for dangerous conditions five minutes before Granados slipped.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although Granados cites testimony from a Wal-Mart employee suggesting that someone looking for hazards five to ten feet from the puddle \u201cshould have\u201d seen it, she does not argue that it was conspicuous in the manner contemplated by <em>Reece, </em>which hypothesized that a \u201clarge puddle of dark liquid on a light floor\u201d might shorten the amount of time in which a premises owner should reasonably have discovered a spill.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rather, it is undisputed that the spill was clear, on a light-colored floor, and not particularly large. Nor does Acosta\u2019s presence in the area of the spill qualify as \u201ccontinuous and significant\u201d in a manner that would .shorten the amount of time necessary under <em>Reece </em>\u2014 surveillance video demonstrates that she was mopping at the entrance of the relevant aisle for less than five seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In sum, Granados failed to raise a triable issue as to whether the spill in which Granados slipped was in existence for long enough that Wal-Mart reasonably should have discovered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">'}&gt; &amp;</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
