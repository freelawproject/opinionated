The district court then denied Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and granted Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Plaintiff-Appellant appeals herein. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-21\">Plaintiff-Appellant Romano Woods Dialysis Center (\u201cRomano\u201d) is a medical provider of dialysis treatments. Starting in 2012, Romano began providing dialysis treatments to Leanna Guggenmos (\u201cLeanna\u201d), an employee of Defendant-Appellee Admiral Linen Service, Inc. (\u201cAdmiral\u201d). Leanna is covered by Admiral\u2019s Welfare Benefit Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). Admiral is the Plan Administrator and Defendant-Appel-lee Group &amp; Pension Administrators, Inc. (\u201cGPA\u201d) is the Claims Administrator. GPA contracted in late 2012 with Specialty Care Management LLC (\u201cSpecialty\u201d) to assist with processing reimbursement claims for dialysis treatments, including Leanna\u2019s treatments.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-22\">After providing multiple dialysis treatments to Leanna, Romano filed suit in 2014 against Defendants-Appellees asserting ERISA claims for benefits, breach of fiduciary duty, and interference with ERISA rights. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). Romano claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that Leanna was entitled to reimbursement for all unpaid medical expenses \u2014 as billed by Romano \u2014 incurred as part of her dialysis treatments, an amount totaling approximately $1,363,344.00. Defendants-Appellees countered that, under the terms of the Plan as confirmed by their communications with Romano prior to beginning Leanna\u2019s dialysis treatments, reimbursement was based on the Medicare rules and reimbursement rates. As such, with one limited exception,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 125% of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>applicable Medicare rate had been paid to Romano under the terms of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Upon considering both parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court rendered summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees and dismissed Romano\u2019s claims with prejudice. Additionally, the district court granted Defendants-Appellees\u2019 subsequent motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the amount of $209,350.13, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In separate memorandums providing its reasons for judgment, the district court noted that the plain language of the Plan provides that dialysis charges may be subject to Medicare rules and reimbursement rates \u2014 an amount which Admiral exceeded in reimbursing Romano. Accordingly, Admiral\u2019s reimbursement to Romano in the amount of 125% of the applicable Medicare rate was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Additionally, the district court concluded that a conflict of interest existed as a result of Admiral being both the Plan Sponsor and Plan Administrator; however, the conflict was of minimal importance in determining whether Admiral\u2019s interpretation of the Plan was arbitrary and capricious. It reasoned that Admiral\u2019s decision to hire Specialty as its Claims Administrator \u2014 a third party with no pecuniary interest \u2014 indicated that Admiral took active steps to reduce its own potential conflict and to promote an accurate administration of Leanna\u2019s claims. Specialty reviewed the applicable paperwork and recommended payment to Romano in the amount of 125% of the applicable Medicare rate and Admiral paid Romano accordingly. As a result, the conflict of interest created by Admiral serving as both the Plan Sponsor and the Plan Administrator was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">Finally, upon analyzing Defendants-Ap-pellees\u2019 \u201cMotion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs\u201d under Bowen<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Johnson,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court awarded reasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $209,350.13, to be recovered from Romano. In its reasons for judgment with respect to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, the district court placed particular emphasis on Romano\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d in filing suit against Defendants-Appellees, in light of the plain language of the Plan clearly stating that dialysis charges may be subject to Medicare rules and reimbursement rates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">Romano appeals the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees and its award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">On appeal, Romano argues that Defendants-Appellees\u2019 interpretation of the Plan \u2014 which they used to reimburse Romano based on Medicare rates \u2014 was legally wrong, that their interpretation of the Plan was tainted by a conflict of interest, and that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees against Romano.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-16\">Should this court affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment, Defendants-Appellees request that they be awarded additional attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred after June 30, 2015, in defending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s judgment on cross motions for summary judgment de novo, addressing each party\u2019s motion independently, viewing the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>See Morgan v. Plano Ind. Sch. Dist., </em>589 F.3d 740, 745 (5th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). We \u201caffirm only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Where \u201cthe language of an ERISA benefits plan grants the plan administrator discretionary authority to interpret the plan and determine eligibility for benefits, the plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Hagen v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>808 F.3d 1022, 1026 (2015) (citation omitted). We also review a district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>See Salley v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>966 F.2d 1011, 1016 (5th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">After considering the parties\u2019 arguments as briefed on appeal, and after reviewing the record, the applicable law, and the district court\u2019s judgment, memorandums and orders, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees and adopt its analysis in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Courts have held that the ERISA fee-shifting provision entitles parties to attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal. <em>See Prod. &amp; Maint. Emps. Local 504 v. Roadmaster Corp., </em>954 F.2d 1397, 1407 (7th Cir. 1992); see <em>also Nachwalter v. Christie, </em>805 F.2d 956, 961 (11th Cir. 1986) (collecting cases). This court\u2019s precedent has similarly allowed for awards of attorney\u2019s fees for both trial and appellate work. <em>See Norris v. Hartmarx Specialty Stores, Inc., </em>913 F.2d 253, 257 (5th Cir. 1990). Accordingly, we award Defendants-Appellees attorney\u2019s fees for this appeal and we remand to allow the district court to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be granted to DefendantsTAppellees for their appellate work.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">The judgment is AFFIRMED. This matter is REMANDED for the limited purpose of calculating an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AMh\">. The record indicates that, pursuant to a separate and limited Single Case Agreement, the parties agreed that Defendants-Appellees would reimburse Romano at a rate of 65% of the billed charges for claims incurred between June 25, 2012, and October 31, 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\">. <em>Iron Workers Local No. 272 v.
