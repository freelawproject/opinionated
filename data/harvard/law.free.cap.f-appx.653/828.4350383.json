Cheese invoked <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He also argued that he was actually innocent of murder conduct used to calculate his guideline range and that the denial of a sentence modification or reduction violated his right to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">On appeal, Cheese challenges the dismissal of his <em>Alleyne, Begay, </em>and <em>Des-camps </em>claims. Our review is de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir. 2000) (per curiam). The district court determined that the claims should be presented in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and did not fit within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) because they challenged the validity of Cheese\u2019s enhanced sentences, not his conviction. We agree, having previously held that the savings clause only applies to \u00a7 2241 claims that, among other things, are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner \u201cmay have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001); <em>see Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). Cheese\u2019s argument that <em>Persaud v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1023, 188 L.Ed.2d 117 (2014) (mem.), allows him to proceed under the savings clause is unavailing. <em>See Robinson v. United States, </em>812 F.3d 476, 477 (5th Cir. 2016) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-17\">Cheese fails to address, and has thus abandoned, the remaining claims that he raised in the district court. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir. 1999). We decline to consider- Cheese\u2019s new claims based on <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>560 U.S. 563, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), as he first raises them here, <em>see Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 435 n.1 (5th Cir. 2011). For the same reason, we decline to consider his new claims based on <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). <em>See Wilson, </em>643 F.3d at 435 n.l. Cheese may seek to present his claim based on <em>Johnson </em>in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Cheese was convicted and sentenced in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b851-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
