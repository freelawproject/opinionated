He contends the condition\u2019s requiring him to provide his probation officer any requested financial information was inadequately justified by the court; is plainly unreasonable; and violates his constitutional-liberty interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">Mayoral may have waived a challenge to the supervised-release condition by signing the form acknowledging the condition at issue and agreeing to be bound it; \u201c[n]ev-ertheless, out of an abundance of caution, we will review for plain error\u201d. <em>United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir. 2006). Under that standard, Mayoral must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the reversible plain error, but should do so only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">Generally, the court has broad discretion to impose special conditions of supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>release. <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>776 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir. 2015). That discretion is limited by 18 U.S.C'. \u00a7 3583(d)(1), which requires the conditions to be \u201creasonably related\u201d to the relevant factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a): the nature and circumstances of the offense and defendant\u2019s history and characteristics; affording adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; protecting the public from further crimes by defendant; and providing defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment. <em>See United States v. Caravayo, </em>809 F.3d 269, 275 (5th Cir. 2015). The special condition must impose \u201cno greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\u201d to serve the last three of the above \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it must be consistent with any relevant policy statements in the Sentencing Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">At sentencing, contrary to Mayoral\u2019s assertion, the court explained that his sentence satisfied the need to protect the public, impose a fair punishment for the offense, and deter Mayoral from future offenses of this type. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). It referred to the nature of the offense and his relevant criminal history, which included other offenses of a financial-fraud nature. These references support that the court considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the sentence, and determined the financial-information condition appropriate. <em>See United States v. Sealed Juvenile, </em>781 F.3d 747, 752 (5th Cir. 2015). Additionally, the Guidelines recommend a supervised-release condition requiring the defendant to provide access to any requested financial information if the court \u201cimposes an order of ... forfeiture\u201d, as it did here. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1,3(d)(3) (p.s.).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Therefore, for plain-error purposes, Mayoral fails: to show the sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing, protect the public, and deter such crimes in the future, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d); <em>Caravayo, </em>809 F.3d at 275; and, failing to show clear or obvious error regarding the condition\u2019s meeting the tailoring requirements of \u00a7 3583(d), also fails to show such error concerning the condition\u2019s not violating his constitutional-liberty interests, <em>see Caravayo, </em>809 F.3d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
