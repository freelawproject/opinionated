The BIA denied her motion on the grounds that Serova, in her motion for reconsideration, raised largely the same arguments that the BIA had considered and rejected on appeal. Because the BIA found no error in the IJ\u2019s fact finding, and her argument constituted a mere disagreement with the BIA\u2019s prior holding on appeal, the BIA denied Serova\u2019s motion for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">On appeal, Serova argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion for reconsideration. Serova avers that the BIA\u2019s initial remand opinion \u201cmade it clear that more fact-finding was necessary.\u201d Serova claims that the IJ\u2019s decision after remand was virtually the same as the IJ\u2019s first decision and merely consisted of \u201csingular statements\u201d that Serova was ineligible for relief. Thus, Serova contends that, because the IJ did not make the findings required by the BIA\u2019s remand decision, the BIA committed error by failing to remand the proceedings a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">A motion to reconsider \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir.2005) (stating that a motion for reconsideration fails if it does not \u201cidentify a change in the law, a misapplication of the law, or an aspect of the case that the BIA overlooked\u201d). We review a denial of a motion to reconsider under the highly deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006). Under the abuse of discretion standard, we must uphold the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider unless the denial is \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In this case, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Serova\u2019s motion to reconsider. We agree with the BIA that Serova\u2019s motion to reconsider raised the same argument that she had previously raised on appeal to the BIA. Thus, Sero-va\u2019s motion for reconsideration did not present any \u201cerrors.of law or fact\u201d in the BIA\u2019s decision, as is required by \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C), that the BIA had not already considered and rejected. Because Serova\u2019s motion to reconsider only recycled the argument that she raised on appeal concerning the IJ\u2019s purported error, the BIA correctly found that her motion merely represented a disagreement with the BIA\u2019s prior decision. Such a disagreement does not establish the requisite grounds for a motion to reconsider. <em>See Matter of O-S-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006) (holding that \u201ca motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal and seek reconsideration by generally alleging error in the pri- or Board decision\u201d); <em>see also Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 319 (5th Cir.2009) (citing <em>O-S-G- </em>approvingly).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Because Serova\u2019s motion merely recycles the same argument that she made on appeal, and there is nothing to indicate\u2014 and Serova does not even argue \u2014 that the BIA\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, racially invidious or otherwise discrimina--tory, <em>Singh, </em>436 F.3d at 487, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Accordingly, Serova\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">. We note that our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s August 6, 2015, decision denying Sero-va\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Serova had 30 days after the BIA\u2019s denial of her petition to appeal that decision, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), and she failed to do so. Therefore, this court is without jurisdiction to consider Serova\u2019s substantive claims for relief under the Immigration and .Nationality Act, \u00a7\u00a7 1158 and 1231(b)(3), and the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16. <em>See Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
