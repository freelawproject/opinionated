By moving to proceed IFP, White is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1997). Our inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The Supreme Court has prescribed a two-step inquiry for a district court that is considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The court must first determine whether a prisoner is eligible for a reduction as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). <em>Id. </em>If he is eligible, then the district court must \u201cconsider any applicable [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion,\u201d any reduction is warranted under the particular facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683. We review the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">The district court properly concluded that White was ineligible for the reduction because he was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir. 2009); \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, White\u2019s argument that the district court improperly overlooked the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is mer-itless. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683. As White was not sentenced under a Guideline lowered by Amendment 782, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied White\u2019s motion. <em>See Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791. White\u2019s arguments challenging alleged defects in his original sentence are not cognizable in the instant proceeding. <em>See Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">White has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Additionally, because this appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion for immediate release is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b830-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
