We have jurisdiction to review the denial of this motion. <em>See Nolos v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-19\">Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for purposes of our review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 831-32 (5th Cir. 2003). We review the BIA\u2019s denials of motions to reopen under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-20\">Vallejo-Delgado does not challenge the BIA\u2019s holdings that, insofar as he requested reopening based upon an exceptional circumstance and in order to request new relief from removal, his motion was untimely; consequently, he has abandoned any sgeh challenges. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d a\u00a1t 833. Service of notice of the removal hearing upon Vallejo-Delgado\u2019s attorney, which service Vallejo-Delgado does not dispute, constituted adequate notice. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1292.5(a); <em>Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, </em>666 F.3d 948, 953 n.6 (5th Cir. 2012); <em>Men Ken Chang v. Jiugni, </em>669 F.2d 275, 277-78 (5th Cir. 1982). Vallejo-Delgado fails to show that the BIA abused its discretion. <em>Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-21\">The motion for summary disposition is GRANTED, and the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b854-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be ' published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
