The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that, they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. CiR. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Through grants from the U.S. Small Business Administration, Howard University runs the District of Columbia Small Business Development Center Network. That Network provides small-business development and counseling services to D.C. residents. Those services are delivered through non-profit organizations that subcontract with Howard University to operate grant-funded \u201cservice centers\u201d across the District. Under those subcontracts, each service center must meet annual performance benchmarks for client recruitment, client counseling, and business development. Howard University also operates the \u201cLead Center\u201d as the Network\u2019s hub.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">At the time this dispute arose, the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) operated one of those service centers. Candice Miles became that center\u2019s director in 2009, notwithstanding \u201creservations\u201d about her appointment because she had no prior experience managing staff, developing marketing plans, preparing budgets, or making the type of financial filings required by the Howard University-UDC subcontract. J.A 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">As it turns out, the UDC Center floundered under Miles\u2019 leadership. In 2009, the Center achieved only 29% of its client-acquisition goal and only 5% of its client-counseling goal. By 2010, the UDC Center lagged significantly behind the other centers in the Network. In early 2011, the Executive Director of the Lead Center identified the UDC Center as the \u201cworst/ performing Center in the [Njetwork.\u201d J.A. 715. Miles was well aware of her center\u2019s poor performance and the need for significant improvement. But she consistently failed to take corrective actions, and left unfilled the critical position of a full-time business counselor who could have assisted with client counseling and operating the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">Meanwhile, in December 2010, an accreditation team from the Association of Small Business Development Centers inspected several of the Network\u2019s service centers, including the UDC Center. The team concluded that substantial improvements were required to maintain accreditation, and that the UDC Center\u2019s performance was \u201cespecially problematic.\u201d <em>See </em>J.A. 715. In its February 2011 draft report, the team recommended that the Network\u2019s accreditation be deferred, and that Howard \u201crevisit and analyze its organizational structure\u201d before attempting to regain accreditation. <em>Id. </em>at 716. The next month, the team repeated that Howard University needed \u201cto seriously restructure the Network,\u201d and in doing so should \u201ctake a hard look\u201d at the UDC Center. <em>Id. </em>Shortly thereafter, the team formally deferred the Network\u2019s accreditation, prompting an official warning to Howard University that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>grant was in \u201cserious jeopardy.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 717-718.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">In August 2010, Miles learned that she was pregnant, with an expected due date in early April 2011. She informed UDC in the Fall of 2010, but did not notify anyone at the Lead Center about her pregnancy or forthcoming extended absence until January 2011, Complications with her pregnancy put Miles on bed rest on March 7, 2011. A week later, Miles emailed the Lead Center Executive Director advising that she had started her maternity leave and would not return for three or four months. Absent from that e-mail was any discussion of how the UDC Center would continue to function in her absence. Miles has acknowledged her obligation as Center Director to ensure the continuity of opera: tions during her leave. But she never \u201cinformed [Howard University] of any plan for servicing UDC\u2019s clients\u201d in her absence, or made any effort to arrange for temporary personnel to provide counseling services at the UDC Center, J.A, 718, 719. According to the record, Miles\u2019 only plan was to re-direct clients to another service center, although she acknowledged that she had no idea whether that center had the staffing or resources \u201cto provide counseling to all of UDC\u2019s clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Upon learning that the UDC Center would be effectively shuttered until Miles returned, the Lead Center\u2019s Executive Director warned UDC about the accreditation team\u2019s calls for immediate corrective action, the UDC Center\u2019s prolonged un-derperformance, and the complete breakdown in services wrought by Miles\u2019 failure to plan for her absence. He directed UDC to create a recovery plan for the Center\u2019s operations in Miles\u2019 absence and for an overall improvement in performance. In an April 7, 2011 letter memorializing that directive, the Executive Director placed the UDC Center on probation and advised that its subcontract could be terminated if its recovery plan was not satisfactory. The letter added that the \u201cService Center Director is currently on maternity leave,\u201d and that she took that leave \u201cwithout prior notification to the Executive Director\u201d and without making \u201cany meaningful provision for the continuation of client servicesf.]\u201d J.A. 867. The letter further noted that Miles had not advised the Executive Director of her expected return date, and had \u201cessentially abandoned the service center and its clients by her failure to take the necessary and proper steps to assure viable operation of the service center.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The letter worried that, \u201c[u]nder its present condition,\u201d the Center was unlikely to be operational again until after Miles returned. <em>Id. </em>Given all of that, the letter suggested that UDC consider \u201creplacing [Miles] with a more experienced person, who has an educational background and meaningful experience in marketing, business development, consulting, and communications.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">When UDC\u2019s response came up short, the Executive Director again complained to UDC that: (i) the UDC Center \u201chas been and continues to be non-functioning and non-performing since Ms. Miles took leave in mid March, 2011\u201d; (ii) there had been no \u201cmeasurable change in the function of the Center,\u201d and \u201cno significant change proposed for the foreseeable future\u201d; (Hi) UDC\u2019s \u201clack of effective oversight\u201d had led to the lack of any \u201cplan for operating the center while Ms. Miles is on. leave\u201d; and (iv) UDC\u2019s failure to make necessary personnel changes meant that \u201cthe Center\u2019s leadership, which for nearly two years has proven seriously inadequate will remain the same.\u201d J.A. 876. The Executive Director informed UDC that its subcontract would be terminated unless it promptly complied with several \u201cnon-negotiable conditions,\u201d including replacing Miles with \u201cappropriate new leadership\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>within 60 days, and submitting a \u201cproper recovery and marketing plan\u201d once a new Director began working. <em>Id. </em>at 877. UDC refused to comply. Howard University then formally terminated UDC\u2019s subcontract. Because Miles\u2019 salary was paid from funds provided under the subcontract, UDC terminated her employment shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">As relevant here, Miles filed suit against Howard University, alleging that her termination violated the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq., </em>a similar provision of D.C. law, D.C. Code \u00a7 32-601 <em>et seq., </em>the D.C. Human Rights Act, D.C. Code \u00a7 2-1401.01 <em>et seq., </em>and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted summary judgment for Howard University. <em>Miles v. Howard Univ., </em>83 F.Supp.3d 105 (D.D.C. 2015). The court held that Howard University was not -liable both because it was not Miles\u2019 \u201cjoint employer,\u201d and alternatively because Miles failed to show that Howard University\u2019s stated performance-based reason for terminating the UDC subcontract was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Reviewing <em>de novo, </em>we affirm. <em>See Coleman v. District of Columbia, </em>794 F.3d 49, 57 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Miles proceeded under a single-motive retaliation theory, contending that she was fired solely because she exercised her FMLA rights. <em>See </em>Oral Arg. Tr. at 5 (Feb. 11, 2016). Accordingly, the central question at summary judgment is whether Miles \u201c\u2018produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that [Howard University\u2019s] asserted * * * reason\u2019\u201d for terminating the UDC subcontract that led to her termination was not the true reason, and that Howard University intentionally discriminated or retaliated against her. <em>Allen v. Johnson, </em>795 F.3d 34, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, </em>520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Howard University produced evidence that it terminated the subcontract because the UDC Center was the \u201cworst-performing Center in the [N]etwork,\u201d and had no foreseeable prospect of improving. J.A. 715. The record amply evidences that the Center was persistently underperforming under Miles\u2019 leadership. Also, it is undisputed that the Network \u201clater regained full * * * accreditation\u201d after the UDC Center was closed, and that the Small Business Administration subsequently concluded during a review of the Small Business Network \u201cthat Howard\u2019s termination of the UDC subcontract was managerially and strategically sound.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721 (internal quotation marks omitted). Those undisputed facts, combined with UDC\u2019s undisputed failure to rectify any of the deficiencies identified as in need of urgent correction, substantiate Howard University\u2019s non-pretextual and non-discriminatory explanation for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">That showing shifted the burden to Miles to produce evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Howard University\u2019s proffered reason for terminating the UDC subcontract was pretex-tual, and that its actual motive was her FMLA leave. <em>See Brady, </em>520 F.3d at 496 n. 4; <em>Gleklen v. Democratic Cong. Campaign Comm., Inc., </em>199 F.3d 1365, 1367-1368 (D.C. Cir. 2000). We hold that Miles failed to make any plausible showing that Howard University chose to close an entire service center just because she took parental leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\"><em>First, </em>Miles argues that the April 7, 2011 letter\u2019s reference to her maternity leave \u201csingled out\u201d her FMLA leave as the precipitating factor for the UDC Center\u2019s suspension. Miles Br. 31. The letter is clear, however, that Howard University\u2019s Lead Center was not complaining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Miles had taken leave, but that she had done so without: (i) informing the Lead Center of her plans, (ii) making viable arrangements for the continuity of client service, and (iii) filling a crucial staff vacancy -before departing \u2014 thus effectively shuttering the UDC Center at the exact time that Howard University was being asked to justify its continued operation and receipt of taxpayer funds. J.A. 867. No reasonable jury could find from that evidence that the termination rested solely on her use of FMLA leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Miles argues that she redirected UDC\u2019s current and prospective clients to another center. Oral Arg. Tr. 16-17 (Feb. 11, 2016); J.A. 851. Maybe. But that just underscores that she made no plan for the continuity of operations <em>at the UDC Center. </em>Miles also lacked any record evidence that the Network\u2019s operational practice permitted a center director to unilaterally transfer <em>all </em>of her present and prospective clients to other centers for an indefinite period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Second, Miles argues (Br. 31) that Howard University terminated the subcontract because UDC refused to replace her while she was on leave. But the record shows that the contract was terminated because UDC failed to provide an adequate recovery plan and wholly refused to implement the prescribed last-chance, \u201cnon-negotiable conditions\u201d for keeping the Center open. J.A. 877. To be sure, one of those conditions was hiring \u201cappropriate new leadership for the Center[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>But Miles produced no credible evidence suggesting that the call for new leadership was motivated by a discriminatory or retaliatory animus based on her taking FMLA leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\"><em>Third, </em>Miles argues that the Network\u2019s overall decline undermines Howard University\u2019s performance-based reasons for terminating UDC\u2019s subcontract. But whatever the condition of the Network as a whole, the undisputed record evidence shows that the UDC Center was the \u201cworst-performing Center in the [N]et-work\u201d and had no plan for improvement. J.A. 715. Indeed, it is undisputed that both Howard University and UDC had explicitly identified the UDC Center as woefully underperforming \u2014 even relative to the other centers \u2014 long before Miles informed anyone that she was planning to take parental leave. <em>See id. </em>at 714-715. The record further shows that concerns about the Center\u2019s performance were brought to Miles\u2019 attention, but still no corrective actions were taken on her watch. <em>Id. </em>at 272, 579-584. In addition, the UDC Center\u2019s poor performance left Howard University at risk of losing funding for the entire Network. The undisputed record shows, moreover, that calls for a \u201chard look\u201d at the UDC Center originated not with Howard University, but with the accreditation team, at a time when no one knew that Miles was on parental leave. <em>Id. </em>at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\"><em>Fourth, </em>Miles argues that Howard University demonstrated discriminatory animus by expecting a continuity of service plan when it did not require a similar plan from the D.C. Chamber- Center after its director resigned. Miles Br. 34-35. That argument overlooks the undisputed evidence that the Chamber Center kept functioning because its director had hired a business counselor, who was able to step in and keep that center running. J.A. 718. Miles failed over the course of nearly a year to fill the business counselor vacancy at the UDC Center. Miles also admitted, <em>see id. </em>that the Chamber Center was <em>not </em>\u201cequally non-functioning\u201d because it performed considerably better than the UDC Center in meeting contractual benchmarks. <em>See id. </em>at 342, 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>Fifth, </em>Miles points to an exchange in which a UDC Dean allegedly said that terminating Miles during her leave would be \u201cillegal,\u201d and the Dean of Howard University\u2019s business school replied that \u201cmay be right.\u201d J.A. 888. Even viewed in the light most favorable to Miles, the Howard University Dean\u2019s \u201cmay be\u201d response to the UDC Dean\u2019s lay legal opinion does not by itself create a disputed question of material fact concerning pretext given the mountain of undisputed record evidence corroborating Howard University\u2019s performance-based decision to terminate the subcontract. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (\u201cThe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><em>Finally, </em>Miles argues that the temporal proximity between the Executive Director learning about her leave and termination of the subcontract support a reasonable .inference of retaliatory intent. That is incorrect. Temporal proximity, standing alone, cannot rebut an employer\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for an adverse employment action. <em>See Gleklen, </em>199 F.3d at 1368-1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-16\">In sum, we affirm the grant of summary judgment because Miles has failed to produce sufficient evidence to rebut Howard University\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory justification for terminating the UDC subcontract. That determination equally disposes of Miles\u2019 claims under Title VII and District law. <em>See Gleklen, </em>199 F.3d at 1367 (applying <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting analysis to claims under Title VII and the D.C. Human Rights Act); <em>Alford v. Providence Hosp., </em>945 F.Supp.2d 98, 108 (D.D.C. 2013), <em>aff'd, </em>561 Fed.Appx. 13 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (\u201cThe <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework applies to retaliation claims\u201d under the \u201cFMLA/DCFMLA\u201d). We accordingly need not reach the district court\u2019s alternative holding that Howard University did not qualify as Miles\u2019 joint employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven Days After the Resolution of Any Timely Petition for Rehearing or Rehearing En Banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. C\u00ede. R. 41(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
