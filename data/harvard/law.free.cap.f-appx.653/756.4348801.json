He argues that he has met his burden of proving eligibility for withholding of removal by establishing that his fears of future persecution have a sufficient nexus to a statutorily protected ground. After careful review, we deny the petition in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">We \u201creview only the [BIA]\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we' will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). When the BIA decides that someone is ineligible for withholding of removal, we review that decision under the substantial evidence test, where we \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision arid draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d Seck v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 663 F.3d 1356, 1364 (11th Cir. 2011). We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003). Whether an asserted group constitutes a particular social group is a question of law, which is reviewed de novo. See Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 446 F.3d 1190, 1195-96 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) provides that \u201cthe Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Private acts of violence, general criminal activity, and purely personal retribution do not qualify as persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir. 2006); Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir. 2004). We have defined the term \u201cparticular social group\u201d to mean \u201cpersons who share a common, immutable characteristic that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d Rodriguez v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 735 F.3d 1302, 1310 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). To meet the statute\u2019s definition, a group also needs \u201csocial visibility,\u201d meaning the group\u2019s characteristics must be \u201chighly visible and recognizable by others in the country.\u201d Castillo-Arias, 446 F.3d at 1194 (quotation omitted). Beyond that, a group can\u2019t be \u201ctoo numerous or inchoate,\u201d and it shouldn\u2019t be defined so broadly that it is \u201ca catch-all for all groups who might claim persecution.\u201d Id. at 1197-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Here, Prieto-Miranda\u2019s claims of persecution are based on threats he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>ceived from the relatives of a married woman who were upset that he was living with her, his robbing and beating by neighborhood gang members (who included a relative of the married woman\u2019s husband), his nephew\u2019s stabbing, and his cousin\u2019s death. But the record supports the conclusion that Prieto-Miranda\u2019s past threats and beating and his fears for his safety were due to a personal matter relating to his previous romantic relationship, and persecution based on personal matters is not based on a protected ground. Similarly, the record supports a finding that the harms suffered by Prieto-Miranda\u2019s family members were a result of general criminal activity, and not on account of a protected ground. Thus, substantial evidence supports the determination that Prieto-Miranda\u2019s asserted persecution did not have a sufficient nexus to one of the five protected grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">As for Prieto-Miranda\u2019s remaining arguments, we lack jurisdiction to review them. The INA provides that we \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien\u201d as a matter of right. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional and precludes review of a claim that was not presented to the BIA. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2006). A petitioner must exhaust a claim before the BIA by raising both the core issue and any discrete arguments he relies on in support of that claim. Jeune v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 810 F.3d 792, 800 (11th Cir. 2016). A petitioner does not exhaust a claim if they do not present it before the BIA, even if the BIA .addresses the issue sua sponte. Amaya-Artunduaga, 463 F.3d at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Prieto-Miranda did not present before the BIA his discrete arguments that expatriates who return to Mexico from the United States should be a protected social group, or that there is a pattern of organized crime and persecution in Mexico. Because he did not exhaust these claims, we do not have jurisdiction to review them.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
