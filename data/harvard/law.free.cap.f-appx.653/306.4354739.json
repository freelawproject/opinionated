He argues that the BIA allowed the IJ to disregard the REAL ID Act when assessing the credibility of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) witnesses. He also argues that the DHS\u2019s evidence was hearsay, unreliable, and insufficient to establish his removability by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s credibility determinations are substantially reasonable and supported by the record. As the BIA observed, the IJ was free to credit the testimony of Singh\u2019s United States citizen ex-wife and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service officers over that of Singh and his three children. <em>See United States v. DeRose Indus., Inc., </em>519 F.2d 1066, 1067 (5th Cir. 1975). Singh has failed to show that, under the totality of the circumstances, \u201cthe evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir. 2009). Because the credible testimony and documentary evidence established that Singh entered into a fraudulent marriage with the intent to procure an immigration benefit and that he testified falsely in an attempt to secure United States citizenship, Singh has failed to show that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s determination that he was removable as charged. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i); <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Singh also contends that the IJ and BIA erred in applying the prior adverse credibility determination to his application for relief from removal. However, the denial of Singh\u2019s application for relief from removal was not .based solely on the prior adverse credibility determination. The IJ and BIA also found that Singh had failed to meet his burden for the requested relief because he did not offer oral testimony in support of his application. Singh has abandoned any challenge to the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s alternative ruling by failing to address the issue in his petition for review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir. 2003). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
