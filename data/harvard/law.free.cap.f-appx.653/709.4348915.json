On appeal, Harris argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the gun found in his vehicle because the officer who stopped him for a license plate violation did not have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation had occurred. Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">A traffic stop constitutes a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). A traffic stop is constitutional if it is based upon either probable cause to believe a traffic law has been violated or a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. United States v. Harris, 526 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir. 2008). The standard for both probable cause and reasonable suspicion is an objective one. Id. at 1337-38. Additionally, reasonable suspicion can rest upon a mistake of law if the mistake is objectively reasonable. Heien v. North Carolina, 574 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 530, 539-40, 190 L.Ed.2d 475 (2014) (concluding that an officer\u2019s mistaken belief that a North Carolina statute required two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>working brake lights, rather than just one, was a reasonable mistake of law based on the wording of the statute, which had never been construed by the state appellate courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Florida law at the time of Harris\u2019s stop provided in relevant part' that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">Every vehicle, at all times while driven, stopped, or parked upon any highways, roads, or streets of this state, ... shah ... display, the license plate or both of the license plates assigned to it by the state ... in such manner as to prevent the plates from swinging, and all letters, numerals, printing, writing, and other identification marks upon the plates regarding the word \u201cFlorida,\u201d the registration decal, and the alphanumeric designation shall be clear and distinct and free from defacement, mutilation, grease, and other obscuring matter, so that they will be plainly visible and legible at all times 100 feet from the rear or front.... Nothing shall be placed upon the face of a Florida plate except as permitted by law or by rule or regulation of a governmental agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.605(1) (2014) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">According to Officer Kaitlyn Grijalva\u2019s hearing testimony, she pulled Harris\u2019s truck over after she observed that the truck\u2019s license plate was obstructed by the license plate\u2019s frame. Specifically, because of the frame, portions of the \u201cMyFlori-da.com\u201d lettering at the top of the license plate, the \u201c2\u201d at the end of the alphanumeric designation, and the decal on the upper-right corner of the license plate were not completely visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-16\">The district court credited Officer Gri-jalva\u2019s testimony, and Harris has offered no reason for us not to defer to this credibility finding. See United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, 289 F.3d 744, 748-49 (11th Cir. 2002) (explaining that we defer to the district court\u2019s credibility determination made during a suppression hearing unless that determination, is \u201ccontrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfin-der could accept it\u201d). Contrary to Harris\u2019s contention, the photographs of the rear of Harris\u2019s truck (submitted by both the government and Harris) corroborate Officer Grijalva\u2019s testimony, as they show that the chain-link frame partially obscured the \u201cMyFlorida.com\u201d and \u201cSunshine State\u201d lettering at the top and bottom of the license plate and slightly overlapped the side of the \u201c2\u201d at the end of the alphanumeric designation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">Harris argues that these obstructions were \u201cde minimis\u201d and did not constitute a violation of \u00a7 316.605(1) because they did not render the \u201crequired writings\u201d illegible, as evidenced by Officer Grijalva\u2019s admission that she was able to read the registration information and enter it accurately on her laptop. Harris\u2019s \u201cde minimis\u201d argument seems inconsistent with the broad language of \u00a7 316.605(1), which required not only the registration decal and the alphanumeric designation, but also \u201call letters, numerals, printing, writing, and other identification marks upon the plates regarding the word \u2018Florida,\u2019 \u201d to be \u201cclear and distinct\u201d and \u201cfree from ... obscuring matter\u201d so that the plate is not just \u201clegible,\u201d but also \u201cplainly visible\u201d from 100 feet away. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.605(1) (2014) (emphasis added). \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>In any event, even assuming arguendo that Harris\u2019s license plate frame did not actually violate \u00a7 316.605(1) because the alphanumeric designation and registration information, although obscured, were still legible, Officer Grijalva\u2019s belief that it did violate \u00a7 316.605(1) because it obscured other writing on the plate was objectively reasonable in light of the statute\u2019s broad language and the lack of any settled state law at the time-of Officer Grijalva\u2019s stop that precluded her belief. See Heien, 574 U.S. at \u2014, 135 S.Ct. at 539-40.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, we cannot say Officer Grijalva\u2019s understanding of the scope of \u00a7 316.605(1) was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Because Officer Grijalva had probable cause to believe a traffic violation had occurred, her stop of Harris\u2019s truck did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Harris\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\">. On appeal, Harris does not challenge his 51-month sentence. Harris also does not challenge: (1) the fact that he was driving on a suspended license; (2) the extension of the traffic stop once Officer Kaitlyn Grijalva determined that Harris was a habitual traffic offender driving on a suspended license; or (3)- Officer Grijalva\u2019s plain view discovery of the shotgun sticking out from behind the driver\u2019s seat. Rather, Harris challenges only whether Officer Grijalva had probable cause to stop his truck based on his alleged license plate violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b733-15\">. \"Because rulings on motions to suppress involve mixed questions of fact and law, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its application of the law to the facts de novo.\u201d United States v. Lewis, 674 F.3d 1298, 1302-03 (11th Cir. 2012). The facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the district court. Id. at 1303.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">. Although Florida intermediate appellate courts had interpreted \u00a7 316.605(1) at the time of Officer Grijalva\u2019s traffic stop, those decisions were factually inapplicable and also in conflict with each other. Thus, there was no settled state law that would have made Officer Grijalva's interpretation of the statute objectively unreasonable,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
