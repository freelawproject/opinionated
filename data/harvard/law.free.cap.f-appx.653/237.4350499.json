In doing so, Lutcher has challenged the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Thus, our inquiry \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The district court determined that Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines lowered Lutcher\u2019s guidelines sentencing range but that Lutcher was ineligible for a further reduction of his 240-month sentence because he was subject to the 240-month statutory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). Lutcher contends, however, that he is not subject to the 240-month statutory minimum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). He argues that the district court\u2019s relevant conduct finding did not trigger the mandatory minimum because a fact that increases a minimum sentence, other than a fact of a prior conviction, must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Implicit in his argument is a challenge to the jury\u2019s drug-quantity finding that the conspiracy involved 50 grams or more of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Under the version of \u00a7 841(b) (1)(A) (iii) applicable to Lutcher, the 20-year statutory minimum was triggered if the defendant was convicted of an offense involving 50 grams or more of cocaine base and had a prior conviction for a felony drug offense. In light of the jury finding that the offense involved 50 grams or more of cocaine base and the judicial finding that Lutcher had a prior felony conviction for a drug offense, he is subject to the 20-year statutory minimum sentence. While the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) increased \u201cthe drug amounts triggering mandatory; minimums for crack trafficking offenses from 5 grams to 28 grams\u201d and \u201cfrom 50 grams to 280 grams,\u201d <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2329, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), the FSA does not apply to Lutcher, who was sentenced prior to its effective date and who seeks a sentence reduction after that effective date, <em>see United States v. Kelly, </em>716 F.3d 180, 181-82 (5th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Because the 240-month statutory minimum is greater than the 121- to 151-month guidelines imprisonment range that results from the application of Amendment 782, the district court correctly determined that the statutory minimum is Lutcher\u2019s guidelines sentence and that he was ineligible for a further reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b); <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). Because this appeal does not involve a nonfrivolous issue, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220, Lutcher\u2019s IFP motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous, <em>see Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
