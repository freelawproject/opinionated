By moving to proceed IFP, Patrick is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not friv-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ol'ous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[W]here the merits are so intertwined with the certification decision as to constitute the same issue,\u201d as in this case, we may deny the IFP motion and dismiss the appeal sua sponte as frivolous. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n.24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The Supreme Court has prescribed a two-step inquiry for a district court that is considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The district court must first determine whether a prisoner is eligible for a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Id. </em>If the prisoner is eligible, then the district court must \u201cconsider any applicable [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion,\u201d any reduction is warranted under the particular facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Patrick argues that the district court ignored the purpose of Amendment 782 and abused its discretion by denying his motion for reduction of sentence based on his prior criminal history. However, the record shows that, in deciding that a reduction was not warranted, the district court gave due consideration to the motion and implicitly considered the appropriate factors, particularly the need to protect the public from further crimes, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), as well as \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment,\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10,. comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Thus, there was no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, 55 </em>F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Under the circumstances, Patrick has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n.24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
