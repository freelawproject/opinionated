In 2008, Nunez was sentenced above his guideline range, to 200 months of imprisonment following his guilty plea to conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. In 2012, the district court granted Nunez a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and reduced his sentence from 200 months to 148 months. In denying Nunez\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and his motion for reconsideration, the district court noted that Nunez\u2019s original sentence of 200 months of imprisonment was reasonable under the circumstances due to his extensive criminal history and the circumstances of his offense. The court concluded that even in light of Nunez\u2019s positive behavior while imprisoned, the current sentence of 148 months is more than reasonable, protects the public from further crimes of this defendant, and deters the type of criminal conduct he has displayed in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-22\">Reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u00e1re not mandatory. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir. 2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-23\">The district court reiterated the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors it considered in selecting Nunez\u2019s original sentence, and it explained why those factors were also significant to its conclusion that a further reduction was unwarranted. The court also gave due consideration to Nunez\u2019s post-sentencing behavior, although it concluded that such behavior did not warrant a further reduction in sentence. The court\u2019s failure to specifically mention Nunez\u2019s substance abuse issues and his troubled upbringing does not mean that the court did not consider them. <em>See Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 718. Nunez\u2019s contention that the district court gave undue weight to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors it considered in imposing his original sentence fails because the.district court was not required to discount those factors merely because they were already considered at the original sentencing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 &amp; n.11 (5th Cir. 2009) (noting that despite the movant\u2019s alleged reformation, the facts that led to his original high-end sentence remained). Nunez provides no details of the sentences or records of the defendants who purportedly have been granted sentence reductions. Accordingly, his contention that the denial of his motion results in an unwarranted sentencing disparity thus fails. <em>See United States v. Duhon, </em>440 F.3d 711, 721 (5th Cir. 2006).\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b852-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
