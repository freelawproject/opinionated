California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2011). Thomas has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">However, our review of the record reveals two clerical errors that require remand. First, the written order of revocation incorrectly indicates that Thomas \u201cadmitted as true some of the allegations contained in [the motion to revoke] and not true as to one of the allegations.\u201d In fact, Thomas admitted all of the allegations in the motion to revoke. Second, the district court did not complete a statement of reasons form reflecting in writing its grounds for imposing a sentence that exceeded Thomas\u2019s policy statement range. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 261-62 (5th Cir. 2009); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for'leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. We REMAND to the district court for correction of the noted clerical errors pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
