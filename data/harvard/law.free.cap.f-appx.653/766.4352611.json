See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(3). Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order, filed February 16, 2016, be affirmed, but the order is hereby modified to reflect that the dismissal is without prejudice to refiling. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint for failure to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), which requires a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d See Ciralsky v. CIA, 355 F.3d 661, 668 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The complaint failed to satisfy this minimum standard. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1213(a) (stating providing that U.S. Office of Special Counsel provisions relating to violations of law, mismanagement, etc., apply to \u201cdisclosures of information by an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
