The court has afforded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not presently warrant a published opinion, <em>See </em>D.C. Cm. R. 36(d). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b785-25\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court dismissing Appellants\u2019 claims under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 948a and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) be affirmed. Appellants did not exhaust their administrative remedies for those claims before filing suit. <em>See Brink v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>787 F.3d 1120, 1128 (D.C. Cir. 2015). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b785-26\">FURTHER ORDERED that, in light of the dismissal of Appellants\u2019 only federal-law claims, the record be remanded to the district court for a determination whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists to decide Appellants\u2019 remaining common-law claims, either as a discretionary exercise of supplemental jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction as the amended complaint asserts. <em>See Tate v. District of Columbia, </em>627 F,3d 904, 913 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (remanding plaintiffs common-law claims \u201cfor the district court to determine in its discretion whether to decide their merits or to dismiss them without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 1367(c)(3)\u201d); <em>Minker v. Baltimore Annual Conference of United Methodist </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number><em>Church, </em>894 F.2d 1354, 1361 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (directing district court to determine on remand whether diversity jurisdiction existed where court affirmed dismissal of claims providing federal question jurisdiction). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">FURTHER ORDERED that, as this court retains jurisdiction over this appeal, this case will be held in abeyance pending resolution of the limited jurisdictional question on remand. The Clerk is directed to transmit a copy of this judgment to the district court. The district court is requested to notify this court promptly upon its determination of the jurisdictional issue identified herein. The parties are directed to file motions to govern future proceedings in this appeal within 21 days of the district court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein pending resolution of the remainder of the appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
