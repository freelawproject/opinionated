He was sentenced to life in prison. He filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, where he is incarcerated. The district court construed the petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it for want of jurisdiction. Smith challenges the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Smith contends that under <em>Rosemond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014), which set forth the Government\u2019s burden of proof with respect to the mens rea to convict under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 for aiding and abetting an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) offense, he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. To the extent that \u00a7 2255 is reserved for questions of constitutional magnitude, and Smith\u2019s claim goes to statutory interpretation, his claim is arguably not cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-01 (5th Cir. 2001). Smith has not shown, however, that his claim could be brought in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) because, even if <em>Rosemond </em>applies retroactively, he has not established his claim was foreclosed previously.' The law in the Eighth Circuit, the circuit in which he was convicted, was consistent with <em>Rosemond </em>and, in fact, was cited in <em>Rosemond, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1249 (citing <em>United States v. Akiti, </em>701 F.3d 883, 887 (8th Cir. 2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">Furthermore, Smith has not shown that under <em>Rosemond </em>he was convicted of a nonexistent offense given that he was not convicted under \u00a7 2, and he has not cited authority applying <em>Rosemond </em>to an offense under \u00a7 1958(a). Thus, he does not make the requisite showing that he was convicted for conduct that did not constitute a crime. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 831 (5th Cir. 2001). Given that <em>Rose-mond </em>is inapposite, he otherwise fails to show that \u00a7 2255 is unavailable or ineffective to challenge the legality of his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">Accordingly, the petition was properly dismissed because the district court lacked jurisdiction over the \u00a7 2255 motion, which could be filed, if at all, in the district where Smith was sentenced. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b850-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
