(\u201cAct\u201d). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-26\">In a petition for review under the Act, we review a decision by the ALJ under a deferential standard, determining only whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is in accordance with the law and is supported by substantial evidence in the light of the entire record. Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Co. v. Dir., OWCP, 508 F.3d 975, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>980 (11th Cir. 2007). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The Act provides benefits to miners who are totally disabled due to coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(a). Pneu-moconiosis is \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a). This definition encompasses both \u201cclinical\u201d and \u201clegal\u201d pneumoconiosis. Id. \u201cClinical pneumoconiosis\u201d includes \u201cthose diseases recognized by the medical community as pneumoconioses,\u201d including, among other things, coal workers\u2019 pneu-moconiosis. Id. \u00a7 718.201(a)(1). \u201cLegal pneumoconiosis\u201d means \u201cany chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment\u201d including, but \u201cnot limited to, any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">A miner is presumed to be totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if he (1) worked in an underground coal mine for 15 years or more and (2) suffers from a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(b)(1), (c). Once a miner demonstrates total disability and invokes the 15-year presumption, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption by proving either (1) that the miner suffers no legal or clinical pneumo-coniosis or (2) that the miner\u2019s totally disabling impairment is wholly unrelated to his pneumoconiosis. Id. \u00a7 718.305(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">That Claimant meets the criteria for eligibility under the 15-year presumption is undisputed. The issue in this appeal is on whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Chevron failed to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In a detailed written order granting Claimant benefits, the ALJ described the contents of Claimant\u2019s medical records and the medical opinions of several doctors. Based on this evidence, the ALJ first determined that Claimant had no clinical pneumoconiosis. Applying the 15-year presumption, however, the ALJ concluded that Chevron failed to satisfy its burden of demonstrating that Claimant suffered from no legal pneumoconiosis. About causation, the ALJ noted that, where a miner is found to have legal pneumoconiosis, the ALJ need not determine separately whether the disease \u201carose out of\u2019 the miner\u2019s coal mine employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">To rebut the regulatory presumption that a miner has pneumoconiosis, the employer must present \u201caffirmative proof that pneumoconiosis does not and did not exist\u201d: mere silence or the absence of an express diagnosis of pneumoconiosis is not enough. Black Diamond Coal Mining Co. v. Benefits Review Bd., 758 F.2d 1532, 1534 (11th Cir. 1985) (discussing rebuttal of interim entitlement presumption under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(4)). To rebut the presumption on causal grounds, \u201cthe employer must show that no part of the claimant\u2019s disability arose out of mine employment.\u201d Id. Thus, \u201c[e]ven where pneumoconiosis is only a \u2018contributing cause\u2019 of claimant\u2019s total disability, benefits must be awarded as long as no other ground for rebuttal has been established.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">As an initial matter, Chevron urges this Court to consider whether the preponderance of the evidence in this case demonstrates the existence of Claimant\u2019s pneumoconiosis. The scope of our review, however, is limited to whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record. The weight to be afforded the evidence is a matter within the ALJ\u2019s discretion; and we are precluded from reweighing the evidence. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Bradberry v. Dir., OWCP, 117 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 1997) (\u201cThe ALJ is responsible for making credibility determinations and for weighing conflicting evidence\u201d); Vintson v. Califano, 592 F.2d 1353, 1357 (5th Cir. 1979) (when reviewing for substantial evidence, \u201c[i]t is not the task of a reviewing court to reweigh the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On this record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Chevron failed to satisfy its burden of rebutting the 15-year presumption. Chevron has identified no \u201caffirmative proof\u2019 that Claimant\u2019s respiratory condition does not qualify as a chronic lung disease arising out of his coal mine employment: that is, legal pneumoconiosis. That Claimant has never been diagnosed formally with pneumoconiosis, in and of itself, is insufficient rebuttal evidence. See Black Diamond Coal Mining Co., 758 F.2d at 1534.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Although Dr. Lipscomb and Dr. Bailey opined that Claimant suffered no coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, each doctor based his or her opinion largely on Claimant\u2019s negative chest x-rays and CT scans. As a result, the ALJ noted correctly that Dr. Lipscomb\u2019s and Dr. Bailey\u2019s opinions were limited to whether Claimant had clinical pneumoconiosis and failed to address \u2014 and, thus, to rebut \u2014 the issue of legal pneumoconiosis. And substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Dr. Bailey\u2019s opinion was incomplete and unclear in the light of Dr. Bailey\u2019s reliance on negative x-rays, and on inaccurate information about Claimant\u2019s lung resection. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) (\u201cnotwithstanding a negative X-ray,\u201d a physician may find, based on sound medical judgment, that a miner suffers from pneumoco-niosis).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The ALJ also acted in a reasoned manner in giving little weight to Dr. Gold-stein\u2019s opinion that Claimant\u2019s condition was \u201cconsistent with\u201d Claimant\u2019s smoking history and lung surgery (and, implicitly, not a result of pneumoconiosis). First, Dr. Goldstein\u2019s report included the wrong date for Claimant\u2019s lung resection surgery and failed to discuss the impact Claimant\u2019s lung surgery may have had on Claimant\u2019s respiratory condition. Dr. Goldstein\u2019s report also failed to discuss the significance of the non-reversibility of Claimant\u2019s condition and of Claimant\u2019s post-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests. Moreover, in the light of the deficiencies in Dr. Gold-stein\u2019s report, the ALJ acted reasonably in determining that Dr. Goldstein\u2019s opinion failed to establish that no part of Claimant\u2019s impairment was due to pneumoconio-sis.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Because we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision is both in accordance with the law and supported by substantial evidence, we deny the petition for review. In addition, we note that the record contains evidence of Claimant\u2019s pneumoconi\u00f3sis. Both Dr. Barney and Dr. Hawkins opined that Claimant\u2019s coal dust exposure contributed, at least to some extent, to Claimant\u2019s impairments. Dr. Goldstein also noted pleural abnormalities consistent with pneumoconi-osis in Claimant\u2019s May 2011 x-ray.</p>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
