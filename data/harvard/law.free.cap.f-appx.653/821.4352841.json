California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2011). Zamora has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Zamora\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivo-lous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED; counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein; and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2. Zamora\u2019s untimely motion to appoint new counsel is DENIED. <em>Cf. United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b843-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
