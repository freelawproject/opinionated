She contends that the district court clearly erred in calculating the loss amount under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). She asserts that the district court should have found her responsible for $166,653.12, the total amount actually paid by Medicaid based on a government witness\u2019s testimony and her own affidavit. Because the district court\u2019s loss amount finding was plausible in light of the record as a whole, it was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>582 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Adenuga argues that the 121-month sentence imposed by the district court-is illegal because it exceeds the 120-month statutory maximum sentence for the offenses. Adenuga\u2019s sentence is modified to 120 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>602 F.3d 313, 318 (5th Cir. 2010); <em>United States v. Vera, </em>542 F.3d 457, 459 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 164 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
