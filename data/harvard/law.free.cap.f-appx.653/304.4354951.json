That sentence is the result of a previous reduction from the original 235-month sentence as the result of a retroae-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tive amendment that lowered the Guideline for crack offense. Fernandez now seeks a modification of his sentence based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered most offense levels for any drug offenses by two points.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Fernandez argues that the district court erred in denying his most recent \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it did not adequately explain its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, gave excessive weight to his criminal history and relevant conduct, and did not adequately consider the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors or his mitigating arguments. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the \u00a7 3582(c) motion as a whole, considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and contemplated Fernandez\u2019s mitigating arguments, including his positive post-sentence rehabilitation efforts and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among similarly situated defendants; thus, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73 &amp; n.11; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009-10 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
