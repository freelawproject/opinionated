Harris is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">When Harris filed his claim for relief in the Southern District of Texas, he was incarcerated in Kentucky. The district court thus lacked jurisdiction to consider the \u00a7 2241 petition because Harris was required to bring it in the district where he was confined. <em>See Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426; <em>Lee v. Wetzel, </em>244 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-22\">Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal .is AFFIRMED. Harris\u2019s motion for release pending appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b825-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
