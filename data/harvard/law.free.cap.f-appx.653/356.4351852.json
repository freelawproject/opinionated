We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In 2012, Laura Lee and Brenton James Mastronardi defaulted on the loan on their home in Fort Worth, Texas. Wells Fargo Bank, the mortgagee, enrolled the Mastro-nardis in a forbearance plan to reduce their monthly payments for one year. The Mastronardis alleged that Wells Fargo agreed to modify their loan when the plan ended but later reneged. The Mastronar-dis further alleged that the denial of their loan modification application was the result of a conspiracy between Wells Fargo and two of its employees, Hector Estrada and Megan Marin, to lose and refuse to process the documentation necessary to complete the transaction. After Wells Fargo began the foreclosure process, the Mastro-nardis filed this lawsuit in Texas state court alleging breach of contract, conspiracy, fraud, and fraudulent inducement claims against Wells Fargo, Estrada, and Marin (collectively, \u201cthe defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The defendants removed the case on diversity grounds under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. They argued that Wells Fargo\u2019s principal place of business is South Dakota, and Estrada\u2019s and Marin\u2019s Texas domiciles should be disregarded because the employees were \u201cnominal parties ... improperly joined.\u201d The Mastronardis countered that they stated viable fraud and conspiracy claims against Estrada and Marin' and moved to remand. The district court held Estrada and Marin were improperly joined, dismissed the claims against them, and denied the motion to remand. The district court later dismissed the claims against Wells Fargo with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) for failure to prosecute. The Mastro-nardis timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AUd\">\n<em>I. Fraudulent Joinder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The Mastronardis first contend the district court erred in analyzing the sufficiency of their fraud and conspiracy claims against Estrada and Marin under the equivalent of the federal pleading standard instead of Texas\u2019s more lenient \u201cnotice\u201d pleading standard. The district court concluded that a recent amendment to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure made the state\u2019s \u201cfailure-to-state-a-claim rule ... substantially the same as the federal rule....\u201d The Mastronardis concede on appeal that their complaint \u201cmay not \u2018meet ... federal pleading requirements....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Under the fraudulent joinder doctrine, a district court may dismiss a nondiverse defendant who is made a party in order to defeat federal jurisdiction. <em>Flagg v. Stryker Corp., </em>819 F.3d 132, 136-37 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc). One of the ways a defendant may establish improper joinder is by showing \u201cthere is .no possibility of recovery by the plaintiff against [a nondiverse] defendant, ... mean[ing] that there is no reasonable basis for the district court to predict that the plaintiff might be able to recover against [a nondiverse] defendant.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Smallwood v. Ill. Cent. R.R., </em>385 F.3d 568, 573 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc). Wells Fargo argues that the federal pleading standard applies when a court considers whether a defendant is fraudulently joined. The Mastronardis\u2019 claims against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Estrada and Marin are insufficiently pled under either the federal standard or the revised Texas standard, which now tracks the federal standard. <em>See </em>Tex R, Civ. P. 91a.l; <em>Wooley v. Schaffer, </em>447 S.W.3d 71, 75-76 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, pet. denied).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>II. Rule 4.1(b) Dismissal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><em>\u25a0 </em>The Mastronardis next argue that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing their claims against Wells Fargo with prejudice<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for failure to prosecute. <em>See </em>Fed, R. Civ, P. 41(b). \u201cA dismissal with prejudice is an extreme sanction....\u201d <em>Berry v. CIGNA/RSI-CIGNA, </em>975 F.2d 1188, 1191 (5th Cir. 1992) (quotation marks omitted). We will affirm a Rule 41(b) dismissal with-prejudice for failure to prosecute where \u201c(1) there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff, and (2) the ... record shows that the district court employed lesser sanctions that proved to be futile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Affirmance also usually requires the existence of \"at least one of three aggravating factors\u201d including delay caused by the plaintiff (not counsel), \u201cdelay caused by intentional conduct[,]\u201d or \u201cactual prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Here, after dismissing the claims against Estrada and Marin, the district court ordered the Mastronardis to file an amended complaint alleging claims against Wells Fargo \u201cconsistent with federal pleading requirements \u201d The Mastronardis requested a three-day extension, which was granted, but failed to file an amended complaint. The district court ordered the Mas-tronardis to \u201cshow cause by an appropriate written filing ... why their claims in this action should not be dismissed.... \u201d The show cause order warned the Mastronar-dis that failure to comply \u201cmay result in the imposition of sanctions,\u201d including dismissal. The Mastronardis again failed to file. .</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">The Mastronardis admit their violation of the court\u2019s orders was \u201cinexcusable.\u201d They contend, however,, that with-prejudice dismissal was unwarranted because there was no inordinate delay in the case, nothing in the record indicates their conduct was \u201cwillful and deliberate,\u201d and the district court failed to consider imposing a lesser sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">While there is no evidence of intentional conduct in the record, the Mastronardis and their counsel offered no explanation in their motion for reconsideration for their failure to follow the district court\u2019s orders. They also do not provide any explanation on appeal except that their conduct was caused by the \u201cinadvertence\u201d of their attorney. We have held that there was no abuse of discretion in a Rule 41(b) dismissal with prejudice when a plaintiff provided no explanation for his inaction on a case. <em>Dillon v. Diamond Offshore Mgmt. Co., </em>46 Fed.Appx. 227 (5th Cir. 2002). A plaintiffs failure to give a meaningful explanation for failure to comply with a court order to file an amended complaint by a certain date may by itself justify a dismissal. Here, though, the district court first imposed a lesser penalty through a show-cause order, warning the Mastronardis that failure to respond to that order could result in dismissal. <em>See Callic v. Harris Cnty. Child Welfare Dep\u2019t, </em>757 F.2d 1513, 1521 (5th Cir. 1985) (providing that an \u201cexplicit warning[]\u201d is a lesser sanction than dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>On these facts, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the Mas-tronardis\u2019 case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\">. The Mastronardis also argue that the defendants did not \u201cclearly and convincingly prove[]\u201d that Estrada and Marin were improperly joined. This argument was not presented to the district court and is therefore waived. <em>See Texas Commercial Energy v. TXU Energy, Inc., </em>413 F.3d 503, 510 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">, The final judgment does not state whether the lawsuit is dismissed with prejudice. A Rule 41(b) dismissal for failure to prosecute, however, \"is a complete adjudication on the merits, and thus with prejudice\u201d unless the order states otherwise. <em>Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 994 (5th Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
