Stinson, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tallahassee, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee Elizabeth Vickers Addison, Addision Law, Florence, AL, for Defendant-Appellant</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b734-18\">Before JORDAN, JULIE CARNES, and EDMONDSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b734-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b734-20\">Troy Anthony Coleman appeals his convictions and total 210-month sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coleman pleaded guilty \u2014 pursuant to a written plea agreement \u2014 to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, possession with intent to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>and being a felon in possession of a firearm. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On appeal, Coleman first argues that the prosecution committed prosecutorial misconduct by allowing a federal agent to give perjured testimony during the grand jury proceedings. Coleman also contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress certain evidence. The government responds that Coleman waived each of these arguments when he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">A defendant waives all non-jurisdictional challenges to his conviction when he enters a knowing and voluntary unconditional guilty plea. United States v. Pierre, 120 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir. 1997). \u201cA defendant who wishes to preserve appellate review of a non-jurisdictional defect while at the same time pleading guilty can do so only by entering a \u2018conditional plea\u2019 in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">First, we reject Coleman\u2019s contention that he entered a conditional plea. Although Coleman\u2019s plea agreement provides that \u201c[t]he parties reserve the right to appeal any sentence imposed,\u201d nothing in the plea agreement preserved Coleman\u2019s right to challenge \u2014 no matter the ground \u2014 his underlying convictions. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2) (a conditional plea must specify the adverse ruling preserved for appeal). And Coleman has failed to demonstrate that either the government or the district court consented to a conditional guilty plea. See id.; United States v. Betancourth, 554 F.3d 1329, 1332 (11th Cir. 2009) (defendant\u2019s guilty plea deemed unconditional in part because the government had not consented to a conditional plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The record also evidences that Coleman\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the plea colloquy, the district court confirmed that Coleman\u2019s plea was not coerced and that Coleman understood both the charges against him and the consequences of his plea. In pertinent part, Coleman said that he understood that, by entering a guilty plea, he would \u201cgive up any defense that [he] might have to the charges against [him].\u201d On this record, the district court committed no plain error in accepting Coleman\u2019s plea as knowing and voluntary. See United States v. Frye, 402 F.3d 1123, 1127 (11th Cir. 2005). Moreover, nothing in Rule 11 required the district court to inform Coleman expressly that, by entering an unconditional guilty plea, he waived his right to appeal all non-jurisdictional defects. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">By entering a knowing and voluntary unconditional guilty plea, Coleman waived his right to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. See United States v. McCoy, 477 F.2d 550, 551 (5th Cir. 1973). Coleman also waived his right to raise on appeal his argument about prosecutorial misconduct during the grand jury proceedings. See Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 93 S. Ct. 1602, 1607-08, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) (a defendant who enters a knowing and voluntary guilty plea is unentitled to federal collateral relief based on allegations that the grand jury was unconstitutionally selected); United States v. Boniface, 631 F.2d 1228, 1229 (5th Cir. 1980) (defendant\u2019s guilty plea barred non-jurisdictional claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>that the indictment was \u201cclandestinely constructed by the United States Attorney after the grand jury voted on it\u201d and \u201csigned by the Foreman sep\u00e1rate and apart from the grand jury\u201d); see also United States v. Cain, 134 F.3d 1345, 1352 (8th Cir. 1998) (persuasive authority) (defendant waived claims of prosecutorial misconduct by pleading guilty).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">We also decline to consider Coleman\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel (many of which are raised for the first time on direct appeal), because the record is not yet sufficiently developed on these issues. See United States v. Bender, 290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir. 2002) (in general, \"we will not \u201cconsider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on direct appeal where the district court did not entertain the claim or develop a factual record\u201d). Instead, Coleman\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims are more properly raised in a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See United States v. Patterson, 595 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir. 2010) (a section 2255 motion is the preferred method for raising claims of ineffective assistance of counsel).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">. In a related appeal currently pending before this Court (Case No. 15-11679), Coleman challenges the district court's resentencing order, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b734-22\">. In his appellate brief, Coleman mentions in passing that the grand jury never found that he used a gun in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense. Because Coleman presents no supporting argument or authority on this issue, his claim is abandoned. See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., 739 F.3d 678, 681-82 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">. Because Coleman raised no challenge the voluntariness of his plea in the district court, we review this issue only for plain error. See United States v. Moriarty, 429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir. 2005). Under plain error review, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) the district court erred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. Id. at 1019.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b736-17\">. We note that Coleman has already filed an initial section 2255 motion. Because the district court considered and granted Coleman\u2019s section 2255 motion on only a single issue (whether Coleman\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by filing to file a notice of appeal), and dismissed without prejudice Coleman\u2019s other ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, Coleman seems not to be barred from filing' another section 2255 motion. See McIver v. United States, 307 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir, 2002) (\u201can order granting a \u00a7 2255 petition, and reimposing sentence, resets to zero the counter of collateral attacks pursued.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b736-20\">.
