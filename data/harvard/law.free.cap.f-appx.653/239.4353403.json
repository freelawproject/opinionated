He argues that the district court plainly erred in entering judgment under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years for an alien whose prior removal was subsequent to a conviction for an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as that term is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). If the alien\u2019s prior removal was subsequent to a conviction for a felony, as opposed to an aggravated felony, then \u00a7 1326(b)(l)\u2019s ten-year statutory maximum applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Medrano-Camarillo argues that his pri- or Texas conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, for which he received four years deferred adjudication of probation, did not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because his conviction did not result in a term of imprisonment of at least one year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He seeks that his case be remanded to the district court for resentenc-ing or, alternatively, for reformation of the judgment. The Government concedes the error but contends that remand for resen-tencing is improper because Medrano-Ca-marillo failed to show that the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Because Medrano-Camarillo did not object on this basis in the district court, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368 (5th Cir. 2009). To establish plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">We agree that the district court committed clear or obvious error in entering judgment under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). When a court places a defendant directly on probation, it has not imposed a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 368-69. Accordingly, because deferred adjudication probation in Texas does not impose a sentence of imprisonment, Medrano-Camarillo\u2019s prior Texas conviction cannot be considered an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In any event, nothing in the record suggests that the error influenced the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. Because the error did not affect Medrano-Camarillo\u2019s substantial rights, resentencing is not warranted. <em>See id. </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Nevertheless, because the judgment erroneously reflects that Medrano-Camarillo was convicted under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and because that designation has potential immigration consequences, remand for reformation of the judgment is proper. Accordingly, Medrano-Camarillo\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. We REMAND the case to the district court for the limited purpose of reforming the judgment to reflect the correct statute of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except- under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\">. The issue whether Medrano-Camarillo\u2019s prior offense is an aggravated felony hinges on whether a term of imprisonment was imposed and not on whether the offense is a crime of violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) &amp; (b). Additionally, Medrano-Camar-illo acknowledges that his prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense for purposes of the 16-level crime-of-violence enhancement under U.S.S.G.\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and that there was no error in the application of the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 277-78 (5th Cir. 2004). As Medrano-Camarillo asserts, the Supreme Court's recent decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015),is not implicated in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
