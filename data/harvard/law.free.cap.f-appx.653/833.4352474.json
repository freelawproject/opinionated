In March 2012, a federal court convicted Paz on his guilty plea to conspiring to commit bank fraud as charged in an indictment asserting a loss amount of more than $400,000. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1344,1349. Concluding that Paz was removable based on his conviction for an aggravated felony in which the loss exceeded $10,000, an immigration judge ordered him removed to the Philippines. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), (U), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed Paz\u2019s appeal. He petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review a final order removing an alien based on his conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir. 2001). But we may examine \u201cwhether the specific conditions exist that bar [our] jurisdiction over the merits,\u201d i.e., whether the petitioner is an alien removable for \u201ccommitting the type of crime that\u201d precludes our review. <em>Nehme, </em>252 F.3d at 420. We examine that question de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 421; <em>see Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 207, 210 (5th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-23\">The BIA relied on record evidence of the fraud count of Paz\u2019s indictment and of Paz\u2019s plea of guilty as charged in that count to conclude that Paz had committed an aggravated felony. <em>See Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 42-43, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009). This evidence showed that his victims\u2019 losses resulted from his crime. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-24\">We conclude that the record furnishes clear and convincing evidence supporting the determination of the amount of loss caused by Paz and the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he is removable as an aggravated felon and conclude further that this evidence was \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative.\u201d <em>Arguelles-Olivares v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 171, 179-80 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>see also Nijhawan, </em>557 U.S. at 42, 129 S.Ct. 2294. Consequently, we leave the BIA\u2019s ruling undisturbed and deny the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>petition for review. <em>See Arguelles-Oli-vares, </em>526 F.3d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
