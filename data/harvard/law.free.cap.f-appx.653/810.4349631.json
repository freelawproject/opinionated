By seeking leave to proceed IFP, Espinosa has challenged the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Amendment 782 reduced Espinosa\u2019s applicable guideline range to 135 to 168 months of imprisonment, which is higher than the 120-month sentence imposed. Because his sentence was 48 months below his original guideline range, his \u00a7 3582(c) motion sought a comparable reduction below his amended range and below the 120-month statutory minimum. However, the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure from the guidelines did not request or authorize a sentence below the statutory minimum, so the district court did not have authority to grant a sentence reduction below the statutory minimum. <em>See Melendez v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 120, 125-26, 116 S.Ct. 2057, 135 L.Ed.2d 427 (1996); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Espinosa\u2019s appeal does not present a nonfrivolous issue and has not been brought in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983). The motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5TH CIR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
