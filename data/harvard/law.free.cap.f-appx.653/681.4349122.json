On appeal, Defendant asserts that his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced based on a prior conviction for drug trafficking that was not charged in the indictment or found by the jury. Because Defendant\u2019s argument is foreclosed by binding precedent, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b703-22\">In 2007, Defendant was convicted in Massachusetts state court of five counts of \u201cpossession to distribute\u201d a Class B substance, and sentenced to 2 years of home confinement and 222 days of jail. The investigation into those charges revealed that Defendant had been deported in 1996, and as a result, he was later charged and convicted of illegal reentry of a deported alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He was subsequently removed to Jamaica in 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-23\">Then, in 2015, the U.S. Coast Guard stopped a suspect vessel heading toward Miami, Florida, which had 13 people on board, including Defendant. Officials with the U.S. Border Patrol determined that Defendant had been previously removed, and did not have permission to reenter the United States. Defendant was later charged and pleaded guilty to the present offense of illegal reentry after deportation subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>In anticipation of sentencing, the probation officer prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR assigned Defendant a base offense level of eight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Defendant received a 12-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) because he had been previously deported and had a conviction for a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b), Defendant\u2019s total offense level was 17. Based on a total offense level of 17 and a criminal history category of V, the PSR calculated a guideline range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSR stated that the statutory maximum for his offense was 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Of relevance, Defendant objected to the constitutionality of an enhancement based on the finding that his qualifying prior conviction was an aggravated felony because it was not alleged in the indictment or proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. At sentencing, Defendant conceded that his objection was foreclosed by binding precedent and, consequently, the district court sentenced him to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We review issues related to the constitutionality of a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">' A conviction for illegal reentry into the United States under \u00a7 1326(a) carries a two-year, maximum sentence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, if an alien\u2019s initial removal was subsequent to an aggravated-felony conviction, the applicable maximum sentence is 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in the context of \u00a7 1326(b)(2)\u2019s penalty provision, a defendant\u2019s prior aggravated-felony conviction is merely a sentencing factor that need not be charged in an indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Later, in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">More recently, the Supreme Court held in <em>Alleyne v. United States </em>that \u201c[ajny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2014 U.S.\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). In doing so, the Supreme Court specifically stated that it was not revisiting the holding of <em>Almen-darez-Torres. Id. </em>at 2160 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">While we have recognized that there is some discord between <em>Alleyne </em>and <em>Ap-prendi </em>on the one hand and <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>on the other, we have stated that \u201c[njothing in the facts or holding of <em>Al-leyne </em>indicates that it eliminated <em>Appren-di\u2019s </em>exception for judicial findings of prior convictions that increase a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1249-50 (11th Cir. 2014). And we have explicitly stated that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent unless and until the Supreme Court overrules it. <em>Id. </em>at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">Though conceding that his argument is foreclosed by binding precedent, Defendant asserts that the district court\u2019s finding that his qualifying prior conviction was an aggravated felony enhanced his statutory maximum sentence, but was not alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>in the indictment or found by a jury as required by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219. As noted, we are bound by the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until it is overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See Harris, </em>741 F.3d at 1250. Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
