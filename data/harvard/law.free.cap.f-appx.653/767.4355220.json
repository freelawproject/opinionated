See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(3). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b789-25\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Tax Court\u2019s orders of February 9, 2015 and March 2, 2015 be affirmed. On the record before it, the Tax Court properly determined Calvo\u2019s requests for review of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (\u201cIRS\u201d) denial of innocent-spouse relief under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6015 and his request for relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>from the deficiency notice under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213 were untimely. Calvo failed to show that the deficiency notice was not sent to his \u201clast known address\u201d on February 22, 2011. See Gaw v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, 45 F.3d 461, 465 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Because his request for relief from the deficiency notice came after the expiration of the period to seek such relief, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a), as did his request for review of the IRS\u2019 denial of innocent-spouse relief, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A)(ii), the Tax Court lacked jurisdiction over those requests, see Edwards v. C.I.R., 791 F.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
