The district court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting Jim from using social media applications and websites. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>720 F.3d 220, 224 (5th Cir. 2013). The record indicates that the district court imposed this condition because Jim used Facebook to convey a threatening message and ultimately committed an assault and battery that was precipitated by his anger related to Fa-cebook comments. <em>See United States v. Caravayo, </em>809 F.3d 269, 275 (5th Cir. 2015). The prohibition on social media is therefore reasonably related to the nature and circumstances of one of his supervised release violations and his history and characteristics, the need for deterrence of criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public from further crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(1). The condition does not impose a \u201cgreater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\u201d to deter Jim arid protect the public. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(d)(2). The condition is narrowed in both scope and time: Jim is only prohibited from using social media, as distinguished from the entire internet, and he is prohibited from doing so for five years only.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has' determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
