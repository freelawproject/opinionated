Castillo argues that the BIA erred in declining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen removal proceedings and- that, in the alternative, he was entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-18\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision whether to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen removal proceedings. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. </em>Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir. 2004). Insofar as Castillo argues that we retain jurisdiction because the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of relief violated his constitutional due process rights by denying him a hearing on the merits of his cancellation of removal application, Castillo received a full and fair immigration hearing and \u201cdiscretionary relief from removal ... is not a liberty or property right that requires due process protection.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-19\">Moreover, contrary to Castillo\u2019s assertion, our jurisdiction is not restored by a \u201cgross miscarriage of justice\u201d claim. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Castillo\u2019s reliance on <em>Ramirez-Molina v, Ziglar, </em>436 F.3d 508 (5th Cir. 2006), and <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000), is misplaced because these cases did not address whether we had jurisdiction to review a decision by the BIA not to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen immigration proceedings but, instead, considered whether a federal court has jurisdiction to consider an alien\u2019s collateral challenge to the reinstatement of a prior removal order. <em>See Ramirez-Molina, </em>436 F.3d at 510-15; <em>Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 492-95. Indeed, Castillo fails to cite any authority suggesting a \u201cgross miscarriage of justice\u201d exception to our lack of jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s failure to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Even if such an exception existed, Castillo does not explain how he suffered a gross miscarriage of justice. <em>See Ramirez-Moli~ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number><em>na, </em>436 F.3d at 514-16 (noting that there is no precise standard, for determining what constitutes a gross miscarriage of justice and dismissing petition for lack of jurisdiction after concluding that petitioner had not demonstrated a gross miscarriage of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Additionally, we note that even if the immigration statutes are subject to equitable tolling, Castillo has failed to show that such tolling would apply. <em>See Mata v. Lynch, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2150, 2156 &amp; n. 3, 192 L.Ed.2d 225 (2015) (expressing no opinion as to whether the immigration statutes allow equitable tolling). Castillo did not expressly argue before the BIA that the applicable time limitations for filing his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled and does not adequately argue in his petition for review that he is entitled to equitable tolling. <em>See Stroman v. Thaler, </em>603 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting that the burden of establishing equitable tolling rests with the petitioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
