He complains that he was denied procedural due process, based on <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), when his staff representative failed to obtain evidence that would have exonerated him from the charge of viewing pornography on a computer in the prison computer laboratory. Martinez asserts that after his disciplinary hearing and release from administrative segregation, he obtained new evidence that he presented in his final appeal to the Central Office which should have resulted in a reversal of the finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">\u201cIn an appeal from the denial of habeas relief, this court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law <em>de novo.\u201d Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir. 2001). Because Martinez lost earned good time credits, he was entitled to due process as recognized in <em>Wolff. See Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 563-70, 94 S.Ct. 2963; <em>Henson v. United States Bureau of Prisons, </em>213 F.3d 897, 898 (6th Cir. 2000). A review of the disciplinary record reflects that Martinez received all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>of the procedural process to which he was due under <em>Wolff. </em>The record shows that Martinez was given (1) written notice of the charges, (2) the opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense, and (3) a written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken. <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 563-70, 94 S.Ct. 2963.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Martinez cannot complain about the adequacy of his staff representative\u2019s assistance because he was not entitled to retained or appointed counsel for the disciplinary proceedings. <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 570, 94 S.Ct. 2963. Neither did Martinez show that he was illiterate or that the case was so complex that he was unable to present evidence. <em>Id. </em>His assertion made for the first time on appeal that he was not fluent in English is not subject to review. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Disc. Ctrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir. 2000). Because Martinez was not constitutionally entitled to representation, the failure of his staff counsel to seek a continuance did not result in a denial of due process. Further, the record reflects that Martinez indicated to the disciplinary hearing officer that he was prepared to proceed with the hearing, and he provides no valid explanation for his failure to request more time to obtain evidence. Martinez\u2019s argument, made for the first time in his notice of appeal, that the Accardi<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine required the Bureau of Prisons to provide him with adequate staff representation to. assist him in obtaining evidence is not subject to review. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc., </em>200 F.3d at 316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Martinez next contends that the new evidence he obtained conclusively demonstrated that he was innocent of committing the prohibited act. Martinez argues that, when the evidence is in conflict, the decision must be made based on the greater weight of the evidence,, which he contends proves his innocence and a decision otherwise would be arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The findings of a prison disciplinary hearing should not be disturbed unless they are arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Stewart v. Thigpen, </em>730 F.2d 1002, 1005 (5th Cir. 1984). We need not undertake a de novo review of the DHO\u2019s findings of fact and must consider only whether there are at least \u201csome basis in fact\u201d or a \u201cmodicum of evidence\u201d to support the disciplinary conviction. <em>Superintendent, Massachusetts Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). ,</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">The record reflects that the disciplinary hearing officer relied on the written statement and subsequent memorandum of the charging officer regarding her eye witness observation of the inmates who were involved in the viewing of pornography and photographs of the physical evidence subsequently recovered from the hard drives of the computer. The records shows that there was evidence presented that supports Martinez\u2019s disciplinary conviction. <em>See Hill, </em>472 U.S. at 454-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768. Contrary to Martinez\u2019s contention, we may not consider the weight of the evidence or make credibility determinations in reviewing the finding of guilt in the disciplinary proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768. Martinez has not shown that the disciplinary decision was arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Stewart v. Thigpen, </em>730 F.2d 1002, 1005 (5th Cir. 1984). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b857-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
