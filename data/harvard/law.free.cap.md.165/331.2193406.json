Pearson, </em>of <em>Baltimore v. Pearson, </em>and of <em>Pearson v. Ghingher, Bank Commissioner, </em>being, respectively, Nos. 14, 15 and 16 of the October Term, 1933, 165 Md. 273, 168 A. 122. If these deposits are not^uch moneys of the State, the decisions in Nos. 14 and 15 deny them priority over other deposits within the meaning of section 71-G of fhe Emergency Banking Act (chapter 46 of the Acts of 1933). On the other hand, if such deposits are moneys of the State, the decision in Eo. 16 determines that m&gt; priority exists within the meaning of section 71-G. As the decree held that no priority existed, the ruling is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
