Truong then moved to reopen his appeal, proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d), and stay proceedings \u201cpending adjudication of other related appeals.\u201d The District Court, while not addressing the IFP motion directly, denied relief and noted that the Bankruptcy Court had not granted IFP status, nor had Truong paid the required filing fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review the District Court\u2019s denial of Truong\u2019s motion to proceed IFP, dismissal for failure to pay fees and motion to reopen his appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>See Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 ex rel. Lou Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999); <em>Jones v. Zimmerman, </em>752 F.2d 76, 78 (3d Cir.1985). Having granted Truong leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, we must dismiss his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 if it is frivolous, i.e., if it has no arguable basis in law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">IFP determinations are to be made solely on the basis of indigence. <em>See Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1084 n. 5 (3d Cir.1995); <em>Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 n. 1 (3d Cir.1990). In the IFP application that Truong submitted to the District Court, he indicated that he had rental income of $3000 a month, two cars (though one had its \u201ctitle in litigation\u201d), \u201cless than $500 average\u201d in a bank account, and an IRA account worth $6000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Given that information, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Truong\u2019s appeal and denied his subsequent motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-14\">Accordingly, the appeal is devoid of legal merit and we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1041-11\">. We incorporate hereinafter the facts and procedural history of this case as set forth in our opinion disposing of Truong\u2019s related appeal, <em>In re Truong, </em>CA No. 08-3365.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1041-16\">. The IRA account\u2019s worth has apparently dropped by $2000 since Truong last 2 applied for IFP status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
