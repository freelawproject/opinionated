Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). On appeal, Gew maintains that Amendment 706 applies to him and argues that the distl'ict court previously did not determine the exact drug quantity attributable to him, only that it was more than the 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine necessary to qualify him for the highest base offense level of 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">When a sentencing guideline is amended and given retroactive effect, the district court, \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,\u201d may reduce a previous sentence under the amendment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under section 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">Gew originally received the highest base offense level of 38 under section 2Dl.l(c), which corresponded to distribution of more than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. This level was based on the district court\u2019s finding that Gew was responsible for just under seven kilograms of crack cocaine. While Gew raised objections to the drug quantity at sentencing (mostly about which alleged coconspirators\u2019 acts were attributable to him), he did not challenge the district court\u2019s ultimate drug-quantity determination on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">After Amendment 706, a base offense level of 38 corresponds to distribution of 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. So, because Gew was held accountable for just under seven kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering his guidelines range; and the district court committed no error in denying his section 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>1369 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that \u201ca base offense level of 38 still applies to defendants responsible for 4.5 kilograms or more\u201d of crack cocaine). Gew\u2019s argument that the court determined only that he met the threshold of 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine to qualify him for a base offense level of 38 plainly is belied by the record: the sentencing court stated that, even in discounting the drug quantities of certain co-conspirators, Gew still was responsible for just under seven kilograms of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Gew also argues that the district court did not explain sufficiently its reasons for denying his section 3582(c)(2) motion, including failing to say whether it considered the section 3553(a) factors. But because Gew was ineligible for a sentence reduction, the district court was not required to consider the section 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000) (record must demonstrate that district court considered section 3553(a) factors only if district court first determines that offense level should be amended).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-14\">. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, Amends. 706, 713 (2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">. While the district court failed to explain how it determined that Amendment 706 had no effect on Gew's sentencing range, the parties assume the denial was based on the quantity of crack cocaine involved; and this reason has support in the record. <em>See United States v. Mejia, </em>82 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.1996) (permitting affirmance on any ground with support in the record).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
