Raines based his motion on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court denied Raines\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, finding that he was ineligible for a reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, such that Amendment 706 did not lower the guideline range pursuant to which he was sentenced. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>appeal, Raines submits that the district court erred in determining that he was not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because his sentence was based on his guideline range calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201c[a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary elaborates that a reduction is not authorized if an applicable amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Because the district court sentenced Raines as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, we conclude that the crack cocaine base offense level played no ultimate role in his sentence, and therefore, the district court correctly determined that he was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the district court was not authorized to grant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reductions because, \u201calthough Amendment 706 would reduce the base offense levels applicable to the defendants, it would not affect their guideline ranges because they were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1\u201d), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Raines\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
