Socorro contends that the Board erred when it refused to reopen her removal proceeding. We deny in part and dismiss in part Socorro\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Socorro was admitted in November 2003 as a nonimmigrant visitor. In March 2005, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a notice to appear and charged Socorro for staying in the country past the authorized period. INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Socorro conceded removability and filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Socorro alleged that she was threatened and intimidated after she refused to falsify government payroll documents to pay individuals who supported Hugo Chavez.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">The immigration judge ruled that Socorro\u2019s application for asylum was untimely and, in the alternative, the application failed on the merits. The immigration judge found that the threats and intimidation did not establish that Socorro suffered past persecution, or the possibility of future persecution or torture, particularly when Socorro remained in the position for several months after the alleged persecution began and she waited more than a year to leave Venezuela. The Board dismissed Soccoro\u2019s appeal and her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">In March 2008, Socorro moved to reopen her immigration proceedings on the basis of a change in conditions in Venezuela. Socorro submitted statements from three acquaintances in Venezuela that Socorro had been harassed and threatened by the Bolivarian Circles. Socorro also submitted several newspaper reports that the Chavez government violated human rights and did not tolerate disagreement with its policies. The Board denied the motion as untimely and ruled that Socorro failed to submit evidence that was previously unavailable to prove that conditions in Venezuela had changed since her original removal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">In July 2008, Socorro moved the Board to reconsider as a \u201chumanitarian act.\u201d The Board denied the motion on the basis that Socorro failed to \u201cdem\u00f3nstrate any error\u201d in its previous decision. The Board explained that it lacked \u201cpower to grant equitable remedies or to confer general humanitarian relief on aliens\u201d in the absence of evidence that Socorro\u2019s removal proceedings were \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d or that she was denied \u201ca full and fair opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Calle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number><em>v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Socorro challenges the denial of her motion to reconsider on two grounds. Socorro argues that she submitted evidence to establish that conditions were declining in Venezuela. Socorro also argues that the Board failed to recognize it had authority to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen her removal proceedings, but we lack jurisdiction to consider that argument. <em>See Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The Board did not abuse its discretion by denying Socorro\u2019s motion. Socorro argued that the Board overlooked statements and newspaper articles that she submitted with her motion to reopen, but those documents do not establish that conditions have changed in Venezuela. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1331. In the absence of evidence that conditions in Venezuela had changed since Socorro filed her original application, she was not eligible for an exception to the time limit to file a motion to reopen. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i)-(ii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i)-(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Socorro also complains that the immigration judge and Board failed to consider her request for relief under the Convention, but she failed to petition timely this Court to review the order of removal. An alien must petition for review of an order of removal \u201cno[ ] later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The order of removal became final on August 24, 2007, when the Board dismissed Socorro\u2019s appeal, and her petition for review, filed on January 16, 2009, was untimely. We lack jurisdiction to review the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">We DENY the petition challenging the denial of Socorro\u2019s motion to reconsider and DISMISS the petition challenging the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
