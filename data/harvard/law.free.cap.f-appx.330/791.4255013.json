Young contends that the drug quantity finding was based on Investigator Brian Chaffin\u2019s testimony, which was hearsay, speculation, and inconsistent. Young argues that because he was cooking methamphetamine for his own use, he could not have been cooking methamphetamine as often as the district court found.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">The district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity is a finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005). Where a defendant is responsible for more than 10 but less than 20 grams of methamphetamine, a base offense level of 18 is appropriate. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl'.l(a)(3)(e)(ll) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">\u2018When a defendant objects to a factual finding that is used in calculating his guideline sentence, such as drug amount, the government bears the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1296.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-11\">Where there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance. Moreover, in estimating the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant, a court may base its computation on evidence showing the average frequency and amount of a defendant\u2019s drug sales over a given period of time. Thus, sentencing may be based on fair, accurate, and conservative estimates of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-13\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. The district court did not clearly err in holding Young responsible for at least ten grams of methamphetamine. Chaffin testified that Young stated that he would produce approximately three to four grams of methamphetamine per cooking session. Chaffin stated that during the two weeks preceding Young\u2019s arrest, he received daily complaints that Young was making methamphetamine. Moreover, Chaffin had been receiving complaints about Young making methamphetamine for months prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">Though complaints alone are inadequate in reliably estimating drug quantity, Young\u2019s statement that he would produce approximately three to four grams of methamphetamine per session makes it more likely than not that he produced at least ten grams within the two weeks preceding his arrest. It is also worth noting that there was extensive circumstantial evidence of repeat methamphetamine production, including bi-phase methamphetamine oil, a hot plate, iodine crystals, match books, \u201cHEET,\u201d hydrogen peroxide, and acetone on Young\u2019s premises. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Young was responsible for at least 10 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Young next argues that the district court did not have a factual basis on which to enhance his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(8)(C) for his mobile home methamphetamine laboratory creating a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor. Young concedes that methamphetamine laboratories are inherently dangerous, but contends that the government failed to prove that he ran his laboratory in a way that created a specific substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Taber, </em>497 F.3d 1177, 1179 (11th Cir.2007), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 949, 169 L.Ed.2d 781 (2008). The Sentencing Guidelines provide that \u201c[i]f the offense (i) involved the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine; and (ii) created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or an incompetent, [the offense level should] increase by 6 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 30, increase to level 30.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(8)(C) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Young\u2019s actions placed a minor at risk. A hazardous materials team was needed to clean up the property because the materials constituted hazardous waste. Moreover, Young had two children living in his mobile home, one of whom told Chaffin that he had to leave the house because the smell was so bad. Finally, Chaffin estimated that between six and eight children lived within 100 yards of Young\u2019s mobile home. The district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous, and it properly applied the enhancement. In addition, because the district court stated that the sentencing guidelines were advisory, any argument predicated upon improperly used judge-found facts to enhance Young\u2019s sentence fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Finally, Young argues that the harm to a minor enhancement resulted in an unreasonable sentence because he had no prior criminal history. He questions how it can be reasonable that he received a higher offense level increase under the enhancement than a criminal recidivist defendant. He suggests that the Sentencing Commission might be in a good position to set blanket policies regarding offenders, but courts are in a better position \u201cto fine tune\u201d a reasonable sentence for particular defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">We review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). Because Young\u2019s offense involved the manufacture of methamphetamine and created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor, his offense level would normally be increased by 6 levels, but because the resulting offense level was less than 30, the offense level automatically was increased to 30, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(8)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">Here, the district court\u2019s sentence was proeedurally sound as the court correctly calculated Young\u2019s guideline range, treated the guidelines as advisory, and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Additionally, the below-guidelines range sentence is substantively reasonable. The district court chose to sentence Young below the guideline range because the court found that it was unfair to raise Young\u2019s offense level to 30 instead of increasing it only by the 6 points he would have received if he had a higher criminal history category. The district court went on to note that his sentence was within the guideline range had he received only the 6-level increase for the harm to minor enhancement, rather than the automatic offense level of 30 that was otherwise ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>plicable. Therefore, the sentence Young now requests is actually the sentence that he received. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
