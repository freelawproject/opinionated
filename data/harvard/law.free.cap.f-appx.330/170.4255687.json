Spaulding and assistant federal public defender Clarence Counts. Rogozinski brought suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), alleging that Counts violated his civil rights by refusing to file certain pretrial motions on his behalf in the criminal case, that Judge Spaulding violated his civil rights by denying his request for new counsel in that case and requiring him to submit any further pretrial motions through Counts, and that Counts and Judge Spaulding conspired to deny him equal access to the courts. The district court dismissed his complaint \u201cfor reasons stated in open court\u201d during a hearing held in Rogozinski\u2019s criminal case, but did not issue a written order. On appeal, Rogozinski argues that the district court deprived him of due process due to bias and prejudice, and that the district court erred in failing to allow him to serve his complaint on Judge Spaulding and Counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-25\">A judge is absolutely immune from suit for actions taken in her judicial capacity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>unless she acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. <em>Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir.2005). Whether a judge\u2019s actions were taken in her judicial capacity depends on whether: \u201c(1) the act complained of constituted a normal judicial function; (2) the events occurred in the judge\u2019s chambers or in open court; (3) the controversy involved a case pending before the judge; and (4) the confrontation arose immediately out of a visit to the judge in [her] judicial capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Federal public defenders are also immune from civil rights suits arising out of alleged malpractice. <em>See Sullens v. Carroll, </em>446 F.2d 1392, 1392-93 (5th Cir.1971) (per curiam) (holding court-appointed lawyers were immune from malpractice suits); <em>O\u2019Brien v. Colbath, </em>465 F.2d 358, 359 (5th Cir.1972) (per curiam) (extending <em>Sullens </em>to civil rights actions against public defenders in federal prosecutions).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Judge Spaulding\u2019s ruling on Ro-gozinski\u2019s request for new counsel constituted a normal judicial function in a case pending before her. Her actions took place in open court and arose out of an appearance in front of her, during a hearing on Rogozinski\u2019s request for new counsel. Therefore, Judge Spaulding was acting in her judicial capacity and is entitled to absolute judicial immunity. Likewise, because Rogozinski\u2019s claim against Counts essentially alleges malpractice in the pretrial stage of his criminal case, Counts is also immune from a civil rights suit. Therefore, Rogozinski\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim for relief against either defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-19\">. Rogozinski does not address the propriety of the district court's ruling or the fact that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>written order was entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
