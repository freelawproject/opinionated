For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In June 2008, Hughes filed the instant <em>pro se </em>habeas corpus petition in the Southern District of Florida, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his petition, Hughes challenged the calculation of his applicable guideline range and argued that the court erred under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) by relying on impermissible factors, failing to consider Sentencing Commission reports about the crack/powder cocaine disparity, and imposing a sentence that was greater than necessary. Notably, Hughes acknowledged that the Guidelines were mandatory at the time of sentencing and that, although \u201csaid law was amended in 2005,\u201d it \u201cwas not expressly made retroactive.\u201d Hughes also asserted that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was an inadequate or ineffective remedy because he was procedurally barred from bringing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and because any such motion would be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">A magistrate judge issued a report, recommending that the district court dismiss Hughes\u2019s petition on the ground that \u201c\u00a7 2241 petitions may not be used to avoid either the statute of limitations or the prohibitions against successive motions to vacate as contained in the AEDPA.\u201d Hughes objected to the magistrate\u2019s report, where he essentially repeated the arguments from his \u00a7 2241 petition. He clarified, however, that his claim was based in part on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). The district court overruled Hughes\u2019s objections, adopted the magistrate\u2019s report, and dismissed Hughes\u2019s petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">\u201cThe availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that this [C]ourt reviews <em>de novo.\u201d Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cTypically, a petitioner collaterally attacks the validity of his federal sentence by filing a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1365. However, \u201c[ujnder the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). We have held that a petitioner may use the \u201csavings clause\u201d to \u201copen the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-11\">1) [his] claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3R\"><em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 &amp; n. 3 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">In this case, Hughes has not satisfied the <em>Wofford </em>criteria because his claim is not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. His attempt to use <em>Booker </em>and its progeny in this regard is unavailing because, as Hughes himself rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ognizes, <em>Booker </em>has not been made retroactive to cases on collateral review. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, nowhere in the litigation has Hughes asserted that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. Finally, <em>Wof-ford </em>explicitly rejects Hughes\u2019s assertion that the statutory restrictions on filing successive motions to vacate render \u00a7 2255 an inadequate or ineffective remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 1237, 1245; <em>accord Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1351 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (same); <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 945 (11th Cir.2005) (same). Thus, because Hughes was not entitled to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition through the savings clause, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\">. Though Hughes was convicted and sentenced in 1998 in the Northern District of Mississippi \u2014 for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine \u2014 he was serving that sentence in the Southern District of Florida. <em>See Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1495 (1 llh Cir.1991) (\"Section 2241 petitions may be brought only in the district court for the district in which the inmate is incarcerated.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
