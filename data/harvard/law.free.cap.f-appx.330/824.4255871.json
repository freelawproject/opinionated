On appeal, Oliver argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion because Amendments 439, 505 and 706 should have been applied to his sentence. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1050, 126 S.Ct. 1643, 164 L.Ed.2d 351 (2006). A district court may abuse its discretion by making an error of law. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). If the district court errs in applying the guidelines, we must nevertheless ignore the errors if they were harmless. <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 634 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c[Rjemand is required only if the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 202-03, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (quotations and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">Section 3582(c)(2) gives retroactive effect to particular amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that subsequently lower the sentencing range upon which an earlier sentence was based. <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1176 (11th Cir.2003). The relevant policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences provides that a sentence reduction is authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only where the applicable amendment to the Guidelines Manual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>is enumerated in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a); <em>United States v. Pe-laez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that only the amendments listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) may be applied retroactively using a \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion). Even if an amendment applies retroactively, however, a reduction in the term of imprisonment is not authorized if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Amendment 505 amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), by, <em>inter alia, </em>setting the base offense level for 1.5 kilograms or more of cocaine base at 38, where, previously, the level was as high as 42. U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 505 (2006). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, indicates that Amendment 505 is retroactively applicable. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). Amendment 505 became effective after Oliver was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Amendment 706, which also became effective after Oliver was sentenced and applies retroactively, provides for a two-level reduction in the base offense level assigned to certain levels of crack cocaine listed in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. U.S.S.GApp. C., Amend. 706; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Before Amendment 706 took effect, a defendant received a base offense level of 38 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) if he was held accountable for 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine; under the amended version of \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), however, a defendant receives a base offense level of 38 if he is held accountable for 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">On the record here, we are not persuaded by Oliver\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion. As an initial matter, Amendment 439 is not listed in the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on the retroactive reduction in sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Therefore, Amendment 439 may not be applied retroactively through a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, <em>see Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d at 1205 n. 3, and, therefore, any error of the district court in failing to consider Amendment 439 was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">We likewise reject Oliver\u2019s claim regarding Amendment 505. As the record shows, Oliver\u2019s total offense level was calculated to be 45, but because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5A n. 2 stated that an offense level of more than 43 was to be treated as an offense level of 43, Oliver\u2019s total offense level was set at 43. Based on a total offense level of 43, and a criminal history category of III, the guideline range was life imprisonment. Even with a reduction of Oliver\u2019s base offense level to 38, with the enhancements applied at sentencing in 1993, Oliver\u2019s offense level would be 43. With an offense level of 43, and a criminal history category of III, Oliver\u2019s sentencing range remains life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Chapter 5, Part A (1993). Thus, any error by the district court in denying Oliver eligibility for relief under Amendment 505 was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Nor would Amendment 706 affect his sentence. In Oliver\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion, he conceded that he was held accountable for 11.23 kilograms of cocaine base. Therefore, Oliver\u2019s base offense level would remain unchanged even after Amendment 706 revised \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) because he was held responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. In short, Oliver\u2019s sentence was not based on a range subsequently lowered by Amendment 706 and the district court lacked authority to grant him a sentencing reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>tion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the district court lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to grant a sentencing reduction to defendants who were career offenders sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because Amendment 706 would not ultimately affect their guideline ranges), cert <em>denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>United States v. Walker, </em>301 Fed.Appx. 844 (11th Cir.2008) (unpublished opinion) (holding that the district court lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to grant a sentencing reduction to a defendant who was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
