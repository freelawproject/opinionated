Johnson, a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion seeking modification of his term of imprisonment, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). On appeal, Johnson argues that, since Amendment 599 was designated for retroactive application, his sentence should be recalculated without the \u201c2 point increase for discharging a firearm during flight\u201d because that increase to his sentence computation was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">We review a district court\u2019s decision of whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). According to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court is permitted to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence if his sentencing range subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o). Amendment 599 became effective November 1, 2000, and amended the commentary to U.S.S.G. 2K2.4. U.S.S.G. App. C, Amendment 599. Section \u00a7 2K2.4 sets forth a base offense level for individuals who have violated, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. 924(c). Amendment 599 provides that, \u201c[i]f a sentence under [2K2.4] is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristics for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. App. C., Amendment 599. In this instance, John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>son\u2019s guideline range was adjusted upward per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, for reckless endangerment during flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s motion to modify, because his motion was procedurally improper. Section 3582(c)(2) only permits a motion to modify when a sentencing range has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by an amendment by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). Amendment 599 became effective November 1, 2000, prior to Johnson\u2019s sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, Amendment 599. Furthermore, the presentence investigation report applied the amendment by recommending no Chapter Two specific offense characteristic enhancements on the basis that Johnson discharged a firearm during the offense. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-15\">.
