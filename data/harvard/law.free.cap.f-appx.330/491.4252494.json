The district court\u2019s order, denominated \u201cJudgment,\u201d dismissed Tillman\u2019s constructive discharge claim and his claims based on events occurring before September 17, 2005. Other claims remain to be adjudicated. As Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) provides, \u201cany order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims ... does not end the action as to any of the claims.... \u201d Although the district court did enter a judgment on the claims that it disposed of, the court did not expressly determine that there is no just reason for delay, as required by Rule 54(b). Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Appeal DISMISSED. Costs shall be borne by Tillman.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
