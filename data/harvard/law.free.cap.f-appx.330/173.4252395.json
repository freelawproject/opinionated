Malcolm contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-31\">We review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1321 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>(11th Cir.2008). The Supreme Court has clarified that the reasonableness standard means review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to calculate or incorrectly calculated the guidelines, treated the guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court is not, however, required to discuss explicitly its consideration of each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors on the record. Instead, we ask whether the district court has \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 n. 8 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence\u201d under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence is substantively unreasonable if it is not supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 600. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1323 (quotation omitted). Further, we \u201cexpect a sentence within the Guidelines to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Here the district court\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. No one disputes that the district court correctly calculated Malcolm\u2019s guideline sentence range at 46-57 months. The district court did not treat the guidelines as mandatory. In determining Malcolm\u2019s sentence, the district court properly considered Malcolm\u2019s background, which included a criminal history of drug offenses (most recently conspiracy to distribute over : <em>\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u00a1j </em>kilograms of marijuana), in relation to the \u201crelatively minor nature of [his illegal re-entry] offense.\u201d The district court demonstrated a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for Malcolm\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">The district court further stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors but did not believe that a downward variance was appropriate in this case. Instead, the district court concluded that \u201cthe total picture of [Malcolm\u2019s] background\u201d justified a sentence at the low-end of the guidelines range. The district court\u2019s 46-month sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
