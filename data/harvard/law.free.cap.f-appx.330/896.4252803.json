Diaz argues that the Board should have <em>sua sponte </em>reopened his removal proceedings and its failure to do so violated his due process rights. We deny in part and dismiss in part Diaz\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b918-25\">Diaz entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor. Diaz conceded re-movability and applied for asylum, but later withdrew that application with prejudice and was granted four months to depart voluntarily. Twelve days before he was required to depart, Diaz moved to withdraw his request for departure and to reinstate his application for asylum. The immigration judge ruled that Diaz provided \u201cno substantial grounds\u201d to grant the motion and, in the alternative, that the motion was untimely to reopen his asylum proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-26\">Diaz filed a second motion to -withdraw and argued that he had agreed to voluntary departure under duress. The immigration judge treated Diaz\u2019s filing as a motion to reopen and denied that motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>as untimely and for failure to provide new facts that would affect Diaz\u2019s eligibility for asylum. The judge declined <em>sua sponte </em>to reopen the proceedings because Diaz had not alleged that any exceptional circumstances would warrant such relief. The immigration judge also ruled that Diaz\u2019s allegations of coercion by his counsel and the court were without merit because Diaz had knowingly and voluntarily decided to withdraw his application for asylum after the immigration judge found Diaz\u2019s application frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The Board dismissed Diaz\u2019s appeal. The Board ruled that Diaz failed timely to move to reopen his asylum proceeding; to provide a reason to exempt him from the filing deadline; or to provide a reason to reopen his proceeding. Diaz did not appeal the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Diaz twice moved the Board to reconsider. The Board denied the first motion on the basis that Diaz failed to establish that the Board made any legal or factual error in dismissing his appeal. The Board ruled that the second motion was barred as successive. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Diaz challenges the denial of his motion to reconsider on two grounds. Diaz argues that the Board should have reopened his asylum proceeding because the immigration judge violated his due process rights. Diaz also argues that the Board failed <em>sua sponte </em>to reopen his removal proceedings, but we lack jurisdiction to consider that argument. <em>See Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">The Board did not abuse its discretion by denying Diaz\u2019s second motion to reconsider. Diaz was not permitted to file a successive motion that requested the Board reconsider the denial of a previous motion to reconsider. 1NA \u00a7 240(c)(6); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)CA); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). We lack jurisdiction to review the orders of the Board in earlier proceedings because Diaz did not timely petition this Court to review those orders. <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">IV.CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">We DENY the petition challenging the denial of Diaz\u2019s second motion to reconsider and DISMISS the petition challenging the previous orders of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
