Agust\u00edn argues that the denial of his applications for asylum and withholding of removal, based on his failure to establish past persecution or a well-founding fear of future persecution, are not supported by substantial evidence. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">When considering a petition to review a BIA final order, we review legal issues <em>de novo. Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). Under this test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284. \u201cTo reverse a factual finding by the BIA, [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s order, so we review the BIA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">An alien may establish eligibility for asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) if he shows that he has suffered either \u201cpast persecution\u201d or has a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1255, 1257 (11th Cir.2008). To establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was \u201cat least in part\u201d motivated by race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2007). A well-founded fear may be established by show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>ing (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, (2) a reasonable possibility of being singled out for persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country, or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which he is a part. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2), (3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if he can show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). This standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum; thus, if an applicant is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard, he necessarily is unable to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Al </em>Najjar; 257 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The record here shows that the BIA did not expressly find Agustin\u2019s testimony to be incredible; instead, it found that the inconsistencies in his testimony and a lack of corroborating evidence undermined his testimony, preventing him from meeting his burden of proof on his asylum and withholding claims. Credible testimony of the applicant <em>\u201cmay </em>be sufficient to sustain the applicant\u2019s burden without corroboration.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii) (emphasis added); <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818-19 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In his brief, Agust\u00edn challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and asserts that his testimony established that he suffered past persecution, but he wholly fails to address the BIA\u2019s determinations regarding (1) the lack of corroborating evidence, and (2) inconsistencies in his testimony. In fact, other than citing the regulatory provisions and out-of-Circuit case law for the basic proposition that uncorroborated but credible testimony may be sufficient to meet an applicant\u2019s burden of proof, he makes no further mention of the issue of corroboration and does not explain why corroborating evidence was not needed in his particular case. Thus, Agust\u00edn has abandoned any challenge to (1) the BIA\u2019s reliance on the inconsistencies in his testimony and (2) the BIA\u2019s finding regarding the need to provide corroborating evidence. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a petitioner abandons an issue if he fails to offer argument on it); <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that passing references to an issue are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal, and such issues are deemed abandoned). Because the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of relief was clearly based on Agustin\u2019s failure to produce corroborating evidence in support of his weak and inconsistent testimony, and because Agust\u00edn has not addressed this issue on appeal, the issue is abandoned, and we are compelled to deny Agustin\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Nevertheless, even if Agust\u00edn did not abandon his challenge to the BIA\u2019s finding regarding the lack of corroborating evidence, he has failed to show that the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that reached by the BIA. <em>See Farquharson, </em>246 F.3d at 1320. We determined, in <em>Yang, </em>that the weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, the greater the need for corroborating evidence. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. Although the BIA did not find Agust\u00edn incredible, it found his testimony to be weak, in light of the numerous inconsistencies it specifically mentioned in its opinion. As mentioned above, Agust\u00edn fails to chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>lenge on appeal the BIA\u2019s inconsistency finding. Moreover, because Agust\u00edn testified that he had regular contact with his family in Guatemala, it appears that he could have obtained certain corroborating information, such as the three letters Agustin\u2019s father received from the Guatemalan government. In light of these facts, the BIA did not err in determining that Agust\u00edn failed to meet his burden of proof with regard to his application for asylum. Because Agust\u00edn failed to show that he was entitled to asylum, he also necessarily failed to meet the higher burden of proof required to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">For all of these reasons, we deny Agustin\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">. We also note that Agust\u00edn has failed to present on appeal any argument regarding his application for CAT relief, and has thus abandoned any such argument. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
