In 2003, Baker pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) and 846. The Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) determined Baker qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The district court adopted this factual finding in its judgment and assigned Baker a total offense level of 31, after concluding Baker was entitled to a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. In this appeal, Baker argues the district court did not sentence him as a career offender, and because he was never sentenced as a career offender, the district court should have granted him the two-level reduction based on Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and questions of statutory interpretation in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">In <em>Moore, </em>this Court addressed whether a defendant sentenced pursuant to the ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>reer offender guideline is eligible for sentence reduction based on Amendment 706. 541 F.3d at 1327. There, the defendants\u2019 offense levels were initially calculated based on the amount of crack cocaine involved. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. The defendants, however, were ultimately sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, which was not affected by Amendment 706. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the denials of their motions for sentence modification, holding, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">In this case, the PSI initially assigned Baker a base offense level of 38 based on his accountability for over 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which was greater than the offense level of 34 under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The district court, however, sentenced Baker under the career offender provision after finding that Baker was accountable for only five grams of cocaine base. The court assigned Baker a total offense level of 31, which included a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and sentenced him to 130 months\u2019 imprisonment, departing from the recommended Guidelines range of 188-235 months because of the Government\u2019s motion on account of Baker\u2019s substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Like the defendants in <em>Moore, </em>Banker was sentenced based on a range that was determined by application of the career offender provision. The offense level that would have applied under \u00a7 2D1.1, based on the amount of crack cocaine involved, ultimately played no role in Baker\u2019s sentence. Because Amendment 706 \u201cdoes not alter the sentencing range upon which his ... sentence was based,\u201d Baker is ineligible for sentence reduction. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
