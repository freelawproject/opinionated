On appeal, Welch argues his conviction is unconstitutional because the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt. He also contends his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">We review a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence <em>de novo, </em>considering the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government\u201d and \u201cresolv[ing] all reasonable inferences and credibility evaluations in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cThe evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with <em>every </em>conclusion except that of guilt, provided that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). In other words, \u201c[t]he verdict must stand if [there] is substantial evidence to support it, that is[,] unless no trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1324 (11th Cir.1997) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A4N9\">\n<em>A. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 8U</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">\u201cTo sustain a conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, the government must show that a defendant knowingly possessed the controlled substance with the intent to distribute it.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>433 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted). We conclude the evidence was sufficient for a jury to convict Welch under \u00a7 841. Two officers testified they saw a man in a black shirt and gold pants who fit Welch\u2019s description carrying a rifle and a blue backpack. Both testified they got a clear look at the suspect\u2019s face before he fled into an apartment building and both identified Welch at trial as the suspect. When the officers captured Welch less than a block away from the apartment building, he was wearing a black shirt and gold pants and one of the officers testified that he recognized Welch\u2019s face. This evidence, along with Welch\u2019s later acknowledgment that he possessed the backpack, supported the jury\u2019s finding that Welch knowingly possessed the blue backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">When the backpack was found in an abandoned apartment, it contained two large crack rocks, a large bag of marijuana, several pills, and two digital scales. Based on the testimony of a narcotics detective \u2014 that scales and weapons are tools of the drug trade and that the amounts of drugs contained in the backpack were consistent with distribution amounts \u2014 the jury could find that Welch possessed those drugs with the intent to distribute them. <em>See United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1392 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cIntent to distribute can be proven circumstantially from, among other things, the quantity of cocaine and the existence of implements such as scales commonly used in connection with the distribution of cocaine.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">\n<em>B. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 92tfc)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">Section 924(c) makes it a federal crime to carry a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\u201d \u201cA defendant carries a firearm if it is carried directly on his person or carried in his vehicle.\u201d <em>United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1128 (11th Cir.2005). To prove the \u201cin relation to\u201d element, the evidence must show that the firearm had \u201csome purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime; its presence or involvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2058-59, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993). We conclude the evidence was sufficient for a jury to convict Welch under \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The officers testified they saw Welch carrying a rifle several minutes before he was arrested. The officers found a 9-mm rifle in the same abandoned apartment where they found the backpack containing drugs. In his interview with an ATF agent, Welch described the rifle as \u201ca black nine-millimeter rifle\u201d \u2014 more detail than the agent knew at the time. From the evidence presented at trial, the jury could reasonably conclude Welch carried the rifle \u201cdirectly on his person,\u201d <em>Frye, </em>402 F.3d at 1128, and the presence of that rifle was not \u201cthe result of accident or coincidence,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>113 S.Ct. at 2059. Further, the evidence showed Welch was carrying the rifle and the backpack containing drugs at the same time and the rifle was loaded. This evidence was sufficient to prove the rifle at least had the potential of facilitating Welch\u2019s drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 841. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>131 F.3d 1437, 1439 (11th Cir.1997) (holding the evidence proved a \u00a7 924(c) offense where the defendant knew there were loaded guns in his car along with drugs because \u201cthe guns had the potential of facilitating a drug trafficking offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">\n<em>Q 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">To prove a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1), the evidence must show that (1) the defendant was a convicted felon, (2) the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm or ammunition, and (3) the firearm or ammunition was in or affected interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Palma, </em>511 F.3d 1311, 1315 (11th Cir.2008). We conclude there was sufficient evidence to convict Welch of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1). The parties stipulated to each element except for possession and the evidence outlined above \u2014 including the fact that the officers testified they saw Welch carrying rifle and Welch\u2019s own description of the rifle to the ATF agent \u2014 was sufficient to support a finding of possession. For these reasons, the evidence presented at trial, taken in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, was sufficient to support a verdict of guilt on all three charged offenses. Accordingly, we affirm Welch\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence imposed by a district court under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The burden of proof is on the party challenging the reasonableness of the sentence. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). Review for reasonableness has two steps. First, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Second, we must determine whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable based on the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>In undertaking this inquiry, \u201cwe recognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">In calculating a defendant\u2019s sentence, a district court must take the factors in 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) into account. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 757, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) These factors include, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, provide just punishment, and promote respect for the law; the need to deter criminal conduct; the need to protect the public from other crimes of the defendant; and the advisory Guidelines range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court must choose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to satisfy these factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We conclude Welch\u2019s sentence is reasonable. First, the district court followed the proper procedures in sentencing Welch. The district court correctly calculated Welch\u2019s Guidelines range. The court acknowledged it was not required to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range. After considering Welch\u2019s arguments and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), the court concluded that a 420-month sentence was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Second, Welch\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record indicates Welch has a long criminal history, including prior convictions for violent felonies. Therefore, Welch\u2019s sentence is reasonable based on the history and characteristics of the defendant and the need to protect the public from further crimes by the defendant. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(C). The sentence also provides just punishment for the offenses in this case and reflects the seriousness of Welch\u2019s crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). A 420-month sentence also has a significant deterrent effect on others who may wish to commit the same types of crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). Finally, Welch\u2019s sentence is at the low end of his Guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Welch\u2019s total sentence was \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to achieve the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">For the foregoing reasons, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt on all three charges and the district court\u2019s sentence of 420 months\u2019 imprisonment is reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Welch\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. Because Welch's 60-month consecutive sentence for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) is a mandatory minimum sentence, we do not review that portion of the total sentence for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
