Because Mejia-Lopez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to review Mejia-Lopez\u2019s challenge of the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under CAT. In his petition for review, Mejia-Lopez argues (1) he established both past and future persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, and (2) the IJ violated his due process rights by not allowing him to continue his testimony in support of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">On the merits of his asylum and withholding of removal claims, Mejia-Lopez argues that he established past persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group and/or his political opinion. The alleged past persecution was based on his cooperation with the Honduran police, which led to threats and an attempted abduction by a policeman. Mejia-Lopez also argues he has subjectively and objectively shown his fear of future persecution, as it was the Government of Honduras, specifically the police, that caused him to flee Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). In that case, \u201cwe review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, so we review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">\u201cWe review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We must \u201caffirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotations omitted). Under this test, \u201cwe view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>Accordingly, \u201c[t]o conclude that the [IJ\u2019s] decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d at 765 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">Any alien who is physically present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007); INA \u00a7 208(a)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security may grant asylum if an alien meets the definition of \u201crefugee,\u201d as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). The INA defines \u201crefugee\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-12\">[A]ny person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory refugee status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (11th Cir.2001). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, \u201cwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256. \u201cTo establish asylum [eligibility] based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Neither the INA nor the regulations define persecution. We have described persecution as an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Se-pulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations and citation omitted). In <em>Sepulveda, </em>we held that menacing telephone calls and threats to the alien, her family members, and colleagues did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The evidentiary burden for withholding of removal is greater than that imposed for asylum, so, if an alien has not met the well-founded fear standard for asylum, he generally cannot meet the standard for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">We have held that noncriminal informants do not constitute a particular social group. <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1198 (11th Cir.2006) (holding noncriminal informants working against the Cali drug cartel did not constitute a particular social group eligible for asylum and withholding; group of informants were both not visible enough, and, at the same time, were potentially too numerous or inchoate).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-9\">\u2018Particular social group\u2019 should not be a \u2018catch all\u2019 for all persons alleging persecution who do not fit elsewhere. In restricting the grounds for asylum and withholding of deportation based on persecution to five enumerated grounds, Congress could not have intended that all individuals seeking this relief would qualify in some form by defining them own \u2018particular social group.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">\u201cThe statutes governing asylum and withholding of removal protect not only against persecution by government forces, but also against persecution by nongovernmental groups that the government cannot control.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThus, evidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence ..., or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (holding evidence was consistent with finding that Columbian FARC guerilla group\u2019s harassing of petitioner for failure to cooperate did not qualify petitioner for withholding of removal under the INA). We have also held that targeting the wealthy for extortionate purposes was not persecution based on political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>opinion. <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3cl 815, 821-22 (11th Cir.2007) (holding aliens whose persecutors had murdered members of the family for refusal to pay a \u201cwar tax\u201d were not persecuted on account of political opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">We conclude from the record that the IJ did not err as a matter of law, and substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding, adopted by the BIA, that Mejia-Lopez failed to demonstrate a nexus between the threats and kidnapping attempt and a protected ground. The IJ considered the evidence Mejia-Lopez submitted in support of his case. The record does not compel the conclusion that the criminal extortion attempts against him were motivated by anything other than money, and because an applicant who does not qualify for asylum ordinarily will be unable to qualify for withholding of removal, <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93, we must deny the petition to the extent it generally challenges the denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Mejia-Lopez also argues his due process rights were violated because he was not allowed a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his behalf. Specifically, Mejia-Lopez argues that after a recess the IJ did not allow him to continue and expand his testimony and did not allow his wife to testify. Mejia-Lopez argues this deprivation caused him substantial prejudice because he was not able to complete the presentation of his testimony in support of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Review of constitutional challenges is <em>de novo. Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Aliens present in the United States are entitled to due process under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cIn order to establish a due process violation, an alien must show that he or she was deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted error caused him substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1222 (11th Cir.2003) (internal citations omitted). Under certain conditions, the deprivation of \u201cthe ability to present evidence on one\u2019s behalf in a removal proceeding would, under certain circumstances, constitute a due process violation.\u201d Fr<em>ech v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>491 F.3d 1277, 1282 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Mejia-Lopez has not shown he was prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s decision not to continue his testimony or allow his wife\u2019s testimony after the recess. The record is clear that the IJ considered Mejia-Lopez and his wife\u2019s application for asylum as well as all the documents filed in support of the case. After Mejia-Lopez\u2019s counsel could not establish or explain the required nexus between the threats and kidnapping attempt and a protected ground, the IJ likely felt the additional testimony would be an accumulation and a reiteration of their applications for asylum. Mejia-Lopez did not proffer or present any new facts or evidence to the BIA or here on appeal that might have changed or even influenced the IJ\u2019s decision. Thus, Mejia-Lopez has not shown the asserted error caused him substantial prejudice, <em>Garcia, </em>329 F.3d at 1222, and that his due process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">For the above-stated reasons, we deny Mejia-Lopez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
