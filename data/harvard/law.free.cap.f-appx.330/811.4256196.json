Mitchell pled guilty to distribution of cocaine base, the district court sentenced him to prison for a term of 151 months. On March 3, 2008, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he moved the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense level for cocaine base offenses, to reduce his sentence. The court denied his motion. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-17\">Mitchell argues that the district court erred in denying his motion because, although he was sentenced as a career offender, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, his original base offense level should still have been recalculated. He also contends that, because this court, in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), did not determine whether <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, <em>Booker </em>should be applied to reduce his sentence range and thus his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>Moore, </em>we held that, if the defendant was sentenced as a career offender, and the sentence range was not affected by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, then his sentence was not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. There, we noted that the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D 1.1 played no role in the calculation of the career offender sentence range for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. Thus, the district court was not authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>to reduce the sentence under Amendment 706. <em>Id. </em>at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Because Mitchell was sentenced as a career offender, the crack cocaine base offense level played no ultimate role in the determination of his sentence; therefore, the district court correctly determined that Mitchell was not eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706. Moreover, the court did not have authority to reduce Mitchell\u2019s sentence under <em>Booker. See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that <em>Booker </em>itself does not render a defendant eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Mitchell next argues that the district court erred by failing to appoint counsel for his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. We review the right to counsel in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding <em>de novo. U.S. v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793-94 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cA district court\u2019s decision not to appoint counsel is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Webb, </em>we held that \u201cthere is no statutory or constitutional right to counsel for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795. As a result, \u201cthe decision to appoint an attorney is left to the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
