INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Both the Board of Immigration Appeals and the immigration judge found Ye not credible. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Adverse credibility findings will be reversed \u201c \u2018only if the evidence \u201ccompels\u201d a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (quoting <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005)). An adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods in the applicant\u2019s oral and written statements. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Ye was not credible, <em>see Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001), and the immigration judge and Board provided specific and cogent reasons to support that finding. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. There were inconsistencies between Ye\u2019s filings and his testimony. Ye alleged in his application that he placed flyers promoting Falun Gong in mailboxes to avoid detection by officials, but he later testified that he distributed the flyers on a public street. Ye\u2019s later testimony was implausible because he knew that the practice of Falun Gong was illegal when he allegedly distributed the flyers. Ye also testified that the scars on his hands were caused by cigarette burns inflicted during his interrogation by Chinese officials, but the medical report Ye submitted stated that he had been \u201cburned by flame.\u201d When the immigration judge mentioned that Ye\u2019s scars resembled cooking injuries, Ye acknowledged that he had received some of the burns while cooking. The record does not \u201c \u2018compel\u2019 a reasonable fact finder\u201d to reverse the adverse credibility finding and conclude that Ye established eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">Ye\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
