Porter\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. The court denied Porter\u2019s motion because Amendment 706 did not affect his mandatory term of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), even though he received a downward departure under Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b). On appeal, Porter submits that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, but he acknowledges that his position is controlled by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2008), and provides that he merely is preserving the issue in the event the <em>Williams </em>is altered or reversed. Porter submits that <em>Williams </em>was decided wrongly because it overlooked that the Sentencing Commission used \u201cguideline range\u201d as \u201ca precise term of art,\u201d submitting that a \u201cguideline range\u201d is \u201cwholly distinct\u201d from a \u201cguideline sentence.\u201d Porter also argues that <em>Williams </em>offends the policy of encouraging defendants to provide substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-22\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">As Porter concedes on appeal, the district court did not err in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, even though he received a downward departure under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b), his sentence was based on the statutory minimum term of imprisonment, not his otherwise applicable range calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-42 (holding that the district court did not have the authority to grant Williams a reduction because Amendment 706 had no effect on his statutory minimum term of imprisonment, which had become his guideline range, even though he received a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
