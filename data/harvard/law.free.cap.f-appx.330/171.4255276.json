On appeal, Hughley argues that the district court erred in determining that he was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than under the drug quantity table set forth in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy Statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence modification is not consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statements where an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), we held that where a defendant\u2019s base offense level is calculated under the career offender provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), Amendment 706 does not operate to lower the defendant\u2019s guideline range and, therefore, the defendant is not eligible for a sentence modification under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We noted that a defendant who qualifies as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 may still be eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 where the district court determines that the career offender provision over-represents his criminal history and, thus, sentences the defendant according to the otherwise applicable guideline range set forth in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. We emphasized, however, that this would occur only where the defendant\u2019s offense level was determined by the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Here, any exception discussed in <em>Moore </em>does not apply to Hughley. At Hughley\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court calculated his base offense level pursuant to the career offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1. Although the district court departed downward from Hughley\u2019s base offense level by three levels in light of various factors, the court did not calculate his offense level based on the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) rather than \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Hughley\u2019s offense level and resulting guideline range were based on his career offender status, Amendment 706 did not operate to reduce his offense level. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. As a result, any exception discussed in <em>Moore </em>does not apply, and the district court correctly determined that Hughley was not eligible for relief under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1829-30. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
