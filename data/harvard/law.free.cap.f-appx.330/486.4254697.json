Guevara-Vielma argues that his within-guidelines sentence is unreasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 double counted his prior crime of violence and overstated the seriousness of the offense and the risk of recidivism. Guevara-Viel-ma also contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He notes that he is of advanced age and has a history of mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-17\">Because Guevara-Vielma did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence, the Government contends that Guevara-Viel-ma\u2019s challenge to his sentence is subject to plain error review pursuant to <em>United States v. Peltier.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Guevara-Vielma contends that <em>Peltier </em>was wrongly decided and that his sentence should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not determine, however, whether plain error review is appropriate in this case because Guevara-Vielma is not entitled to relief even assuming that he preserved the reasonableness issue for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-18\">Guevara-Vielma fails to establish that the district court erred by relying on \u00a7 2L1.2 to impose his sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Guevara-Vielma\u2019s sentence is presumptively reasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court heard Guevara-Vielma\u2019s arguments concerning his age and mental illness but elected to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>pose a sentence within the applicable guidelines range. The court\u2019s statements at sentencing reflect a concern over Guevara-Vielma\u2019s lengthy criminal history. Guevara-Vielma has not demonstrated that his sentence was an abuse of discretion by the district court or that his sentence is unreasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

This court in <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370 (5th Cir.2009) reiterated the importance of plain error review: \"Not every error that increases a sentence need be corrected by a call upon plain error doctrine. It bears emphasis that all defendants\u2019 appeals challenging a sentence rest on the practical premise that the sentence should be less. The doctrine of plain error serves powerful institutional interests, including securing the role of the United States District Court as the court of first instance, as opposed to a body charged to make recommendations to appellate courts.\" 564 F.3d 370, 378.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b509-20\">. <em>See United States v.
