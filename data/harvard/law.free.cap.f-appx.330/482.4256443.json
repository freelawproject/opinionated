Campbell, federal prisoner # 08471^124, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. Campbell, who is serving a 235-month sentence for a 1999 bank robbery conviction, sought to challenge his fine and restitution order. The district court determined that the claim could not be brought under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-26\">Campbell contends that \u00a7 2241 is the proper vehicle for bringing his claim because \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate or ineffective means for challenging the restitution order. Although Campbell is correct about the inapplicability of \u00a7 2255, he is incorrect about the availability of \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-27\">A challenge to the restitution or fine portion of a sentence is a nonconstitutional issue relative to sentencing that should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>raised on direct appeal and not for the first time in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>United States v. Hatten, </em>167 F.3d 884, 887 n. 5 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Segler, </em>37 F.3d 1131, 1135 (5th Cir.1994). A district court lacks jurisdiction to a modify restitution order under \u00a7 2255, a writ of coram nobis, or \u201cany other federal law.\u201d <em>Hatten, </em>167 F.3d at 886-87 &amp; nn. 3 &amp; 6. Further, a monetary penalty is not a sufficient restraint on liberty to meet the \u201cin custody\u201d requirements of \u00a7 2255 or \u00a7 2241. <em>Hatten, </em>167 F.3d at 887; <em>Segler, </em>37 F.3d at 1167; <em>see Spring v. Caldwell, </em>692 F.2d 994, 998-99 (5th Cir.1982); \u00a7 2241(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The district court did not err by dismissing Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the restitution order. <em>See Hatten, </em>167 F.3d at 887; <em>Segler, </em>37 F.3d at 1136-37. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
