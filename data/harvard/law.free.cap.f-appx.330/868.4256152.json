Ray argues that (1) the government breached the plea agreement by advocating a 10-year statutory minimum term of imprisonment at sentencing, despite the plea agreement\u2019s provision that a 5-year statutory minimum applied, and (2) his decision to proceed with sentencing, rather than withdraw his guilty plea, was involuntary because it was influenced by (a) the government\u2019s threat to withdraw its U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and (b) the district court\u2019s participation in the plea negotiations in violation of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">I. Breach of Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">Ray does not wish to withdraw his guilty plea; rather, he seeks to enforce the 5-year mandatory minimum set forth in the plea agreement. Ray notes that the government and the district court both stated, at the Rule 11 proceeding, that his applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence was 5 years. He contends that the five-year mandatory minimum penalty \u201cwas a material part of the consideration for [his] guilty plea\u201d and notes that, until the sentencing hearing, the government had consistently asserted that the applicable statutory minimum was five years\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, Ray contends that the government\u2019s advocacy, at sentencing, of a ten-year mandatory minimum breached the plea agreement, because it was \u201cfundamentally incompatible\u201d with the provisions of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">Although there was a misrepresentation at the plea hearing that the statutory mandatory minimum was 5 years, the trial judge corrected that error at sentencing and gave the defendant and his counsel the opportunity to defer sentencing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>hold a hearing addressing whether Ray would be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea. Ray declined, choosing instead to proceed with sentencing. Further, Ray did not object to the sentence after it was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Since his claims that the government breached the plea agreement were unpreserved by an objection during the sentencing, plain error review applies. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1425, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Under plain error review, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005). When a defendant challenges the government\u2019s breach of a plea agreement and the breach relates to the defendant\u2019s rights at sentencing, the defendant cannot show that he suffered prejudice unless he shows that his sentence would have been different in the absence of the breach. Puckett, 556 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 1433 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">In this case, the district court stated that it would have sentenced Ray to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, even if it applied the 5-year mandatory minimum set forth in the plea agreement. Thus Ray has failed to show that the alleged breach affected his substantial rights because he suffered no prejudice as a result of the alleged breach. Accordingly, he has failed to show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">II. Decision to Continue With Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Ray argues that he did not effectively waive his right to withdraw his guilty plea, because the waiver was not voluntary, in light of the government\u2019s threat to withdraw its U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion if he withdrew his plea. He contends that it is unconstitutional for the government to refuse to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion as punishment for exercising his Sixth Amendment rights. Ray secondly contends that his decision to persist in his guilty plea was unduly influenced by that court\u2019s statement that it had \u201cevery intention of giving [Ray] 120 months today.\u201d He asserts that this statement violated Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(c)(l)\u2019s prohibition on courts participating in plea negotiations. Ray argues that the combination of the breach of the plea agreement, the government\u2019s improper threat to withhold its \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and the court\u2019s involvement in plea negotiations constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">First, we do not construe the government\u2019s observation at sentencing that withdrawing the guilty plea might preclude the possibility of a future \u00a7 5K1.1 motion as a threat. Moreover, because Ray does not contend that he would have withdrawn his guilty plea in the absence of the government\u2019s \u201cthreat,\u201d Ray has failed to establish any prejudice to his substantial rights and thus failed to show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">Second, we find no merit to Ray\u2019s argument that the district court impermis-sibly participated in the plea negotiations. Because Ray bases his Rule 11 challenge solely on comments the district court made during sentencing, rather than during the plea bargaining process, and because we have never applied Rule 11 to a district court\u2019s post-plea comments, Ray has failed to establish plain error. Accordingly, we affirm Ray\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
