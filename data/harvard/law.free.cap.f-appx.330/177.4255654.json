Ingram\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Ingram argues the district court erred in finding he was not eligible for a sentence reduction because he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Ingram asserts a sentence reduction was warranted in his case because (1) mitigating circumstances surrounded his offense and (2) there are unwarranted disparities between the sentences imposed for crack and powder cocaine offenses, as recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. <em>558, 169 </em>L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Finally, Ingram argues that, at his original sentencing, the district court erred in finding he was responsible for more than 50 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-16\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not consistent with applicable policy statements \u2014 and, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). This occurs where a defendant was sentenced to a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>mandatory minimum sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 TB1.10, cmt. n. 1(A); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we determine Ingram\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent. We have held a district court lacks authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which was set pursuant to a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. Thus the district court correctly determined a sentence reduction was not warranted because Ingram was sentenced pursuant to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, which was not affected by the application of Amendment 706. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-42. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough </em>did not provide the district court with an independent jurisdictional basis to reduce Ingram\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005). Finally, even if the district court had possessed jurisdiction to reduce Ingram\u2019s sentence, it would have been improper for the court to reconsider the amount of crack cocaine for which he was held responsible at his original sentencing. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that all other guideline decisions made during the original sentencing remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing). For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Ingram\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
