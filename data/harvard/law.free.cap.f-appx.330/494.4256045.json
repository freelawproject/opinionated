Gasa-way appeals his within-guidelines sentence of 135 months of imprisonment, arguing that the sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to provide adequate reasons for his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Because Gasaway did not object at sentencing to the adequacy of the court\u2019s reasons for the sentence, this issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099). Even if the district court failed to adequately explain its reasons for rejecting Gasaway's request for a downward departure, Gasaway has not demonstrated how any error affected his substantial rights; that is, he has not shown that the purported error affected or \u201cundermine[d] confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364. Thus, Gasaway has not met the plain error standard. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-12\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
