(\u201cCosta Crociere\u201d), the carrier/vessel operator of a cruise ship aboard which Krupski allegedly suffered an injury. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b915-21\">In January 2007, Krupski\u2019s South Carolina-based travel agent booked a cruise for Krupski, a Michigan resident, through Costa Cruise Lines N.V., LLC (\u201cCosta Cruise\u201d) in Hollywood, Florida. The travel agent received from Costa Cruise Krupski\u2019s \u201cTravel Documents,\u201d which listed Costa Cruise\u2019s Florida address on the second page. Krupski also received an eleven-page passenger ticket containing \u201cGeneral Conditions of Passenger Ticket Contract\u201d (\u201cthe Ticket\u201d), which required that any suit be filed within one year of the date of any alleged injury. The term \u201cCarrier\u201d was defined to include Costa Crociere, various agents onboard the vessel, and the ship\u2019s manufacturer. On February 18, 2007, Krupski departed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Fort Everglades, Florida, aboard the cruise ship Costa Magica. Three days later, Krupski allegedly tripped over a camera cable in the ship\u2019s theater and suffered a fractured femur.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">By letter of July 2, 2007, Krupski\u2019s counsel provided notice of the injury to Costa Cruise in Hollywood, Florida. In response, Krupski\u2019s counsel received a letter from the Claims Administrator for Costa Cruise seeking additional information for pre-suit settlement purposes. After unsuccessful pre-suit settlement efforts, Krupski sued Costa Cruise. One year and four days after Krupski\u2019s alleged injury, Costa Cruise answered, stating that it was merely the North American sales and booking agent for the carrier/vessel operator, Costa Crociere. The district court entered orders allowing Krupski to amend her complaint, adding Costa Crociere as a party and dismissing the suit against Cos-ta Cruise. Represented by the same law firm as Costa Cruise, Costa Crociere moved to dismiss, arguing that it had been sued after the one-year period allowed for claims as set forth in the Ticket, and that the Amended Complaint did not \u201crelate back\u201d under Rule 15(c)(1)(C), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Krupski appeals the dismissal, contending that her failure to sue Costa Crociere was merely the result of \u201cmistake\u201d as contemplated by Rule 15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). We review a district court\u2019s application of Rule 15(c) for abuse of discretion but review findings of fact necessary for application of the Rule for clear error. <em>Cliff v. Payco Gen. Am. Credits, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 1113, 1121 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Rule 15(c) provides, in pertinent part, that an amended pleading \u201crelates back\u201d to the date of the original pleading when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-9\">(B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out \u2014 or attempted to be set out \u2014 in the original pleading; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-10\">(C) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-11\">(i) received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-12\">(ii) knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Because the parties agreed that Rule 15(c)(l)(B)\u2019s requirement had been satisfied, the dispute focused on the criteria set forth in Rule 15(c)(l)(C)(i) and (ii) \u2014 whether Costa Crociere \u201creceived such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits,\u201d and \u201cknew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d The district coui-t found that Costa Crociere met Rule 15(c)(l)(C)(i)\u2019s requirement, having received timely constructive notice of the suit based on its sufficient \u201cidentity of interest\u201d with Costa Cruise and their shared counsel. However, the district court granted Costa Croci-ere\u2019s motion on the basis that there was no \u201cmistake,\u201d under the meaning of the rule, in failing to name Costa Crociere earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of Rule 15(c) is to permit amended complaints to relate back to original filings for statute of limitations purposes when the amended complaint is correcting a mistake about the identity of the defendant.\u201d <em>Powers v. Graff, </em>148 F.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). However, mere lack of knowledge of the proper party is not enough. <em>See id. </em>at 1226-27. \u201cNothing in [Rule 15(c) ] or in the [Advisory Committee] Notes indicates that the provision applies to a plaintiff who was fully aware of the potential defendant\u2019s identity but not of its responsibility for the harm alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227 (internal quotations omitted). \u201cEven the most liberal interpretation of \u2018mistake\u2019 cannot include a deliberate decision not to sue a party whose identity [the] plaintiff knew from the outset.\u201d /(\u00bf.(internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Using February 21, 2007 as the date of Krupski\u2019s alleged injury, Costa Crociere concedes that Krupski brought her original action against Costa Cruise within the one-year period. The determinative question is whether Krupski\u2019s suit against Costa Cruise rather than Costa Crociere was the result of a \u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity\u201d as contemplated by Rule 15(c)(1)(C). Krupski concedes that if suing Costa Cruise, and not Costa Crociere, was a deliberate choice, no \u201cmistake\u201d occurred and the suit against Costa Crociere is time-barred. (Reply Br. at 2). According to Krupski, numerous \u201cCosta\u201d corporations exist and she always intended to sue the correct party.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Krupski\u2019s core argument is that the district court based its conclusion that Costa Crociere was known to Krupski all along because of information provided by Costa Cruise in its Answer, Corporate Disclosure Statement, and Summary Judgment Motion, which conclusion was erroneous because Costa Cruise filed all of those documents after the one-year limitations period expired. Undisputed, however, is that Krupski kept her Ticket and furnished it to counsel shortly after her alleged injury. Costa Crociere, not Costa Cruise, was clearly identified in the Ticket\u2019s definition of \u201cCarrier.\u201d The identity and knowledge of Costa Crociere as a potential party shortly after the alleged injury, therefore, must be imputed to Krupski and her counsel. Indeed, Krupski conceded before the district court that under the plain language of the Ticket, Costa Cruise could not be the Carrier. We agree with the district court that this is not a case about simple mistake of identity or misnomer\u2014 to the contrary, Krupski chose to sue one potential party and not another even though the identity of both was known to her. <em>See Wayne v. Jarvis, </em>197 F.3d 1098, 1103 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted) (Rule 15(c)\u2019s mistake proviso is included \u201cto resolve \u2018the problem of a misnamed defendant\u2019 and allow a party \u2018to correct a formal defect such as a misnomer or mis-identifieation\u2019 \u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by Manders v. Lee, </em>338 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Yet even assuming that she first learned of Costa Crociere\u2019s identity as the correct party from Costa Cruise\u2019s Answer (filed on February 25, 2008), Krupski failed to seek leave to amend her complaint until June 13, 2008 (133 days after she brought the original action) and did not file her Amended Complaint until July 11, 2008. Krupski offers no reason for this delay, and we expect she knew that the limitations period ran on February 21, 2008. Thus, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to her, Krupski fails to show how the district court clearly erred in its fact-finding or abused its discretion in applying Rule 15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not err in concluding that Krup-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>ski\u2019s amendment adding Costa Crociere as a party was not due to the kind of mistaken identity addressed by Rule 15(c). The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-14\">. Costa Crociere sought dismissal of the action pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6), 15, and 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Because the parties recognized and treated the motion as one for summary judgment, the district court afforded the parties the opportunity to present all material pertinent to the motion as required by Rule 12(d) and considered the motion as one for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
