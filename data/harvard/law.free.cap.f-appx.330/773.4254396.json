On appeal, Anderson argues that <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), was wrongly decided. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-17\">A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction pursuant to a motion filed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). However, where, as here, the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, our review is <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-18\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-19\">A defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1, such as the career-offender guideline section of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)) (stating that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where the \u201camendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d). Where the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 \u201cplay[ ] no role\u201d in the calculation of the guideline range, the defendant is not entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief under Amendment 706. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Here, just as in <em>Moore, </em>Anderson was not sentenced under the base offense level in \u00a7 2D 1.1, and, therefore, he was ineligible for \u00a7 3582 relief under Amendment 706. Anderson\u2019s arguments that we decided <em>Moore </em>incorrectly and should modify it are meritless, and we are bound to follow our prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008). Additionally, district courts are not required to hold <em>de novo </em>sentencing hearings for all career offenders based on Amendment 706 because a sentencing hearing is warranted only if the amendment lowered a defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). And even if the district court held a resen-tencing hearing, it would not be a <em>de novo </em>hearing because all original sentencing determinations remain the same, except for the amended guideline section. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that proceedings under \u00a7 3582 do not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resen-tencing, and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged\u201d). Finally, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not provide a jurisdictional basis for \u00a7 3582 relief, and Anderson\u2019s argument that the Guidelines now are advisory under <em>Booker </em>is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that <em>Booker </em>did not provide a jurisdictional basis to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying \u00a7 3582 relief, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
