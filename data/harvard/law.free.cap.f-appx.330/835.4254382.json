For the reasons set forth below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b858-19\">With his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT, Hern\u00e1n submitted, <em>inter\u2022 alia: </em>(1) a letter from Mariano Paz Ospino, a Conservative Party member of the Chamber of Representatives, indicating that Hern\u00e1n had worked on his campaign; (2) an undated letter from the FARC, asking Hern\u00e1n and Gloria to join its struggle by making a payment and indicating that it \u201c[knew] about [Hernan\u2019s] great spirit of collaboration with the poor people of [Colombia] because of [his] position in the chamber of representatives [of Congress]\u201d; (3) an undated letter from the FARC, indicating that, because he had not complied with its request for payment, his family had been declared military targets, such that he had 15 days to pay or else the FARC \u201c[would] have to defend [its] interests in [its] own way and [Hern\u00e1n would] have to accept the consequences\u201d; (4) a police report, dated February 27, 2003, indicating that Her-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>nan had complained that he received two threatening letters from the FARC, in one of which the FARC indicated that Her-nan\u2019s family had been declared military targets because he had not complied with the FARC\u2019s requests for economic requests, and intimidating calls from the FARC; and (5) a notice indicating that Hern\u00e1n had reported to the Human Rights Office that the FARC had threatened the lives of Gloria, Angelica, and a second daughter, Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">At a hearing, Hern\u00e1n testified as follows. He worked for Ospino, arranging political meetings and fairs and sporting events designed to get people interested in Ospino, and had been persecuted by the FARC because of this work. Specifically, (1) on July 22, 2002, he received a letter from the FARC demanding money; (2) on October 2, 2002, he received a call from a member of the FARC, reminding Hern\u00e1n of the contents of the previous letter and demanding that Hern\u00e1n cease his political activity; (3) on January 6, 2003, he received a call from a member of the FARC, inviting him to a meeting in the mountains; (4) on February 25, 2003, he received a letter from the FARC, informing him that the family had been declared military targets; and (4) in early March 2003, he received a call from a member of the FARC, who said, \u201c[Y]ou son of a bitch, you think you can make fun of us. [Since] neither the letters nor the [calls] have been able to make you see the light and do what we want you to do, I\u2019m going to kill you and all your family.\u201d Because of the persecution, the Petitioners decided to flee.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The IJ denied relief, reasoning that (1) Hernan\u2019s claims were incredible, as the letter from Ospino, the letters from the FARC, and the police report showed that the FARC was interested in money only; (2) the Petitioners had not demonstrated the requisite nexus between the FARC\u2019s acts and a protected ground; (3) the FARC\u2019s acts did not rise to the level of persecution; (4) because the Petitioners could not establish asylum eligibility, they also could not establish withholding-of-removal eligibility; and (5) the Petitioners had presented no evidence establishing CAT eligibility. The BIA affh\u2019med, echoing the IJ\u2019s reasoning and additionally reasoning that the Petitioners had not established eligibility for relief based on a pattern and practice of the FARC persecuting similarly situated individuals, because they had not demonstrated the requisite nexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, but issues a separate opinion, as here, we review the BIA\u2019s opinion \u201cexcept to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). When reviewing the BIA\u2019s opinion, we review legal determinations <em>de novo </em>and factual determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence test.\u201d <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (regarding denials of relief); <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006) (regarding adverse credibility determination). Under this test, which is \u201chighly deferential,\u201d we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). In order to reverse a finding of fact, \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">A. Adverse Credibility Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">As the trier of fact, the IJ \u201cmust determine credibility, and [we] may not substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>tute [our] judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). The credible testimony of the applicant \u201cmay be sufficient to sustain the applicant\u2019s burden \"without corroboration.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818-19 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). If the applicant offers such evidence, the IJ must consider it. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Once the IJ makes an adverse credibility determination, the burden is on the applicant to show that the determination \u201cwas not supported by specific, cogent reasons.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. The IJ\u2019s reason was sufficiently specific, in that he referenced and discussed the specific pieces of documentary evidence that demonstrated the inconsistency and supported his finding. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286. The IJ\u2019s reason also was cogent. <em>See id. </em>The pieces of documentary evidence that support the Petitioners\u2019 claim of persecution include a letter from the FARC asking for a donation, a letter from the FARC reminding Hern\u00e1n of its request for a donation, a police report from February 2003 referencing these letters and certain calls from the FARC, and a notice from the Human Rights Office noting that Hern\u00e1n had reported the death threats from the FARC. This documentary evidence demonstrates that the FARC targeted Hern\u00e1n and his family because it wanted money. Although the first letter mentioned above referred to Hernan\u2019s employment with the Chamber of Representatives, it seemed to do so as a means of pointing out that Hern\u00e1n was familiar with helping the poor and, thus, should donate to the FARC, rather than as a threat against his political activity. Conversely, the only evidence presented that suggests that the FARC was motivated by Hernan\u2019s political activity is Hernan\u2019s testimony that a member of the FARC called him on October 2, 2002, and told him to cease his political activity. Although this evidence of political motivation is weak when compared to the above evidence of a solely economical motivation, especially since the police report was made after the October 2, 2002, call and yet still did not mention the FARC\u2019s alleged political motivation, the Petitioners failed to present corroborating evidence to support the testimony. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. Thus, the IJ reasonably found that, because Hernan\u2019s testimony did not match the only documentary evidence offered, it was not believable. Accordingly, we deny the petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">B. Asylum &amp; Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for, <em>inter alia, </em>asylum and withholding of removal. INA \u00a7\u00a7 208(a)(1), 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(1), 1231(b)(3)(A), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). To qualify for asylum, the alien must prove that he is a refugee. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). A refugee is defined in the INA as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish refugee status, the alien must establish, through specific, detailed facts, (1) his past persecution on account of a protected ground, or (2) his \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that he will be persecuted in the future on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. A well-founded fear of future persecution may be established by showing (1) past persecution that creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a protected ground, (2) a reasonable possibility of personal persecution based on a protected ground, or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting a group of similarly situated people, to which the petitioner belonged, on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (b)(2)(f) and (iii). Regarding the nexus element of the standard, the applicant must demonstrate that one of the enumerated grounds \u201cwas or will be at least <em>me central reason </em>for persecuting\u201d him. INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)\u00ae (emphasis added). We specifically have held that persecution by a guerilla group for refusing to make extortion payments or pay \u201cwar taxes\u201d is not persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 821-22 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">To qualify for withholding of removal, the alien similarly must show that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). Because the more-likely-than-not standard that applies to withholding of removal claims is more stringent than the well-founded-fear standard that applies to asylum claims, ineligibility for asylum generally precludes withholding of removal eligibility. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1283-84. The Petitioners failed to establish a requisite nexus between the FARC\u2019s acts and a protected ground. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7\u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 208(b)(1)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1)(B)\u00ae. As discussed above, the only credible evidence offered demonstrates that the FARC was motivated by monetary concerns only. Efforts to extort, even when the money is intended for use by a politically focused organization, are not equivalent to a persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Rivera, </em>487 F.3d at 821-22. Thus, the Petitioners could not establish past persecution on account of a protected ground or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground, either because Hern\u00e1n would be singled out in the future for persecution or because the FARC has a pattern and practice of persecuting political opponents such as Hern\u00e1n, as both standards require proof of a nexus. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)(2)\u00ae, (iii); <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the Petitioners were not eligible for asylum. Likewise, both because the Petitioners could not establish a nexus and did not merit asylum, the Petitioners were not eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. Accordingly, we deny the petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">C. CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">We will not consider arguments presented before the IJ or BIA but not discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>on appeal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201c[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d). On appeal, the Petitioners do not argue that they are eligible for CAT relief. Therefore, they have abandoned the issue. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-11\">. Because the Petitioners could not establish the requisite nexus, we need not address whether the FARC's acts rose to the level of persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
