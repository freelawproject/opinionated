He appeals the sentence, arguing that it is (1) proeedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider his minor role in the offense and impermissibly took into account a gun and body armor found at his home, and (2) substantively unreasonable because his role in the crime was less than that of his co-conspirator.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Our reasonableness reviews consist of two steps. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we determine whether the district court committed a significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines sentence range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines sentence range. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Second, if the district court did not commit a procedural error, we consider the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597). We \u201cmay find that a district court has abused its considerable discretion if it has weighed the factors in a manner that demonstrably yields an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. In other words, if the district court made a clear error in judgment in weighing the sentencing factors, we remand the case for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>While a sentence within the Guidelines sentence range is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, we \u201cordinarily would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence in this case. It correctly applied the sentencing procedures and did not consider any impermissible factors. Further, it gave due consideration to the characteristics of the offense and the defendant\u2019s status as a career offender and thus imposed a substantively reasonable sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-10\">. Beasley does not expressly argue in his brief that his sentence was calculated improperly or that he was improperly denied a minor or minimal role reduction. Accordingly, we deem any claim in this respect to be waived. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
