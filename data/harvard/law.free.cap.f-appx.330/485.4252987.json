Brown, Jr., federal prisoner # 04437-043, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute crack cocaine. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence. The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, and we review the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Amendment 706 modified the guidelines ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>526 F.3d 852, 861 (5th Cir.2008). In general, the effect of Amendment 706 is to decrease by two levels the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1; U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706. However, the base offense level for offenses involving 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine remained unchanged. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The district court\u2019s refusal to reduce Brown\u2019s sentence based on an inapplicable amendment to the Guidelines was not an abuse of discretion. To the extent that Brown argues that the district court improperly treated the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we do not reach this argument because Brown was not eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
