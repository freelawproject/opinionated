See <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:10\u20141. Thereupon the court sentenced Janiec to \u201cthe New Jersey State\u2019s Prison for a period of one year to run consecutively with the previous sentences.\u201d On June 8, 1951 the sentencing judge stated for the record: \u201cThe court is aware of the section of the Revised Statute 2 :192-4, which provides that \u2018All sentences to the New Jersey State Prison shall, on and after May 26, 1932, be for a maximum and minimum term, except sentences for life * * *\u2019 <em>el celera,\u201d </em>and directed that Janiec be returned to the court on September 17, 1951 for the imposition of a sentence to State Prison for a period of not less than one year nor more than a year and a day. However, on September 17, 1951 the County Court decided not to disturb the sentence of one year in State Prison imposed on June 6, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">The defendant having requested the County Court for the correction of said sentence, was informed by the court in a communication dated September 18, 1952, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">\u201cThe Court * * * has re-examined Revised Statutes 2:192-4 and is now of the opinion that it does not apply to a sentence imposed for contempt. Therefore, the Court retracts its statement of June 8. 1951, and will not disturb the sentence imposed on June 6, 1951.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-14\">I am still of the opinion that the sentence imposed on June 6, 1951, was a legal one and, therefore, your application is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201cA criminal contempt is a public wrong; it is a misdemeanor. <em>Staley v. So. Jersey Realty Co., </em>83 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>300 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1914). It may be prosecuted on indictment like other crimes. <em>In re Kerrigan, </em>33 <em>N. J. L. </em>344 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1869).\u201d <em>Zimmerman v. Zimmerman, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>61, 66 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950). Under <em>Rule </em>3:80-2, a contempt, whether criminal or civil, \u201cshall be prosecuted in the action ,in which it occurs.\u201d One convicted of a misdemeanor \u201cshall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both.\u201d <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:85-7. Where a sentence to the Few Jersey State Prison is imposed, it \u201cshall be for a maximum and minimum term, except sentences for life. The maximum term shall not be in excess of the maximum term prescribed by law for the offense for which the offender was convicted. The minimum term shall not be less than 1 year.\u201d <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:164-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In view of the fact that the offense of which the defendant was convicted is a misdemeanor and that the sentence imposed was one of confinement in the State Prison, the fixed sentence of one year, under the aforementioned statutory provision, is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201cOnly the Legislature may ordain the punishment for crime and the sentencing court may not impose a sentence inconsistent therewith. <em>State v. Dugan, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>603 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1913) ; affirmed 85 <em>N. J. L. </em>730 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914). The statutory language employed by the pertinent provision mandatorily directs the sentencing court to impose a \u2018maximum and minimum term, except sentences for life\u2019 in all sentences to the New Jersey State Prison. * * * In 24 <em>G. J. .S., Criminal Law, seo. </em>1582, <em>p. </em>Ill, it is stated: \u2018* * * Under an indeterminate sentence law, the court cannot fix the minimum and maximum term of imprisonment to expire at the same time.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Moore, </em>21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>419, 424 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\"><em>Cf. In re Kershner, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>471 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The matter is remanded to the County Court for the imposition of an appropriate sentence in conformity with the views hereinbefore expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
