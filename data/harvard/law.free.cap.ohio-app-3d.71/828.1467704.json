Henneman, filed a complaint against him alleging that he knowingly caused or attempted to cause physical harm to her in violation of R.C. 2919.25. Appellant entered a plea of not guilty after which he was tried by the court on June 14, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The testimony at the hearing revealed that Bonnie Henneman was appellant\u2019s child; that she had resided with him, but not since 1977; and that on May 31, 1990, appellant appeared at Bonnie\u2019s home and asked to speak with the latter\u2019s mother. Bonnie denied appellant permission to speak to her mother and he began physically abusing Bonnie. The police were summoned tc&gt; the scene. The next day Bonnie filed the subject complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">At the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, appellant moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that the complaint was violative of the constitutional ban against \u201cex post facto\u201d laws. The court denied the motion, found appellant guilty of a first degree misdemeanor, ordered him to pay a fine and court costs, sentenced him to a ten-day suspended jail term, and ordered him placed on probation for six months. Appellant appeals raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred, to the prejudice of defendant-appellant, in overruling his motion to dismiss made at the conclusion of the state\u2019s case-in-chief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">In the sole assignment, appellant maintains that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge of domestic violence, because one of the material elements of the statute requires that he \u201chad resided\u201d with the victim. Appellant further contends that since he had not resided with the victim after the enactment of the statute, his conviction violated the constitutional prohibition against \u201cex post facto\u201d laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Upon review of a motion to dismiss, this court\u2019s standard of review is whether the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\"><em>\u201cEx post facto </em>laws are prohibited by Section 10, Article I of the United States Constitution, which provides, in part: \u2018No State shall * * * pass any * * * ex post facto Law * * *.\u2019 The United States Supreme Court has defined an <em>ex post facto </em>law as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is settled, by decisions of this Court so well known that their citation may be dispensed with, <em>that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, </em>or which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as <em>ex post facto.\u201d \u2019 Dobbert v. Florida </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 282, 292 [97 S.Ct. 2290, 2297-2298, 53 L.Ed.2d 344, 356], quoting <em>Beazell v. Ohio </em>(1925), 269 U.S. 167, 169-170 [46 S.Ct. 68, 68-69, 70 L.Ed. 216, 217-218] (Stone, J.).\u201d (Emphasis added in part.) <em>State ex rel. Corrigan v. Barnes </em>(1982), 3 Ohio App.3d 40, 42, 3 OBR 43, 45, 443 N.E.2d 1034, 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In order to determine whether appellant was subject to an \u201cex post facto law,\u201d close scrutiny of the pertinent provisions of the statute is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">R.C. 2919.25, entitled \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d provides in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">\u201c(A) No person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\"><em>\u00ab </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">\u201c(E) As used in this section and sections 2919.251 and 2919.26 of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">\u201c(1) \u2018Family or household member\u2019 means any of the following, who is residing or has resided with the offender:</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">\u201c(a) A spouse, a person living as a spouse, or a former spouse of the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">\u201c(b) A parent or a child of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">\u201c(c) A parent or a child of a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">\u201c(2) \u2018Person living as a spouse\u2019 means a person who is living or has lived with the offender in a common law marital relationship, who otherwise is cohabiting with the offender, who otherwise has cohabited with the offender within one year prior to the date of the alleged commission of the act in question, or who is the natural parent of the offender\u2019s child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">The facts here clearly reveal that Bonnie was a family member (appellant\u2019s child), that she had resided with him, albeit not since 1977, and that appellant knowingly caused or attempted to cause physical harm to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">Therefore, based on the foregoing, the only question is whether the phrase \u201chas resided\u201d is a material element of the crime, <em>i.e., </em>was it necessary for Bonnie to live with appellant after the enactment of the statute in order to avoid appellant\u2019s contention that the statute violated his constitutional prohibition against \u201cex post facto\u201d laws?</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>It would appear to this court that the material elements of the offense of domestic violence are that a person <em>knowingly caused </em>or <em>attempted </em>to <em>cause physical harm </em>to a <em>family </em>or <em>household member. </em>The phrase \u201cresiding or has resided with,\u201d as found in R.C. 2919.25(E)(1), merely qualifies or defines what constitutes \u201cfamily or household member,\u201d and as such is not a material element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Moreover, in the portion of the statute that applies to a child of the offender, R.C. 2919.25(E)(1)(b), there is no specification as to when the child must have resided in the household of the offender. On the other hand, R.C. 2919.25(E)(2), as amended in 1989, which refers to a \u201cperson living as a spouse,\u201d states that the cohabitation must have occurred within one year prior to the date of the alleged commission of the act in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Thus, it is apparent that the legislature did not intend to specify a time period during which any other class of persons must have resided in the household of the offender in order to find the offender guilty of domestic violence involving a member of such a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Although the original statute was enacted in 1979, it was clarified and amended in 1981; and more recent amendments determined who had to reside with the offender in order to fall within the statute. Also, there was an amendment which provided that in order for a spouse to file a complaint there must have been cohabitation with the offender within one year of the alleged crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Therefore, if any such restrictions were intended for any other class of persons, the legislature would have made that clear when it specified a time period within which it was necessary for a spouse to have lived with the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Accordingly, it appears that appellant was not subjected to an \u201cex post facto law,\u201d inasmuch as he committed the material elements of the crime well after the statute had gone into effect. The fact that the \u201cresiding together\u201d occurred prior to the statute\u2019s enactment is of no consequence, since it is not a material element of the offense, and the legislature did not specify when the \u201cresiding\u201d had to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Also, there is no evidence in the record before us that the motion to dismiss was renewed at the conclusion of appellant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Therefore, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b863-13\">Christley, P.J., and Basinger, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b863-14\">William R.
