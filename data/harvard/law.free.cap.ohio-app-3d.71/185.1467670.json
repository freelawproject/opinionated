Geygan, trustee in bankruptcy of defendant-appellee, Queen City Grain Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Appellants served as president and vice-president respectively of Queen City Grain Company (hereinafter \u201cQueen City\u201d), which operated three grain elevators in Ohio. On May 24, 1982, the director of the Ohio Department of Agriculture (hereinafter \u201cODOA\u201d) filed a petition for receivership against Queen City for failure to satisfy the claims of its depositors. The appointed receivers subsequently joined with ODOA in filing a complaint alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that despite Queen City\u2019s indebtedness, appellants engaged in imprudent grain commodity trading which registered losses exceeding $1,500,000 for the corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Queen City, meanwhile, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on April 29, 1983 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. On January 30, 1984, the trial court substituted Geygan, Queen City\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy, as plaintiff in place of the receivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Queen City\u2019s trial took thirteen days over a six-month period from December 16,1985 to June 18, 1986. Following the close of Geygan\u2019s case on March 14, 1986, appellants moved for a directed verdict. The court granted the motion on two of the counts but denied the motion as to the counts pertaining to the failure to prove damages and appellants\u2019 liability to Queen City for trading losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">On August 3, 1987, the trial court found appellants\u2019 grain speculation practice imprudent and held the business judgment rule inapplicable to the damages from those transactions. Due to the difficulty in assessing damages, however, the court ordered Geygan\u2019s statistician to compile the evidence and separate appellants\u2019 trading losses in order to reach a \u201crealistic\u201d damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>figure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After conducting three days of hearings on the subject of damages, the court found appellants liable for $1,324,000. The court subsequently denied appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial on July 20, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Appellants appealed in a timely manner and submit the following assignments of error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred by finding that the Bobbs were both liable to the corporation for Mr. Bobb\u2019s actions on the commodities market.\u201d Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred by finding Geneva Bobb was liable for damages to the same extent as James Bobb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred by permitting the plaintiff to present additional evidence of damages after both parties had rested their cases.\u201d Assignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred by denying defendants\u2019 motion for directed verdict (motion to dismiss) for failure to prove damages and denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the fourth cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Assignment of Error No. 5:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding that the damages were proven in the amount of $1,324,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">Assignment of Error No. 6:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred by not considering Mr. Ellerman\u2019s proffered testimony concerning mistakes in Dr. Baldwin\u2019s calculations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">Assignment of Error No. 7:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">\u201cThe decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">Assignment of Error No. 8:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-19\">\u201cThe trial court erred by allowing the receivers to file their complaint and join in as plaintiffs in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-20\">Assignment of Error No. 9:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-21\">\u201cThe trial court erred by allowing Geygan to be substituted as plaintiff in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 10:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred by allowing Dr. Baldwin to testify, over objection, as to whether the defendant conducted prudent elevator management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Assignment of Error No. 11:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in allowing Dr. Baldwin to testify, over objection, to exhibits 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 256, and corrected exhibits 246 and 242 and it was error to admit said exhibits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Assignment of Error No. 12:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it denied defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The first assignment of error alleges that the business judgment rule protects appellants from liability for decisions made in the management of Queen City. It is further argued that Geygan failed to present evidence that appellants acted in bad faith in operating Queen City since the actions were taken with the intent to make a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">\u201cIt is well-established that a corporate officer occupies a position of trust in relation to his corporation.\u201d <em>Wing Leasing, Inc. v. M &amp; B Aviation </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 178, 181, 542 N.E.2d 671, 676, citing <em>Thomas v. Matthews </em>(1916), 94 Ohio St. 32, 43, 113 N.E. 669, 671. As a result of this position, directors have \u201ca fiduciary relationship to the corporation and its shareholders and are held strictly accountable and liable if the corporate funds are wasted or mismanaged * * *.\u201d <em>Apicella v. PAF Corp. </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 245, 247, 17 OBR 512, 514, 479 N.E.2d 315, 318, quoting <em>Ohio Drill &amp; Tool Co. v. Johnson </em>(C.A.6, 1980), 625 F.2d 738, 742, 19 O.O.3d 339, 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">The General Assembly codified a director\u2019s fiduciary duty to a corporation in R.C. 1701.59(B), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">\u201cA director shall perform his duties as a director * * * in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believes to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">In noting Ohio\u2019s adherence to the business judgment rule during the evaluation of a director\u2019s compliance with his duty of care, the Sixth Circuit held that the rule prevents inquiry \u201cinto the wisdom of actions taken by the directors in the absence of fraud, bad faith or abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Radol v. Thomas </em>(C.A.6, 1985), 772 F.2d 244, 256. See <em>Stepak v. Schey </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 8, 553 N.E.2d 1072 (Holmes, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>On April 26, 1982, an ODOA grain warehouse examiner cited Queen City for a violation of R.C. 926.141,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after he found the grain elevator \u201clong\u201d 346,646 bushels of corn and 327,543 bushels of soybeans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This provision stipulates the practice licensed grain handlers must abide by when handling delayed price grain. In pertinent part, it authorizes licensed handlers purchasing agricultural commodities to maintain at all times any combination of the commodity, rights and property equal to ninety percent of the value of the handler\u2019s obligations in the commodity.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">An ODOA inspection manager testified that the purpose behind the statute\u2019s ninety percent rule was to prevent grain handlers from speculating. According to the inspection manager, eighteen of the twenty-five Ohio grain elevators that became insolvent and forced into receivership or bankruptcy between 1968 and 1985 became insolvent as a result of speculating with delayed price grain. An ODOA grain warehouse examiner further testified that Queen City\u2019s position was the \u201clongest\u201d he had seen in over one thousand grain elevator examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">By violating R.C. 926.141, appellants acted in bad faith and breached their duty to Queen City. Appellants purposely speculated in grain commodities despite knowing the inherent risks involved in such a venture. Such conduct not only jeopardized Queen City\u2019s financial position, but it also subjected the farmers depositing grain in the elevators to needless risks. The business judgment rule is not applicable where a director acts in bad faith by engaging in transactions which violate statutory law. As a result, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In their second assignment of error, appellants argue that the evidence fails to support the trial court\u2019s decision finding Geneva Bobb liable as a director. Essentially, it is alleged that Geneva\u2019s decision to entrust Queen City\u2019s day-to-day operations to her husband is protected by the business judgment rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">According to R.C. 1701.59(B), Geneva\u2019s role as a Queen City director required her to perform her duties \u201cin a manner [s]he reasonably believe[d] to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.\u201d At trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Geneva testified she knew her husband, a Queen City director, speculated in the commodities futures market. Although unaware of the exact process involved, Geneva admitted her husband took speculative positions in order to make a profit. By possessing knowledge of another director\u2019s illegal transactions and acquiescing to such activity, Geneva acted in a manner opposed to Queen City's best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We are not persuaded by Geneva\u2019s argument that her passive participation in Queen City\u2019s decision-making process precluded her from breaching her fiduciary duty to the corporation. In <em>Francis v. United Jersey Bank </em>(1981), 87 N.J. 15, 432 A.2d 814, the New Jersey Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a corporate director could be personally liable in negligence for failing to prevent other directors from misappropriating corporation funds. The facts of that case involved an elderly and sickly director that visited the corporate office only once and paid no attention to either the corporation\u2019s affairs or her duty as a director.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Initially, the court noted that directors \u201care under a continuing obligation to keep informed about the activities of the corporation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>87 N.J. at 31, 432 A.2d at 822. The failure to keep apprised, the court reasoned, thwarts the director\u2019s ability to participate in the overall management of corporate affairs. Thus, \u201ca director is not an ornament, but an essential component of corporate governance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>87 N.J. at 34, 432 A.2d at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Regarding the director\u2019s inability to prevent the misappropriation, the court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u201cDirectors may not shut their eyes to corporate misconduct and then claim that because they did not see the misconduct, they do not have a duty to look. The sentinel asleep at his post contributes nothing to the enterprise he is charged to protect. <em>Wilkinson v. Dodd, </em>42 N.J.Eq. 234, 245 [7 A. 327] (Ch.1886), aff\u2019d 42 N.J.Eq. 647 [9 A. 685] (E. &amp; A.1887).\u201d <em>Id., </em>87 N.J. at 31, 432 A.2d at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Francis </em>is equally applicable <em>to </em>the case at hand. As a director of Queen City, Geneva was obligated to do more than perform household-type functions and attend meetings. Further, the fact she performed these tasks does not diminish her duty to fully participate in the management of Queen City\u2019s affairs and keep apprised of its business dealings. Such a duty took on added importance in light of Queen City\u2019s previous trading losses and the amount of trust farmers placed in Queen City in holding their grain. When a director has knowledge of a fellow director\u2019s improprieties and does not act upon the information, her decision to stand idly by is not a defense. Geneva\u2019s failure to prevent her husband\u2019s speculative positions amounts to a breach of duty to Queen City unprotected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>business judgment rule. Accordingly, we find no merit to the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Under the third assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court improperly permitted Geygan\u2019s expert witness, Dr. E. Dean Baldwin, to present additional evidence of damages after both parties had rested. The court\u2019s August 3, 1987 judgment entry instructed Dr. Baldwin \u201cto compile the exhibits now in evidence is [sic] such a manner to separate speculation losses from hedging losses.\u201d The court\u2019s entry noted that the expert\u2019s business computer was better equipped to handle the voluminous evidence and calculations than the court\u2019s APPLE computer. Appellants maintain that Geygan\u2019s inability to present such evidence in the case-in-chief demonstrates a failure to prove damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">A trial court has discretion in permitting a plaintiff to reopen his case to introduce additional evidence after resting his case-in-chief. <em>Cook v. Williams </em>(1952), 92 Ohio App. 277, 63 Ohio Law Abs. 101, 108 N.E.2d 232. Although the court, and not the parties, ordered the additional hearing, we find the same standard to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The record shows the court requested the additional hearing in order to credit appellants for certain hedging losses. As per its instructions prior to conducting the additional hearing, the court only heard evidence that had already been presented. The record reflects that evidence regarding Queen City\u2019s losses had been put forth in the case-in-chief. Furthermore, Dr. Baldwin\u2019s testimony served the limited function of clarifying and explaining the overwhelming amount of data the trial had amassed. Finally, the record also reflects that defense counsel cross-examined Dr. Baldwin and presented rebuttal testimony concerning his computation of damages. Under these facts, it cannot be said the trial court abused its discretion in permitting Dr. Baldwin to present additional evidence. As a result, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Appellants challenge the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling denying its directed verdict motion for failure to prove damages in the fourth assignment of error. It is argued that the motion should have been granted after the court\u2019s judgment entry conceded the impossibility of determining damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Civ.R. 50(A(4) states that a trial court shall sustain a motion for a directed verdict if:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u201c * * * after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, [it] finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Where the party opposing the motion is reasonably able to make out from the evidence all essential elements of his claim, a directed verdict is inappropriate. <em>O\u2019Day v. Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">First, the court\u2019s difficulty in ascertaining damages does not preclude the recovery of a damage award. Once a right to damages has been established, that right cannot be denied because the damages are incapable of being calculated with mathematical certainty. <em>Pennant Moldings, Inc. v. C &amp; J Trucking Co. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 248, 11 OBR 374, 464 N.E.2d 175; <em>Reeser v. Weaver Bros., Inc. </em>(1989), 54 Ohio App.3d 46, 560 N.E.2d 819. By making a determination on appellants\u2019 liability in its judgment entry, the trial court established that Geygan had a right to damages. Such right cannot be denied simply because the court professed difficulty in computing a damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Moreover, a review of the record shows evidence of the damages which resulted from appellants\u2019 mismanagement of Queen City. In addition to Dr. Baldwin\u2019s testimony, a certified public accountant testified that appellants\u2019 trading losses caused Queen City\u2019s financial failure. The accountant further testified that Queen City\u2019s net long position during the 1981 fiscal year alone culminated in a $3.1 million dollar loss for the company. Also, a manager of futures brokerage activities for grain elevator managers testified that even if Dr. Baldwin\u2019s final results were off as much as fifty percent, Queen City would still have been in a heavily speculative position. Since reasonable minds could differ as to Geygan\u2019s failure to prove damages, the trial court properly denied the motion. Appellants\u2019 fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Appellants' fifth assignment of error contends that the court\u2019s $1,324,000 damage figure is based on erroneous hypothetical assumptions. An award of damages will be upheld by an appellate court if there is competent evidence supporting the award. <em>Williamson Co. v. Smith </em>(June 28, 1985), Warren App. No. CA84-02-007, unreported, 1985 WL 8720.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Dr. Baldwin testified to a reasonable certainty that Queen City\u2019s financial losses were the result of imprudent elevator management. He further testified that after studying data from Queen City\u2019s records, he used a statistically valid procedure to determine the $1,324,000 damage figure. Although Dr. Baldwin\u2019s complex calculations involved a number of variables which complicated his computations, competent evidence supports the trial court\u2019s damage award. As a result, the fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The sixth assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s decision not to consider certain testimony by appellants\u2019 expert witness, Eugene Ellerman. During one of the additional hearings, the court permitted Ellerman to rebut Dr. Baldwin\u2019s rebuttal testimony of Ellerman\u2019s previous testimony. The court did not, however, allow Ellerman to answer questions regarding Dr. Baldwin\u2019s original damage calculations on the grounds that such testimony exceeded the scope of rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Evid.R. 403 permits a court to exclude relevant evidence if it is a \u201cneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d An inspection of the transcript shows that on direct examination during one of the additional hearings, Ellerman testified about the errors in Dr. Baldwin\u2019s computation of damages. A proffer of Ellerman\u2019s excluded rebuttal testimony reveals that he intended to testify on the accuracy of Dr. Baldwin\u2019s calculations of Queen City\u2019s losses. Since such testimony duplicated evidence Ellerman had previously presented, the trial court properly excluded it. Thus, appellants\u2019 sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The seventh assignment of error contends that the court\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence since the only evidence presented \u201cwas of some mythical financial kingdom made up of estimated factors applicable to generalized times, generalized inventories and generalized conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">An appellate court should not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court where competent, credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578; <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 1&amp; Ohio St.3d 77, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Despite appellants\u2019 contentions to the contrary, ample evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellants\u2019 mismanagement culminated in losses for Queen City. A certified public accountant testified that based upon his examination of Queen City\u2019s records and documents, the corporation\u2019s commodities trading losses caused its financial failure. Furthermore, Dr. Baldwin opined that based upon his examination of Queen City\u2019s records, appellants\u2019 trading practices constituted speculation. The records Dr. Baldwin used in reaching his opinion included Queen City\u2019s accounting records, sales contracts and price ledgers. Since competent, credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s judgment, we overrule appellants\u2019 seventh assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In the eighth assignment of error it is argued that the receivers have no standing to assert claims against appellants. The receivers were appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>after ODOA filed a petition for receivership with the court. Appellants argue that receivers established under R.C. 926.14(E) are a special statutory entity with no authority to pursue claims against individuals such as appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">According to R.C. 926.14(E):</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u201cIf during or after the audit or other investigation provided for in this section, or at any other time, the director has evidence that the licensed handler is insolvent or is unable to satisfy the claims of all depositors, the director may petition the court of common pleas for the appointment of a receiver to operate or liquidate the business of the licensed handler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In <em>Bobb v. Marchant </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 1, 14 OBR 1, 469 N.E.2d 847, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2735 and R.C. 926.14 are <em>in pari materia. </em>Specifically, R.C. 2735.04 states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\u201cUnder the control of the court which appointed him * * *, a receiver may bring and defend actions in his own name as receiver, take and keep possession of property, receive rents, collect, compound for, and compromise demands, make transfers, and generally do such acts respecting the property as the court authorizes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">A plain reading of the above statute fails to place any limitations on the ability of ODOA-appointed receivers to pursue claims against individuals as appellants suggest. Furthermore, as the supreme court noted in <em>Bobb, supra, </em>at 3, 14 OBR at 3, 469 N.E.2d at 849:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">\u201cAppellants\u2019 averment that the receivers * * * have no authority to sue the officers of Queen City Grain Company is laid to rest by R.C. 2735.04, which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u2018a receiver may bring and defend actions in his own name as receiver * * *.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Thus, we find that the receivers instituted this action against appellants as a proper exercise of their authority. As a result, the eighth assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">Appellants\u2019 ninth assignment of error maintains that the court improperly substituted Geygan as plaintiff in place of the receivers. Such a move, appellants argue, made Geygan both plaintiff and defendant due to his role as trustee of Queen City\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">Section 323(a), Title 11, U.S.Code, states that a bankruptcy trustee is the representative of the estate. Section 323(b), Title 11, U.S.Code gives the trustees the capacity to sue and be sued. Under this capacity, the trustee is not the agent of the debtor but rather manages the estate\u2019s funds for the benefit of the estate\u2019s creditors. <em>In re Obie Elie Wrecking Co. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1983), 35 B.R. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Geygan was substituted as plaintiff after the receivers instituted this action against appellants for breaching their duty to Queen City. In this role, Geygan represented Queen City\u2019s estate as it sought to recoup funds which appellants had mismanaged. Thus, appellants were the defendants and not Queen City as appellants suggest. Since Geygan properly pursued this action in his capacity as bankruptcy trustee, we find no merit to the ninth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Appellants contest the court\u2019s decision to allow Dr. Baldwin to testify about prudent grain elevator management in the tenth assignment of error. It is alleged that the facts forming the basis of Dr. Baldwin\u2019s opinion are not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Evid.R. 703 governs opinion testimony of expert witnesses and states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by him or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Thus, opinion testimony by an expert witness must be based upon facts within the witness\u2019 own personal knowledge or upon facts shown by other evidence. <em>State v. Jones </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 123, 9 OBR 347, 459 N.E.2d 526; <em>State v. Chapin </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 437, 21 O.O.3d 273, 424 N.E.2d 317; <em>Price v. Daugherty </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 157, 5 OBR 339, 450 N.E.2d 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">A review of the transcript reveals that two of Geygan\u2019s exhibits, which contained a total of one hundred twenty \u201coverheads\u201d were admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, overhead number 28 contained a list of the records Dr. Baldwin used in analyzing Queen City\u2019s daily position report from June 1979 to May 1982.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Among those records listed were Queen City\u2019s shipping invoices, price ledgers, accounting records, sales contracts from two of Queen City\u2019s divisions, and the Garvey Commodity reports. Furthermore, Dr. Baldwin testified that he used these records to reach his opinion on Queen City\u2019s financial situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">As Dr. Baldwin\u2019s opinion was within the provisions of Evid.R. 703, we find no merit to the tenth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Taken together, appellants\u2019 eleventh and twelfth assignments of error argue that the trial court erred in denying appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial since Dr. Baldwin\u2019s testimony at the additional hearings constituted a surprise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>under Civ.R. 59(A)(3). Specifically, appellants contend that Geygan violated Civ.R. 26(E)(1) by failing to supply them with the documents used by Dr. Baldwin during the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In pertinent part, Civ.R. 59(A)(3) allows a new trial to be granted upon \u201c * * * surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against.\u201d Additionally, the trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining whether to order a new trial. <em>Jones v. Meinking </em>(1987), 40 Ohio App.3d 45, 531 N.E.2d 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Appellants\u2019 argument proceeds on the assumption that Geygan\u2019s failure to supplement the answers to appellants\u2019 request for production amounted to surprise under Civ.R. 26(E)(1). Civ.R. 26(E)(1) provides that a party is under no duty to supplement a response to a discovery request to include after-acquired information if the response was complete when made except that:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u201c(1) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response with respect to any question directly addressed to (a) the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (b) the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial and the subject matter on which he is expected to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We find Geygan was under no duty to supplement his response after the court ordered his expert witness to testify at the additional hearings. As noted earlier, Dr. Baldwin\u2019s testimony consisted of evidence which had previously been presented to the court. As such, it can not be classified as \u201cafter-acquired\u201d information. Furthermore, the court conducted the first additional hearing one year after informing both parties of its decision to have Dr. Baldwin compile the data. Thus, appellants not only had ample time to prepare for Dr. Baldwin\u2019s testimony, but were well aware of its subject matter as well. Since Dr. Baldwin\u2019s testimony did not amount to a surprise, the trial court properly rejected appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial. Accordingly, the eleventh and twelfth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-10\">Jones, P.J., and Koehler, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\">.
