Altvater.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">On August 10, 1984, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that the intentional conduct of defendant, in exposing plaintiffs husband, Robert K. Altvater, to silica and other respirable dusts, proximately caused his death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 30, 1989, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that: (1) plaintiffs claim is barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata; </em>and (2) defendant\u2019s actions did not constitute an intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by <em>res judicata </em>was based upon a finding by the Industrial Commission of Ohio (\u201ccommission\u201d) regarding a workers\u2019 compensation claim initiated by plaintiff. The record indicates that in March 1984 plaintiff, prior to filing her complaint before the trial court, filed for death benefits under Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws. Plaintiff\u2019s claim for death benefits before the commission alleged that the death of Robert Altvater was caused by silicosis resulting from his employment with defendant. The commission denied plaintiff\u2019s claim based upon a determination that although Robert Altvater had contracted silicosis, his death was primarily caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d), a condition found not to be related to his occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">By entry dated August 2, 1989, the trial court granted summary judgment for defendant. The judgment of the trial court states in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">\u201c * * * Plaintiff, as the Administratrix of Robert K. Altvater\u2019s estate, has brought the instant action claiming that Defendant Claycraft intentionally and tortiously caused the death of her husband. The basis for that claim is the contention that the environment while working at Claycraft created silicosis which in turn caused Mr. Altvater\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">\u201cClaycraft relies upon the Industrial Commission\u2019s finding as a basis for asserting <em>res </em>judicata/collateral estoppel as to the cause of death of Mr. Altvater. In support of this contention, Defendant Claycraft cites the case of <em>Smertka v. Hogen Ind., Inc., </em>No. 11-265, 11th District Court App., Sept. 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>1986 (unreported). While this case is not binding upon the Court, the rationale expressed is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u201cThe Court is aware that the question of intent was not before the Commission. Whether there were intentional actions as defined by the cases dealing with occupational intentional torts is not dispositive of this action. The question of proximate cause was clearly a part of the Commission\u2019s Decision and the opportunity to litigate that issue was exercised. There is no reliable evidence to indicate that the Commission\u2019s Decision was modified by any settlement. The undisputed evidence presented establishes that the order of the Commission stills [sic] stands affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u201cThe rationale for the application of <em>res judicata </em>and the companion doctrine of issue preclusion through collateral estoppel is to establish a legal tool to eliminate redundancy and inconsistency. The doctrines are also the basis for bringing contested legal issues to a final conclusion. The Industrial Commission specifically found that Mr. Altvater\u2019s death was caused by chronic pulmonary disease not related to silicosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Memorandum Contra identifies factors indicating the inability to show that Defendant intentionally subjected Mr. Altvater to hazardous conditions, thus causing silicosis and death. The medical evidence before the Commission corroborates that Mr. Altvater had silicosis. The undeniable finding of the Commission is that Mr. Altvater\u2019s death was not a result of silicosis. Therefore, exposure, whether intentional or not, causing silicosis does not allow the Court to reconsider the earlier determination of a lack of proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s claim is \u2018for a loss of consortium, earnings, services, grief, etc., as a result of the wrongful death of Robert Altvater\u2019 * * *. The Commission has considered silicosis in relationship to Mr. Altvater\u2019s death and determined no proximate relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">\u201cThe Court, upon review of the evidence * * * finds that summary judgment is proper and Plaintiff\u2019s claim must be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">On appeal, plaintiff sets forth the following three assignments of error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\u201cA. The trial court erred in granting defendant, Claycraft\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that the legal doctrines of <em>res </em>judicata/collateral estoppel would bar an employee intentional tort action after a common pleas court had dismissed without prejudice an appeal of an Industrial Commission decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\u201c1. In order for the legal doctrines of <em>res </em>judicata!collateral estoppel to be applicable, the points or questions in dispute must have been actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>litigated and determined in the prior action. When a case is dismissed without prejudice due to the fact that the parties have represented to the court that the case is settled, the points or questions in dispute have not been litigated or determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u201c2. The September 8, 1986 Wyandot County Common Pleas Court judgment entry, and the Industrial Commission decision of September 4, 1987, are not binding upon either party in the litigation since both parties did not have a full and fair opportunity to argue their version of the facts in the workers\u2019 compensation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u201c3. It is improper for a court to apply the doctrine of <em>res </em>judicata/collateral estoppel when different parties or their privies are involved in the subsequent action.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u201cB. The trial court erred in granting defendant, Claycraft\u2019s, motion for summary judgment as to all plaintiff\u2019s claims. Even if collateral estoppel were applicable, it would apply only to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death claim, not plaintiff\u2019s survivorship claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u201cC. Under Article I, Section 5, of the Ohio Constitution, the parties to civil litigation have a constitutional right to a jury trial. The trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, thereby denying the plaintiff her right to a jury trial through the application of the doctrine of administrative <em>res </em>judicata.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Summary judgment is a procedural device designed to terminate litigation and to avoid a formal trial where there is nothing to try. In determining whether summary judgment is proper, a tripartite demonstration has been adopted by the Supreme Court of Ohio:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">\u201c * <em>* * </em>(1) [T]hat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made * * <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Summary judgment \u201c * * * must be awarded with caution, resolving doubts and construing evidence against the moving party, and granted only when it appears from the evidentiary material that reasonable minds can reach only an adverse conclusion as to the party opposing the motion. * * *\u201d <em>Norris v. Ohio Std. Oil Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 1, 2, 24 O.O.3d 1, 2, 433 N.E.2d 615, 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s first and second assignments of error are interrelated and will be addressed together. Plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment based upon the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel. While plaintiff raises essentially three different arguments under her first assigned error, our focus is upon plaintiff\u2019s contention that the court erred in applying <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel where there was a lack of identity of parties or their privies between the present intentional tort action and plaintiff\u2019s prior workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. More specifically, plaintiff argues that in plaintiff\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation death benefits, pursuant to R.C. 4123.-59, the only apparent dependent under that claim, as defined by statute, was plaintiff. Plaintiff asserts, however, that the wrongful death action filed by plaintiff as administratrix of Robert Altvater\u2019s estate was brought on behalf of all next of kin, and would have included Robert Altvater\u2019s adult children. Plaintiff maintains that inasmuch as individuals who potentially might benefit from the wrongful death action had no interest or control over plaintiff\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation death benefits, such individuals should not be penalized or bound by that action through <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Under Ohio law, \u201c * * * the defenses of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel are operative in a second suit only when there is an identity of issues and an identity of parties or their privies in both the first and second suit. * * *\u201d <em>Whitehead v. Genl. Tel. Co. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 108, 113, 49 O.O.2d 435, 438, 254 N.E.2d 10, 13. See, also, <em>Beatrice Foods Co. v. Lindley </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 29, 35, 24 O.O.3d 68, 71, 434 N.E.2d 727, 731 (\u201c * * * In order for either doctrine to apply, there must be an identity of parties and issues in the proceedings. * * * \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The trial court, in determining that <em>res judicata or </em>collateral estoppel barred plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death action, relied upon the case of <em>Smertka v. Hogen Industries </em>(Sept. 26, 1986), Lake App. No. 11-265, unreported, 1986 WL 10598. In <em>Smertka, </em>the plaintiff brought an intentional tort action against his employer, alleging that he was required to work in a toxic atmosphere. The defendant-employer moved for partial summary judgment, contending in part that the plaintiff\u2019s allegations had been finally and bindingly adjudicated by an Industrial Commission determination that the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory ailments did not proximately result from exposure to fumes at his workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In <em>Smertka, </em>the court held that the issue preclusion aspect of <em>res judicata </em>applied as to the plaintiff\u2019s prior workers\u2019 compensation claim. In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Smertka </em>court distinguished the facts in that case with the holding of the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Jones v. VIP Development Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 90, 15 OBR 246, 472 N.E.2d 1046. In <em>Jones, supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>100, 15 OBR at 254, 472 N.E.2d at 1055, the court held that the conclusion of the Industrial Commission that an injury arose out of the employment will not preclude a claimant, under the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel, from pursuing a remedy for an intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In <em>Smertka, supra, </em>at 16, the court distinguished the holding in <em>Jones, </em>stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u201cThe specific issue which the Supreme Court held not to be precluded from litigation in a <em>Blankenshp- </em>[v. <em>Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572] type case in its <em>Jones </em>decision is not the issue which defendant herein sought to preclude plaintiff from relitigating in the court below. In <em>Jones, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s 'no estoppel\u2019 ruling was restricted to the single issue of whether the employer\u2019s action was intentional; an issue not germane to the right of participation according to the <em>Jones </em>majority. In the instant case, however, Hogen\u2019s estoppel submission was based upon a different issue of fact \u2014 common to both the workers\u2019 compensation and the intentional tort proceedings \u2014 specifically, the medical issue of proximate causation of plaintiff\u2019s physical ailment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We note that our independent research has found no other cases applying the rationale in <em>Smertka </em>and holding that the commission\u2019s determination of proximate cause collaterally estops the relitigation of that issue in a subsequent intentional tort action. Even assuming, without deciding, the reasoning in <em>Smertka </em>to be sound, and that an identity of issues would therefore be present under the facts of the present case, the requirement of an identity of parties or their privies is lacking herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">It is well settled that \u201c * * * litigation in one capacity, individual or representative, does not preclude relitigation in a different capacity, individual or representative. * * * \u201d Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, Jurisdiction (1981), Section 4454. See, also, Restatement of the Law 2d Judgments (1982) 359, Section 36. The record indicates that in the proceedings before the commission, plaintiff was designated as the claimant. Plaintiff\u2019s right to pursue a recovery for death benefits was by virtue of R.C. 4123.59, which provides for benefits to \u201cdependents.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We note that based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>upon the record before this court, it is unclear whether there were any other potential dependents in the administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Under the wrongful death action, plaintiff is designated in the complaint as the duly appointed administratrix of the estate of Robert Altvater. Ohio\u2019s wrongful death statute provides that an action \u201c * * * shall be brought in the name of the personal representative of the decedent for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, the children, and the parents of the decedent * * * and for the exclusive benefit of the other next of kin of the decedent.\u201d R.C. 2125.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Defendant contends that there is an identity of parties because plaintiff is the claimant in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding and also the claimant or plaintiff in the instant case. However, while plaintiff may appear as a party in both actions, she does not appear in the same capacity. Whereas in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding plaintiff appears, in effect, in her individual capacity, in the present action plaintiff sues as the administratrix of the estate of Robert Altvater, representing a number of potential beneficiaries. We decline to hold that potential beneficiaries who were not a party to the workers\u2019 compensation action are now precluded from representation based upon the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We further note that the rights, of potential beneficiaries in the present action, other than plaintiff, are not dependent upon plaintiff. Under the wrongful death statute, it is not necessary that plaintiff be named or designated as the personal representative acting on behalf of the interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In <em>Jordan v. C.A. Roberts Co. </em>(1967), 379 Mich. 235, 150 N.W.2d 792, the Michigan Supreme Court was faced with a similar factual situation. In <em>Jordan, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s husband was killed while attempting to repair a crane owned by the defendant. The plaintiff initiated an action before the workmen\u2019s compensation department, representing that she was the widow and sole dependent of the deceased. The plaintiff subsequently filed a wrongful death action as administratrix of the estate of the deceased. The trial court held that the decision of the commission in the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding was <em>res judicata </em>as to the subsequent wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>While the Michigan Supreme Court affirmed the trial court decision on different grounds, the court rejected the trial court\u2019s application of <em>res judicata, </em>stating in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u201cSome of the confusion in this case arises from the fact that Thelma Jordan, widow and sole dependent of John C. Jordan, deceased, was a party to the proceedings before the workmen\u2019s compensation department and Thelma Leola Jordan, administratrix of the estate of John C. Jordan, deceased, is the plaintiff in this present action. Thelma Jordan, party to the workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings, acted in her own individual right by virtue of the provisions of the compensation act. * * * Thelma Leola Jordan, administratrix of the estate of John C. Jordan, deceased, is the legally appointed representative of John C. Jordan, deceased, suing in her representative capacity for wrongful death by virtue of the provisions of the wrongful death statute. * * * She brings such an action for the benefit of those persons who are entitled to share in a recovery \u2014 in this case, it is claimed, John C. Jordan\u2019s wife, two children and his creditors. Legally there is no identity whatsoever between the above parties. They are complete strangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u201cThere being no identity of the parties, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is inapplicable. * * *\u201d <em>Jordan, supra, </em>at 242, 150 N.W.2d at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">In <em>Jordan, </em>Justice Souris, who dissented on other grounds, concurred as to the issue of <em>res judicata, </em>stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">\u201cThe principles of collateral estoppel, res judicata and election of remedies are inapplicable to this case. This is so because deceased\u2019s widow and the personal representative of his estate, whoever it be, are distinct entities in law, and the estate\u2019s legal representative, in such capacity, was not a party to the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding. * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 150 N.W.2d at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Accordingly, in the present case the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to plaintiff's wrongful death action based upon the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel. Further, under Ohio\u2019s general survival statute, R.C. 2305.21, a right of action may survive decedent\u2019s death and be pursued by the personal representative on behalf of the estate. As the judgment of the trial court apparently disposes of the wrongful death claim and the survivorship claim upon the same basis, <em>i.e., res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel, the trial court also erred in granting summary judgment on the survivorship claim. Defendant also contends that plaintiff\u2019s survivorship claim is time-barred because plaintiff failed to bring her survivorship cause of action within the two-year requirement of R.C. 2305.10. However, the trial court did not address the issue as to when decedent discovered or should have been aware of his injury and we express no opinion on that issue at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Defendant argues, in the alternative, that the trial court did not grant summary judgment solely upon the basis that the intentional tort action was barred under the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel. Rather, defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s ruling indicates that the court also found, on independent grounds, that plaintiff had failed to show an intentional tort on the part of defendant. Defendant acknowledges, however, in its brief to this court, that it is unclear from the language of the trial court\u2019s decision whether or not such a determination was made. Based upon our review of the trial court\u2019s decision of August 2, 1989, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was made solely upon the basis of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel. Inasmuch as the trial court made no determination as to whether defendant\u2019s actions constituted an intentional tort, we decline to address the issue herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Based upon the foregoing, plaintiff\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s third assignment of error asserts that the trial court, in granting summary judgment on the basis of <em>res judicata, </em>denied plaintiff her right to a trial by jury. Given our disposition of the first and second assignments of error, finding that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel and remanding this cause, plaintiff has failed to show prejudice under her third assignment of error. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the first and second assignments of error are sustained, and the third assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-9\">John C. Young and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b304-10\">Wolff, J., of the Second Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-12\">. Plaintiffs complaint was filed prior to the passage of R.C. 4121.80.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">. R.C. 4123.59(D) designates a \"dependent\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">\"(1) A surviving spouse who was living with the employee at the time of death or a surviving spouse who was separated from the employee at the time of death because of the aggression of the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">\u201c(2) A child under the age of eighteen years, or twenty-five years if pursuing a full-time education * * * or over said age if physically or mentally incapacitated from earning, upon only the one parent who is contributing more than one-half of the support for such child and with whom he is living at the time of the death of such parent, or for whose maintenance such parent was legally liable at the time of his death.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">. Assuming that plaintiff was the sole heir and statutory beneficiary of the wrongful death and survivorship actions, defendant's argument that there is a substantial identity of parties and that therefore the determination in the prior proceedings precludes the subsequent claims under the doctrine of collateral estoppel would then be more persuasive. However, whether or not plaintiff is the only possible beneficiary cannot be determined based upon the record before this court. We note that plaintiff\u2019s brief maintains that the wrongful death claim is also brought on behalf of decedent's adult children and that defendant's brief acknowledges that plaintiff brings both the wrongful death and survivorship claims on behalf of herself and her husband\u2019s heirs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
