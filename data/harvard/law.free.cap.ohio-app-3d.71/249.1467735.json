Appellant was arrested on May 18, 1990, and his trial began on August 16, 1990. Appellant asserts that his trial thus began on the ninety-first day of his incarceration, beyond the statutory time limit. The state contends that trial began on the ninetieth day after his arrest, as the day of arrest cannot be counted when computing the statutory time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">R.C. 1.14 states in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">\u201cThe time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day; * *</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Crim.R. 45 states in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">\u201c(A) Time: Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by the local rules of any court, by order of court, or by any applicable statute, the date of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">Both the statute and criminal rule above make it clear that the day of arrest is not to be included when computing the time within which a defendant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>be brought to trial under R.C. 2945.71. Appellant was therefore brought to trial within the ninety-day period prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-7\">Quillin, P.J., and Cook, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
