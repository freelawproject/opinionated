Hargrave, d/b/a Hargrave Secret Service, and Delbert C. Nugent, an employee of Hargrave, as individuals and as members of a class, brought an action for declaratory judgment against the State Police Department of Indiana and Robert A. O\u2019Neal, as the Superintendent thereof. The Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint prayed alternatively that the Acts of 1965, Ch. 350, Sec. 7, the same being Burns\u2019 Sec. 42-1223 (a) which \u00e9stablishes a registration fee for unlicensed employees assisting a private detective in the conduct of his business, and the Acts of 1961, Ch. 163, Secs. 2, 11, and 17, the same being Burns\u2019 Sec. 42-1208, as amended by the Acts of 1965, Ch. 162, Sec. 1, which define a private detective business and the right to employ unlicensed assistants therein be declared uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>stitutional as being indefinite, vague, and uncertain, and as creating an artificial classification, or alternately, that said Acts be so interpreted as to exclude all those employees of Hargrave Secret Service not used in investigative work from the classification of unlicensed employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The defendants filed an affirmative answer as well as an answer admitting and denying, pursuant to Rule 1-3 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. After the issues were thus joined, the cause was submitted to the court for trial without the intervention of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The Court made the following entry and judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\u201cCome now the parties, and by counsel, and this cause being at issue is submitted to the Court for trial without the intervention of a jury, and the parties stipulate the following in open Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">\u201c1.

interpretation and application are void and invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">\u201cIT IS THEREFORE, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED by the Court as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote

(Acts 1965, ch. 350, \u00a77, p, 1041).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">It seems to us that the crux of the problem to be decided lies in the interpretation of the words \u201cindustrial plants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">We are well aware of the definition of \u201cindustry\u201d as it is given in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Fourth Edition, and from which the trial judge apparently constructed his definition of \u201cindustrial plant.\u201d Black defines \u201cindustry\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">\u201cAny department or branch of art, occupation or business, conducted as a means of livelihood or for profit; especially, one which employs much labor and capital and is a distinct branch of trade.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">However, the language in the statute under consideration after defining one aspect of the private detective business as meaning and including the providing of guards or other persons to protect persons or property, or to prevent the misappropriation of goods, wares and merchandise, money, bonds, stocks, choses in action, notes or other valuable documents or papers, goes on to make a specific, single, and narrow exception to the general language quoted above and states that the furnishing of guards for hire <em>solely </em>to industrial plants for plant security, shall not be considered a private detective business.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Since the definition as set out in the statute concerning the furnishing of guard service moves from a general de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>scription to the single, constricted exclusion of furnishing industrial or plant guards, we interpret the intent of the legislature was to exclude from the class of those engaging in the private detective business, and from the payment of fees, those providing guards <em>solely </em>for hire to industrial plants for plant security. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the words \u201cindustrial plants\u201d are to be construed narrowly and as the common man would think of them, as was so held in the case of <em>Messenger Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review of Allegheny County, </em>132 A. 2d 768, 769, 183 Pa. Super. 407, wherein the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">\u201cThe law ,can do no better than to define an \u2018industrial plant\u2019 as that type of establishment which the ordinary man thinks of as such.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The court in the case of <em>Town of Oyster Bay </em>v. <em>Forte, </em>219 N. Y. S 2d 456, 460, 34 Misc. 2d 5, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">\u201c. . . according to ordinary understanding, an industrial plant is a manufacturing establishment. Furthermore, a dictionary meaning of the word \u2018industrial\u2019 includes \u2018engaged in manufacturing industry\u2019; and a dictionary meaning of the word \u2018plant\u2019 includes \u2018the machinery, apparatus, fixtures, etc., employed in .carrying on a trade of mechanical or other industrial business\u2019; and also a factory, workshop or apparatus complete for the manufacturing of a particular product (Websters International Dictionary, 2d Edition, Unabridged).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the case of <em>North Side Laundry Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review of Allegheny County </em>(1951), 366 Pa. 636, 79 A. 2d 419, 421, spoke on the subjects of \u201cindustry\u201d and \u201cindustrial plants\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-13\">\u201c. . . Therefore, the fact that the businesses to which plaintiff referred are sometimes generically called \u2018industries\u2019 is irrelevant to the issue here raised. The question is whether their establishments are industrial plants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>\u201cThe answer to that question is self-evident. By no stretch of the imagination could a bank building, a hotel, a theater or any of the other business establishments referred to by the plaintiff be considered as an industrial plant. It is true that we sometimes speak of \u2018the movie industry\u2019, the \u2018hotel industry\u2019 or \u2018the banking industry\u2019, but that is merely a loose use of language to convey that idea that the particular business is a sizeable one. In spite of that colloquialism, we do not speak of the buildings housing such businesses as \u2018industrial plants\u2019. Plaintiff attempts to give to that phrase a legal meaning that goes far beyond anything that was contemplated by the courts when they pronounced this rule and by the legislature when it adopted it in the Act of 1933. The law can do no better than to define an industrial plant as that type of establishment which the ordinary man thinks of as such.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In view of our opinion of the legislative intent as expressed in the words \u2018industrial plant\u2019 we think the definition given to those words by the trial court is contrary to the principle that words used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning. <em>Sutto </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Registration &amp; Examination, </em>(1962), 242 Ind. 556, 180 N. E. 2d 533; <em>Gross Income Tax Div. </em>v. <em>Colpaert Realty Corp. </em>(1952), 231 Ind. 463, 109 N. E. 2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes, Section 1-201, concerning interpreting statutes provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201cThe construction of all statutes of this state shall be by the following rules, unless such construction be plainly repugnant to the intent of the legislature or of the context of the same statute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cFirst. Words and phrases shall be given in their plain, or ordinary and usual sense. But technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be understood according to their technical import.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5v\">We are of the opinion that the ordinary man would understand an industrial plant to be any factory, business or concern which is engaged primarily in the manufacture or assembly of goods or the processing of raw materials, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>In reviewing the evidence in the record, we do not find that any evidence was introduced to support the court\u2019s definition of the words \u201cindustrial plants\u201d and we are of the opinion that the trial court\u2019s definition is not supported by any evidence, that it is all-inclusive, and not limited to what the ordinary man would understand an industrial plant to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In examining the record now before us to determine whether the Appellee George E.

Well, our biggest one right now is the new Greenwood Shopping Center.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-16\">\u201cQ. What do you do there?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-17\">\u201cA. It\u2019s all traffic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-18\">\u201cQ. All traffic?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-19\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-20\">\u201cQ.

Well, yes, we do, we escort the people to the bank for their deposits, again try to prevent any theft from the parking lots, from cars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-26\">\u201cQ.

Yes, I have Service Spring Company.

Do you have any other type of guarding service, other than what you have already set out?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u201cA.

Well it\u2019s mostly for the parking of the cars and keeping down any fights from the students.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">On cross-examination Mr. Markin testified in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">\u201cQ. Do your guards provide a service for the purpose of and to protect persons or property or to prevent the misappropriation or concealment of goods, various merchandise, monies, bonds, stocks, choses in action, notes and other valuable documents or papers, do they do any of these things?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-13\">\u201cA. Yes they do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">In view of the construction which we place on the words \u201cindustrial plant\u201d and in view of the foregoing answers to interrogatories, and the foregoing evidence adduced at the trial of the cause, we are of the opinion that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding and decision that \u201cPlaintiff Hargraves furnishes such security guards for hire <em>solely to industrial plants for plant security\u201d </em>(our emphasis).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">It does not appear to us that the plaintiff, George E. Hargrave, d/b/a Hargrave Secret Service, produced any evidence to prove that he provided a guard service which guarded <em>only </em>industrial plants, as we construe the words \u201cindustrial plants.\u201d On the contrary, the answers to interrogatories and the evidence shows that the guards worked at shopping centers, individual stores and shops, theaters and a museum.</p>\n<p id=\"AO7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Having found that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s decision, we must reverse the decision. The decision is reversed, and the trial court is ordered to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, and to take such other steps as are not inconsistent with this opinion. Carson, C.
