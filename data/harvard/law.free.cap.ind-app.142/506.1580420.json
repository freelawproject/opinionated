The only question before the court was one of law, and not of fact, or of fact and law, and the sole function of the trial court was to determine the law applicable to the facts as they are shown by the pleadings and the agreed statement of facts in the record now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The Appellant contended in the trial court\u2019and now contends in this appeal that the false answers made by the applicant Gerald Knoll to the Appellant\u2019s \u201cunderwriters questionable\u201d were material, and had the Appellant known the true facts concerning the driving record of the said Gerald Knoll, the company would not have issued the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The general rule of law is that it is essential there must be a meeting of the minds upon all the necessary elements of an insurance contract, such as the subject matter, the risk insured against, the amount, the duration of the risk and the premium. If it is incomplete in any of the material particulars, or the assent of either party is wanting, such contract has no binding force. West\u2019s Indiana Law Encyclopedia Vol. 16, <em>Insurance, </em>\u00a7 85, p. 225; <em>The Celina Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Baldridge </em>(1937), 213 Ind. 198, 10 N. E. 2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">We are of the opinion that it would seem to be obvious that the questions in an \u201cunderwriters questionaire\u201d which concern past driving records of an applicant are intended to elicit information from which the Company may determine whether to assume the risk and issue the policy. A deliberate false answer of \u201cno\u201d by the applicant, Gerald Knoll, to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">\u201cHas any driver had auto insurance declined, cancelled, renewal refused, <em>or had his driver's license revoked, suspended, restricted, or been required to file evidence of Financial Responsibility during the past 36 months?\u201d </em>(our emphasis).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>when, in fact, at the time he executed the questionnaire on May 28, 1964, his driver\u2019s license had been suspended as the result of an accident on October 31, 1963, and proof of his financial responsibility had been required, as is shown by the agreed statement of facts, was sufficient in itself to establish concealment and misrepresentation by said Gerald Knoll.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">A concealment in the law of insurance implies an intention to withhold or secrete information so that the one entitled to be informed will remain in ignorance. When one has a duty to disclose, such concealment under the law of insurance, implies deceit, and the procurement of a policy of insurance through the concealment of material facts which one is duty bound to disclose, amounts to fraud, which may vitiate the policy. <em>The Rushville National Bank of Rushville, Trustee, et al. </em>v. <em>The State Life Insurance Co. </em>(1936), 210 Ind. 492, 1 N. E. 2d 445. See also West\u2019s Indiana Law Encyclopedia, Yol. 16, <em>Insurance, </em>\u00a7 172, p. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In the treatise of Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, Vol. 12, \u00a7 7273, at page 377, we find the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\"><em>\u201cA </em>concealment sufficient to avoid a policy must be in connection with a matter material to the risk. Where the \u25a0 concealment could in no event increase the risk loss, or would not induce the insurer to decline the risk or charge a higher premium, the matter could scarcely be considered material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">\u201cConversely, if the insured failed to disclose matters material to the risk, such as might have influenced the insurer\u2019s determination as to acceptance of the risk or fixing of the premium charge, the contract is voidable at the insurer\u2019s option.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">After a review of the various authorities, we are of the opinion that it is the general rule of law in almost every jurisdiction that insurance policies are contracts in which the utmost good faith is required both on the part of the insurer and the insured. A failure by the insured to disclose conditions affecting the risk of which he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>aware makes the contract voidable at the insurer\u2019s option. In Indiana we follow the majority rule. Our Supreme Court in the case of <em>Brunnemer, Admx. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1938), 213 Ind. 650, 14 N. E. 2d 97, at p. 658 said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cIf the insurer in the application asks the prospective applicant about a fact that is within his knowledge, and he answers falsely, still such false answer does not necessarily avoid the policy. Whether or not the false answer will have the effect of avoiding the policy will depend upon a determination of its materiality. If the facts that are withheld or suppressed by the false answer would have reasonably entered into and influenced the company in its decision as to whether it would issue the policy, then such false answers would avoid the policy. But on the other hand, if such suppressed matters could not have reasonably influenced the decision of the company on the question of issuing the policy, then it is difficult to see how such immaterial matter could be considered harmful. So if the company inquires about matters, calling for the opinion of the insured, such as was the case in <em>Mouler </em>v. <em>American Life Insurance Company, supra, </em>the applicant is obliged to answer truthfully and with the utmost good faith, because the question calls for information vital and material to the insurance company; and if the answer is false and known to be false at the time, such false answers will render the policy void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In the case of <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Head </em>(1927), 86 Ind. App. 326, 328, 157 N. E. 448, at 449, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cIt is well established that, if representations in an application for insurance are false and material, that is, are such as would have influenced the action of the company upon the application in regard to whether or not it would grant the insurance, the policy will be vitiated, unless the company has in some way waived the benefit of it by its conduct and with knowledge of the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In the case of <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Becraft </em>(1938), 213 Ind. 378, 12 N. E. 2d 952, at pages 384 and 385, our Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cFalse representations, concerning a material fact, which mislead, will avoid an insurance contract, like any other contract, regardless of whether the misrepresentation was innocently made or made with a fraudulent design. <em>New York Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Kuhlenschmidt </em>(1937), ante 213 Ind. 212, 11 N. E. 2d 673 .. . An unqualified statement that a fact \u25a0exists or does not exist, made for the purpose of inducing another to act, implies that the person who makes, -it is acquainted with the facts, and, if action is induced by the representation and false statement, the law will impute to him who made the false representation a fraudulent purpose. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Reeves, et al. </em>(1889), 121 Ind. 280, 22 N. E. 139. \u2018Where a party represents a material fact to be true to his personal knowledge, as distinguished from belief or opinion, when he does not know whether it is true or not and it is actually untrue, he is. guilty of falsehood, even if he believes it to be true, and if the statement is thus made with the intention that it shall be acted upon by another who does so act upon it to his injury, the result is actionable fraud.\u2019 <em>Rochester Bridge Co. et al. v. McNeill </em>(1919), 188 Ind. 432, 439, 122 N. E. 662. It is the injury caused by the misrepresentation of fact that the law protects against. If the misrepresentation was brought about by forgetfullness or mistake it is just as injurious as an intentional fraud. It accomplishes a fraud upon the other contracting party by inducing him to act upon a false premise, where he would not have acted had he known the truth. Whether it' be caused by negligence, or actual fraudulent purpose, good intention or bad, the result is the same. There is no meeting of the minds. It was not necessary for the jury to find fraud as a fact. If there is misrepresentation of a material matter the law constructs the fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGC\">Where, as in the cause now before us, where the pleadings, agreed statement of facts and the law applicable thereto reveal that the Appellant has been denied a decision that it was entitled to, such decision is contrary to law. The Judgment is reversed, and the trial court is ordered to take such further steps as are not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Carson, C.
