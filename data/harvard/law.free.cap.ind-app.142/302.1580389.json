Appellants have filed no answer brief in opposition to this motion. Rule 1-14B, <em>supra, </em>which became effective March 1, 1967, states, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-15\">\u201cWhenever a new trial is requested on the ground or grounds \u2018that the verdict or decision is not sustained by sufficient evidence or is contrary to law,\u2019 the moving party shall file a memorandum stating specifically under such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>itemized cause wherein such evidence is insufficient or the verdict or decision is contrary to law. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The record in this cause reveals that appellants\u2019 motion for new trial was filed March 13, 1967, and thus falls within the ambit of the above rule. Appellants\u2019 motion, omitting the caption and signature, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">\u201cComes now the defendants in the above-entitled cause and move the court for a new trial thereof for the following reasons, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u201c1. The decision or finding of the court is not sustained by sufficient evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">\u201c2. The decision and finding of the court is contrary to law and the principals of law applicable to this particular case involving tax title deeds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">\u201cWHEREFORE the defendants pray the Court for a new trial of said cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">The above are the only reasons given as grounds for the granting of the motion for new trial. Nowhere in the transcript or appellants\u2019 brief can a memorandum be found as required in Rule 1-14B, <em>supra. </em>Furthermore, this rule also states that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">\u201cThe party filing such motion shall be deemed to have waived any ground not specified in the memorandum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">Since appellants have failed to file a memorandum pointing out the insufficiency of the evidence or wherein the decision is contrary to law, any alleged error on these grounds must be deemed waived. Therefore, there being no other grounds specified in the motion for new trial, the assignment of errors presented by the appellants that \u201c[t]he court erred in overruling appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial\u201d presents no question for the consideration of this court, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Carson, C.
