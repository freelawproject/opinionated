The appellants filed a motion for a new trial which was withdrawn on August 25, 1967, and this appeal was filed with our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">We are now confronted with the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss or affirm, filed on December 19, 1967, wherein the appellees petition this court to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss or affirm alleges the following deficiencies in the appellants\u2019 brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">\u201cAppellants have not included in' their brief any summary of argument which is required to be set forth without citation of authorities or statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-13\">\u201cThe brief does not: 1) specify such of the assigned errors as are intended to be urged; 2) does not consistently state the basis of objections to any ruling of the lower court complained of; 3) exhibit clearly the points of fact and law being presented, and how they are applicable, with citations of authority or statute upon which the appellants may rely. The argument section of appellants\u2019 brief does not contain any discussion of any error of the lower court set forth in the Assignment of Errors which assignment is included at page 1 of the transcript and set forth at page 62 of the appellants\u2019 brief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">The appellees\u2019 allegations are well founded. Rule 2-17 of The Supreme Court of Indiana sets forth certain basic requirements in the preparation of an Appellant\u2019s Brief. In substance, this rule, in part, requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>A) Subsection (g) provides that the Appellant shall set forth in the argument section a brief summary of the argument without citation of authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">B) The argument section shall specify such of the assigned errors as are intended to be urged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">C) After each error being relied upon for reversal, Appellant shall concisely state the basis of his objection to the ruling complained of, exhibiting clearly the points of fact and of law being presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">D) The Brief is supposed to show how the authorities are applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The appellants\u2019 brief does not comply with the above provisions of Rule 2-17.</p>\n<p id=\"Apz\">The rule is well settled that where the appellant fails to comply with such rule (2-17), the appellee need not supply the omissions but may rely upon the court to enforce the rule. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>State </em>(1955), 234 Ind. 234, 125 N. E. 2d 802. Failure to treat the assigned error as required by Rule 2-17 waives any error of the trial court and our court will refuse to consider any such error. <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>State </em>(1954), 233 Ind. 341, 118 N. E. 2d 493. See also, <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Selking </em>(1965), 246 Ind. 629, 207 N. E. 2d 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Having considered the appellant\u2019s brief in regard to the above rules and the authorities cited thereunder, we are of the opinion that the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss should be sustained. The Rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana are binding upon our court as well as the litigants involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">Cook, P. J., Bierly and Pfaff, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 235 N. E. 2d 203.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
