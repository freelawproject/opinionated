Appellant then filed its motion for a new trial, which was overruled, and consequently, such action constituted appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Appellant divides his argument into three portions. The first deals with the trial .court\u2019s action in excluding a portion of the testimony of an expert witness. The second deals with an instruction, and finally, the third deals with the question of excessive damages. For purposes of this appeal we will discuss each portion in the same order.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Appellant, in its motion for a new trial, alleges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">\u201cThe Court erred in sustaining the objections of the plaintiff to the question hereinafter set forth, propounded by the defendant during the direct examination of James M. Clayton, a witness called on behalf of defendant, . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">It appears from the record that Mr. Clayton had testified as to the coliform count per milliter at two points in Raccoon Ditch, and that, in his opinion, these counts were normal for that type of operation or installation and that in his opinion the Imhoff tank was operating properly at the time of the samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">He then testified .concerning records of other cities that he had reviewed at the Indiana State Board of Health in Indianapolis which had similar sewage treatment plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">Finally, he was asked the results of these other tests of which he observed in the records of the State Board of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">The question was objected to as being hearsay, which objection was sustained by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">Appellant contends upon appeal, that where an expert witness has given his opinion, the basis upon which he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>formed his opinion should also be allowed, and for that reason, it is an exception to the hearsay rule. Cited as authority is the case of <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Town of Speedway </em>(1965), 137 Ind. App. 510, 210 N. E. 2d 95, and <em>Walter </em>v. <em>State </em>(1935), 208 Ind. 231, 195 N. E. 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">While we are in agreement with the above authorities, we are of the opinion that the principles announced in said authorities are not relevant to the question posed.</p>\n<p id=\"AuP5\">The question as it was posed did not ask for any basis of a former opinion, but merely asked what results were on record at the State Board of Health from other cities, and from what he had observed how did they .compare with those from Raccoon Ditch. See: <em>Northern Ind. Pub. S. Co. </em>v. <em>W. J. and M. S. Vesey </em>(1936), 210 Ind. 338, 200 N. E. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Appellant\u2019s second contention concerns the following Instruction, and appellant\u2019s objection thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201cThe Court instructs you that at all times material herein there was a statute of the State of Indiana in full force and effect which provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">\u201c \u2018Sec. 2-505 Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes \u2014 Whatever is injurious to health, or indecent, or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as essentially to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, is a nuisance, and the subject of an action.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">\u201cThe defendant objects to the giving of plaintiff\u2019s requested instruction #18 for the reason that the Statute which is set out and quoted in said instruction is one which applies only to the abatement of nuisances and the means of doing same and does not pretend to define a nuisance as negligence; for the further reason that the instruction fails to include the necessity of proximate .cause, and for the further reason that the quotation of the Statute is so broad and so all-inclusive as to tell the jury that the slightest matter of offense to senses or obstruction to the free use of property, both of which are not involved in the case at bar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>or the use or failure to do away with what may be indecent without definition of the term \u2018indecent\u2019 so broadly defines an act which may readily be determined by the jury to be an act of negligence or an act of malfeasance; that such instruction is an erroneous statement with reference to the law of negligence and civil liability; for the further reason that the complaint herein does not charge violation of the Statute set out in the instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aej\">Appellant in its brief cites some cases from other jurisdictions in an attempt to show that the above Instruction is mandatory. However, the courts of this state have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cA mandatory instruction unequivocally charges the jury that if they find from a preponderance of the evidence that a certain set of facts exists, they must render a verdict in accordance therewith, either for the plaintiff or in favor of the defendant. It positively directs the jury to find for one party and against the other.\u201d <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1959), 129 Ind. App. 659, 667, 159 N. E. 2d 586.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Also, it appears that appellant did not object to the Instruction as being mandatory, in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">Appellant also contends that the question of offensiveness to the senses and an obstruction to the free use of property were not in issue in the trial court, thus the Instruction was erroneous. We find no merit to this argument. Appellant also states that the entire statute should have been given in the Instruction, but we do not find any such objection made in the trial court, and will not consider it now, for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Finally, appellant claims that the damages are excessive, and a result of prejudice and partiality \u201cagainst an anonymous entity, a relatively prosperous city composed of formless, taxpaying individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ax53\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Generally a showing must be made that the damages assessed were motivated by prejudice, passion, partiality, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>corruption, or that some improper element was considered. See: <em>Clemans Truck Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Vaughn </em>(1966), 139 Ind. App. 404, 220 N. E. 2d, 351. In order to find an inference of the above factors, we ordinarily must examine the evidence on the question of damages. In the case at bar, we do not conclude that $40,000.00 was excessive by judicial standards, as, according to evidence, the boy\u2019s kneecap required surgical removal and during a four year period he suffered a good deal, and also there is evidence to indicate he will suffer even more in the future. Future suffering is a proper element of damages. <em>Chi. &amp; Cal. Dist. Transit etc. </em>v. <em>Stravatzakes </em>(1959), 129 Ind. App. 337, 156 N. E. 2d 902. There is considerable summary of evidence of damage in appellees\u2019 brief, but we feel it would unduly lengthen this opinion if we were to set it forth in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Having found no reversible error, we are of the opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Cook, P. J., Pfaff and Smith, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 233 N. E. 2d 495.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
