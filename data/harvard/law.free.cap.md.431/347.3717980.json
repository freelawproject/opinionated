At the time of the accident, Petitioner and her husband had a motor vehicle liability insurance policy with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm Auto\u201d), and an umbrella policy with State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (\u201cRespondent\u201d) (collectively, \u201cState Farm\u201d). The umbrella policy contained a household exclusion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which formed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>basis for State Farm\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s claim under the umbrella policy. Petitioner challenges the household exclusion\u2019s validity in light of Maryland Code (1997, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2005 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 19-504.1 of the Insurance Article (\u201c \u00a7 19-504.1\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which requires an insurer to offer liability coverage for claims of family members in the same amount of liability coverage for claims of nonfamily members under a \u201cpolicy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance.\u201d Petitioner claims that she and her husband were never offered equal coverage for family members under their umbrella policy, which contained motor vehicle coverage. Therefore, according to Petitioner, the household exclusion in their umbrella policy is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The issue before this Court is the proper interpretation of the phrase \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d as contained in \u00a7 19-504.1. Specifically, we are asked whether an umbrella policy fits within that definition such that an insurer must offer an insured liability coverage for family members in the same amount as the liability coverage for nonfamily members. We shall hold that the umbrella policy does not fit within the definition of \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d as contained in \u00a7 19-504.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On March 19, 2008, Petitioner was riding as a passenger in a vehicle driven by her husband when, according to Petitioner, her husband negligently drove into an intersection and was struck by another vehicle. As a result of the accident, Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tioner\u2019s husband was killed and Petitioner suffered serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">At the time of the accident, Petitioner and her husband had several policies of insurance issued by State Farm. They had a motor vehicle liability policy with coverage of $100,000 per person and $800,000 per accident with State Farm Auto. Mrs. Stickley and her husband also had a Personal Liability Umbrella Policy with personal liability and uninsured motorist coverage of $2,000,000 with Respondent, a subsidiary of State Farm Auto. According to Petitioner, the Stickleys purchased both policies from the same State Farm agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The umbrella policy was originally purchased in the 1980\u2019s and issued by State Farm. It provided coverage for bodily injury, personal injury,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and property damage. On the \u201cDeclarations Page,\u201d the umbrella policy required the insured to maintain specific underlying insurance, including automobile liability insurance. The umbrella policy also included the following language under the \u201cExclusions\u201d and \u201cDefinitions\u201d sections, respectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">EXCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">There is no coverage under this policy for any:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">13. bodily injury or personal injury to any insured as defined in part a. or b. of the definition of insured, including any claim made or suit brought against any insured to share damages with or repay someone else who may be obligated to pay damages because of such bodily injury or personal injury [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag7\">6. \u201cinsured\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">a. you and your relatives whose primary residence is your household;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>b. any other human being under the age of 21 whose primary residence is your household and who is in the care of a person described in 6.a[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">12. \u201crelative\u201d means any person related to you by blood, adoption, or marriage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">After the accident, Petitioner filed a claim under their automobile liability policy for injuries and losses she sustained as a result of the March 2008 accident. State Farm offered Petitioner the full $100,000 in liability coverage provided under the policy. Petitioner also made a claim for bodily injury under the umbrella policy. State Farm denied the claim, however, due to the household exclusion included in the policy which denied payment of damages for bodily injury or personal injury resulting from the negligence of another insured household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">On February 1, 2010, Petitioner filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Petitioner sought to have the household exclusion in the umbrella policy declared void. To support her claim, Petitioner cited \u00a7 19-504.1, enacted in 2004, that requires an insurer to offer its insured, under a policy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance, liability coverage for claims made by family members in the same amount as liability coverage for claims made by nonfamily members. The statute only applies when the liability coverage in the private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy exceeds the State-mandated minimum amount of coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner argued that their Personal Liability Umbrella Policy is private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance, and \u201cthe exclusion, which was included in the policy prior to 2004 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>never signed off [ ] by the insureds, [is therefore] void\u201d in light of the statute. Subsequently, both Petitioner and Respondent filed Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On March 30, 2011, a hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The trial judge ruled in favor of State Farm and granted its Motion for Summary Judgment. Finding \u201cabsolutely no ambiguity in Section 19-504.1[,]\u201d the judge stated \u201cthat the umbrella policy in this case is not a part of, referred to, connected to, or the same as, a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance [policy].\u201d The trial judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">The Court interprets and reads 19-504.1 literally, and it indicates that a policy ... it doesn\u2019t say where there is other coverage. It says, a policy of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance, liability coverage for claims made by family members, in the same amount as liability coverage for claims made by non-family members under the policy. That is, the insurer shall offer. And in this case, the [$4100,000 pertains to her the same as it would anyone else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">In the particular case of the umbrella, that\u2019s a separate animal. It has a lot of coverage. It covers the entire waterfront, but it doesn\u2019t make it a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance coverage policy. That\u2019s so specific that the Court doesn\u2019t even have to strain to guess. It defies credulity to say that it\u2019s ambiguous. It\u2019s about as clear as it can be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The judge further indicated that the General Assembly could have linked umbrella policies and motor vehicle policies together by specifically referencing \u201cany type of policy which affords coverage in any motor vehicle accident\u201d in the statute. As the judge noted, however, the statute was not written that way, and \u201c[o]ur job is to look at what the law says.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Petitioner appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court issued its reported opinion affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling. <em>Stickley v. State Farm, Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>204 Md.App. 679, 682, 42 A.3d 696, 697 (2012). According to the intermediate appellate court, the General Assembly enacted the statute at issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u00a7 19-504.1, \u201cto ensure that, when obtaining a policy of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance with limits in excess of the statutory minimum, the insured would have a right to obtain that policy without a household exclusion.\u201d 204 Md.App. at 696, 42 A.3d at 706. In applying the \u201cpublic policy considerations leading up to the enactment of the statute\u201d the court reasoned that interpreting the phrase \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d as applying to <em>any </em>policy that contains, even in part, some motor vehicle liability insurance, \u201cwould be a colossal leap[.]\u201d 204 Md.App. at 696-98, 42 A.3d at 706-07. Further, the court noted the title given to Article 19, Subtitle 5, <em>\u201cMotor Vehicle Insurance </em>\u2014 Primary <em>Coverage </em>\u201d (emphasis added), and analyzed the text of other sections in the Subtitle to support the conclusion that \u00a7 19-504.1 must have referred to primary policies alone, and not umbrella policies. 204 Md.App. at 695, 698-700, 42 A.3d at 705, 707-08. Finally, in the court\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he coverage under a policy of \u2018private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u2019 focuses on the scheduled motor vehicles, which is also the focus of the mandatory insurance requirements^] [whereas] [t]he coverage under an umbrella policy focuses on the insured.\u201d 204 Md.App. at 700, 42 A.3d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Subsequently, Petitioner asked that we review the case. We granted <em>certiorari, </em>in <em>Stickley v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>427 Md. 606, 50 A.3d 606 (2012), to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">1. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that Insurance Code \u00a7 19-504.1 does not apply to excess of umbrella policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">2. Whether a personal liability umbrella policy that includes motor vehicle liability insurance constitutes \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d as contemplated by Insurance Code \u00a7 19-504.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">DISCUSSION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">I.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The issue in the present case is the correct interpretation of \u00a7 19-504.1, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u00a7 19-504.1. Coverage for claims of family members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">(a) <em>Applicability. </em>\u2014 This section applies only when the liability coverage under a policy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance exceeds the amount required under \u00a7 17-103 of the Transportation Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">(b) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 An insurer shall offer to the first named insured under a policy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance liability coverage for claims made by a family member in the same amount as the liability coverage for claims made by a nonfamily member under the policy or binder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">(c) <em>Form. </em>\u2014 (1) An offer made under this section shall be made on the form that the Commissioner requires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">(2) The form may be part of the insurance application, policy, contract, or binder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">(3) The form shall clearly and concisely explain in 10 point boldface type:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">(1) the nature, extent, benefit, and cost of the amount of liability coverage for claims made by family members that is available to the first named insured; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">(ii) that an insurer may not refuse to underwrite a first named insured because the first named insured requests or elects the liability coverage for claims made by family members in an amount equal to the coverage provided for claims made by nonfamily members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">(d) <em>Prohibitions against insurers. </em>\u2014 (1) An insurer may not refuse to underwrite a first named insured because the first named insured requests or elects the liability coverage for claims made by family members in an amount equal to the coverage provided for claims made by nonfamily members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">(2) An insurer that violates this subsection is subject to the penalties provided in \u00a7\u00a7 4-113 and 4-114 of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">/ [Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">As noted by the intermediate appellate court, the Stickleys\u2019 umbrella policy was renewed after the effective date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>statute and, \u201cthus, is subject to \u00a7 19-504.1 if it comes within its substantive terms.\u201d <em>Stickley, </em>204 Md.App. at 685, 42 A.3d at 699. We must assess, therefore, whether an umbrella policy is a policy of \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance,\u201d thereby requiring the insurer to offer liability coverage for family members in the same amount as coverage for nonfamily members.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Petitioner argues that the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cinterest in protecting an insured\u2019s ability to recover damages in excess of the statutory m\u00ednimums evidences an intent for [\u00a7 19-504.1] to include excess liability policies.\u201d By only affording Petitioner the benefit of her primary motor vehicle coverage, Petitioner argues, she is being denied the extra protection she sought in the umbrella policy, which contradicts the purpose and language of the statute. With regard to the plain meaning of the statute, Petitioner\u2019s central argument is that because the umbrella policy contained motor vehicle liability insurance coverage, it is considered private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance as contemplated by \u00a7 19-504.1. Petitioner also argues that because the umbrella policy in the instant case required Petitioner to carry underlying motor vehicle insurance, \u201cthis requirement, [ ] intrinsically linked the two policies together making the motor vehicle coverage of the [u]mbrella [p]olicy an extension of the underlying policy, and, thus, the [u]mbrella [p]olicy would constitute private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Positing several textual arguments with reference to the uninsured motor vehicle statutes, Md.Code (1997, 2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 19-509, 19-510 of the Insurance Article, Petitioner contends that although the General Assembly distinguished between underlying policies and umbrella policies in the uninsured motorist statutes, it did not do so in \u00a7 19-504.1 because the General Assembly intended both underlying motor vehicle policies and umbrella policies to be incorporated into \u00a7 19-504.1. Finally, Petitioner reviews Maryland legislative history and precedent to argue, in the alternative, that household exclusions in umbrella policies are against Maryland public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>To the contrary, Respondent maintains that the umbrella policy in question is not a policy of \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and \u201c[f]or this reason, State Farm was not obliged to provide coverage where neither the policy nor [\u00a7 19-504.1] required it to do so.\u201d Looking at the plain meaning of the statute, Respondent claims that umbrella policies are broad-based, general, <em>personal </em>liability policies that follow the insured, which is separate and distinct from a policy of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance that covers the motor vehicle and anyone with permission to operate it. Along these lines, Respondent argues that the fact that certain policy coverages overlap \u201cdoes not transform one type of policy into another for purposes of statutory interpretation.\u201d Rather, Respondent contends, the General Assembly\u2019s objective in providing automobile liability coverage for claims of family members equal to others above the statutory minimum can be accomplished through the purchase of higher limits of automobile liability insurance. According to Respondent, \u201c[s]uch additional coverage should not be created by way of a strained interpretation of the nature of an umbrella policy to fit it within the definition of [] \u2018private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance []\u2019____\u201d Finally, Respondent asserts that by enacting \u00a7 19-504.1, the General Assembly \u201cchose not to abrogate the household exclusion altogether above statutory minimum coverage, but, [elected,] instead to offer the insured the opportunity, for an additional premium, to purchase liability limits for family members equal to that of nonfamily members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The legal issue in this case is one of statutory interpretation. As we stated in <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613, 937 A.2d 242, 257-58 (2007) (citations and quotations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>In construing the plain language, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. Statutory text should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u201cIt is also clear that we avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Centre Ins. Co. v. J.T.W., </em>397 Md. 71, 81, 916 A.2d 235, 240-41 (2007) (citations and quotations omitted). Additionally, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">We analyze the contested provisions of Maryland\u2019s Insurance Article in the context of the statutory scheme and construe the plain language so that the various sections of the article do not conflict with one another.... In addition, the meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which it appears. As this Court has stated, because it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">We begin by looking at the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cpolicy or binder of <em>private passenger motor vehicle liability </em>insurance.\u201d (emphasis added). By its terms, a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy refers to a specific type of <em>motor vehicle liability insurance </em>policy. These insurance policies have been held by this Court to \u201cattach[] to automobiles and not to individuals.\u201d <em>Neale v. Wright, </em>322 Md. 8, 16, 585 A.2d 196, 199-200 (1991). By contrast, a <em>personal </em>liability umbrella policy includes coverage for a myriad of losses suffered by the insured. This might include coverage for losses resulting in \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d such as false arrest, wrongful eviction, libel, and defamation of character. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>personal liability umbrella policy might also include protection against excess judgments of third parties with regard to the operation of a motor vehicle. Therefore, umbrella policies attach generally to the insured, whereas private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policies attach to the motor vehicle and protect against injuries and/or damages resulting from the operation of the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Additionally, a motor vehicle liability insurance policy is a type of primary policy that is required in the State. For example, as explained by one scholar, \u201can individual\u2019s automobile liability and homeowner\u2019s policies are [types of] primary insurance policies.\u201d Michael M. Marick, <em>Excess Insurance: An Overview of General Principles and Current Issues, </em>24 Tort &amp; Ins. L.J. 715, 716 (1989). Primary policies of motor vehicle liability insurance \u201cattach[ ] immediately upon the happening of the occurrence ... giv[ing] rise to liability[,]\u201d and have been required with a mandated minimum amount of coverage since the General Assembly revised the State\u2019s automobile insurance laws in 1972. <em>See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>307 Md. 631, 635-36, 516 A.2d 586, 588 (1986)(discussing the General Assembly\u2019s mandated compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance law); <em>Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>117 Md.App. 72, 117, 699 A.2d 482, 504 (1997) (citations and quotations omitted) (defining \u201cprimary insurance\u201d); <em>see also </em>Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 17-103 of the Transportation Article (noting that \u201cthe form of security required ... is a vehicle liability insurance policy\u201d in certain minimum amounts); Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 17-104 of the Transportation Article (explaining that evidence of the state-required security is a prerequisite to obtaining registration of a motor vehicle). By statute, an insurer may issue, sell, or deliver such motor vehicle liability insurance policies with coverage above the minimum required amount. Md.Code (1997, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 19-502(b) of the Insurance Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">By contrast, an umbrella policy is a supplemental form of insurance that is distinguishable from more specific primary policies, such as motor vehicle liability insurance or home<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>owner\u2019s insurance. For example, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines an \u201cumbrella policy\u201d as \u201c[a]n insurance policy covering losses that exceed the basic or usual limits of liability <em>provided by other policies.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>811 (7th ed.1999) (emphasis added). Moreover, \u201cumbrella insurance\u201d is specifically referred to as \u201c[insurance that is <em>supplemental, </em>providing coverage that exceeds the basic or usual limits of liability.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 811 (7th ed.1999) (emphasis added). Under either definition, therefore, umbrella policies are described not merely as an extension of the primary policy, but rather as a distinct and different form of coverage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Megonnell v. U.S. Auto. Assoc., </em>368 Md. 633, 796 A.2d 758 (2002) (contrasting an insured\u2019s primary motor vehicle liability policy from a separate umbrella policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Not only are the basic definitions and coverages different in motor vehicle liability policies and umbrella policies, but the purpose of both forms of coverage are different. Although primary insurance attaches \u201cupon the happening of the occurrence that gives rise to liability ... [ejxcess insurance^] [by contrast,] attaches only after a predetermined amount of primary coverage has been exhausted.\u201d <em>Empire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>117 Md.App. at 117, 699 A.2d at 504 (citations and quotations omitted). In fact, umbrella policies generally \u201crequire the existence of a primary policy as a condition of coverage!,]\u201d because the umbrella coverage only \u201ckicks in\u201d after the primary policy is exhausted to protect against <em>catastrophic loss. Couch on Insurance 3d </em>\u00a7 220:32 (2005)(emphasis added). Moreover, one scholar noted that umbrella policies are \u201cclearly designed to be comprehensive <em>excess </em>policies.\u201d 8C Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 5071.65 (1981)(emphasis added). Appleman points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">Umbrella policies serve an important function in the industry. In this day of uncommon, but possible, enormous verdicts, they pick up this exceptional hazard at a small premium. Assuming one\u2019s automobile and homeowner\u2019s policies have liability limits of $100,000 or even $500,000, the umbrella policy may pick up at that point and cover for an additional million, five million, or ten million. It may assume as a primary carrier certain coverages not included elsewhere, such as invasion of privacy, false arrest, etc., but there is no intention to supplant the basic carriers on the homeowners or automobile coverages. Therefore, these should not even enter into our current consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">As we have explained in the past, we interpret the plain meaning of a statute in light of the context in which it appears. <em>See Centre Ins. Co., </em>397 Md. at 85, 916 A.2d at 243 (applying a provision of the Insurance Article in context of the statutory scheme of its Title). \u201cOur ultimate objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>See Md. Econ. Dev. Corp. v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>431 Md. 189, 64 A.3d 478 (2013) (citations and quotations omitted). An examination of the statute in context provides further indication that the General Assembly did not intend \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d to include umbrella policies. The subtitle at issue in the present case, <em>\u201cSubtitle 5. Motor Vehicle Insurance </em>\u2014 Primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Coverage </em>\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (emphasis added) includes other statutes that refer generally to motor vehicle insurance policies providing primary coverage. By including \u00a7 19-504.1 within this subtitle, the General Assembly demonstrated its intention to address household exclusions in primary policies. In \u00a7 19-504, for example, the term \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance policy\u201d is used to discuss the minimum amount of coverage required in a primary policy. The statute states that \u201c[e]ach motor vehicle liability insurance policy ... shall provide the minimum liability coverage specified in Title 17 of the Transportation Article.\u201d Md.Code (1997, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 19-504 of the Insurance Article. It would be illogical to interpret the phrase \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance policy\u201d in this statute as referring to umbrella policies, because umbrella policies, by definition, are supplemental and serve as an excess form of coverage to motor vehicle primary policies. By contrast, \u00a7 19-504 discusses <em>minimum </em>liability coverage. The same reasoning would apply in \u00a7 19-505, which discusses the required <em>minimum </em>amount of personal injury protection (\u201cPIP\u201d) coverage in a \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance policy.\u201d Md.Code (1997, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 19-505 of the Insurance Article. As such, examining the language of the statute in context supports the proposition that a policy of \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d refers to a primary motor vehicle liability insurance policy, and does not extend to include an umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In support of Petitioner\u2019s argument, that \u00a7 19-504.1 must include umbrella policies, Petitioner cites to the uninsured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) statutes in the Insurance Article. Md.Code (1997, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 19-509, 19-510. First, Petitioner contends that although Title 19, Subtitle 5 refers to \u201cPrimary Coverage,\u201d one of the UM statutes that falls within that section, \u00a7 19-509(h)(l), has been interpreted to apply to umbrella policies, thereby showing a legislative intent to treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>umbrella policies as motor vehicle liability insurance. <em>Cf. Popham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>333 Md. 136, 152-53, 634 A.2d 28, 36 (1993)(explaining an insurer\u2019s option to provide UM coverage under an umbrella policy). Unlike other language contained in Title 19, Subtitle 5, however, \u00a7 19-509(h)(1) explicitly refers to policies that are different in kind from primary policies. For example, the language of the statute itself discusses policies whose <em>\u201cprimary purpose[] </em>provides coverage in excess\u201d of other forms of insurance. Md.Code (1997, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 19-509(h)(l) of the Insurance Article (emphasis added). By its own terms, therefore, \u00a7 19-509(h)(l) explicitly distances itself from the primary motor vehicle policies discussed elsewhere in the section.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, by contrast, \u00a7 19-504.1, shows no indication that it applies to policies whose <em>primary purpose </em>is to provide excess coverage. Rather, it refers to a \u201cpolicy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d with liability coverage exceeding the minimum amount of coverage required.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Petitioner also directs us to the UM statutes to argue that where \u201c[t]he Maryland Legislature distinguished between un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>derlying motor vehicle policies and umbrella policies in the [UM] statute and chose not to do the same thing in the family use exclusion statute [\u00a7 19-504.1] ... the family use exclusion must be read to include all motor vehicle policies, including umbrella policies....\u201d As we discussed above, however, the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d does not include umbrella policies and \u201c[i]n construing the plain language, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute.\u201d <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. at 613, 937 A.2d at 257-58 (citations and quotations omitted). Moreover, Courts will not engage in \u201ca forced or subtle interpretation [in an attempt to] extend[] or limit[] a statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Hastings v. PNC Bank, NA, </em>429 Md. 5, 36, 54 A.3d 714, 732 (2012) (citations omitted). Therefore, we do not read into the General Assembly\u2019s actions beyond what the General Assembly has unambiguously codified.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Additionally, in interpreting a statute, we do not construe it to reach a result that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense. <em>Md. </em>\u2014 Nat\u2019l <em>Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 182, 909 A.2d 694, 700 (2006) (citations and quotations omitted). Under this common sense approach, we note that the fundamental difference between umbrella and motor vehicle policies is underscored by the difference in premiums charged for the different coverages. As noted in <em>Couch on Insurance Sd, </em>\u00a7 220:32 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">The intent of excess and umbrella policies to serve a different function from primary insurance policies with \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses can be discerned from the fact that different rate structures apply to excess and umbrella policies on the one hand, and primary policies with other insurance clauses on the other. In general, umbrella policy premiums are relatively small in relation to the amount of risk so that the company cannot be expected to prorate with other excess coverages; and public policy should not demand that this be done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9N\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Id. </em>(citations and quotations omitted). Common sense also demonstrates that the Stickleys\u2019 umbrella policy differed from policies of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance. For instance, the Stickleys\u2019 umbrella policy was specifically titled <em>\u201cPersonal </em>Liability Umbrella Policy\u201d (emphasis added), indicating that the purpose of the umbrella policy was to provide coverage for the insured, as opposed to attaching primarily to the motor vehicle. Moreover, the Stickleys\u2019 umbrella policy required underlying coverage of automobile liability, recreational motor vehicle liability, personal residential liability, and watercraft liability, further indicating a fundamental distinction between the underlying primary policy and the supplemental, excess umbrella policy. In fact, such a requirement is typical of supplemental umbrella and excess policies. <em>See Couch on Insurance 3d </em>\u00a7 220:32 (2005) (noting that \u201c[b]oth true excess and umbrella policies require the existence of a primary policy as a condition of coverage\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Next, we determine whether, on the facts of this case, enforcing the household exclusion in the Stickleys\u2019 umbrella policy is against public policy, and, as such, should be voided.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u201cAs a general rule, parties are free to contract as they wish.\u201d <em>Nesbit v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 76, 854 A.2d 879, 885 (2004) (citations and quotations omitted). Although the Court will generally allow parties to contract freely, \u201c[a] clause in an insurance policy, which is contrary to the public policy of this State, as set forth in ... the Insurance Code or other statute, is invalid and unenforceable.\u201d <em>State Farm v. Nationwide, </em>307 Md. at 636, 516 A.2d at 588 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>(citations and quotations omitted); <em>see also Jennings v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>302 Md. 352, 356-62, 488 A.2d 166, 168-71 (1985) (citations and quotations omitted) (noting that a household exclusion that excluded all liability coverage for injury to the insured and members of the insured\u2019s household was void as against public policy mandating compulsory automobile liability insurance). We note, however, that a \u201ccontractual provision that violates public policy is invalid ... only to the extent of the conflict between the stated public policy and the contractual provision.\u201d <em>State Farm v. Nationwide, </em>307 Md. at 643, 516 A.2d at 592 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In the present case, the public policy with regard to household exclusions requires the insurer to <em>offer </em>the insured liability coverage for family members in the amount equal to that of nonfamily members in a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy. It would be a violation of public policy, therefore, to enforce a household exclusion in a situation where an insured has not offered coverage for claims of family members equal to that for nonfamily members under a private passenger motor vehicle liability policy exceeding the minimum amount of coverage. \u201cTo permit the \u2018household exclusion\u2019 to operate [in the event the insurer has not offered such liability coverage] ... would be to deprive injured persons of the protection which the Legislature intended to provide, and would violate public policy.\u201d <em>See State Farm v. Nationwide, </em>307 Md. at 643, 516 A.2d at 592 (citations and quotations omitted). The General Assembly, however, has not shown an intent to abrogate household exclusions altogether above statutory minimum coverage. Rather, in enacting \u00a7 19-504.1, the General Assembly chose to offer the insured the opportunity to purchase liability limits for family members equal to that for nonfamily members. <em>Cf. Stearman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>381 Md. 436, 450, 849 A.2d 539, 547 (2004) (noting that \u201cif the General Assembly had intended something closer to complete insurance recovery for all victims, they [could] have said so ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We explained in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hart </em>that \u201cthe invalidity of household exclusion clauses in motor vehicle insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>policies\u201d is based upon specific statutory provisions. 327 Md. 526, 532-33, 611 A.2d 100, 103 (1992). Therefore, with regard to the household exclusion, \u201c[w]e will not invade the province of the General Assembly and rewrite the law for them, no matter how just or fair we may think such a new law or public policy would be.\u201d <em>Stearman, </em>381 Md. at 454-55, 849 A.2d at 550. \u201cThe principle of leaving the creation of public policy to the Legislature is even stronger in a case such as the present one, where the public policy in question is one created by the Legislature in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We hold, therefore, that \u201c[s]o far as the public policy evidenced by the compulsory insurance law is concerned,\u201d the household exclusion in the present case is a valid and enforceable contractual provision. <em>See State Farm v. Nationwide, </em>307 Md. at 644, 516 A.2d at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

An umbrella policy \u201cgenerally provides two types of coverage: (1) standard ... excess coverage; and (2) broader coverage than is provided by the underlying insurance....\u201d Michael M. Marick, <em>Excess Insurance: An Overview of General Principles and Current Issues, </em>24 Tort &amp; Ins. L.J. 715, 718-19 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">For example, an individual who purchases separate policies of primary insurance covering his automobile and homeowner\u2019s liability may also obtain an umbrella policy providing coverage in excess of each of the two primary policies. While the standard homeowner\u2019s policy covers the insured's personal liability for a third party\u2019s \"bodily injury,\u201d the standard personal umbrella policy expands the insured\u2019s coverage to include claims of \"personal injury\u201d (a different type of coverage which may provide coverage for libel, slander, malicious prosecution and various other offenses). Thus, if a libel lawsuit is brought against the insured, the umbrella carrier would effectively become the primary carrier (i.e., \u201cdrop down\u201d) for purposes of the defense and indemnification of the insured. For the insured's automobile liability, however, the umbrella policy would apply in the same manner as a[n] ... excess policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. We note that the phrase \"Primary Coverage\u201d as it appears in Subtitle 5 was placed in the statute by the General Assembly. <em>See </em>Chapter 11 of the Acts of 1996 at 495; Chapter 73 of the Acts of 1972 at 281, 304 (as enacted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">. One of the provisions that \u00a7 19-509(h)(l) may be differentiated from is \u00a7 19 \u2014 509(e)(2), another provision within the UM statute, which employs similar language to \u00a7 19-504.1. Whereas \u00a7 19 \u2014 509(h)(1) states that an insurer <em>may </em>include UM coverage as provided for in \u00a7 19-509, \u00a7 19 \u2014 509(e)(2) states that the UM coverage, under a <em>private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy, shall </em>equal the amount of liability coverage provided under the policy. As our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals explained, interpreting the phrase <em>\u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy </em>\u201d in \u00a7 19 \u2014 509(e)(2) as inclusive of umbrella policies would be inconsistent with \u00a7 19-509(h)(1). This is so because \u00a7 19-509(h)(l), which refers to excess and umbrella policies, is a permissive UM statute, whereas \u00a7 19-509(e)(2), referring to private passenger motor vehicle policies, is a mandatory UM statute. <em>See Stickley v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>204 Md.App. 679, 699-700, 42 A.3d 696, 707-08 (2012). Therefore, it would be inconsistent to interpret \u00a7 19-509(e)(2), as <em>requiring </em>an umbrella policy to provide UM coverage in the same amount as its liability coverage, because \u00a7 19-509(h)(l), which refers to umbrella policies, is a permissive UM statute. We do not read statutes to be inconsistent with each other. Nor do we read statutory text to render a word, clause, sentence, or phrase superfluous or nugatory. <em>See Bowen v.
