The State sought to do that through the testimony of a police officer who had an opportunity to examine Gordon\u2019s driver\u2019s license and to see the date of birth listed there. Gordon objected to that testimony on hearsay grounds, but the State argued that, even if the date of birth was hearsay, it was admissible as an adoptive admission of a party-opponent under Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(2). Under the State\u2019s theory, because Gordon provided the license to the officer upon request, it was as if he himself had stated his age. The trial court agreed with the State and allowed the detective to testify. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">The events giving rise to Gordon\u2019s charges and convictions took place on January 10, 2010. That day, a fourteen-year-old girl was shopping at a Pacific Sunwear Store in the St. Charles Towne Mall, where Gordon worked. In Gordon\u2019s presence, she tried on a pair of pants in a fitting room. At one point, Gordon \u201casked to touch parts of [the girl\u2019s] body and proceeded to insert his finger in her vagina.\u201d He later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201cpulled his penis out and asked if she would perform fellatio on him,\u201d but she declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Gordon was interviewed about this incident by Detective Kenneth Klezia on January 14, 2010. Detective Klezia did not recall expressly asking Gordon for his date of birth, but upon request for identification, Gordon produced his Florida driver\u2019s license. Additionally, Detective Klezia had an earlier opportunity to observe Gordon\u2019s driver\u2019s license, when he visited Pacific Sun on an unrelated incident on January 9, 2010. Likewise, on that day, Gordon produced his Florida driver\u2019s license to Detective Klezia upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Gordon was charged with-and tried on the counts of third-degree sex offense and sexual solicitation of a minor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to satisfy the age element of the charge for the third-degree sex offense, the State had to prove that Gordon was \u201cat least 21 years old\u201d at the time of the offense. Md.Code (2002 &amp; 2010 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 3-307 of the Criminal Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">To satisfy that element, the State called Detective Klezia to the stand. He testified that he had \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of Gordon\u2019s age from Gordon\u2019s \u201cFlorida Driver\u2019s License.\u201d When Gordon objected to this evidence as hearsay, the State sought to justify the testimony under the adoptive admission by a party-opponent exception to the hearsay rule under Rule 5-803(a)(2). According to the State, by providing the driver\u2019s license to Detective Klezia, Gordon was \u201cmanifesting a belief that [the driver\u2019s license, prepared by the Florida Motor Vehicle Administration] is a true document,\u201d and that the date of birth stated on it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The Circuit Court for Charles County found this argument persuasive and overruled Gordon\u2019s objection, allowing Detective Klezia to continue to testify about Gordon\u2019s age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>conclusion of the trial, the jury convicted Gordon on both counts, and he was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, with all but one year suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Gordon appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed Gordon\u2019s convictions, holding \u201cthat Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony was admissible pursuant to the exception to the hearsay rule for adoptive admissions set forth in Md. Rule 5-803(a)(2).\u201d <em>Gordon v. State, </em>204 Md.App. 327, 344, 40 A.3d 1093, 1102 (2012). Gordon filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, together with the State\u2019s cross-petition. <em>Gordon v. State, </em>427 Md. 606, 50 A.3d 605 (2012). The parties present three questions for our review: one dealing with the adoptive admission exception and two questions concerning the public records exception to the hearsay rule. We do not reach the two questions concerning the public records exception<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because we resolve this case by answering the first question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">Whether, and if so, under what circumstances, an individual who presents a driver\u2019s license in response to a request for identification by a law enforcement officer manifests an adoption or belief in the truth of information contained in the license for purposes of the hearsay exception for adoptive admissions set forth at Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(2)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The only evidence of Gordon\u2019s age \u2014 a crucial element of his conviction of third-degree sex offense \u2014 was Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony that, according to Gordon\u2019s driver\u2019s license, he was twenty-seven years old at the time of the offense. The trial court admitted that testimony over Gordon\u2019s objections, finding that, when Gordon provided his license to the Detective, he \u201cmanifested an adoption or belief\u2019 in the truthfulness of the information listed there, including the date of birth. The parties ask us to decide whether Gordon did indeed manifest such an adoption or belief, making his age admissible under the admission of a party-opponent exception to the hearsay rule set forth in Rule 5-803(a)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Gordon and the State do not agree on the standard of review appropriate in this case. Gordon argues that we should review the trial court\u2019s entire ruling de novo, while the State advocates for an abuse of discretion standard for reviewing the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Gordon manifested an adoption or belief in the truth of the information listed on the driver\u2019s license. That the parties disagree is not surprising. Courts across the country have grappled with articulating the standard of review for hearsay rulings. Although the concept of hearsay evidence has been around for centuries,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> there is \u201ca split of authority among ... jurisdictions on how evidentiary rulings addressing admissibility under the hearsay rule and its exceptions are to be reviewed.\u201d <em>State v. Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 926 A.2d 633, 639 (2007).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There are also inconsistencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u25a0within jurisdictions. Just last year, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit observed with frustration that \u201cdecisions show one panel after another disagreeing with each other in published opinions discussing\u201d the standard of review for hearsay rulings. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>677 F.3d 753, 754 (6th Cir.2012) (Kethledge, J., dissenting). He urged his court \u201cto clean up our law on this issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In Maryland, the standard of review for hearsay rulings has undergone some evolution in the past decade. As we analyze our precedents below, we discern that a judge\u2019s hearsay ruling involving an adoptive admission has two components, and our standard of review differs as to each one.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Gordon and the State concur on two basic points. First, they agree that ordinarily a trial court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Hopkins v. State, </em>352 Md. 146, 158, 721 A.2d 231, 237 (1998). They also agree that \u201c[w]hether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 8, 887 A.2d 602, 606 (2005). Beyond these general propositions, the parties\u2019 views diverge.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Unhappy with the trial court\u2019s ruling, Gordon maintains that we should give the trial court\u2019s ruling no deference and review it de novo. In support of this assertion, he cites our seminal case, <em>Bernadyn, </em>in which we held that a medical bill seized by police at a crime scene and addressed to \u201cMichael Bernadyn\u201d at the same address, constituted hearsay, when used to prove that Bernadyn lived there. <em>Id. </em>at 3, 887 A.2d at 603. Judge Raker, writing for the Court, explained that \u2014 unless a hearsay exception applied \u2014 the trial court \u201chas no discretion to admit hearsay\u201d and explained that \u201c[w]hether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 8, 887 A.2d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The State does not attach the same significance to this statement in <em>Bemadyn </em>as does Gordon. It reads <em>Bemadyn </em>narrowly \u2014 as setting forth a de novo standard of review only for legal determinations of whether evidence is hearsay, but not for decisions about whether a hearsay exception applies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the State, \u201c[t]he evaluation of whether Gordon adopted the statement through his conduct ... is not a legal question, [rather it] involves a weighing of the evidence, which is reviewed under the more deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In support of this argument, the State cites <em>Brown v. The Daniel Realty Co., </em>409 Md. 565, 599 n. 26, 976 A.2d 300, 320 n. 26 (2009), in which we characterized a trial court\u2019s determination that certain \u201cdeposition testimony was the vicarious admission of Petitioner\u201d as a \u201cfactual determination,\u201d and a pre<em>Bemadyn </em>case in which we utilized the abuse of discretion standard of review, <em>Key-El v. State, </em>349 Md. 811, 813, 709 A.2d 1305, 1305 (1998), <em>overruled by Weitzel v. State, </em>384 Md. 451, 863 A.2d 999 (2004). The State also cites several federal cases. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pulido-Jacobo, </em>377 F.3d 1124, 1132 (10th Cir.2004) (\u201cOur review is even more deferential where the evidentiary ruling concerns the admissibility of what is claimed to be hearsay evidence.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The parties\u2019 divergent views about the standard of review likely stem from the nature of hearsay rulings. On the one hand, hearsay rulings are evidentiary rulings, which are typically subject to review for abuse of discretion. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Maryland\u2019s older cases almost always treated the admissibility of hearsay evidence as an issue left to \u201cthe discretion of the trial judge\u201d and spoke of reviewing hearsay rulings for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Jacobs v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 634, 653, 415 A.2d 590, 600 (1980) (\u201cWhen dealing with the rule against hearsay and its exceptions according to common law evidentiary principles, admissibility is a question addressed exclusively to the discretion of the trial judge.... \u201d); <em>Pratt v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 442, 456, 387 A.2d 779, 788 (1978) (\u201c[W]e are unable to say the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting the records.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>284 Md. 516, 398 A.2d 421 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">On the other hand, under the rules of evidence, hearsay rulings are not discretionary. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-802. (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by these rules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes, hearsay is not admissible.\u201d). Judge Raker clarified in <em>Bemadyn </em>that we would review a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions on hearsay evidence without deference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence ordinarily on an abuse of discretion standard. Review of the admissibility of evidence which is hearsay is different. Hearsay, under our rules, <em>must </em>be excluded as evidence at trial, unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule excluding such evidence or is \u201cpermitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes.\u201d Md. Rule 5-802. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Thus, a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. Whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo. </em>(Citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">390 Md. at 7-8, 887 A.2d at 606; <em>see also J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 71, 92, 792 A.2d 288, 300 (2002) (trial court\u2019s admission of hearsay \u201cenjoys no presumption of correctness on review and is not entitled to any deference\u201d) (alterations, citation, and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Since <em>Bemadyn, </em>we have reiterated time and again that determinations of hearsay admissibility are subject to review on the law. <em>See, e.g., Thomas v. State, </em>429 Md. 85, 97-98, 55 A.3d 10, 17 (2012); <em>Dulyx v. State, </em>425 Md. 273, 285, 40 A.3d 416, 426 (2012); <em>Parker v. State, </em>408 Md. 428, 436, 970 A.2d 320, 325 (2009); <em>Figgins v. Cochrane, </em>403 Md. 392, 419-20, 942 A.2d 736, 752 (2008); <em>Hall v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., </em>398 Md. 67, 82-83, 919 A.2d 1177, 1186 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">But not all aspects of a hearsay ruling need be purely legal. A hearsay ruling may involve several layers of analysis. Proponents of the evidence challenged on hearsay grounds usually argue (1) that the evidence at issue is not hearsay, and even if it is, (2) that it is nevertheless admissible. The first inquiry is legal in nature. <em>See Bernadyn, </em>390 Md. at 8, 887 A.2d at 606. But the second issue may require the trial court to make both factual and legal findings. For instance, in determining whether evidence is admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, codified in Rule 5-803(b)(2), the trial court looks into \u201cthe declarant\u2019s subjective state of mind\u201d to determine whether \u201cunder all the circumstances, [he is] still excited or upset to that degree.\u201d 6A Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Practice: Maryland Evidence State &amp; Federal </em>\u00a7 803(2):l(c) (2d ed.2001). It considers such factors, as, for example, how much time has passed since the event, whether the statement was spontaneous or prompted, and the nature of the statement, such as whether it was self-serving. <em>Id. </em>Such factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>determinations require deference from appellate courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">This is not the first case in which we have examined how the multi-dimensional nature of hearsay determinations plays out in terms of appellate review. In <em>State v. Walker, </em>decided before <em>Bernadyn, </em>the Court held that rulings on the residual exception to the hearsay rule were subject to de novo review as a matter of law. 345 Md. 293, 325, 691 A.2d 1341, 1356 (1997). In writing for the Court, Judge Wilner explained: \u201cSome of the subsidiary determinations made by a trial court in arriving at its findings and conclusions [about the residual exception] may well be purely factual or discretionary ones, and, as to them, we will continue to apply a clearly erroneous or abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Many of our sister states take a two-part approach in reviewing hearsay rulings as well. For instance, the Iowa courts \u201creview the admission of hearsay for errors at law, not for abuse of discretion[, but] give deference to the [trial] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>court\u2019s factual findings and uphold such findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>628 N.W.2d 440, 447 (Iowa 2001) (citation omitted). Likewise, the Nebraska courts \u201creview[ ] for clear error the factual findings underpinning a trial court\u2019s hearsay ruling and review[] de novo the court\u2019s ultimate determination to admit evidence over a hearsay objection.\u201d <em>State v. McCave, </em>282 Neb. 500, 805 N.W.2d 290, 316 (2011); <em>see also Brown v. United States, </em>27 A.3d 127, 130-31 (D.C.2011) (the de novo standard of review governs review of legal rulings on whether a hearsay statement falls within an exception, but \u201cthe underlying factual findings\u201d are subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard (citations omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 374, 184 L.Ed.2d 221 (2012); <em>Young v. Commonwealth, </em>50 S.W.3d 148, 167 (Ky.2001) (\u201c[W]hen the determination [of whether a hearsay exception applies] depends upon the resolution of a preliminary question of fact, the resolution is determined by the trial judge ... on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence, and the resolution will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous, i.e., unless unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Under this two-dimensional approach, the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination of whether particular evidence is hearsay or whether it is admissible under a hearsay exception is owed no deference on appeal, but the factual findings underpinning this legal conclusion necessitate a more deferential standard of review. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed de novo, <em>see Bernadyn, </em>390 Md. at 7-8, 887 A.2d at 606, but the trial court\u2019s factual findings will not be disturbed absent clear error, <em>see State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 430-31, 842 A.2d 716, 719 (2004) (and citations contained therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The sticky wicket in this case is deciding whether the trial court made a factual or legal conclusion in ruling that, in handing the officer his driver\u2019s license in response to a request for identification, Gordon made an adoptive admission. An examination of the evidentiary record is required. First though, a brief explanation of Rule 5-803(a)(2) is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The Admission by a Party-Opponent Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Rule 5-803 provides that a \u201c[statement by party-opponent\u201d is \u201cnot excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness,\u201d when the party-opponent \u201chas manifested an adoption or belief in [the] truth\u201d of that statement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This exception, known as an \u201cadoptive admission,\u201d can apply in multiple situations. For instance, in <em>Richardson v. Anderson, </em>the defendant\u2019s statement that the accounting report \u201cwas correct except as to two items contained therein\u201d made the report itself \u201cadmissible as an admission of the defendant.\u201d 109 Md. 641, 649, 72 A. 485, 488 (1909). In <em>Brandon v. Molesworth, </em>the defendant employer adopted the statement of an employee by nodding in agreement, when the employee acknowledged that the plaintiff was fired, in part, because she was a woman. 104 Md.App. 167, 196, 655 A.2d 1292, 1307 (1995), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>341 Md. 621, 672 A.2d 608 (1996); <em>see also Ewell v. State, </em>228 Md. 615, 619-21, 180 A.2d 857, 860-61 (1962) (defendant\u2019s failure to respond, under the circumstances, when companion said \u201cwe just yoked a man,\u201d was admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In many, if not most, circumstances, a trial court\u2019s decision about whether a person made an adoptive admission will be factual. This is certainly so when there are disputed facts about whether a question was asked, what was said, and what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>words or non-verbal conduct were involved in reply. For instance, in <em>Ewell v. State, </em>it was not clear who asked the co-defendants \u201cwhat they were doing\u201d or who replied \u201cwe just yoked a man.\u201d 228 Md. at 617, 180 A.2d at 859. Defendant Ewell testified \u201cthat no question had been asked and that neither he nor the codefendant had replied to a question.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id.; see also Brandon, </em>104 Md.App. at 177, 196, 655 A.2d at 1297, 1307 (the defendant disputed both the statement and his nod in agreement).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Even if there is no dispute about <em>what </em>was said or done, the decision of whether there was an adoptive admission may still be factual when the circumstances allow different inferences depending on the trial court\u2019s interpretation of those facts. In <em>Darvish v. Gohari, </em>the defendant was asked to confirm certain statements the plaintiff alleged were defamatory, but made no attempt to refute that he made the statements or that they were untrue. 130 Md.App. 265, 270, 745 A.2d 1134, 1136-37 (2000), <em>aff'd, </em>363 Md. 42, 767 A.2d 321 (2001).

State, </em>403 Md. 308, 326, 941 A.2d 1107, 1117 (2008) (speaking of \u201cunequivocally manifesting] an adoption of or belief in\u201d a statement of another). In this regard, argues Gordon, a manifestation is unambiguous only when \u201cthe surrounding circumstances, including the circumstances and nature of the underlying statement itself,\u201d demonstrate \u201can intent to adopt the statement.\u201d (Quoting <em>White Indus., Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>611 F.Supp. 1049, 1062 (W.D.Mo.1985)); <em>see also </em>2 Kenneth S. Broun, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 261, at 300-01 (7th ed. 2013) (\u201cThe circumstances surrounding the party\u2019s declaration must be examined to determine whether they indicated an approval of the statement.\u201d). According to Gordon, if the adoptive admission is by silence or conduct, a \u201clink\u201d between a request for information and an allegedly adoptive admission is essential.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">To illustrate his point, Gordon contrasts this case to <em>Brandon, </em>where the adopted statement \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s part of it\u201d \u2014 was made in response to a specific question of whether the plaintiff was fired for being a woman. 104 Md.App. at 176, 655 A.2d at 1297. Gordon points out that \u201cDetective Klezia acknowledged that he never asked Petitioner for his age.\u201d Rather, according to Gordon, \u201c[a] fair reading of the record indicates that [he] produced his driver\u2019s license\u201d either to confirm his identify or to enter police headquarters. He concludes that, because he did not produce his driver\u2019s license in response to a question about his age, \u201chis conduct [was] ambiguous\u201d and cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>considered a manifestation of the adoption or belief in the truth of the birth date listed on his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The State agrees with the general premise that the conduct needs to be unambiguous, but contends that this requirement is met so long as \u201cthe court determines that the jury can properly infer from the party\u2019s conduct an intent to adopt the statement or a belief in its truth.\u201d <em>See Ewell, </em>228 Md. at 620-21, 180 A.2d at 861 (\u201cWe think a jury of reasonable men could have found that it would have been natural for Ewell to reply under the circumstances, and, this being so, we cannot find error in the submission of the testimony complained of to the jury.\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Citing <em>White Industries, </em>the State argues that the scenario in this case can readily be considered an adoptive admission of \u201cthe truth of the information\u201d contained in that document. 611 F.Supp. at 1062 (\u201cThere is no doubt that where a party\u2019s use of a document supplied by another in fact represents the party\u2019s intended assertion of the truth of the information therein, an adoptive admission can be found.\u201d); <em>see also </em>4 John Henry Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1073(4) (James H. Chadbourn ed., rev. ed. 1972) (\u201cThe party\u2019s use of a document made by a third person will frequently amount to an approval of its statements as correct, and thus it may be received against him as an admission by adoption.\u201d (emphasis removed)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We agree with the State that when the trial court finds credible evidence that a person supplies a driver\u2019s license to a police officer when asked for identification, it does not err in admitting into evidence both the name and birth date on that license. The question of whether Gordon manifested an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>adoption or belief in the truth of the date of birth listed on the license was a preliminary question of fact to be resolved by the trial court before deciding whether to admit the statement into evidence. As Professor McLain has noted, most tacit admission cases \u201ctreat the preliminary facts ... as falling under the corollary to Md. Rule 5-104(b) [relevance conditioned on fact], rather than 5-104(a) [questions of admissibility generally]\u201d). <em>See </em>McLain, at \u00a7 801(4):3 n. 10 (quoting <em>Barber v. State, </em>191 Md. 555, 565, 62 A.2d 616, 620 (1948) (\u201cFailure to deny the charge, under some circumstances, may permit an inference of an admission of guilt. Although the ultimate question is for the jury, a preliminary question for the court is presented.\u201d); <em>see also Ewell, </em>228 Md. at 620, 180 A.2d at 860 (\u201cThe matter turns on whether the trial judge erred in the judgment he necessarily made in permitting the evidence to go to the jury \u2014 that under the circumstances it would have been natural for Ewell to make a reply if he had not agreed with the statement.\u201d); <em>State v. Carlson, </em>311 Or. 201, 808 P.2d 1002, 1006 (1991) (\u201cWhether a party intended to adopt, agree with or approve another person\u2019s statement is a preliminary question of fact to be determined by the trial judge under OEC 104.\u201d); McCormick, at \u00a7 262 (making the same observation as Professor McLain but with respect to the Federal Rules of Evidence).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has explained the interplay between the trial court\u2019s preliminary determination and the jury\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the adoption was unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>When deciding whether to admit an adopted statement\u2014 the judge must make a preliminary determination whether a jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant unambiguously adopted another person\u2019s incriminating statement. If the judge answers that question in the affirmative and admits the evidence, then the jury\u2019s function is to decide whether it <em>should </em>reach the conclusion which the judge has held that it <em>may </em>reach, namely that there was unambiguous assent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><em>Blackson v. United States, </em>979 A.2d 1, 7 (D.C.2009) (quoting <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>580 A.2d 1259, 1264 n. 8 (D.C.1990).) Thus, on appeal of an allegedly erroneous admission of evidence as an adoptive admission, the question is not whether the evidence before the judge clearly proved that the person against whom the statement was admitted unambiguously adopted the statement. Rather, the question is whether \u201cthere is sufficient evidence from which a jury <em>could </em>reasonably conclude that the defendant unambiguously adopted another person\u2019s incriminating statement.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 8 (citation and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>In this case, in ruling Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony admissible, the trial court was aware that Gordon presented his driver\u2019s license to the detective on two occasions, which were only several days apart. Even if Detective Klezia did not specifically ask Gordon about his age and only asked him for identification, a person\u2019s name and birth date undoubtedly are pieces of identifying information. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1977, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-301(a) &amp; (g) of the Transportation Article (requiring proof of age upon application for a state-issued identification card and listing the name and birth date as two of the identifying elements to be listed on the identification card). The trial court noted that Gordon never once disputed the date of birth listed on his license. This reflects the trial court\u2019s factual inference that the occasions on which the license was presented to Detective Klezia were circumstances in which Gordon could reasonably be expected to say something if his date of birth was not stated accurately on his license. We see no clear error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that, when Gordon presented his driver\u2019s license to Detective Klezia, it was as if he stated: \u201cMy name is Michael David Gordon, and I am twenty-seven years old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Thus, the record demonstrates that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that\u2014 by giving his driver\u2019s license to the detective, Gordon manifested an adoption or belief in the truth of the information listed on the license.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To be sure, the testimony includes only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>a limited discussion of the facts surrounding Gordon\u2019s action in handing his license to Detective Klezia. But, the sparsity of words used to describe the transaction likely reflects the simplicity of the interchange. The exchange is a customary and familiar one that takes few words to describe. In the absence of something to suggest that this is not a typical exchange, the factual inference the trial court made was reasonable. Once the court made the factual determination, the legal conclusion that Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony was admissible called for a straightforward application of Rule 5-803(a)(2). The evidence was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We are not dissuaded from this view by Gordon\u2019s emphasis on what he calls \u201ca systemic problem with persons obtaining and using fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses.\u201d Citing numerous secondary sources discussing an epidemic of fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses, especially among our youth, but also terrorists, and persons entering or remaining in this country illegally, Gordon contends that the information on a driver\u2019s license cannot and should not be trusted. In Gordon\u2019s view, \u201cthe fact that a person is required to carry a driver\u2019s license and present it upon an officer\u2019s demand does not nullify the real possibility that that person is carrying a fraudulent driver\u2019s license and has no intention of assenting to the truth of its content except in very particular circumstances, e.g., when attempting to purchase alcohol.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">We agree with the State that generally people carry driver\u2019s licenses and provide them to law enforcement upon request for one of two reasons: \u201cto prove one\u2019s authorization to drive a motor vehicle, and to prove one\u2019s identity.\u201d The mere fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>that liars and criminals use licenses for fraudulent purposes does not eradicate the usual and normal inference that when a person offers a driver\u2019s license to prove his identity he makes a representation that the information stated on the license is accurate. Even if a person offers a license that has been fraudulently altered as to the date of birth, that would be no reason to exempt the defrauder from operation of this hearsay exception. To do so would unduly limit the plain meaning of Rule 5-803(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The determination of whether a declarant manifested an adoption or belief in the truth of a statement of another so as to constitute an adoptive admission by the party-opponent under Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(2) is a preliminary factual determination to be made by the trial court. We see no clear error in the trial court\u2019s finding that \u2014 by providing his driver\u2019s license to the detective \u2014 Gordon manifested an adoption or belief in the truth of the information listed on the license, including his date of birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Because Gordon\u2019s conduct of providing the driver\u2019s license to the detective constituted an adoptive admission under Rule 5-803(a)(2), the trial court was legally correct in admitting into evidence the testimony of the detective as to his knowledge of Gordon\u2019s birth date, as listed on his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\">. Gordon was also charged with a second-degree assault, indecent exposure, and visual surveillance with prurient intent, but, for trial, these three counts were severed from the first two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-10\">. After issuing the ruling that the testimony was admissible under Rule 5~803(a)(2), the trial court also observed that \"it may be admissible ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>as a public record,\u201d or as \u201ca record of a vital statistic.\u201d At a later time, the trial court opined that Gordon\u2019s \u201cpassing the license to the police officer ... could be what's considered an applied assertion not hearsay.\u201d Finally, the court observed that, because \u201cthe age of the Defendant other than it's an element that has to be proven ... doesn\u2019t really seem to be something that's disputed.... [fit's almost to the point where the ... Court feels that \u2014 you could almost take judicial notice of Mr. Gordon's age.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">. Gordon posed the following question on the public records exception: Was Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony regarding the date of birth on Mr. Gordon's driver\u2019s license admissible under the public record hearsay exception set forth at Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 803(b)(8)?</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The State raised the following question in its cross-petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">Did Gordon waive his challenge to the admissibility of the testimony under the public records exception?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">. We do not need to discuss whether Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony regarding the date of birth on Gordon\u2019s driver's license was hearsay.

The Supreme Court of Connecticut grouped these approaches into three categories: \u201cA majority of courts review such trial court eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tiary rulings for an abuse of discretion; while others engage in de novo review; and still others engage in a 'hybrid' scope of review dependent on whether the hearsay rule or an exception to that rule is under consideration.\" <em>State v.

The State also attempts to distinguish <em>Bemadyn </em>from this case. It points out that, unlike <em>Bemadyn, </em>where the primary issue was whether evidence constituted hearsay, the question here \"is not whether the date of birth on Gordon\u2019s license was hearsay,\u201d but \"whether the State proved that he adopted the hearsay statement through his conduct, thus making the statement admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule in Rule 5-803(a).\u201d Although it is true that the main question in <em>Bemadyn </em>was whether the bill was hearsay, after concluding that it was, we went on to consider whether it was nevertheless admissible. Thus, the State\u2019s attempt to distinguish this case from <em>Bemadyn </em>is unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\">. Some states continue to apply the abuse of discretion standard of review today. <em>See, e.g., Pressey v. State, </em>25 A.3d 756, 760 (Del.2011). But, although many courts say they will review a trial court's hearsay ruling for abuse of discretion, they use \u201cthe traditional tripartite law-fact-discretion standard of review.\u201d Peter Nicolas, <em>De Novo Review in Deferential Robes?: A Deconstruction of the Standard of Review of Evidentiary Errors in the Federal System, </em>54 Syracuse L.Rev. 531, 535-37 (2004). For instance, the United States Court of Appeals for Tenth Circuit has explained: \"We review questions concerning the admission of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. Under that standard, we will not disturb an evidentiary ruling absent a distinct showing that it was based on a clearly erroneous finding of fact or an erroneous conclusion of law or manifests a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>United States v.

Admittedly, neither <em>Bemadyn </em>nor its progeny have made this distinction between legal and factual findings and the corresponding standards of review. That is because, however, in those cases, the trial courts did not reach the admissibility of hearsay evidence \u2014 halting the analysis with a conclusion that the evidence at issue was not hearsay\u2014 and therefore, there were no factual findings for <em>Bernadyn </em>and its progeny to review. <em>See, e.g., Thomas v. State, </em>429 Md. 85, 100-01, 55 A.3d 10, 19 (2012) (the trial court simply overruled objection on hearsay grounds and made no findings of fact); <em>Bernadyn v.

In another recent case, <em>Dulyx </em>v. <em>State, </em>we reviewed a trial court's legal ruling that a hearsay statement (testimony at a suppression hearing) was admissible under the \"former testimony\u201d exception to the hearsay rule under Rule 5-804(b)(l). 425 Md. 273, 275, 40 A.3d 416, 418 (2012).

The Court acknowledged that the statement \"we just yoked a man\u201d could have been made by either defendant or even an acquaintance, but \"assume[dj, as did the trial court in admitting the challenged testimony,\u201d that it was someone other than Ewell. The Court concluded that \"the jury reasonably could have found that Ewell heard and understood both the assertion that 'we just yoked a man\u2019 and that the pronoun \u2018we\u2019 included him, as well as that he remained silent although fully free to speak.\u201d <em>Ewell v.

The Court of Special Appeals upheld the admission of the statement: We cannot see how [the employee\u2019s] statement [that plaintiff was fired, in part, because she was a woman,] could fall outside this definition. Assuming the truth of Molesworth\u2019s allegations, Brandon\u2019s nod clearly constituted either a manifestation of adoption or a belief in the truth of Palmer\u2019s statement.

This Court affirmed: \"Brandon\u2019s nod was admissible hearsay under Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(2) because it 'manifested an adoption\u2019 of Palmer\u2019s statement. Thus, the nod was a communication by Brandon that part of the reason he fired Molesworth was because she is a woman.\u201d <em>Molesworth v.

The trial court also found other hearsay exceptions applicable, as we indicated above in footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b573-23\">. After the trial court overruled Gordon\u2019s objection, the examination continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-24\">[MR.

In support of this position, Gordon quotes <em>Grier v. State, </em>in which we stated, with respect to admission of silence as evidence of guilt, that \"[e]vidence of a person\u2019s silence\u201d may be admissible \"if it amounts to a tacit admission, that is, if it is in response to an assertion which the party would, under all circumstances, naturally be expected to deny.\u201d 351 Md. 241, 252, 718 A.2d 211, 217 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">. The State also cites <em>Briggeman v. Albert, </em>where we held that payment of a traffic citation does not support an inference of guilt under an adoptive admission theory because \"people who believe themselves innocent often pay preset fines for the sake of convenience or expediency.\u201d 322 Md. 133, 138, 586 A.2d 15, 17 (1991); <em>see also United States v. Barletta, </em>652 F.2d 218, 219 (1st Cir.1981) (a trial court should determine the admissibility of an adoptive admission by asking \"whether a reasonable jury could properly find the ultimate fact in favor of the proponent of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">. Under Rule 5-104(b), \"When the relevance of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding by the trier of fact that the condition has been fulfilled.\u201d For instance, in the context of admission by silence, before admitting a statement \"against the silent party,\u201d the trial court must make the following preliminary findings: \"(1) that the statement was actually made; (2) that the reaction of silence or evasion took place as claimed; (3) that the party heard and understood the statement; and (4) that under all the circumstances the party\u2019s conduct makes it probable that he believed the statement to be true.\u201d <em>Ewell, </em>228 Md. at 618-19, 180 A.2d at 859-60 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">. In his Reply Brief, Gordon disagrees with the premise that the trial court only makes a preliminary finding but that the ultimate determination of whether the person manifested an adoption or belief in the truth of the statement of another is for the jury to make. He posits that it is not \"as if a court could at once find adoptive conduct to be unambiguous while containing an element of ambiguity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">We are not persuaded by this argument. Courts make similar preliminary findings in other contexts as well. For example, courts make the preliminary determination of whether a confession was voluntary (making it admissible), but the ultimate decision-maker on this issue is the jury. <em>Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 605, 655 A.2d 370, 382 (1995). If we were to follow Gordon\u2019s logic, so long as there was a possibility that the jury would find a confession involuntary, trial courts could never find confessions voluntary, rendering them inadmissible. That clearly is not the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. In <em>Blackson v. United States, </em>in finding an adoptive admission, the trial court considered the circumstances surrounding the statement and concluded that the defendant was \" 'in a position where you would expect that if tilings didn't occur the way they were describing them he would have said something.' \u201d 979 A.2d 1, 7 (D.C.2009). The defendant argued on appeal that \" 'the evidence at trial was insufficient as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>matter of law to clearly prove that [he] heard, understood, and unambiguously assented to all of the statements with his silence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia noted that Blackson \"misapprehends the law\u201d and explained that for the statement to be admissible, it was not necessary that the evidence \" 'clearly proved that Blaskson heard, understood, and unambiguously assented to all of the statements with his silence\u2019 in order to be admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and citations omitted). So long as there was sufficient evidence for the jury to make that inference, the statement was properly admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">. The jury, of course, was free to reach a different conclusion. Even Gordon acknowledges that \"[t]he jury was free to disbelieve Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony that Petitioner presented the driver\u2019s license to him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>or to doubt whether Detective Klezia read the date-of-birth information correctly, or to doubt that the information on the license was accurate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\">. He suggests, \u201c[h]ad Detective Klezia instead been a liquor store cashier, Petitioner's production of his driver\u2019s license for the purpose of obtaining liquor might be sufficient for purposes of the adoptive admission exception.\u201d Without \u201cthat type of specific communication,\u201d there was no manifestation of adoption or belief in the date of birth listed on the license.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
