In particular, the income of a Subchapter S corporation is deemed to \u201cpass through\u201d to the shareholders who are then directly taxed on that income. Some or all of that income may be generated outside the state in which a shareholder resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The Maryland income tax law reaches all of the income of a Maryland resident. The State income tax law allows a credit against an individual\u2019s State tax liability for income taxes paid to other states based on the income earned in those states. However, that credit takes no account of, and cannot be taken against, the portion of the Maryland income tax known as the \u201ccounty income tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">This case poses the question whether the failure to allow a credit violates the federal Constitution when a portion of a Maryland resident taxpayer\u2019s income consists of significant \u201cpass-through\u201d income generated by a Subchapter S corporation in other states, apportioned to the taxpayer, and taxed by the states in which it was generated. The taxpayer has appealed an assessment by the State Comptroller that did not allow a credit against the county income tax portion of the Maryland income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The Comptroller, as he should,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defends the tax law as written by the Legislature<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and interpreted by this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The taxpayers accept that interpretation, but assert that it is wanting when measured against the federal Constitution. They rely on a multitude of cases \u2014 virtually all of which are subsequent to the 1975 amendment of the Maryland tax law that uncoupled the credit from the county income tax \u2014 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>assess state taxes against what has come to be known as the \u201cdormant Commerce Clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Although the Maryland Tax Court ruled in favor of the Comptroller, the Circuit Court for Howard County reversed that decision and held that the statute\u2019s failure to allow such a credit violated the dormant Commerce Clause. For the reasons that follow, we find merit in the taxpayers\u2019 contentions and affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\n<em>State Income Taxes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">A state may tax the income of its residents, regardless of where that income is earned. A state may also tax a nonresident on income earned within the state. Both of these propositions are consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v. Chickasaw Nation, </em>515 U.S. 450, 462-63 &amp; n. 11, 115 S.Ct. 2214, 132 L.Ed.2d 400 (1995); <em>New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, </em>300 U.S. 308, 312-13, 57 S.Ct. 466, 81 L.Ed. 666 (1937). However, they raise the possibility of what might be termed \u201cdouble taxation\u201d when both the state of the taxpayer\u2019s residence and the state where the income was generated tax the same income. As explained below, the Commerce Clause of the federal Constitution sets certain constraints on this possibility, which the states recognize through the provision of credits for payments of out-of-state taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\n<em>Maryland Individual Income Tax</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">State law imposes an income tax on individuals. Maryland Code, Tax-General Article (\u201cTG\u201d) \u00a7 10-101 <em>et </em>see/.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is composed of three parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">(1) a State income tax (the \u201cState tax\u201d) at a rate set by the Legislature in statute, <em>see </em>TG \u00a7 10-105;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>(2) a county income tax that applies only to residents of each county<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (the \u201ccounty tax\u201d) at a rate set by the county within the range allowed by statute, <em>see </em>TG \u00a7\u00a7 10-103, 10-106; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">(3) a tax on those subject to State income tax but not the county tax (the \u201cSpecial Non-Resident Tax\u201d or \u201cSNRT\u201d) at a rate equal to the lowest county tax, <em>see </em>TG \u00a7 10-106.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Thus, all individual taxpayers are subject to the State tax and either the county tax or the SNRT. These taxes are all collected by the Comptroller; the proceeds of the county tax are distributed to the relevant county.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>Credit for Income Taxes Paid to Other States</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">[3] State law allows for an individual subject to the Maryland income tax to take a credit against the State tax for similar taxes paid to other states.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In particular:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">a resident may claim a credit only against the State income tax for a taxable year in the amount determined under [TG \u00a7 10-703(c) ] for State tax on income paid to another state for the year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">TG \u00a7 10-703(a). There are various exceptions to this credit, none of which are pertinent to this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In general, the credit is designed to ensure that Maryland receives, at a minimum, the Maryland income tax due on the taxpayer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>income that is attributable to Maryland, regardless of the another state\u2019s method or rate of taxation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Comptroller v. Hickey, </em>114 Md.App. 388, 391, 689 A.2d 1316 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">No credit is given against the county tax for income taxes paid in other states. TG \u00a7 10-703(a); <em>Comptroller v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 890 A.2d 279 (2006). As this Court outlined in <em>Blanton, </em>a credit had previously applied with respect to the county tax. <em>See Stern v. Comptroller, </em>271 Md. 310, 316 A.2d 240 (1974). However, in 1975, the Legislature amended the tax code to eliminate that credit. Chapter 3, Laws of Maryland 1975.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>S Corporations and Income Taxes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">A Subchapter S corporation or \u201cS corporation\u201d is a corporation \u2014 often a relatively small business \u2014 that meets certain requirements set forth in the Internal Revenue Code and makes an election to pass through its income and losses, for federal tax purposes, to its shareholders.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Each shareholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>reports his or her share of the S corporation\u2019s income and losses on their individual tax returns and is assessed federal income tax at the shareholder\u2019s individual rate. In that way, the income that the S corporation generates for its owners is taxed at one level \u2014 similar to the taxation of a partnership\u2014 rather than at two levels (corporate and shareholder) as is otherwise typically the case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To accomplish this, the character of any item of income or loss of an S corporation \u201cpasses through\u201d to its owners \u201cas if that item were realized directly from the source from which realized by the corporation, or incurred in the same manner as incurred by the corporation.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1366(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Some states accord similar pass-through treatment to the income of an S corporation; other states do not and require an S corporation to pay income tax directly. The Maryland income tax law incorporates, for the most part, the definitions of income under the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See </em>TG \u00a7\u00a7 10-101(\u00a3), 10-107, 10-201 <em>et seq. </em>Accordingly, the income of an S corporation \u201cpasses through\u201d and is attributed to its shareholders for purposes of the Maryland income tax law. <em>See </em>TG \u00a7 10-104(6); <em>see also </em>TG \u00a7\u00a7 10-102.1,10-304(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\n<em>The Wynnes and Maxim Healthcare Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The underlying facts are undisputed. The taxpayers are Brian and Karen Wynne (\u201cthe Wynnes\u201d), a married couple with five children residing in Howard County. During the 2006 tax year, Brian Wynne was one of seven owners of Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc. (\u201cMaxim\u201d), a company that does a national business providing health care services, and owned 2.4% of its stock. Maxim had made an election under the Internal Revenue Code to be treated as an S corporation. As a result of that election, Maxim\u2019s income was \u201cpassed through\u201d to its owners for federal income tax purposes, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the Wynnes reported a portion of the corporation\u2019s income on their individual federal income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Because Maryland accords similar pass-through treatment to the income of S corporations, the Wynnes also reported pass-through income of Maxim on their 2006 Maryland tax return. A substantial portion of the pass-through income had been generated in other states and was taxed by those states for the 2006 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In particular, for the 2006 tax year, Maxim filed state income tax returns in 39 states. Maxim allocated to each shareholder a pro rata share of taxes paid to the various states. The returns did not indicate payments of income taxes to any county or local entity in other states. The Wynnes claimed their pro rata share of such income taxes paid to other states as a credit pursuant to TG \u00a7 10-703(c) against their 2006 Maryland individual income tax, reflected on Maryland Form 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\n<em>Assessment and Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The Comptroller made a change in the computation of the local tax owed by the Wynnes and revised the credit for taxes paid to other states on the Wynnes\u2019 2006 Maryland Form 502. The net result was a deficiency in the Maryland taxes paid by the Wynnes, and the Comptroller issued an assessment, which the Wynnes appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">On October 6, 2008, the Hearings and Appeals Section of the Comptroller\u2019s Office affirmed the assessment, although it revised it slightly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Wynnes then appealed to the Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>land Tax Court where they argued, for the first time, that the limitation of the credit to the State tax for tax payments made to other states discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The Tax Court rejected that argument and affirmed the assessment on December 29, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The Wynnes then sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Howard County. Following a hearing on the appeal, the Circuit Court reversed the Tax Court in a decision issued on June 29, 2011. The Circuit Court remanded the case to the Tax Court for further factual development and \u201can appropriate credit for out-of-state income taxes paid\u201d on Maxim\u2019s income. An appeal was noted to the Court of Special Appeals on July 22, 2011. Prior to hearing and decision in the intermediate appellate court, this Court granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The Tax Court is \u201can adjudicatory administrative agency in the executive branch of state government.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A decision of the Tax Court is subject to the same standards of judicial review as contested cases of other administrative agencies under the State Administrative Procedure Act. TG \u00a7 13-532(a)(1). In undertaking such review, this Court directly evaluates the decision of the agency<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 in this case, the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">When the Tax Court interprets Maryland tax law, we accord that agency a degree of deference as the agency that administers and interprets those statutes. <em>Comptroller v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. at 533-35, 890 A.2d 279. In this case, the Tax Court\u2019s decision required the application and analysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>cases interpreting the United States Constitution. Because our review of its analysis turns on a question of constitutional law, we do not defer to the agency\u2019s determination. <em>Frey v. Comptroller, </em>422 Md. 111, 138, 29 A.3d 475 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\n<em>The Dormant Commerce Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The Wynnes do not contest the State\u2019s authority to tax their income, wherever earned, under the Due Process Clause. Rather, they base their challenge to the Comptroller\u2019s assessment on what has come to be known as the \u201cdormant Commerce Clause\u201d of the United States Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, </em>504 U.S. 298, 313 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 1904, 119 L.Ed.2d 91 (1992) (\u201c[a] tax may be consistent with due process and yet unduly burden interstate commerce\u201d). The dormant Commerce Clause is a restriction on State power that is not explicitly articulated in the Constitution but that has been derived as a necessary corollary of a power specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The Commerce Clause provides Congress with the power to \u201cregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\u201d United States Constitution, Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. \u201cThough phrased as a grant of regulatory power to Congress, the [Commerce] Clause has long been understood to have a \u2018negative\u2019 aspect that denies the States the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce.\u201d <em>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality, </em>511 U.S. 93, 98, 114 S.Ct. 1345, 128 L.Ed.2d 13 (1994). This negative aspect of the Commerce Clause is an \u201cimplied limitation on the power of state and local governments to enact laws affecting foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Board of Trustees v. City of Baltimore, </em>317 Md. 72, 131, 562 A.2d 720, 749 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We assess first whether the dormant Commerce Clause is implicated by the county tax and, if so, whether the failure to provide a credit for out-of-state taxes violates the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\n<em>Does the Application of the County Tax without a Credit Implicate the Dormant Commerce Clause?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Although each of the three components of the State income tax has its own label and is created by different code provisions, each is for federal constitutional purposes a state income tax. <em>Frey, </em>422 Md. at 141-42, 29 A.3d 475. In any event, whether the tax is nominally a state or county tax is irrelevant for purposes of analysis under the dormant Commerce Clause because a state may not unreasonably burden interstate commerce through its subdivisions any more than it may at the state level. <em>Associated Industries v. Lohman, </em>511 U.S. 641, 650-51, 114 S.Ct. 1815, 128 L.Ed.2d 639 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Much recent case law concerning the dormant Commerce Clause has been \u201cdriven by concern about economic protectionism \u2014 that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. Davis, </em>553 U.S. 328, 337-38, 128 S.Ct. 1801, 170 L.Ed.2d 685 (2008) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). While many cases construing the dormant Commerce Clause concern state taxation, \u201c[t]he dormant Commerce Clause protects markets and participants in markets, not taxpayers as such.\u201d <em>General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, </em>519 U.S. 278, 300, 117 S.Ct. 811, 136 L.Ed.2d 761 (1997). Therefore, the dormant Commerce Clause will not affect the application of a tax unless there is actual or prospective competition between entities in an identifiable market and state action that either expressly discriminates against or places an undue burden on interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>This impact must be more than incidental. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 559, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The Comptroller argues that the county income tax is not directed at interstate commerce and that the Wynnes have failed to identify any interstate commercial activity affected by a failure to allow a credit against that tax for tax payments to other states. However, application of the dormant Commerce Clause is not limited to circumstances where physical goods enter the stream of commerce. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>example, a state tax exemption related to the movement of people across state borders for economic purposes has been held to implicate interstate commerce and violate the dormant Commerce Clause. <em>Camps Newfound,/Owatonna v. Town of Harrison, </em>520 U.S. 564, 574, 117 S.Ct. 1590, 137 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997); <em>see also Edwards v. California, </em>314 U.S. 160, 172, 62 S.Ct. 164, 86 L.Ed. 119 (1941) (state statute prohibiting transport of indigent persons into the state unconstitutional under Commerce Clause). Moreover, even when a state tax is imposed on an intrastate activity, if that tax substantially affects interstate commerce, the tax is subject to scrutiny under the Commerce Clause. <em>See, e.g., Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>429 U.S. 318, 332, 97 S.Ct. 599, 50 L.Ed.2d 514 (1977) (state securities transfer tax unconstitutional under dormant Commerce Clause to the extent it taxed in-state stock transfers resulting from out-of-state sales at a greater rate than in-state transfers resulting from in-state sales).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The Comptroller asserts that the Wynnes are subject to Maryland income taxes because of their status as Maryland residents and not because of their activities in intrastate or interstate commerce. But this is a false dichotomy. In fact, they are subject to the income tax because they are Maryland residents <em>and </em>because they have income derived from intrastate and interstate activities; other states may also tax some of that same income because it derives from activities in those state. This case concerns the constitutional constraint on the otherwise overlapping power to tax such income.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In making his argument based on a state\u2019s power to tax its own residents, the Comptroller relies on several cases from other states that fail to distinguish the constraints on state taxation imposed by the dormant Commerce Clause from those imposed by the Due Process Clause or that are otherwise distinguishable from the case. Those cases are not persuasive.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The limitation of the credit for payments of out-of-state income taxes to the State portion of the Maryland income tax can result in significantly different treatment for a Maryland resident taxpayer who earns substantial income from out-of-state activities when compared with an otherwise identical taxpayer who earns income entirely from Maryland activities. In particular, the first taxpayer may pay more in total state and local income taxes than the second. This creates a disincentive for the taxpayer \u2014 or the S corporation of which the taxpayer is an owner \u2014 to conduct income-generating activities in other states with income taxes. Thus, the operation of the credit with respect to the county tax may affect the interstate market for capital and business investment and, accordingly, implicate the dormant Commerce Clause. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>e.g., Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, </em>516 U.S. 325, 116 S.Ct. 848, 133 L.Ed.2d 796 (1996) (North Carolina property tax on intangibles that taxed investments in out-of-state businesses at a higher rate violated the Commerce Clause); <em>Boston Stock Exchange, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\n<em>Does Application of the County Tax without a Credit Violate the Dormant Commerce Clause ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The Supreme Court has held that a state may tax interstate commerce without offending the dormant Commerce Clause so long as the tax satisfies a four-prong test. Under that test, a state tax survives a challenge under the dormant Commerce Clause if it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">(1) applies to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">(2) is fairly apportioned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">(3) is not discriminatory towards interstate or foreign commerce; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">(4) is fairly related to the services provided by the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH\"><em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274, 279, 97 S.Ct. 1076, 51 L.Ed.2d 326 (1977); <em>see also D.H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, </em>486 U.S. 24, 30-31, 108 S.Ct. 1619, 100 L.Ed.2d 21 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">The Wynnes apparently do not dispute that the application of the county tax in this case has a substantial nexus to Maryland or that it is fairly related to services provided by the State. Thus, for purposes of the present controversy, we focus on the remaining two prongs of the <em>Complete Auto </em>test: the requirement of fair apportionment and the prohibition against discrimination against interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">\n<em>(1) Is the county tax without a credit fairly apportioned?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">The purpose of the apportionment requirement is to ensure that each state taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction. <em>Goldberg v. Sweet, </em>488 U.S. 252, 261, 109 S.Ct. 582, 102 L.Ed.2d 607 (1989). \u201cIt is a commonplace of constitutional jurisprudence that multiple taxation may well be offen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>sive to the Commerce Clause. In order to prevent multiple taxation of interstate commerce, the Court has required that taxes be apportioned among taxing jurisdictions, so that no instrumentality of commerce is subjected to more than one tax on its full value.\u201d <em>Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, </em>441 U.S. 434, 446-47, 99 S.Ct. 1813, 60 L.Ed.2d 336 (1979). \u201cThe rule which permits taxation by two or more states on an apportionment basis precludes taxation of all of the property by the state of the domicile---- Otherwise there would be multiple taxation of interstate operations.\u201d <em>Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, </em>342 U.S. 382, 384-85, 72 S.Ct. 309, 96 L.Ed. 427 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The dormant Commerce Clause does not mandate the adoption of a particular income allocation formula for apportionment. <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, </em>437 U.S. 267, 274, 98 S.Ct. 2340, 57 L.Ed.2d 197 (1978) (states have \u201cwide latitude\u201d in the selection of an apportionment formula which will only be disturbed upon \u201cclear and cogent evidence\u201d that it leads to a \u201cgrossly distorted result\u201d). In order to assess the fairness of apportionment courts look to whether a tax is \u201cinternally consistent\u201d as well as \u201cexternally consistent.\u201d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v. Jefferson Lines, </em>514 U.S. 175, 185, 115 S.Ct. 1331, 131 L.Ed.2d 261 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\n<em>(a) Is the county tax without a credit internally consistent?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u201cInternal consistency is preserved when the imposition of a tax identical to the one in question by every other State would add no burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear. This test asks nothing about the degree of economic reality reflected by the tax, but simply looks to the structure of the tax at issue to see whether its identical application by every state in the Union would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate.\u201d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v. Jefferson Lines, </em>514 U.S. at 185, 115 S.Ct. 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Internal consistency is thus measured by the answer to the following hypothetical question: If each state imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>county tax without a credit in the context of a tax scheme identical to that of Maryland,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> would interstate commerce be disadvantaged compared to intrastate commerce?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The answer is yes. In this scenario, TG \u00a7 10-703 (or its hypothetical equivalent in other states) would grant a credit against a taxpayer\u2019s home state income tax but not against the home county income tax for income taxes paid to other states. As a result, taxpayers who earn income from activities undertaken outside of their home states would be systematically taxed at higher rates relative to taxpayers who earn income entirely within their home state. Those higher rates would be the result of multiple states taxing the same income.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">This is illustrated by the following example.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">\u2022 <em>Tax rates. </em>Assume each state imposes a state tax of 4.75% on all the income of its residents, a county tax of 3.2% on all the income of residents, and a SNRT of 1.25% on the income of non-residents earned within the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">\u2022 <em>Credit. </em>Assume that each state allows a credit for income taxes paid to other states that operates in the same fashion as TG \u00a7 <em>10-703 </em>\u2014 i. e., the formula for the credit and application of the credit take only the home state \u201cstate tax\u201d into account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">\u2022 <em>Taxpayer with in-state income only. </em>Mary lives in Maryland and earns $100,000, entirely from activities in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">Mary owes $4,750 in Maryland state income tax (.0475 x $100,000), $3,200 in Maryland county income tax (.032 x $100,000) for a total Maryland tax of $7,950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">\u2022 <em>Taxpayer with multi-state income. </em>John lives in Maryland and earns $100,000, half ($50,000) from activities in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Maryland and half ($50,000) from activities in Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">Because John is a resident of Maryland, all of his income is subject to both the Maryland \u201cstate tax\u201d and the \u201ccounty tax\u201d applicable to his county. Before the application of any credit, John owes $4,750 in Maryland state income tax (.0475 x $100,000), $3,200 in Maryland county income tax (.032 x $100,000) for a total Maryland tax of $7,950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">Because half of John\u2019s income was generated in Pennsylvania, John also owes $2,375 in Pennsylvania state income tax (.0475 x $50,000) and $625 with respect to the Pennsylvania SNRT (.0125 x $50,000) for a total Pennsylvania tax of $3,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">John receives a credit in the amount of $2,375 with respect to his Maryland state income tax pursuant to credit formula set forth in TG \u00a7 10-703(c).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This reduces his Maryland income tax to $5,575.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Thus, John owes a combined total of $8,575 in state income taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">As the above example demonstrates, a taxpayer with income sourced in more than one state will consistently owe more in combined state income taxes than a taxpayer with the same income sourced in just the taxpayer\u2019s home state. This may discourage Maryland residents from engaging in income-earning activity that touches other states. In the context of S corporations, it may encourage Maryland residents to invest in purely local businesses, and discourage businesses from seeking to operate both in Maryland and in other states. In effect, it acts as an extra tax on interstate income-earning activities. It fails the internal consistency test.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">While it is true that a failure to pass the internal consistency test does not always signal a constitutional defect in a state tax scheme, the circumstances under which the courts have tolerated a lack of internal consistency do not pertain here. One such case concerned a flat $100 annual fee imposed by Michigan upon trucks engaged in intrastate commercial hauling. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>545 U.S. 429, 125 S.Ct. 2419, 162 L.Ed.2d 407 (2005). The petitioners in that case challenged the fee on the ground that it discriminated against interstate carriers and unconstitutionally burdened interstate trade because the fee was flat but trucks carrying both interstate and intrastate loads engaged in less intrastate business than trucks carrying only intrastate loads. 545 U.S. at 431-32, 125 S.Ct. 2419. The Supreme Court held that the fee did not violate the dormant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Commerce Clause. In analyzing the internal consistency of the tax, the Court concluded that, if every state imposed such a fee, an interstate trucker doing local business in multiple states would have to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in fees if it supplemented its interstate business by carrying local loads in many other states, thus an internal inconsistency. The Court nonetheless found no Commerce Clause violation because a business would have to incur such fees only because it engaged in local business in all those states. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 125 S.Ct. 2419. \u201cAn interstate firm with local outlets normally expects to pay local fees that are uniformly assessed upon all those who engage in local business, interstate and domestic firms alike.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such a fee, in effect a toll on in-state activity, is factually distinguishable from the present case involving business performed and income earned outside of Maryland. Moreover, we are not aware of an instance in which a court has upheld an unapportioned <em>income </em>tax on the authority of <em>American Trucking.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The Comptroller advances an alternative argument. Because an individual can only be a resident of one county in the universe,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> even if every taxing jurisdiction adopted Maryland\u2019s tax structure, the individual would only be required to pay a county tax once. This, argues the Comptroller, precludes the possibility of multiple taxation by operation of the county tax. However, this analysis appears to be inconsistent with the logic underlying this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Frey </em>that the Maryland SNRT is a state tax for constitutional purposes. 422 Md. at 142, 29 A.3d 475. Moreover, under dormant Commerce Clause analysis, there are generally only two levels of regulation, state and federal. <em>See Associated Indus. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>Lohman, </em>511 U.S. 641, 650-51, 114 S.Ct. 1815, 128 L.Ed.2d 639 (1994). The Comptroller\u2019s analysis posits a third level, the local level, such that a local tax need only be considered in the light of local taxes in other jurisdictions. But there appears to be no authority in the case law for this position.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\n<em>(b) Is the county tax without a credit externally consistent?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"> The next question is whether the current county tax scheme is externally consistent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For this test, one must assess \u201cwhether the State has taxed only that portion of the revenues from the interstate activity which reasonably reflects the in-state component of the activity being taxed.\u201d <em>Goldberg v. Sweet, </em>488 U.S. 252, 262, 109 S.Ct. 582, 102 L.Ed.2d 607 (1989). This test looks to a state\u2019s \u201ceconomic justification\u201d for its claim on the value taxed \u201cto discover whether a state\u2019s tax reaches beyond that portion of value that is fairly attributable to economic activity within the taxing state.\u201d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., </em>514 U.S. 175, 185, 115 S.Ct. 1331, 131 L.Ed.2d 261 (1995). \u201c[T]he threat of real multiple taxation (though not by literally identical statutes) may indicate a state\u2019s impermissible overreaching.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Thus, to test for external consistency one asks: Does tax liability under the Maryland income tax code reasonably reflect how income is generated? Because no credit is given with respect to the county tax for income earned out-of-state, the Maryland tax code does not apportion income subject to that tax even when that income is derived entirely from out-of-state sources. Thus, when income sourced to out-of-state activities is subject to the county tax, there is a potential for multiple taxation of the same income. In those circumstances, the operation of the county tax appears to create external inconsistency.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This is further indication that the application of the tax in these circumstances without application of an appropriate credit violates the dormant Commerce Clause.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\n<em>(2) Does the County Tax Discriminate against Interstate Commerce?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Under the third prong of the <em>Complete Auto </em>test, a tax must not discriminate against interstate commerce. Even if a tax is fairly apportioned, it \u201cmay violate the Commerce Clause if it is facially discriminatory, has a discriminatory intent, or has the effect of unduly burdening interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Amerada Hess Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>490 U.S. 66, 75, 109 S.Ct. 1617, 104 L.Ed.2d 58 (1989). A state tax may not discriminate against a transaction because the transaction has an interstate element or because the transaction or incident crosses state lines. <em>Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, </em>467 U.S. 638, 642, 104 S.Ct. 2620, 81 L.Ed.2d 540 (1984). A taxing scheme that encourages interstate businesses to conduct more of their business activities within the taxing state may be found to be discriminatory. <em>Amerada Hess Corp., </em>490 U.S. at 77-78, 109 S.Ct. 1617. Facially discriminatory state taxes are subject to the strictest scrutiny, and the \u201cburden of justification is so heavy that \u2018facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc., </em>511 U.S. at 101, 114 S.Ct. 1345 (quoting <em>Hughes v. Oklahoma, </em>441 U.S. 322, 337, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979)). There is no <em>\u201cde minimis </em>\u201d justification if a tax is found to actually discriminate against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>interstate commerce. <em>Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, </em>516 U.S. 325, 332 n. 3, 116 S.Ct. 848, 133 L.Ed.2d 796 (1996). Discriminatory effect may lie in the tax itself, but it may also arise from interactions with other states\u2019 taxes. <em>See, e.g., Barringer v. Griffes, </em>1 F.3d 1331, 1337-39 (2d Cir.1993) (state use tax on automobiles that provided credit for sales tax paid in-state, but not out-of-state was discriminatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Particularly pertinent to the present case is the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of a North Carolina tax in <em>Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, supra. </em>North Carolina imposed an \u201cintangibles tax\u201d on the value of corporate stock owned by North Carolina residents. The tax was computed as a fraction of the value of the stock, with the tax rate reduced to the extent that the corporation\u2019s income was subject to tax in North Carolina. 516 U.S. at 327-28, 116 S.Ct. 848. This resulted in a North Carolina stockholder being taxed at a higher rate for holdings in companies that did not do business in North Carolina and at lower rates for holdings in companies that did business in North Carolina. The Supreme Court held that the tax violated the dormant Commerce Clause because it discriminated against interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 333, 344, 116 S.Ct. 848.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In striking down the tax, the Court stated: \u201c[A] regime that taxes stock only to the degree that its issuing corporation participates in interstate commerce favors domestic corporations over their foreign competitors in raising capital among North Carolina residents....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 116 S.Ct. 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">This case presents a similar situation. The application of the county tax to the out-of-state pass-through income without application of a credit for out-of-state income taxes on the same income means that Maryland shareholders \u2014 the Wynnes in this case \u2014 may be taxed at a higher rate on income earned through Maxim\u2019s out-of-state activities than on income earned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>though its Maryland activities. This would appear to favor businesses that do business primarily in Maryland over their competitors who do business primarily out-of-state \u2014 at least in the context of ownership of a Subchapter S corporation. The only difference between <em>Fulton </em>and the present case is one of form. Whereas in <em>Fulton </em>it was North Carolina\u2019s own tax rate that varied, in the present case it is the imposition of an additional tax, the tax set by the state where the income was earned \u2014 and the failure to provide a credit for it in Maryland \u2014 that creates the discrimination. Nonetheless, the effect is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">While the failure to allow a credit is at the heart of the discrimination in this case, not every denial of a deduction or credit for taxes paid to another jurisdiction results in a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. In <em>Amerada Hess v. New Jersey Dept. of the Treasury, </em>the Supreme Court evaluated the constitutionality of a New Jersey statute that denied to oil-producing companies a deduction for amounts paid under the federal -windfall profits tax. Holding that the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause, the Court noted, \u201ca deduction denial does not unduly burden interstate commerce just because the deduction denied relates to an economic activity performed outside the taxing State.\u201d 490 U.S. at 78 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1617.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><em>Amerada Hess </em>is distinguishable from the present case however. At issue in <em>Amerada Hess </em>was a state deduction for a federal income tax \u2014 a tax that a business would be subject to no matter where it was located in the United States, whether within New Jersey or elsewhere. By denying a tax credit in that case, New Jersey treated all similarly-situated taxpayers equally because a business was subject to the same rate regardless of whether the windfall profits were earned within New Jersey or elsewhere. By contrast, the failure to provide a credit against the county tax in this case penalizes investment in a Maryland entity that earns income out-of-state: an investment in such a venture incurs both out-of-state taxes and the Maryland county tax on the same income; a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>similar venture that does all its business in Maryland incurs only the county tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The tax at issue in this case is also similar to the one in <em>Halliburton Oil Well Co. v. Reily, </em>373 U.S. 64, 72, 83 S.Ct. 1201, 10 L.Ed.2d 202 (1963). There, a Louisiana statute had the discriminatory effect of imposing a greater tax on goods manufactured outside Louisiana than on goods manufactured within that state, thereby creating an incentive to locate the manufacturing process within Louisiana. Although the mechanism is different, the application of the credit in Maryland\u2019s income tax law has a similar discriminatory effect. The more a Maryland business can locate its value-creating activities within Maryland the less it will be taxed. <em>See also Camps Newfound/Owatonna v. Town of Harrison, </em>520 U.S. 564, 117 S.Ct. 1590, 137 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997) (application of tax exemption that disfavored in-state businesses with out-of-state clientele violated dormant Commerce Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Thus, the application of the county tax to pass-through S corporation income sourced in other states that tax that income, without application of an appropriate credit, discriminates against interstate commerce.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">For the reasons explained above, the failure of the Maryland income tax law to allow a credit against the county tax for a Maryland resident taxpayer with respect to pass-through income of an S corporation that arises from activities in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>another state and that is taxed in that state violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the federal Constitution.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As for relief, the Wynnes suggest in their brief that the Maryland county income tax, the credit, or some part of the Maryland tax scheme be \u201cstruck down.\u201d In fact, the county income tax itself is not unconstitutional. Nor is the credit, which serves to ensure that the Maryland income tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>scheme operates within constitutional constraints. Nor is the Maryland income tax law generally. What is unconstitutional is the application \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of the credit to the county income tax. As this Court explained in some detail in <em>Blanton, </em>a credit previously applied to the county income tax in these circumstances. The county income tax was only eliminated from the computation and application of the credit by a 1975 amendment of the tax code. Chapter 3, Laws of Maryland 1975. It is that amendment, when applied to the particular circumstances of taxpayers like the Wynnes, that contravenes the Constitution.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> On remand from the Circuit Court, the Tax Court should recalculate the Wynnes\u2019 tax liability in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County Affirmed WITH DIRECTION TO REMAND TO THE TAX COURT FOR FURTHER Proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The county tax applies to a resident of a county if, on the last day of the taxable year, the person was domiciled in the county or maintained a principal residence or place of abode there. TG \u00a7 10-103(a). We assume, without deciding, that a person can be a resident of only one county under the statute. This may not be a safe assumption as the definition appears to allow for a principal place of abode that is different from the place of domicile, but it is fundamental to the Comptroller\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">. As this Court discussed in <em>Frey, </em>the SNRT is justified as a \u201ccompensatory\" tax on non-residents that is analogous to the county tax and that is imposed at a rate equivalent to the county tax in at least one Maryland county. 422 Md. at 149-63, 29 A.3d 475. Accordingly, even if one is a resident of a county of the universe other than Maryland, one may be subject to a Maryland tax analogous to the county tax \u2014 a fact that undermines the Comptroller's theory that the county tax should be considered separately from state taxation for purposes of the Commerce Clause. Even if Commerce Clause analysis recognized a third layer of income taxation, the existence of the SNRT shows how vulnerable that layer would be to multiple taxation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">. Although the external consistency test is only applied to confirm the proper apportionment of a tax already found to be internally consistent, <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v. Jefferson Lines, </em>514 U.S. 175, 185, 115 S.Ct. 1331, 131 L.Ed.2d 261 (1995), it seems prudent to address this issue given the possibility that dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence will continue to develop in the wake of <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.

In discussing the external consistency test, the Comptroller argues that the county tax has no effect on interstate activity on the basis that the Wynnes themselves did not directly participate in interstate commerce and the income in question is investment income. The Wynnes respond that Mr. Wynne was an officer of the company and therefore involved in its interstate activities though it is not readily apparent how that is relevant as the issue before us does not concern his salary. More to the point is that the income in question is \"pass-through\u201d income of an S corporation that was generated outside of Maryland. Under the Internal Revenue Code and the Maryland tax code, such income is attributed to shareholders like the Wynnes \"as if [it] were realized directly from the source from which realized by the corporation, or incurred in the same manner as incurred by the corporation.\u201d 26U.S.C. \u00a7 1366(b); TG \u00a7 10-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">It is this treatment of pass-through income of S corporations that allows Maryland to tax non-resident individuals with no other connection to Maryland who have pass-through S corporation income from activities in Maryland. <em>See </em>TG \u00a7 10-401. Thus, the same provisions that form the basis for Maryland to tax such income also govern the characterization of such income. Such income is not necessarily or simply to be characterized as investment income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\">. Courts in other states have found local taxes that lack external consistency to be unconstitutional. <em>See Phila.

The Court also held that the discriminatory aspect of the tax could not be justified as a valid \"compensatory\u201d <em>tax </em>\u2014 i.e., a tax on interstate commerce that complements a tax on intrastate commerce to the extent that it \"compensates\u201d for the burdens imposed on intrastate commerce by imposing a similar burden on interstate commerce. 516 U.S. at 331 n. 2, 334-44, 116 S.Ct. 848. <em>See </em>note 25 below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\">.

The Comptroller has not argued that failure to allow a credit against the county tax with respect to payments of out-of-state income taxes is part of a compensatory tax. <em>See Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, </em>516 U.S. 325, 116 S.Ct. 848, 133 L.Ed.2d 796 (1996) (rejecting argument that North Carolina's discriminatory \"intangibles\u201d tax was a compensatory tax based on inability of state to collect corporate income tax from out-of-state corporations).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\">. Our colleague, Judge Greene, offers a thoughtful dissent to this conclusion. While we are not unsympathetic to the dissent as a matter of policy, we find its legal analysis unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The dissent first points to a hypothetical situation \u2014 not this case \u2014 in which the application of the credit for out-of-state tax payments with respect to income earned in another state with a higher tax rate than Maryland could lead to the \"absurd result\" that a county resident who earned all of his or her income in the other state with the higher income tax rate would pay little or no county income tax on that same income while a neighbor who earned a similar income from activity solely within Maryland and is taxed only in Maryland would pay county income tax. This rhetorical statement proves both too much and too little.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">It proves too much because, in the situation posited by the dissent, the credit for the higher out-of-state tax payments would have a similar effect on the taxpayer\u2019s state income tax liability. But the dissent does not assert, and could not credibly suggest, that the state income tax would survive a challenge under the Commerce Clause without a credit for out-of-state tax payments made with respect to out-of-state income. It proves too little because the application of the credit has no effect on the taxpayer\u2019s liability for sales taxes, local property taxes, and other taxes unrelated to income that are used to provide state and county services.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">The dissent also argues that key Supreme Court decisions on the application of the dormant Commerce Clause to state taxes are distinguishable on the basis that the taxes at issue in those cases were \"facially discriminatory\u201d in a way that the county tax in this case is not. But this is more a matter of semantics than substance. For example, in <em>Fulton Corp. </em>v. <em>Faulkner, 516 </em>U.S. 325, 116 S.Ct. 848, 133 L.Ed.2d 796 (1996), the North Carolina law in question allowed a deduction from the state intangibles tax for corporate income taxes paid in North Carolina, but no deduction for entities that were not subject to the state income tax <em>(i.e., </em>entities that did business elsewhere) \u2014 thus effectively favoring intra-state commerce over interstate commerce. The failure to allow a credit in this case for out-of-state tax payments has the same effect as withholding a deduction in <em>Faulkner. </em>In the end, it is perhaps most telling that the dissent does not attempt to analyze the application of the county income tax without a credit under the <em>Complete Auto </em>test \u2014 the analysis that the Supreme Court has directed courts to apply in assessing State taxes under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b208-12\">.

The Maryland General Assembly\u2019s decision to apply a credit for taxes paid in other states to the Wynnes\u2019 state tax, and not their county tax, does not run afoul of the federal Constitution\u2019s dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The Wynnes live in Howard County where they benefit from the services provided by that county. <em>See Frey v.

As the Majority notes, TG \u00a7 10-703 does not permit the Wynnes to apply a credit for taxes paid in other states to reduce the Howard County tax. <em>Comptroller v.

Otherwise, \u201cif the taxpayers were allowed to pay a lesser amount of county income tax, it \u2018would have the possible absurd result of the [taxpayers] paying little or no local tax for services provided by the county while a neighbor with similar income, exemptions, and deductions might be paying a substantial local tax to support those services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blanton, </em>390 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>at 536 n. 9, 890 A.2d at 284 n. 9 (quoting <em>Coerper v.

In all four of those cases, the challenged tax law facially discriminated against interstate commerce by either first distinguishing between organizations and businesses that were involved in interstate business and those organizations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>businesses that were only involved with intrastate business, and then imposing a disadvantage upon those involved in interstate transactions, or, in the case of <em>Edwards, </em>placing a restriction upon people moving in interstate commerce itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">In <em>Camps Newfound/Owatonna, </em>the challenged Maine tax law granted a general exemption from real estate and personal property taxes for charities incorporated in Maine, but limited that exemption for organizations that mostly served non-Maine residents. 520 U.S. at 568, 117 S.Ct. at 1594, 137 L.Ed.2d at 859. The law, thereby, distinguished between groups that served people traveling in interstate commerce and those that only served Maine residents and explicitly benefited the latter. 520 U.S. at 575-76, 117 S.Ct. at 1598, 137 L.Ed.2d at 864. In <em>Edwards, </em>the challenged law directly implicated interstate commerce and travel by prohibiting the transportation of indigent persons across state lines. 314 U.S. at 174, 62 S.Ct. at 167, 86 L.Ed. at 125-26. In <em>Boston Stock Exchange, </em>the challenged New York tax law distinguished between sales of securities made within New York and those made outside New York, and then imposed a lower tax rate and a cap on taxes for in-state sales and a higher tax rate and no cap on taxes for out-of-state sales. 429 U.S. at 319, 324-25, 97 S.Ct. at 602, 604, 50 L.Ed.2d at 518, 521. Finally, in <em>Fulton Corp., </em>North Carolina imposed a tax on investments in corporations but allowed stockholders to reduce their tax liability based on the business the corporation did in North Carolina. 516 U.S. at 327-328, 116 S.Ct. at 852, 133 L.Ed.2d at 802-03.

TG \u00a7 10-103 imposes a county tax on all residents with no distinction drawn based upon the source of the income. And, TG \u00a7 10-703, on its face, provides a benefit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>interstate commerce by applying a credit to reduce the amount of Maryland state taxes paid by residents who earned income in interstate commerce. The only distinction drawn between income earned in intrastate commerce and income earned in interstate commerce pursuant to these two laws is that a benefit is bestowed upon interstate commerce through the credit that is applied to state taxes. This can hardly be interpreted as discriminating against interstate commerce on the face of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The fact that Maryland\u2019s tax scheme is not facially discriminatory is critical to the dormant Commerce Clause analysis. As the Majority notes, \u201c[fjacially discriminatory state taxes are subject to the strictest scrutiny, and the \u2018burden of justification is so heavy that \u201cfacial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Wynne, </em>431 Md. at 173, 64 A.3d at 468 (quoting <em>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v.

In other words, when a court is examining a law that, on its face, draws a distinction between interstate and intrastate commerce and imposes a disadvantage to the former, the burden of proving that the law expressly discriminates against interstate commerce and that the dormant Commerce Clause is implicated is met. <em>See United Haulers Ass\u2019n v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., </em>550 U.S. 330, 338-39, 127 S.Ct. 1786, 1793, 167 L.Ed.2d 655, 664-65 (2007). In this case, there is no facial discrimination against interstate commerce, and thus, the burden of proving that the dormant Commerce Clause is implicated requires a higher level of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">As noted above, the Wynnes have the burden of proving that interstate commerce is implicated. The Wynnes, however, fail to meet this burden with the arguments they present. In arguing that the dormant Commerce Clause is implicated, the Wynnes primarily rely on two lines of arguments, both of which are inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>First, the Wynnes rely on our decision in <em>Frey </em>where we concluded that the \u201cSpecial Nonresident Tax,\u201d or SNRT, implicated the dormant Commerce Clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The SNRT is applied to nonresidents doing business in Maryland. On its face, the SNRT singles out income from interstate commerce and applies a tax on that income. It is thus a \u201cfacially discriminatory state tax[ ],\u201d and subject to \u201cthe strictest scrutiny!.]\u201d <em>Frey, </em>422 Md. at 144, 29 A.3d at 494. The county tax, on the other hand, draws no distinction between income earned in interstate and intrastate commerce and is not facially discriminatory. Therefore, unlike the SNRT, the county tax does not expressly discriminate against interstate commerce and our conclusion in <em>Frey </em>that the SNRT implicated the dormant Commerce Clause is inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Second, the Wynnes rely on <em>Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Fulton Corp., </em>and a case from the Minnesota Supreme Court, <em>Chapman v. Comm\u2019r of Revenue, </em>651 N.W.2d 825 (Minn.2002). As noted above, <em>Camps Newfound/Owatonna </em>and <em>Fulton Corp. </em>address facially discriminatory laws. Likewise, <em>Chapman </em>addresses a facially discriminatory law. The law in question allowed Minnesota taxpayers to take a tax deduction for contributions to charities \u201clocated in and carrying on substantially all of its activities within [Minnesota],\u201d but did not allow a tax deduction for contributions to non-Minnesota charities. 651 N.W.2d at 834. The Minnesota Supreme Court stated that \u201c[o]n its face, the statute treats contributions to instate charitable organizations differently from contributions to out-of-state charitable organizations,\u201d and concluded that it was \u201cfacially discriminatory.\u201d 651 N.W.2d at 834. As noted above, a law that facially discriminates against interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>commerce necessarily implicates the dormant Commerce Clause. Maryland\u2019s tax scheme, which is not facially discriminatory, however, does not necessarily implicate the dormant Commerce Clause. Therefore, like <em>Camps Newfound/Owatonna </em>and <em>Fulton Corp., </em>the conclusion that the law in <em>Chapman </em>implicated the dormant Commerce Clause is inapplicable to the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In the absence of facial or express discrimination, an undue burden on interstate commerce must be shown.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Tracy, </em>519 U.S. at 287, 117 S.Ct. at 818, 136 L.Ed.2d at 773 (internal quotation and citations omitted) (\u201cThe negative or dormant implication of the Commerce Clause prohibits state taxation ... or regulation ... that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and thereby impedes free private trade in the national marketplace[.]\u201d). In <em>Amerada Hess Corp. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, New Jersey, </em>490 U.S. 66, 78-79 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1617, 1624-25 n. 10, 104 L.Ed.2d 58, 70 n. 10 (1989), the Supreme Court, in considering New Jersey\u2019s denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>of a state tax deduction for federal windfall profit tax payments, observed that \u201cin the absence of discriminatory intent or a statute directed specifically at economic activity that occurs only in a particular location ... a deduction denial does not unduly burden interstate commerce just because the deduction denied relates to an economic activity performed outside the taxing State.\u201d The Wynnes, in failing to prove discriminatory intent or unacceptable statutory geographical specificity, have demonstrated neither an undue burden on interstate commerce nor an implication of the dormant Commerce Clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The <em>Blanton </em>decision conclusively established that Maryland law applies TG \u00a7 10-703\u2019s tax credit only to state taxes, not county taxes. 390 Md. at 543, 890 A.2d at 288. The Wynnes asked this Court to conclude that settled Maryland law is unconstitutional under the dormant Commerce Clause. The presumption has always been that Maryland law is constitutional, and the Wynnes, as challengers of the Maryland tax law, have failed to overcome that presumption by proving that Maryland\u2019s tax scheme expressly discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce such that the dormant Commerce Clause is implicated. The Wynnes may believe that it is bad policy to require them to pay the Howard County tax without a tax credit; however, they have failed to prove that it is in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Judge BATTAGLIA joins in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Opinion on Motion for Reconsideration by</p>\n<author id=\"Aq\">McDONALD, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The Comptroller has filed a Motion for Reconsideration and, Alternatively, a Motion for Stay of Enforcement of the Judgment. The Wynnes opposed that motion. The parties filed memoranda of law and other materials in support of their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">It appears appropriate to clarify two points raised in the papers submitted by the parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">(1) The Comptroller raised the question of whether he could deny application of a credit to the Wynnes for income taxes paid by an S corporation, such as Maxim, in another state that does not accord pass-through treatment to S corporation income, but rather taxes the income of such a corporation in the same way that it taxes the income of a C corporation. The parties did not brief, and we did not consider, the ways in which other states may treat S corporation income other than as pass-through personal income of the corporation\u2019s share<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>holders. Our opinion does not foreclose different treatment in Maryland of income taxes paid in other states that are not based on passthrough personal income.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">(2) A state may avoid discrimination against interstate commerce by providing a tax credit, or some other method of apportionment, to avoid discriminating against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. The Comptroller interprets a footnote in our earlier opinion to hold that a state must provide a tax credit. 431 Md. at 177 n.26, 64 A.3d at 470-71 n.26. While the footnote might have been worded more elegantly, it referred primarily to the method used by the Legislature in the Maryland income tax; we did not mean to preclude other methods that might be utilized in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED; however, we shall STAY the effective date of the mandate pending the disposition of a timely petition for certiorari filed by the Comptroller with the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-5\">. In <em>General Motors v. Tracy, </em>519 U.S. 278, 300, 117 S.Ct. 811, 825, 136 L.Ed.2d 761, 781 (1997), the Supreme Court noted that \u201cin the absence of actual or prospective competition\u201d within \"a single market\u201d between those engaged in interstate commerce and those engaged in intrastate commerce, there can be no dormant Commerce Clause violation. Because of this, the New York Court of Appeals has determined that before a tax can be subjected to the <em>Complete Auto </em>test, the party challenging the tax must \u201cidentify the interstate market that is being subjected to discriminatory or unduly burdensome taxation.\u201d <em>In re Tamagni, </em>91 N.Y.2d 530, 673 N.Y.2d 44, 695 N.E.2d 1125, 1131 (1998). \u201cThis requires, at the outset, identification of the similarly situated in-State and out-of-State interests which the tax treats differently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Wynnes argue that \u201cMaryland taxpayers and companies that do business out of state, on the one hand, and those that restrict their trade to Maryland, on the other\u201d constitute similarly situated parties in one market. These two groups are not similarly situated, however. Those who engage in out-of-state business enjoy the protections and markets provided by the states where they do business. Taxpayers and companies that restrict their business to Maryland only receive the protections and services provided by Maryland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-5\">. In most of the cases where the Supreme Court has subjected a tax to the <em>Complete Auto test, the </em>tax was directly on interstate commerce itself or items in interstate commerce. <em>See Okla. Tax Comm\u2019n v. Jefferson Lines, </em>514 U.S. 175, 177, 183, 115 S.Ct. 1331, 1334, 1337, 131 L.Ed.2d 261, 267, 271 (1995) (analyzing an Oklahoma tax on a bus ticket for interstate travel); <em>Goldberg, </em>488 U.S. at 255-56, 259-60, 109 S.Ct. at 585-86, 587-88, 102 L.Ed.2d at 613, 615-16 (analyzing an Illinois state tax on interstate calls); <em>D.H.

The challenged Howard County tax without a credit is assessed upon the income of residents of the County. While a portion of that income may derive from interstate commerce, the challenged tax is not directed to interstate commerce or items in interstate commerce. Rather, the connection to interstate commerce is more attenuated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-5\">. Similarly, at oral argument before this Court, counsel for the Wynnes argued that, in footnote 14 of the <em>Frey </em>decision, this Court indicated that the county tax implicates the dormant Commerce Clause. A close reading of footnote 14 indicates that what we concluded was that \u201d[t]he SNRT may thereby substantially affect interstate commerce and is consequently susceptible to Commerce Clause scrutiny.\u201d 422 Md. at 143 n. 14, 29 A.3d at 493 n. 14. We said nothing in the footnote about county taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\">. The Supreme Court in <em>Dept. of Revenue v. Davis, </em>553 U.S. 328, 128 S.Ct. 1801, 170 L.Ed.2d 685 (2008), articulated the standard for when a nondiscriminatory law can violate the dormant Commerce Clause. It stated that \"[a]bsent discrimination for the forbidden purpose [of economic protectionism], however, the law 'will be upheld unless the burden imposed on [interstate] commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\u2019 \" 553 U.S. at 338-339, 128 S.Ct. at 1808, 170 L.Ed.2d at 695 (quoting <em>Pike v.

In the present case, the Wynnes have failed to prove that any alleged burden upon interstate commerce is \"clearly excessive\u201d in relation to the local services paid for by the Howard County tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b217-5\">. In another section of their brief to this Court, the Wynnes argue that the dormant Commerce Clause requires taxes to be apportioned, which can be read as an assertion that an un-apportioned tax might implicate and violate the dormant Commerce Clause. Some unapportioned taxes could have a significant effect on interstate commerce such that they \"unduly\u201d burden interstate commerce, thereby implicating and violating the dormant Commerce Clause. <em>Amerada Hess, </em>490 U.S. at 75, 109 S.Ct. at 1623, 104 L.Ed.2d at 68. The dormant Commerce Clause, however, does not protect against taxes and laws that have only an incidental effect on interstate commerce. <em>Fulton Corp., </em>516 U.S. at 331, 116 S.Ct. at 854, 133 L.Ed.2d at 805. TG \u00a7 10-703 provides a credit for state taxes, significantly diminishing any effect Maryland income taxes have on interstate commerce. As noted above there is a strong presumption that an act of the Maryland General Assembly is constitutional. Additionally, the Supreme Court has concluded that \"[t]he dormant Commerce Clause protects markets and participants in markets, not taxpayers as such.\u201d <em>Tracy, </em>519 U.S. at 300, 117 S.Ct. at 825, 136 L.Ed.2d at 781. The Wynnes have not provided evidence that any markets or market participants, as opposed to taxpayers, have been disadvantaged by some taxpayers being required to pay slightly more in taxes. Additionally, there is no evidence that, as the Majority fears, interstate commerce will be harmed because taxpayers will have a \"disincentive ... to conduct income-generating activities in other states with income taxes.\u201d <em>Wynne, </em>431 Md. at 164, 64 A.3d at 463. In fact, as the Majority notes, Maryland residents have paid a county tax without a credit pursuant to TG \u00a7 10-703 since the tax code was amended in 1975. <em>Wynne, </em>431 Md. at 157-58, 64 A.3d at 458-59. There has been no evidence presented to this Court that Maryland companies or taxpayers have been deterred from engaging in interstate commerce over nearly four decades since 1975. In fact, at issue in the present case is the income generated by the Maxim Corporation, a company founded in 1988, from business in 39 other states where the income was taxed. Thus, even if we were to accept the argument that the federal Constitution requires the apportionment of taxes as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>contention by the Wynnes that the dormant Commerce Clause is implemented, the Wynnes have failed to prove this.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
