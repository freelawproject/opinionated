U.S. Const. amend. V; <em>Hubbard v. State, </em>395 Md. 73, 91-92, 909 A.2d 270, 280-81 (2006). Where a mistrial is declared because of manifest necessity, however, retrial is not prohibited. <em>Hubbard, </em>395 Md. at 89, 909 A.2d at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Prior to the conclusion of jury deliberations in the present case in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the jury sent an unsolicited, completed verdict sheet to the trial judge indicating apparently that the jury voted unanimously to acquit Respondent, Sean Fennell, on charges of first degree assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and conspiracy to commit robbery. The jury sheet indicated further, however, that the jury had not agreed unanimously as to disposition of an additional charge of robbery and a lesser included charge to first degree assault of second degree assault. After examining this \u201cgift,\u201d the trial judge instructed the jury to continue to deliberate \u201cregarding the counts as to which you are undecided.\u201d The jury continued to deliberate, but, upon being called back into open court, indicated that it was not making progress and was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Fennell, through counsel, requested of the judge that he take a partial verdict on the counts as to which the jury indicated unanimity previously. The State objected. The judge declared a mistrial as to all counts. A retrial date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>was scheduled. Fennell filed a motion to bar retrial on the charges for which he believed the first jury acquitted him. This motion was denied, which lead to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">On these facts, all agree now that Fennell may be retried on the charges of second degree assault and robbery; the parties diverge, however, as to whether Fennell may be retried for first degree assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and conspiracy to commit robbery. For reasons we shall explain, we conclude, on the unusual posture of this case, that retrial of Fennell on the latter three charges is prohibited by principles of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">RELEVANT FACTUAL<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">On 6 May 2010, Fennell was indicted in the Circuit Court on the following four counts: (1) first degree assault; (2) conspiracy to commit first degree assault; (3) robbery; and, (4) conspiracy to commit robbery. A one day jury trial took place on 18 October 2010. The jury began deliberations at approximately 5:50 p.m.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At approximately 9:00 p.m., the jury gave the bailiff a completed verdict sheet to take to the judge. The verdict sheet read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">Count One: As to the charge of First Degree Assault, we, the jury, find the Defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">Not Guilty <em>12 </em>Guilty <em>0</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">If you find the Defendant guilty of Count One, go on to decide Count Two. If you find the defendant not guilty of First Degree Assault, then consider whether he is, guilty, as to the charge of Second Degree Assault:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Not Guilty <em>6 </em>Guilty <em>6</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Count Two: As to the charge of Conspiracy to commit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">First Degree Assault, we, the jury, find the Defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEn\">Not Guilty <em>12 </em>Guilty <em>0</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Count Three: As to the charge of Robbery, we, the jury, find the Defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">Not Guilty <em>6 </em>Guilty 5[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">Count Four: As to the charge of Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, we, the jury, find the Defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">Not Guilty <em>12 </em>Guilty <em>0</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">After sharing the unsolicited verdict sheet with the parties, the following exchange occurred between counsel and the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-14\">THE COURT: Please have a seat. I thought I had seen everything. Apparently, they knocked on the door, and handed this to [the bailiff], having been fed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Interesting that Count 3 doesn\u2019t add up to 12. You can\u2019t abstain, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-16\">THE COURT: Well, they\u2019re forcing the issue a little bit. The jury has obviously not reached a verdict on about half the counts. They went out about 5:00, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-17\">[COURT CLERK]: I believe it was at 10 of 6:00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-18\">THE COURT: Ten of 6:00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, I thought it was closer to 6:00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-20\">THE COURT: The question now is like I say three options. They can continue to deliberate tonight, come back tomorrow, or call it a day. They haven\u2019t been out very long. How about please continue to deliberate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-21\">[PROSECUTOR]: I know there\u2019s a specific jury instruction for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-22\">THE COURT: I think we already gave it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-23\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>THE COURT: The [modified Allen<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ] charge\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aec\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">THE COURT: Yes, I think that was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">Please continue to deliberate. Your verdict must be unanimous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">[THE COURT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The only thing I would ask you to consider would be please continue to deliberate on the counts of which you are still undecided. Those must be unanimous, as well. Would that work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">THE COURT: Yes, as to which you remain undecided. Please continue to deliberate regarding the counts as to which you are undecided. Your verdict as to each count must be unanimous. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">Well, thank you. I don\u2019t think we ought to keep them past 9:30 [p.m.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-14\">[THE COURT]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-16\">[THE COURT]: I guess we better send [the filled-in verdict sheet] back in there, or give them a clean copy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-17\">THE BAILIFF: I gave them a clean copy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>At approximately 9:30 p.m., the trial judge discussed with counsel the lateness of the hour and the options regarding continued jury deliberations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think we ought to keep them any longer tonight. The question is do we make them come back in the morning. I\u2019ll hear whatever suggestions either of you want to make at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, possibly we could just bring them in and say exactly what you said, do you guys think it would be worth it deliberating [ ] tomorrow or are you making progress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: I think, in reality, they really haven\u2019t been deliberating that long. I don\u2019t think, in this kind of case, it would be that unusual. And I think it is obviously worth it to bring them back in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">THE COURT: How long have they been \u2014 three and a half hours. Well, let\u2019s bring them in and see whether they\u2019re close to reaching a verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The jury having been brought into the courtroom, the trial judge engaged in the following exchange with the jury foreperson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">THE COURT: Please have a seat. Madam Forelady, is there any possibility that upon further deliberation this evening you could reach a verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">THE FOREPERSON: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">THE COURT: Well, then the question is could you reach one tomorrow? Are you making any progress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-13\">THE FOREPERSON: No, it\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-14\">(Discussion off the record.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-15\">THE FOREPERSON: Yeah, there\u2019s a clear division on the amount of evidence, and how you read the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-16\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to ask you to go back in there while 1 confer with counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-17\">The jury left the courtroom, and then the following ensued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-18\">THE COURT: It doesn\u2019t look to me like much has changed in the last hour or so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: It probably depends who you ask sitting there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, they\u2019re split 50/50 on whether\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: They\u2019re making progress or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">[THE COURT]: They can\u2019t even decide if they\u2019re making progress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right. We\u2019re ready to ask you to let it go, Judge. You know, take the three or four they gave, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: We\u2019re not in a position to accept a partial verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">THE COURT: I think, reluctantly, I must declare a mistrial. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any movement. There\u2019s no sign of it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lack of evidence. I just think that the evidence is capable of more than one interpretation depending on whom you believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">So, I think for better or worse, that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, the one\u2019s [sic] where they have reached a unanimous verdict we\u2019re not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to take a verdict at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Obviously, we can\u2019t get a trial date from assignment at this point. We\u2019ll call tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-16\">(The jury entered the courtroom.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-17\">THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the Court determines that it\u2019s very unlikely that you will reach a verdict. I hereby declare a mistrial, which means that the State will have the option of retrying this case at some future date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">On 22 December 2010,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fennell filed a Motion to Bar Retrial Due to Double Jeopardy, claiming that the jury re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>turned a verdict sheet acquitting Fennell unanimously of first degree assault (count 1), conspiracy to commit first degree assault (count 2), and conspiracy to commit robbery (count 4), and indicating that it was hung on the charges of second degree assault (a lesser included offense of count 1) and robbery (count 3). Because the jury found him not guilty of three counts, Fennell argued that retrial of those three counts was prohibited by double jeopardy. Fennell consented to the mistrial on the charges of second degree assault and robbery, however, and thus conceded that the State is free to prosecute him anew on those charges. The State opposed entry of a partial verdict, riposting that, because a partial verdict was not taken, a verdict was not received by the court on any count, and a manifest necessity existed for a mistrial, it was permitted to retry Fennell on all counts. On 22 February 2011, the Circuit Court granted Fennell\u2019s motion to bar retrial as to counts 1 (not including the lesser-included offense), 2, and 4. The State filed, along with a motion to reconsider the February 22 order, a supplemental opposition to the motion to bar retrial. The Circuit Court agreed to reconsider, vacated its judgment entered on February 22, and, without a hearing or written elaboration, denied Fennell\u2019s motion to bar retrial. Fennell appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">A panel of the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion filed on 4 May 2012, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court, determining that there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial and that retrial on the three counts for which the jury indicated a unanimous vote on the verdict sheet was barred by double jeopardy. Characterizing the trial court\u2019s action as declaring <em>sua sponte </em>a mistrial, the intermediate appellate court noted that a mistrial was appropriate only if there was \u201cmanifest necessity for the act.\u201d (quoting <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 317, 322 A.2d 880, 884 (1974) (quoting <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165, 165 (1824))). In order to find a manifest necessity, the court stated, the trial judge \u201cmust engage in the process of exploring reasonable alternatives and determine that there is no reasonable alternative to the mistrial.\u201d (quoting <em>Hubbard v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>State, </em>395 Md. at 92, 909 A.2d at 281). The court determined that, in light of the jury\u2019s prior transmittal of a verdict sheet to the trial judge indicating unanimity as to three charges and the judge\u2019s attendant instruction, the jury\u2019s subsequent statement of deadlock was ambiguous as to on which counts disagreement existed. Thus, prior to declaring a mistrial, the judge was required to determine that there was no reasonable alternative. Because the trial court had the opportunity to clarify whether the jury was deadlocked as to all, or just the previously undecided, charges, inquire whether the jury intended to render a unanimous partial verdict as to the three counts indicated on the verdict sheet, or request reasonably the jury to return the next morning to continue deliberations, the appellate court determined that \u201cthe trial judge failed to \u2018engage in the process of exploring reasonable alternatives.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Hubbard, </em>395 Md. at 92, 909 A.2d at 281). Thus, the intermediate appellate court determined that no manifest necessity for the mistrial existed as to the three counts indicated on the verdict sheet for which the jury voted unanimously to acquit, and retrial of those three counts was barred by double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The State filed a petition for writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which we granted on 19 October 2012, 429 Md. 81, 54 A.3d 759 (2012), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">(1) Where the jury sends to the court a verdict sheet documenting the jurors\u2019 votes as to each charge and the court, with the consent of defense counsel, sends the jury back for further deliberations, is it a proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion to later declare a mistrial as to all charges when, upon further inquiry with the jury, the court concluded that the jurors were unable to reach a verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">(2) Is a circuit court required to accept a partial verdict at the request of one party and over the objection of the other?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">The State contends primarily that the trial judge exercised properly his discretion in declaring a mistrial be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>cause neither the federal Constitution, the common law of Maryland, nor Maryland Rule 4-327(d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> require the trial judge to consider specific alternatives to a mistrial where the jury is deadlocked and gives no indication of unanimity on all counts. Because the trial judge acted therefore within his discretion in denying Fennell\u2019s request to take a partial verdict, the State argues that retrial on all counts is not prohibited by double jeopardy. By contrast, Fennell contends that the record demonstrates unanimous agreement by the jury as to three of the five charges. In his view, the trial court\u2019s failure to enter a partial verdict on these charges, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-327(d), violated his constitutional rights. Although we accord great deference to the decision of a trial judge in concluding that a jury would be unlikely to reach a unanimous decision on all counts, whether there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial implicates principles of double jeopardy. We review without deference, considering the totality of the circumstances, the legal conclusions of the trial court. <em>Giddins v. State, </em>393 Md. 1, 15, 899 A.2d 139, 147 (2005); <em>Bishop v.

The <em>term </em>\u201cgenuinely deadlocked\u201d suggests, however, \u201cmore than an impasse; it invokes a moment where, if deliberations were to continue, \u2018there exists a significant risk that a verdict may result from pressures inherent in the situation rather than the considered judgment of all the jurors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

Rather, the determination of whether there is manifest necessity for a mistrial \u2014 or, a \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity, <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 506-07, 98 S.Ct. at 831, 54 L.Ed.2d at 728 \u2014 is a fact-specific inquiry not reducible to \u201ca standard that can be applied mechanically or without attention to the particular problem confronting the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505-06, 509-10, 98 S.Ct. at 830-32, 54 L.Ed.2d at 728-29 (noting that deference to a trial judge\u2019s discretion guards against the possibility of trial judges otherwise \u201cemploy[ing] coercive means to break the apparent deadlock,\u201d which might create \u201ca significant risk that a verdict may result from the pressures inherent in the situation rather than the considered judgment of all the jurors\u201d); <em>Perez, </em>22 U.S. at 580, 6 L.Ed. at 165 (noting that trial judges must \u201ctak[e] all the circumstances into consideration,\u201d \u201cexercise a sound discretion,\u201d and use the power to declare a mistrial \u201cwith the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The State criticizes the intermediate appellate court\u2019s reliance in the present case on our decision in <em>Hubbard v. State, </em>395 Md. 73, 909 A.2d 270 (2006), in finding no manifest necessity for a mistrial here. In <em>Hubbard, </em>we considered whether manifest necessity for a mistrial existed where \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>witness, whose identification testimony against one defendant had been suppressed, was to be called by the State to testify against the co-defendant in a joint trial.\u201d 395 Md. at 77, 909 A.2d at 272. We noted that, \u201cto determine whether manifest necessity to declare a mistrial over defense objection exists, the trial judge must engage in the process of exploring reasonable alternatives and determine that there is no reasonable alternative to the mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 909 A.2d at 281. Because the trial judge in <em>Hubbard </em>could have excluded reasonably the pre-trial identification testimony against both defendants, instead of declaring a mistrial, we determined that no manifest necessity existed. <em>Id. </em>at 93-96, 909 A.2d at 282-83. Here, because the trial judge could have inquired reasonably regarding the jury\u2019s intention to render a partial verdict or instructed the jury to continue deliberations, the Court of Special Appeals determined consequently that there was no apparent manifest necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The State argues that, because <em>Hubbard </em>did not concern manifest necessity by reason of a deadlocked jury, it is inapposite to the present case. Instead, the State contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blueford v. Arkansas, </em>-U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2044, 182 L.Ed.2d 937 (2012), governs the manifest necessity analysis here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Blueford, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial where the jury indicated that it was \u201chopelessly deadlocked,\u201d after having previously announced orally in court, prior to being sent for further deliberations, that it agreed unanimously that the defendant was not guilty of at least two offenses, but was hung on the remaining offenses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Blueford argued that the jury\u2019s colloquy with the trial court, in which it indicated that it agreed unanimously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>that he was not guilty of the greater two offenses, constituted an actual acquittal barring retrial. -U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2050, 182 L.Ed.2d at 943. In the alternative, Blueford maintained that no manifest necessity for a mistrial existed because the trial judge should have entered a partial verdict on the two greater offenses. <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2052, 182 L.Ed.2d at 945. With respect to his first contention, the Court noted that, because the jury was sent for further deliberations, but was not instructed that it could not reconsider the two offenses as to which it reached a unanimous agreement, any finality that might have attached to the jury\u2019s announcement dissipated. Thus, the jury\u2019s announcement could not operate as an acquittal. <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2050-52, 182 L.Ed.2d at 943-45. Regarding Blueford\u2019s latter contention, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its disinclination to impose specific requirements on trial judges prior to finding a manifest necessity. <em>Id. </em>at-132 S.Ct. at 2050, 182 L.Ed.2d at 945. Noting that Arkansas law permitted the trial judge to accept verdicts only either acquitting on all counts or convicting on one, the Supreme Court concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in failing to act in some manner to provide the jury with an opportunity to give effect to its earlier votes. <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2052-53, 182 L.Ed.2d at 945-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">We disagree with the implication of the State\u2019s theory that <em>Blueford </em>renders inapplicable, in cases where a judge determines a hung jury exists, our analysis in <em>Hubbard </em>requiring a judge to consider reasonable alternatives to a mistrial. Although the Supreme Court refuses to require trial courts to jump over specified hurdles in mechanical fashion prior to declaring a mistrial, its preference for the exercise of judicial discretion does not obviate the manifest necessity analysis. <em>See Somerville, </em>410 U.S. at 462, 93 S.Ct. at 1069, 35 L.Ed.2d at 430 (noting that mistrial by manifest necessity is appropriate where \u201cthe ends of substantial justice cannot be attained without discontinuing the trial\u201d (quoting <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 368, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 1526, 6 L.Ed.2d 901, 904 (1961))). The trial court must determine still that no reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>able alternative to a mistrial exists. In the context of a hung jury, therefore, the trial court must determine ordinarily that genuine jury deadlock exists, such that further deliberations are unlikely to be productive. <em>See Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 509, 98 S.Ct. at 832, 54 L.Ed.2d at 730 (permitting retrial where the court discharges a \u201cgenuinely deadlocked jury\u201d). This view is entirely consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blueford. </em>The Court did not determine, in that case, that the manifest necessity standard is reached automatically whenever the judge determines that deadlock exists, without further inquiry. Rather, in <em>Blueford, </em>the Court reasoned that no further inquiry was needed to establish genuine deadlock after the jury indicated that it was deadlocked hopelessly and unlikely to reach a verdict. Any indication that the jury was in agreement unanimously on any charge disappeared. Moreover, even if unanimity was suggested, the taking of partial verdicts on the counts at issue was prohibited by Arkansas state law, <em>see Blueford v. State, </em>2011 Ark. 8, 370 S.W.3d 496, 502 (2011), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2044, 182 L.Ed.2d 937 (2012) \u2014 thus, the jury\u2019s status of agreement or disagreement on the greater offenses, where at least one charge was definitively unresolved, could not impact the trial judge\u2019s options regarding the entry of a verdict,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a mistrial was necessary manifestly.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Unlike Arkansas, however, Maryland permits partial verdicts under the circumstances present here. In determining that no manifest necessity for a mistrial existed as to the three charges in dispute, the Court of Special Appeals relied implicitly on Maryland Rule 4-327(d), which provides that, \u201c[w]hen there are two or more counts, the jury may return a verdict with respect to a count as to which it has agreed, and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>count as to which the jury cannot agree may be tried again.\u201d We have not stated explicitly, however, what obligations, if any, the availability of partial verdicts places on trial judges in determining whether there is a manifest necessity for a mistrial by virtue of a deadlocked jury, nor whether the availability of partial verdicts changes the determination of whether a jury\u2019s deadlock is genuine. <em>See generally State v. Woodson, </em>338 Md. 322, 330 n. 2, 658 A.2d 272, 276 n. 2 (1995) (noting that \u201cMaryland Rule 4-327(d) does not provide whether it is in the court\u2019s discretion to refuse to take a partial verdict when the jury announces that it has reached a partial verdict,\u201d but declining to consider the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The State appears to concede in its brief that, if the jury indicates an intention to render a partial verdict, \u201cthe court may not preclude the jury from doing so.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (citing <em>United States v. DiLapi, </em>651 F.2d 140, 146 (2d Cir.1981)). The State urges, however, that because the jury did \u201cnot indicate[ ] any intention to render\u201d a partial verdict in this case, the trial court did not have any obligation to inquire into the jury\u2019s desire to render a partial verdict.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>We agree with the State that the mere theoretical availability of partial verdicts does not necessitate a further inquiry by the trial court where, for example, no party has requested a partial verdict be taken or the jury does not indicate that it has reached one. <em>See, e.g., United States v. DiLapi, </em>651 F.2d 140, 147 (2d Cir.1981) (noting that \u201cthe absence of such an explanation [by the trial court regarding the jury\u2019s right to return a partial verdict] did not deny the appellants any protected right in a case such as this where the jury neither attempted to return a partial verdict nor even asked if it could do so\u201d); <em>United States v. MacQueen, </em>596 F.2d 76, 82 (2d Cir.1979) (declining to adopt \u201ca <em>per se </em>rule that a mistrial is improperly declared whenever the trial judge fails to specifically inquire as to the possibility of a partial verdict\u201d); <em>Whiteaker v. State, </em>808 P.2d 270, 277 (Alaska Ct.App.1991) (declining \u201cto place a burden on the trial judge to <em>sua sponte </em>inquire further or perform a special poll of jurors who deliberate on cases involving lesser included offenses\u201d); <em>Speaks v. United States, </em>617 A.2d 942, 952 (D.C.1992) (noting that imposing a <em>sua sponte </em>obligation on a trial judge to inquire regarding partial verdicts where not requested by defense counsel or indicated by the jury \u201cthreatens to disrupt the fine line which a trial judge must tread with respect to partial verdicts\u201d). <em>But see State v. Castrillo, </em>90 N.M. 608, 566 P.2d 1146, 1151-52 (1977), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Wardlow, </em>95 N.M. 585, 624 P.2d 527 (1981) (determining that no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial without a defendant\u2019s consent exists without the trial judge inquiring whether the jury reached a partial verdict). This does not mean, however, that the trial judge is not <em>permitted </em>to inquire of a jury as to the possibility of a partial verdict where it has not been indicated by the jury or requested by counsel \u2014 rather, it remains within the court\u2019s discretion to do so. <em>See generally Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 506, 98 S.Ct. at 830-31, 54 L.Ed.2d at 728 (noting that manifest necessity is not \u201ca standard that can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>be applied mechanically or without attention to the particular problem confronting the judge\u201d); <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 486, 91 S.Ct. 547, 557, 27 L.Ed.2d 543, 557 (1971) (plurality opinion) (noting that, in considering when manifest necessity for a mistrial exists, \u201cbrightline rules based on either the source of the problem or the intended beneficiary of the ruling would only disserve the vital competing interests of the Government and the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Where, however, the jury indicates to the court that unanimity was achieved, at some point, on one or more counts, Maryland Rule 4-327(d) points the way for a trial judge to a reasonable alternative to the declaration of a mistrial. Thus, prior to declaring a mistrial without consent on those counts, the trial judge generally should take steps to determine that genuine deadlock exists as to those counts. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Razmilovic, </em>507 F.3d 130, 137-40 (2d Cir.2007) (conducting a fact-specific inquiry into whether the jury was deadlocked genuinely); <em>In re Ford, </em>987 F.2d 334, 340 (6th Cir.1992) (holding that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to instruct the jury regarding a partial verdict where the judge\u2019s examination of the tentative verdict sheets revealed no indication of jury unanimity). One reasonable alternative is an inquiry into the jury\u2019s status and intention to render a verdict regarding those counts as to which unanimity appears, self-reported, to exist.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In making this inquiry, however, the trial judge \u201ctreads a fine line ...: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>he must neither pressure the jury to reconsider what it had actually decided nor force the jury to turn a tentative decision into a final one.\u201d <em>United States v. Heriot, </em>496 F.3d 601, 608 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>802 F.2d 778, 781 (5th Cir.1986)); <em>see also Burnette v. State, </em>280 Md. 88, 98, 371 A.2d 663, 668 (1977) (\u201cCoercion of the jury for the purpose of breaking a deadlock must be avoided.\u201d). As the Court of Special Appeals noted in <em>Caldwell, </em>the trial judge may not accept a verdict that is tentative, and thus, in determining whether to accept a partial verdict, \u201cmust guard against the danger of transforming a provisional decision into a final verdict.\u201d 164 Md.App. at 643, 884 A.2d at 216. \u201cJust as when the total circumstances disclose an ambiguity or qualification in a verdict, when they suggest that the jury has made a tentative decision, the court ... should inquire into the jury\u2019s intention <em>vel non </em>that the verdict be final, if such inquiry can be done non-coercively; return the jury for further deliberation; or, if that is not possible and there is manifest necessity, declare a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Although we agree with the State that the partial verdict inquiry is largely an exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion, we disagree that the principle salvages the trial judge\u2019s conduct in the present case. The State characterizes the record in this case as demonstrating \u201cclearly\u201d that the jury did not intend to render a partial verdict. Viewing the record as a whole, however, we conclude that the jury\u2019s unsolicited submission of the completed verdict sheet, the trial judge\u2019s subsequent instructions, and the ultimate colloquy between the jury foreperson and the trial court reveals an ambiguity as to the jury\u2019s intent and resulting deadlock that was never resolved satisfactorily by the trial court. The jury\u2019s delivery to the court of the verdict sheet indicated facially that the jury agreed unanimously to acquit the defendant on the charges of first degree assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and conspiracy to commit robbery, but was deadlocked as to the remaining two charges. The verdict sheet indicated unambiguously, at least at that stage in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>deliberations,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that the jury reached a verdict unanimously on three charges. Counsel did not request, and the trial court did not consider on the record, the entry of a partial verdict at that time. Rather, the trial court instructed the jury to resume deliberations. Consistent with defense counsel\u2019s request, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury read as follows: \u201cPlease continue to deliberate <em>regarding the counts to which you, are undecided. </em>Your verdict as to each count must be unanimous.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In <em>Blueford, </em>the Supreme Court determined that, when the jury was sent for further deliberations, any finality that could be inferred from the jury\u2019s earlier rendering of the verdict sheet dissipated. Although the verdict sheet here was not final in any way so as to constitute a complete final verdict, <em>see Ogundipe, </em>424 Md. at 72, 33 A.3d at 992, we note that, unlike in <em>Blueford, </em>the instructions to the jury could be understood reasonably as instructing the jury to continue deliberations only as to the charges of second degree assault and robbery. Although the trial court in no way prohibited the jury from reconsidering its prior vote, the instructions, which requested the jury to continue deliberations \u201cregarding the counts as to which [they] are undecided,\u201d were given to the jury directly after the jury indicated to the court that apparently it was unanimous as to acquittal on the other three charges. Thus, one logical interpretation of the instructions by a reasonable juror would be that the trial court directed the jury to continue deliberating as to the two counts to which it indicated it had been unable to achieve unanimity.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The last colloquy between the judge and jury foreperson, occurring before the trial court declared the mistrial, must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>read in light of this ambiguity. Thus, when the trial court later asked if the jury was likely to reach a verdict and had made any progress, the court\u2019s line of questioning could be regarded reasonably as an inquiry aimed at the remaining two charges. The exchange between the judge and jury foreperson did not indicate that the jury had changed its mind as to the other three charges. At the same time, however, the colloquy did not establish unequivocally that the jury was undecided then as to those three charges. Thus, the colloquy did not resolve the ambiguity of the jury\u2019s intention, but left essentially uncontradicted the \u201cinterim\u201d verdict sheet. The justification for the trial court\u2019s denial of defense counsel\u2019s request for a partial verdict, without explanation is, therefore, unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Unlike in <em>Caldwell, </em>where the trial judge sought actively the entry of partial verdicts due to emergency and brought the jury\u2019s deliberations \u201cto an abrupt conclusion,\u201d the jury here returned the verdict sheet to the court \u201con [its] own timetable.\u201d 164 Md.App. at 643-44, 884 A.2d at 217. Asking the jury for further clarification of that decision, in light of the ambiguity inherent here, was unlikely to raise the specter of coercion \u2014 particularly where, as here, the trial court decided already, with Fennell\u2019s consent, to declare a mistrial as to the eoncededly unresolved counts. Because the trial judge was on notice that the jury may have reached a partial verdict, an ambiguity as to unanimity persisted through the colloquy with the jury, defense counsel requested a partial verdict, and the specter of coercion was low due to the posture of the jury\u2019s deliberations, Maryland Rule 4-327(d) provided the trial judge with a reasonable alternative to the declaration of a mistrial. Thus, before a proper finding of manifest necessity for a mistrial could have been made, the trial judge should have inquired into the jury\u2019s status of unanimity prior to its discharge. Failure to do so was an abuse of discretion, and retrial on the charges of first degree assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and conspiracy to commit robbery is barred by double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Maryland Rule 4-327(d) states, \"When there are two or more counts, the jury may return a verdict with respect to a count as to which it has agreed, and any count as to which the jury cannot agree may be tried again.\u201d In Maryland, a partial verdict is \u201ca verdict on less than all counts in a multi-count case.\u201d <em>Caldwell v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 612, 631, 884 A.2d 199, 209 (2005). Although partial verdicts are accepted as a general rule, <em>see generally Selvester v. United States, </em>170 U.S. 262, 18 S.Ct. 580, 42 L.Ed. 1029 (1898), jurisdictions are split generally as to whether partial verdicts may be entered on one or more lesser included offenses. <em>See, e.g., State v. Tate, </em>256 Conn. 262, 773 A.2d 308, 322-23 (2001) (discussing jurisdictions permitting a court to take a partial verdict of acquittal on a greater offense when the jury is deadlocked on the lesser offenses); <em>Whiteaker v. State, </em>808 P.2d 270, 274-75 (Alaska Ct.App.1991) (discussing jurisdictional differences regarding acceptance of partial verdicts on greater and lesser included offenses). The Maryland Rules do not specify (and we have not decided expressly) whether a partial verdict may be entered on a greater offense where the jury is hung as to the lesser included offenses. Because the parties do not dispute the Court of Special Appeals's decision that retrial is barred by double jeopardy on these grounds, we assume, without deciding, that the manifest necessity analysis with regard to partial verdicts applies equally where a jury votes to acquit on a greater offense and is hung as to a lesser-included offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b544-5\">.

Under those circumstances, the trial court's decision is appealable immediately under the collateral order doctrine, <em>id. </em>at 648 n. 8, 884 A.2d at 219 n. 8 (citing <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 2041-42, 52 L.Ed.2d 651, 661-62 (1977); <em>Parrott v. State, </em>301 Md. 411, 424-25, 483 A.2d 68, 75 (1984)), which \u201ctreats as final and appealable interlocutory orders that (1) conclusively determine the disputed question; (2) resolve an important issue; (3) resolve an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action; and (4) would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>St. Joseph Medical Ctr., Inc. v. Cardiac Surgery </em>As<em>socs., P.A., </em>392 Md. 75, 86, 896 A.2d 304, 310 (2006) (quoting <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, </em>389 Md. 315, 329, 884 A.2d 1215, 1223 (2005)). Here, Fennell's motion to bar retrial due to double jeopardy may be treated properly, under the collateral order doctrine, as a motion to dismiss because the motion was filed after a status conference at which a new trial date was set to prosecute him anew on all charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b545-6\">. We note that, with respect to the three charges at issue here, the trial judge declared a <em>sua sponte </em>mistrial, in effect. Defense counsel consented \u2014 and indeed requested \u2014 a mistrial as to the two indisputably undecided charges, but requested a partial verdict (and thereby did not consent to the mistrial) as to the three charges at issue. Therefore, the manifest necessity standard applies. <em>See Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 505, 98 S.Ct. at 824, 54 L.Ed.2d at 728; <em>Caldwell, </em>164 Md.App. at 647, 884 A.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The State argued also in the Court of Special Appeals that Fennell did not object before the trial court to the declaration of a mistrial and thus the issue is not preserved for appellate review. Specifically, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>contended that, after his request for a partial verdict was denied, Fennell acquiesced in the court\u2019s decision by saying \"Okay.\u201d For purposes of review, however, defense counsel's request that the trial court \"take the three or four [verdicts] that [the jury] gave\u201d was sufficient to indicate Fennell\u2019s desired course of action \u2014 that the court enter a verdict as to the three charges indicated \u2014 and thus preserves the issue for appellate review. <em>See </em>Md. R. 4-323(c) (\"For the purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal of any other ruling or order, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\">. The Supreme Court had not decided <em>Blueford </em>at the time the intermediate appellate court decided the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">. The defendant in <em>Blueford </em>was charged with capital murder, which, under Arkansas law, contains the lesser-included offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. -U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2048, 182 L.Ed.2d at 941.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. In fact, some of the Amici in <em>Blueford </em>sought adoption of a <em>per se </em>rule requiring trial judges to take partial verdicts wherever any unanimity exists as a prerequisite to a finding of manifest necessity as to the remaining counts \u2014 in effect, requiring even states that do not permit partial verdicts in certain circumstances to accept them. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae Supporting Petitioner, <em>Blueford v. Arkansas, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2044, 182 L.Ed.2d 937 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\">. The majority of jurisdictions accepting partial verdicts are in accord with this interpretation. <em>See, e.g., Wallace </em>v. <em>Havener, </em>552 F.2d 721, 723 (6th Cir.1977) (holding that the trial judge abused his discretion in not accepting partial verdicts as to counts on which the jury indicated unanimity); <em>Daniels v. Burt, </em>895 F.Supp. 180, 184 (E.D.Mich.1995) (\u201cHad the jury indicated or even suggested that it had reached a verdict as to some of the offenses, the trial judge would have constitutionally erred in declaring a mistrial without accepting the jury\u2019s partial verdict.\u201d); <em>Sturms v. Woodland Justice Court, </em>4 Cal.App.3d 36, 84 Cal.Rptr. 69 (1970) (prohibiting retrial of a defendant as barred by double jeopardy, due to discharge of the jury \u201cwithout legal necessity,\u201d where the judge declined to enter a partial verdict after the jury indicated that it was agreed unanimously as to one count); <em>Oliver v. Justices of New York Supreme Court of New York County, </em>36 N.Y.2d 53, 364 N.Y.S.2d 874, 324 N.E.2d 348 (1974) (requiring trial judge to accept partial verdict if the jury indicated agreement on some, but not all, counts, and further deliberations would be fruitless).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">. Because it is not implicated in the present case, we need not consider the trial judge's discretion as it pertains to accepting or soliciting a partial verdict where the jury has not intimated that it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>have reached one, but rather counsel requests a partial verdict to be entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b553-5\">. For example, in <em>State v. Lewis, </em>172 N.C.App. 97, 616 S.E.2d 1, 6 (2005), the trial judge had the following colloquy with the jury after the jury indicated at the conclusion of deliberations that it could not reach a verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">THE COURT: Yesterday, at the end of the day, you didn\u2019t say that you had reached a \u2014 perhaps reached a verdict as to one case. In fact, had you reached a verdict as to one of the cases and not signed the verdict sheet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">FOREPERSON: (Nods head affirmatively.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">THE COURT: Is that still the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">FOREPERSON: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">THE COURT: So, at this particular point there is no verdict as to either case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\">FOREPERSON: Exactly.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">. The State contends that Fennell should have sought the entry of a partial verdict at that juncture, rather than waiting until the termination of jury deliberations. Although the Maryland Rules do not prohibit the entry of an interim partial verdict, we do not think that defense counsel waived a timely partial verdict request by waiting until the conclusion of the proceeding. Nothing in the Maryland Rules requires counsel to request a partial verdict at the first intimation that the jury may have reached a verdict on one or more counts, but less than all counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
