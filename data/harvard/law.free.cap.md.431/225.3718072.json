Two passers-by of significant social and religious status see the injured man, but choose to cross to the other side of the road. A third traveler of less repute, a Samaritan, comes to the man\u2019s aid, takes him to an inn, tends to him through the night, and then pays the innkeeper the next morning to continue the man\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">We do not know from the parable whether the fear of civil liability discouraged the first two passers-by from intervening. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>In modern-day Maryland, a State law known as the Good Samaritan Act seeks to remove that disincentive, particularly for individuals who have the knowledge and skills to provide useful medical assistance at an emergency, by granting those individuals immunity from liability should something go awry. In some instances that immunity extends to an entity when its personnel provide emergency aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Another source of immunity \u2014 sovereign immunity \u2014 derives from the ancient tenet that \u201cthe King can do no wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Public agencies and employees, including first responders, have long enjoyed a broad qualified immunity from liability as an aspect of sovereign or governmental immunity. A State statute, popularly known as the Fire and Rescue Act, extends similarly broad immunity to fire companies, rescue companies, and their personnel for \u201cany act or omission in the course of performing their duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">These two statutes \u2014 the one potentially applicable to a broad class of actors but focused on emergency situations, the other applicable to a narrower class but broader in the scope of the immunity it confers \u2014 provide overlapping protection to some extent. This case concerns whether one, or both, of these statutes necessarily relieves a commercial ambulance company of liability for the allegedly negligent actions of one of its employees in providing assistance to a patient when an emergency arose while the employee was in training. We hold that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\n<em>The Transport of Bryson Murray</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">On November 15, 2007, Respondent Bryson Murray,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a minor who was suffering from congestion and was having trouble breathing, was taken to Easton Memorial Hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>(\u201cEaston Memorial\u201d) in Talbot County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hospital he was fitted with an endotracheal breathing tube. Because Easton Memorial was not equipped to handle intubated children, hospital officials sought to transfer him to the pediatric intensive care unit at the Medical Center of the University of Maryland Medical System (\u201cUMMS\u201d) in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">UMMS arranged for PHI Air Medical to carry out the transport by helicopter. Present on the helicopter was a flight paramedic team that included a UMMS pediatric intensive-care nurse, a PHI flight paramedic, and a PHI flight nurse. Also present was Chris Barbour,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a paramedic employed by Petitioner TransCare<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who had been invited to ride along by the UMMS nurse (with PHI\u2019s permission) for orientation purposes. TransCare, a licensed commercial ground ambulance transport company, was under contract with UMMS to provide ground ambulance services for patients between the Medical Center and area hospitals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Barbour was a licensed emergency medical technician-paramedic.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">After the helicopter arrived at Easton Memorial, Mr. Barbour set up equipment and the team placed Bryson on the aircraft. Shortly after take-off, however, Bryson\u2019s heart rate and oxygen blood level began to drop, because, according to the allegations in the complaint, the endotracheal tube had become dislodged and was blocking his airway. Members of the flight team searched for a pediatric air mask to restore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Bryson\u2019s breathing, but were unable to locate it. The helicopter then landed at Bay Bridge Airport in Stevensville, where the flight paramedic retrieved the mask from its storage compartment and Bryson was reintubated. Bryson\u2019s cardiac activity returned to normal and the helicopter completed its trip to the Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\n<em>The Murrays\u2019 Negligence Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\n<em>Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Bryson, by his mother, Karen Murray, subsequently filed a complaint against TransCare alleging medical malpractice on the basis that its employee, Mr. Barbour, had failed to provide the requisite standard of care and that TransCare was vicariously responsible under the principle of <em>respondeat superior:</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>According to the complaint, Bryson suffered hypoxic brain injury due to alleged acts and omissions of Mr. Barbour during the helicopter transport and, as a result, is blind, deaf, and mentally disabled. The complaint did not name Mr. Barbour individually as a defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\n<em>Summary Judgment Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">TransCare moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was immune from liability under both the Good Samaritan Act and the Fire and Rescue Act. The Circuit Court for Talbot County<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was initially persuaded that there were disputes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>material fact as to TransCare\u2019s corporate relationship with the other medical providers involved and as to whether it had received a \u201cfee or compensation\u201d that would preclude application of the Good Samaritan Act. The Circuit Court also tentatively concluded that the Fire and Rescue Act did not apply to a commercial ambulance company such as TransCare. Accordingly, the Circuit Court initially denied TransCare\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on those immunity provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">TransCare thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration, submitting two affidavits that established the company\u2019s independent corporate status and described its billing practices. Following a hearing on that motion, the Circuit Court concluded that there were no remaining disputes of material fact and that TransCare was immune under both the Good Samaritan Act and the Fire and Rescue Act. It therefore granted summary judgment in favor of TransCare.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The Murrays appealed and the Court of Special Appeals reversed, holding that neither statute applied to a private, for-profit ambulance company. 203 Md.App. 172, 37 A.3d 987 (2012). TransCare petitioned this Court for certiorari. We granted the petition to determine whether either the Good Samaritan Act or the Fire and Rescue Act relieves a commercial ambulance company of civil liability for the alleged negligence of an employee committed when an emergency arises during a transfer of a patient between medical facilities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> Whether summary judgment was properly granted is a question of law; we review the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to determine whether it was legally correct. <em>Walk v. Hartford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Cas. Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 1, 14, 852 A.2d 98 (2004). Like the Circuit Court, we view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party to ascertain whether there is a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Jurgensen v. New Phx. Atl. Condo. Council of Unit Owners, </em>380 Md. 106, 114, 843 A.2d 865 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In order to assess TransCare\u2019s claims of immunity, we must construe two statutes \u2014 the Good Samaritan Act and the Fire and Rescue Act. This Court has frequently reiterated the principles that guide statutory interpretation, which we summarize as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u2022 give effect to legislative intent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u2022 look first to the \u201cordinary, plain meaning\u201d of the language</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u2022 do not add or delete language</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u2022 do not apply forced or subtle interpretations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">\u2022 keep in mind the statutory context</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u2022 consider the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">\u2022 avoid constructions inconsistent with common sense</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-13\">\u2022 presume that each section is to work harmoniously with others</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-14\"><em>See, e.g., Willis v. Montgomery County, </em>415 Md. 523, 536-37, 3 A.3d 448 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">\n<em>Whether TransCare Has Immunity under the Good Samaritan Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">\n<em>Good Samaritan Laws</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">Under the common law, there is no general duty to provide assistance to those in peril. <em>See </em>Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed.1971) \u00a7 56 at 340-43 (\u201cthe law has persistently refused to recognize the moral obligation, of common decency and common humanity, to come to the aid of another human being who is in danger ... \u201d). Moreover, under general principles of tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>law, one who voluntarily chooses to aid another owes that person a duty of care; a failure to exercise such care may result in legal liability. <em>See Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 589-90, 831 A.2d 18 (2003); <em>see also </em>57A Am.Jur.2d <em>Negligence </em>\u00a7 104 (2012); Restatement 2d of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 323, 324. This risk of potential liability led to the unsatisfactory result that health care professionals capable and willing to provide emergency medical services had (in theory, at least) a disincentive to do so. <em>See </em>Silver, <em>The Duty to Rescue: A Reexamination and Proposal, </em>26 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 423, 428 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Beginning in California in 1959,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> legislatures in every state enacted laws designed to eliminate this disincentive and to encourage medical professionals (and, often, volunteers in general) to provide emergency assistance by granting them immunity from liability for ordinary negligence. Silver, <em>supra, </em>26 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. at 427-28. The Maryland General Assembly first enacted such a statute in 1963. Chapter 65, Laws of Maryland 1963. From the outset, such laws have generally been labeled the \u201cGood Samaritan Act\u201d or \u201cGood Samaritan Law,\u201d both in Maryland and elsewhere. <em>See </em>Annotation, <em>Construction and Application of \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d Statutes, </em>68 A.L.R.4th 294 (2012); 64 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>169 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>Maryland Good Samaritan Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Pertinent to this case, the Maryland Good Samaritan Act provides immunity to specified individuals and entities from liability for ordinary negligence that occurs in connection with assistance or medical care rendered without fee or other compensation at the scene of an emergency or in transit to a medical facility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statute currently provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>(a) A person described in subsection (b) of this section is not civilly liable for any act or omission in giving any assistance or medical care, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">(1) The act or omission is not one of gross negligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">(2) The assistance or medical care is provided without fee or other compensation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">(3) The assistance or medical care is provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">(i) At the scene of an emergency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">(ii) In transit to a medical facility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">(iii) Through communications with personnel providing emergency assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">(b) Subsection (a) of this section applies to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">(1) An individual who is licensed by this State to provide medical care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">(2) A member of any State, county, municipal, or volunteer fire department, ambulance and rescue squad, or law enforcement agency, the National Ski Patrol System, or a corporate fire department responding to a call outside of its corporate premises, if the member:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">(i) Has completed an American Red Cross course in advanced first aid and has a current card showing that status;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">(ii) Has completed an equivalent of an American Red Cross course in advanced first aid, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">(iii) Is certified or licensed by this State as an emergency medical services provider;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-16\">(3) A volunteer fire department or ambulance and rescue squad whose members have immunity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-17\">(4) A corporation when its fire department personnel are immune under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>(c) An individual who is not covered otherwise by this section is not civilly liable for any act or omission in providing assistance or medical aid to a victim at the scene of an emergency, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">(1) The assistance or aid is provided in a reasonably prudent manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">(2) The assistance or aid is provided without fee or other compensation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">(3) The individual relinquishes care of the victim when someone who is licensed or certified by this State to provide medical care or services becomes available to take responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d) \u00a7 5-603.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> TransCare asserts that it has immunity directly under CJ \u00a7 5-603(b)(3) as a \u201cvolunteer fire department or ambulance and rescue squad whose members have immunity.\u201d In addition, TransCare argues that, regardless of whether CJ \u00a7 5-603(b)(3) directly confers immunity on it, it has immunity because its employee, Mr. Barbour, has immunity under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\"><em>CJ \u00a7 5-608(b)(3) </em>\u2014 Text</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">As TransCare is a commercial ambulance company, the application of CJ \u00a7 5-603(b)(3) to it depends, in part, on whether the adjective \u201cvolunteer\u201d modifies only \u201cfire department\u201d or also modifies \u201cambulance and rescue squad.\u201d If \u201cvolunteer\u201d modifies only \u201cfire department,\u201d TransCare potentially has immunity as an \u201cambulance squad\u201d (if its \u201cmembers\u201d have immunity). If \u201cvolunteer\u201d also modifies \u201cambulance and rescue squad,\u201d TransCare does not have immunity under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>provision (regardless of whether its \u201cmembers\u201d or employees have immunity). Either construction of the phrase is grammatically correct; in light of this ambiguity in meaning, we resort to the statute\u2019s legislative history to discern its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><em>CJ \u00a7 5-603(b)(3) </em>\u2014 Legislative <em>history</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">What is now CJ \u00a7 5 \u2014 603(b)(3) was added to the Good Samaritan Act in 1979. Chapter 301, Laws of Maryland 1979.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To place it in context, however, we must briefly describe the history of the Good Samaritan Act leading up to that amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">When the General Assembly first enacted the Good Samaritan Act in 1963, the statute applied only to physicians who provided free medical assistance at the scene of an accident.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The following year, the statute was amended to expand its protection beyond physicians to include \u201cmembers of volunteer ambulance and rescue squads ... organized and operated as a non-profit group.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In 1969, the provision concerning mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>bers of ambulance and rescue squads was amended to include \u201cmembers or employees\u201d of fire departments; at the same time, the adjective \u201cvolunteer\u201d was deleted. Thus, the immunity extended to \u201cmembers or employees of fire departments or ambulance and rescue squads ... organized and operated as a nonprofit group.\u201d Chapter 616, Laws of Maryland 1969. As is evident, although the word \u201cvolunteer\u201d had been eliminated by the 1969 amendment, the statute did not apply to members or employees of for-profit organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">In 1970, in the course of recodifying the statute, the Legislature returned the adjective \u201cvolunteer\u201d to the statute. Chapter 736, Laws of Maryland 1970.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the Good Samaritan Act was amended in other respects over the next few years, the language concerning members of ambulance and rescue squads was unaffected until 1976.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Despite the insertion, deletion, and re-insertion of the word \u201cvolunteer\u201d before \u201cambulance and rescue squads,\u201d it remained clear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>statute did not extend to members or employees of for-profit organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">In 1976, the Good Samaritan Act was revised in response to advice from the Attorney General\u2019s Office that an amendment of the Act was necessary to ensure that functions carried out under the new State Emergency Medical System were covered by the Good Samaritan Act. <em>See </em>Letter of Assistant Attorney General Paul Walter to R. Adams Cowley, M.D. (October 24, 1974). That advice did not suggest that the Act needed to be extended to commercial ambulance companies or other for-profit entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The 1976 revision encompassed the entire statute, including the provision concerning members of fire departments and ambulance and rescue squads. In particular, the description of the individuals covered by immunity in that provision was changed from \u201c[tjhe members of any fire department or volunteer ambulance and rescue squads ...\u201d to \u201c[a] member of any State, county, municipal, or volunteer fire department, ambulance and rescue squad ...\u201d Chapters 558, 689, Laws of Maryland 1976. The shifting of the adjective \u201cvolunteer\u201d within the introductory phrase, however, did not signify an indirect expansion of the immunity provision to members of commercial entities. Rather, it simply ensured that the adjective \u201cvolunteer,\u201d together with the adjectives denoting government entities, would apply to fire departments as well as ambulance and rescue squads. <em>See Tatum v. Gigliotti, </em>321 Md. 623, 630, 583 A.2d 1062 (1991) (describing the provision as providing immunity for \u201cmembers of fire departments and ambulance and rescue squads which may be state, county or municipal, as well as volunteer\u201d). That conclusion is confirmed by one of the drafters of the 1976 bill, who told the Legislature that the language of the provision concerning members of fire departments and ambulance and rescue squads was meant simply to restate the existing immunity without substantive change. <em>See </em>Testimony of William E. Hathaway (January 29, 1976) (\u201cThis paragraph provides the same coverage to firemen, ambulance and rescue personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>and police as is presently provided in [the Good Samaritan Act]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The extension of immunity to the entities themselves in addition to their members \u2014 what is now CJ \u00a7 5-603(b)(3)\u2014 was added to this provision three years later.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Chapter 301, Laws of Maryland 1979. At that time, the statute provided immunity for members of \u201cany State, county, municipal or volunteer fire department, ambulance and rescue squad\u201d who satisfied certain requirements. Maryland Code, Article 43, \u00a7 132(b) (1971 Repl.Vol., 1978 Supp.). As indicated above, this provision had never applied to members of a commercial entity. The Anne Arundel County government requested a bill, which originally would have applied only in Anne Arundel County, to extend that immunity to the organization of which the immune individuals were <em>members </em>\u2014 i.e., so that \u201ca volunteer fire department or ambulance and rescue squad has the same immunity as its members.\u201d Senate Bill 1031 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">A submission to the Legislature by the Anne Arundel County Executive\u2019s office explained the need for the amendment. It indicated that the County had agreed to provide legal representation for all members of volunteer fire departments \u201cand ambulance/rescue squads\u201d in the county. <em>See </em>Legislation Submitted by the Anne Arundel County Executive, 1979 General Assembly, copy in legislative file for Senate Bill 1031 (1979). It recounted a recent case in which a volunteer fire department had been named as a defendant in a lawsuit in addition to the firefighter. The County noted that, while the firefighter was clearly immune under the Good Samaritan Act, \u201c[t]he <em>volunteer </em>fire department, however, is a private <em>nonprofit </em>corporation which does not appear to have the statutory immunity which is bestowed upon its constituent members. We believe the absence of this protection for <em>the volunteer unit </em>is not in keeping with the spirit and rationale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>[the Good Samaritan Act] since it has the net effect of discouraging the active participation of <em>these units </em>in emergency situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The bill\u2019s geographical limitation to Anne Arundel County was ultimately eliminated, making the amendment applicable statewide. No amendment was made to the substantive language concerning the types of organizations covered by the immunity. The bill was enacted and codified at that time in Article 43, \u00a7 132(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">There is no indication in the language of the 1979 amendment or its legislative history of any intent to extend this protection to commercial ambulance companies. The amendment keyed the immunity of a \u201cvolunteer fire department or ambulance and rescue squad\u201d to the immunity of its \u201cmembers\u201d \u2014 an odd term to use if the amendment encompassed the employees of a company with stockholders.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> While the example given by the county government that proposed the amendment involved a volunteer fire department, it stated that it had agreed to provide legal representation for the members of \u201cambulance/rescue squads\u201d and its purpose for including those organizations in the bill was the same as stated for the volunteer fire department that had been sued. There is no suggestion in these materials that the county had decided to provide free legal representation to the employees of commercial ambulance companies or was seeking to confer a benefit on those entities. Nor is there any discussion of the potential liability of commercial ambulance companies. It is clear that the legislation was concerned with expanding immunity to volunteer, nonprofit entities to remove a disincentive to the provision of their emergency services. Consistent with this history, a contemporaneous opinion of the Attorney General construed the term \u201cvolunteer\u201d in the statute to modify \u201cambulance and rescue squad.\u201d 64 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>175, 176 (1979) (concluding that \u201cthe Community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Rescue Service and its members are covered under \u00a7 132(b) as a Volunteer\u2019 ... ambulance and rescue squad\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">After 1979, the Good Samaritan Act was amended in minor substantive respects not pertinent to this case<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and was recodified as part of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article in 1982.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that TransCare, as a for-profit ambulance company, does not have immunity under CJ \u00a7 5-603(b)(3) regardless of whether Mr. Barbour is personally covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\n<em>Whether TransCare as Employer Necessarily Has Same Immunity as its Employee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">TransCare makes a broader argument for immunity under the Good Samaritan Act, untethered to any of the provisions that specifically confer immunity on corporations or other organizations. It asserts that, given that its liability is predicated on the actions of its employee, Mr. Barbour, it cannot be vicariously liable if Mr. Barbour is personally immune under the Good Samaritan Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>TransCare\u2019s argument is contrary to the general rule on the relationship of employer immunity to that of an employee. As this Court recently stated: \u201cThe principal in an agency relationship is not entitled to receive immunity simply because the agent is entitled to receive immunity; the principal must establish an independent basis to receive the benefit of an immunity shield---- [UJnless there is an independent source of immunity for the employer or principal, the cause of action premised on vicarious liability can be brought even if the employee or agent is entitled to immunity.\u201d <em>D\u2019Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 605-07, 36 A.3d 941 (2012); <em>see also James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 332, 418 A.2d 1173 (1980)(\u201cAs a general rule ... the master remains liable for the servant\u2019s conduct even though the servant is himself not liable because of a personal immunity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">TransCare attempts to distinguish D\u2019Aoust on the basis that it concerned common law immunity rather than statutory immunity. But the Court in D\u2019Aoust specifically noted that its conclusion applied \u201cto the concept of immunity generally as it relates to causes of action based on vicarious liability.\u201d <em>D\u2019Aoust, </em>424 Md. at 607, 36 A.3d 941. Moreover, in establishing immunity for individuals by statute, the General Assembly may well contemplate that the individual\u2019s employer is liable for that individual\u2019s conduct. For example, in the Maryland Tort Claims Act, governmental entities may be liable for the negligent actions of an employee even though the Legislature has conferred immunity on the individual employee. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, State Government Article, \u00a7 12-101 <em>et. seq.; </em>CJ \u00a7 5-522. Indeed, if, as a general principle, an employee\u2019s immunity under the statute relieved the employer of liability, two provisions of the statute that explicitly confer immunity on specified organizations when the members or personnel of the organization have immunity \u2014 CJ \u00a7 5-603(b)(3) and (b)(4)\u2014 would be unnecessary. Thus, we are persuaded that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>employer does not necessarily have immunity under the Act simply because its employee has immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">TransCare is not a volunteer ambulance and rescue squad and therefore does not qualify for immunity under CJ \u00a7 5-603(b)(3). Nor is it shielded from liability under the Act for the alleged negligence of Mr. Barbour, regardless of whether he individually has immunity under the statute.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACU\">\n<em>Whether TransCare Has Immunity under the Fire and Rescue Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\"><em>Fire and Rescue Act </em>\u2014 Text</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Unlike the Good Samaritan Act, the Fire and Rescue Act confers a broad immunity on certain organizations without predicating that immunity on the immunity of the organization\u2019s members or employees. If the statute applies, it provides immunity for both the organization and its personnel. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except for any willful or grossly negligent act, a fire company or rescue company, and the personnel of a fire company or rescue company, are immune from civil liability for any act or omission in the course of performing their duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">(b) (1) The immunity granted by this section is waived with respect to actions to recover damages for the negligent operation of a motor vehicle to the following extent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">(i) For a self-insured fire company or rescue company, liability shall extend up to the minimum insurance limits imposed by \u00a7 17-103 of the Transportation Article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>(ii) For a fire company or rescue company insured by an insurer authorized to issue insurance policies in this State, liability shall extend up to the maximum limit of any basic vehicle liability insurance policy it has in effect, exclusive of excess liability coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">(2) The immunity granted by this section is not waived and may be raised as a defense as to any amount of damages claimed above the limits in this subsection and as to any other action for damages not involving the negligent operation of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">CJ \u00a7 5-604. The statute thus provides a broad immunity from civil liability for ordinary negligence \u2014 with a limited exception related to negligent operation of a motor vehicle\u2014 for fire and rescue companies and their personnel. This Court has previously determined that the Fire and Rescue Act was intended to immunize all fire and rescue companies and their personnel: \u201cThe statute clearly and unequivocally refers to fire or rescue companies; there is no differentiation at all between public and private companies.\u201d <em>Mayor and City Council v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 132, 756 A.2d 987 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Whether the statute provides immunity to TransCare in this case depends on whether TransCare is properly characterized as a private \u201cfire or rescue company\u201d \u2014 or, more precisely, a private \u201crescue company,\u201d as TransCare makes no pretension of being a fire company. There is no definition of that phrase in the statute, nor is its plain meaning in this context self-evident. We look to the history of the statute, as well as the Legislature\u2019s creation of similar immunities in other statutes, to discern the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in establishing this broad immunity. We also consider related statutes and regulations concerning rescue companies and commercial ambulance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>Fire and Rescue Act </em>\u2014 History</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Although the Fire and Rescue Act provides protection similar to that provided by the Good Samaritan Act, it has a separate lineage. The legislative record reveals that the Fire and Rescue Act was intended to confer a governmental-like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>immunity on volunteer fire departments and entities performing similar functions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Under the common law, state and local governments, and their agencies, have sovereign or governmental immunity.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>See Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 492, 632 A.2d 753 (1993). For various policy reasons, the General Assembly may choose to waive that immunity by statute, usually to a limited extent and sometimes in conjunction with conferring immunity on State actors or employees.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> On occasion, a question arises as to whether other organizations that serve a public purpose also partake of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In 1983, the Court of Special Appeals considered whether a volunteer fire department was protected by governmental immunities against claims related to allegedly negligent efforts to extinguish a fire. <em>Utica Mutual Ins. Co. v. Gaithersburg Wash. Grove Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>53 Md.App. 589, 455 A.2d 987, <em>cert. denied, </em>296 Md. 224 (1983). The intermediate appellate court answered the question in the negative, finding that there was insufficient evidence in the record that the particular volunteer fire department qualified as a government entity. The court further held that, in any event, the members of the volunteer fire department were not public officials, and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>were not entitled to public official or governmental immunity from negligence claims.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Similarly, other courts have held that a non-profit rescue squad in Maryland is a private entity and not a State actor. <em>Krieger v. Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad, </em>599 F.Supp. 770, 775 (D.Md.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>792 F.2d 139 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The day after the <em>Utica Mutual </em>opinion was released, a state senator asked legislative staff to draft a bill conferring immunity on volunteer firefighters.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The initial version of the bill simply extended local government immunity to volunteer fire companies. As the bill progressed through the Legislature it was rewritten to also include within its scope all fire companies,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> as well as \u201crescue\u201d companies and the personnel of fire companies and rescue companies. The revision also elaborated on the bill\u2019s broad immunity from liability for ordinary negligence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In particular, it applied to \u201cany act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>omission [of a fire or rescue company or its personnel] in the course of performing their duties\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and stated that the immunity trumped other potentially applicable laws (\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law ... \u201d). Proponents of the bill had expressed the concern that, in light of the <em>Utica Mutual </em>decision, \u201cfew people would volunteer to serve the fire departments, if they realized that they could be subject to liability for their acts.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Hearing Summary for Senate Bill 731 (March 30, 1983). As enacted, the bill resembled the broad immunity applicable to governmental entities \u2014 not surprising in light of the bill\u2019s purpose to extend (or, in the view of some, restore) such immunity for volunteer fire departments and entities performing similar public functions. Chapter 546, Laws of Maryland 1983. Apart from recodification, the statute remains unchanged since its original passage.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">As enacted in 1983, the statute also carved out an exception to the broad immunity that it recognized \u2014 an exception for liability arising from the negligent operation of a motor vehicle. See CJ \u00a7 5-604(b). This exception was characterized as a \u201cwaiver\u201d of immunity<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and resembled similar exceptions, or waivers, that the Legislature had contemporaneously applied to governmental immunities and immunities related to the provision of emergency services. In particular, the General Assembly had codified or tweaked various governmental-type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>immunities and, at the same time, carved out exceptions or waivers as to each of those immunities for negligent operation of a motor vehicle. <em>See, e.g., </em>CJ \u00a7 5-507 (codifying immunity of municipal officials and creating a limited exception for motor vehicle torts up to the limits of motor vehicle insurance) <footnotemark>36</footnotemark>; CJ \u00a7 5-524 (creating exception to governmental or sovereign immunity for negligent use of a vehicle in government service up to the limits of motor vehicle insurance)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark>; CJ \u00a7 5-511 (codifying immunity of officials of various governmental entities and creating exception related to motor vehicle insurance limits)<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>; CJ \u00a7 5-639 (establishing immunity for owners of \u201cemergency vehicles\u201d providing \u201cemergency service\u201d and creating exception related to motor vehicle insurance limits).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">It is quite evident that the Fire and Rescue Act was meant to complement or replicate governmental immunity \u2014 an immunity that at least some believed that volunteer fire companies and similar entities had already enjoyed. Even the Court of Special Appeals in its <em>Utica Mutual </em>decision had not ruled out the application of official immunity to volunteer fire departments \u2014 it simply found that there was insufficient evidence in that case to establish the governmental nature of the volunteer fire department in question and also held that the volunteer firefighters did not qualify as public officials entitled to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\n<em>\u201cRescue Company \u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The term \u201crescue\u201d generally connotes a crisis or emergency. A \u201crescue company\u201d is presumably engaged in activities that alleviate a crisis or emergency. <em>See Krieger v. Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad, supra, </em>599 F.Supp. at 772-73 (describing local rescue squad providing \u201crescue, ambulance, fire-fighting support, and emergency medical services\u201d that \u201cshows up primarily to care for, rescue and transport the injured\u201d). There are a number of entities in Maryland, generally in rural areas, that refer to themselves as a \u201crescue squad\u201d or \u201crescue company,\u201d and that operate ambulances that respond to emergency situations.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Other parts of the Maryland Code suggest that the phrases \u201crescue company\u201d or \u201crescue squad\u201d typically refer to entities that (even if formally private) perform a public function in responding to crises or emergencies and would not normally include a commercial ambulance transport company. For example, \u201crescue squads\u201d are authorized to enter into mutual aid agreements with contiguous states or similar entities in those states, as well as with the federal government. Maryland Code, Public Safety Article (\u201cPS\u201d), \u00a7\u00a7 7-101(b), 7-103 (authorizing such agreements by a \u201cfire, rescue, or emergency medical services entity\u201d which, by definition, include \u201crescue squads\u201d).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Such mutual aid agreements contemplate plans to share equipment, personnel, and services necessary to respond to fires and other emergency situations. PS \u00a7 7-101(c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Moreover, \u201cnecessary expenditures\u201d arising out of such agreements are to be \u201cmade out of any appropriations usually available\u201d to the entity.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> PS \u00a7 7-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>Whether a commercial ambulance company may be a \u201crescue company\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">TransCare is a commercial ambulance company. According to the testimony of one of its employees, its business generally involves transporting patients from nursing homes to hospitals, from home to a dialysis center, or \u201cwherever the patient needs to go, they take them.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> It became involved in the transport of Bryson Murray in this case as a result of its contract with UMMS to provide ground transportation services between area hospitals for UMMS patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Commercial ambulance companies in Maryland are licensed and regulated by the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems (\u201cMIEMSS\u201d). Maryland Code, Education Article (\u201cED\u201d), \u00a7 13-515. There is no mention in the statute of a licensing requirement for \u201crescue companies\u201d or \u201crescue squads.\u201d Rather, specifically excepted from this regulation are ambulance services provided by, or operated under, the jurisdiction of State or local government or volunteer fire or rescue companies. ED \u00a7 13 \u2014 515(a)(3)(ii); COMAR 30.09.03.04.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In parsing the jurisdiction of MIEMSS over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>commercial ambulance services under this regulatory regime, the Attorney General noted that \u201cnearly all <em>commercial </em>ambulance transports are considered non-emergency.\u201d 80 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>118, 120 (1995) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">It is also notable that the statute governing commercial ambulance companies requires that each company maintain commercial general liability insurance coverage in the amount of at least $1 million \u2014 in addition to motor vehicle insurance and other insurance \u2014 to provide payment for bodily injuries, death, and property damage \u201cresulting from any cause for which the commercial ambulance service is liable.\u201d ED \u00a7 13-515(d)(2); <em>see also </em>COMAR 30.09.04.06B. It is not clear why a commercial ambulance company would be required to maintain such coverage if it automatically enjoyed general immunity \u201cfrom civil liability for any act or omission in the course of performing [its] duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">TransCare asserts that, as an ambulance company that may provide emergency medical services, it necessarily qualifies as a \u201crescue company\u201d and that it is therefore entitled to the broad, governmental-type immunity provided by the Fire and Rescue Act for \u201cany act or omission in the course of performing their duties.\u201d Under this view, TransCare and its employees would apparently enjoy this broad immunity from liability for ordinary negligence in their normal commercial activities, with a limited exception related to motor vehicles. Indeed, the breadth of its immunity would exceed that of State or local agencies, for which the Legislature has enacted limited waivers of sovereign immunity for ordinary negligence that are not restricted to automobile accidents. We are loath to infer, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the absence of a clearer statement of legislative intent, that the General Assembly meant to bestow such a benefit on a commercial enterprise generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">This is not to say that a commercial ambulance company may not qualify as a \u201crescue company\u201d in particular circumstances. Unlike the Good Samaritan Act, the Fire and Rescue Act is not limited to \u201cvolunteer\u201d entities. For example, one might imagine a situation in which a local government has privatized emergency services or has otherwise enlisted commercial entities as first responders.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In this case, the Circuit Court held that TransCare qualified as a \u201crescue company\u201d without any evidence that the company provides such emergency services in Maryland or that it was functioning as a first responder in the particular circumstances of this case. Indeed, the evidence available to the Circuit Court indicated that TransCare\u2019s employee was present for training purposes related to its contract to provide inter-facility transports for UMMS patients. Accordingly, it was an error to grant TransCare\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of the Fire and Rescue Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">While we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the Circuit Court\u2019s decision should be reversed, unlike the intermediate appellate court,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> we do not rule out the possibility that a commercial ambulance company could establish that it performs the function of a \u201crescue company.\u201d Thus, if a commercial ambulance company like TransCare could demonstrate, on the basis of undisputed facts, that it functioned as a rescue company in particular circumstances, it would be entitled to summary judgment under the Act. Of course, we express no opinion on whether TransCare will be able to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">For the reasons stated above, a commercial ambulance company such as TransCare does not qualify for immunity under the Good Samaritan Act, regardless of whether the company\u2019s employee may qualify for immunity under the statute. Moreover, in the circumstances of this case, Trans-Care has not demonstrated it functioned as a \u201crescue company\u201d that has the broad immunity from liability provided by the Fire and Rescue Act. Accordingly, TransCare was not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of statutory immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals Affirmed.

As TransCare concedes, neither of those decisions expressly addresses its theory that an employer necessarily has immunity under the Good Samaritan Act if its employee has immunity. <em>Chase v.

Accordingly, we need not determine issues related to other conditions for immunity under the Good Samaritan <em>Act </em>\u2014 i.e., whether UMMS\u2019s payments to TransCare or Mr. Barbour\u2019s salary constituted a \u201cfee or other compensation\" that would negate immunity or whether a \"transit to a medical facility\u201d covered by the Act must occur in response to an emergency. (Nor is there any need to determine whether there was gross negligence that would preclude application of the Act; in any event, the Murrays apparently did not allege gross negligence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\">. The legislative history of the statute was first reviewed by this Court in some detail in WSSC <em>v.

The court noted, however, that volunteer firefighters providing emergency assistance or medical care would potentially have immunity under the Good Samaritan Act, which was then codified at CJ \u00a7 5-309. 53 Md.App. at 595 n. 5, 455 A.2d 987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\">. The Court of Special Appeals opinion mistakenly merges the legislative histories of the Fire and Rescue Act and the Good Samaritan Act, suggesting that the Fire and Rescue Act was first enacted in 1964 and describing it as an offshoot of the Good Samaritan Act. <em>See </em>203 Md.App. at 214-16 &amp; n. 19, 37 A.3d 987. In fact, while the protections from liability provided by the two statutes overlap to some degree, their origins are quite distinct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">. In <em>Mayor and City Council v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 123, 756 A.2d 987 (2000), this Court concluded that the revision of the bill broadened its reach to include \u201cmunicipal fire and rescue departments and their employees, as well as to volunteer fire and rescue companies and their employees.\u201d Similarly, the Attorney General concluded that it would cover an ambulance service run by volunteer firefighters that collected a stipend to cover expenses. <em>Opinion of the Attorney General, </em>No. 87-055 (November 17, 1987) (unpublished), 1987 Md AG LEXIS 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\">. The immunity was clearly intended to be broader in scope than that provided by the Good Samaritan Act, which only covered the provision of emergency assistance and medical care and would not, apparently in the appellate court\u2019s view in <em>TJtica Mutual, </em>extend to firefighting. <em>See Opinion of the Attorney General, </em>No. 87-055 (November 17, 1987) (unpublished), 1987 Md AG LEXIS 4 at *8 n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b277-5\">. The reference to the performance of \u201cduties/' instead of \"during the course of employment,\u201d suggests the performance of a public function and echoes language used in statutes concerning governmental immunity. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 5-522(b)(referring to \"scope of public duties\u201d in defining immunity under Maryland Tort Claims Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\">.

The characterization of this exception as a \"waiver\u201d \u2014 as opposed to simply part of the definition of the immunity conferred by the statute\u2014 is consistent with the notion that the immunity was otherwise all-encompassing and similar to a governmental immunity that pre-exists exceptions created by legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b278-5\">.
