The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the convictions. The petitioner, in this Court, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his felony animal cruelty conviction, and claims that his attorney\u2019s failure, after the close of all evidence, to renew the motion for judgment of acquittal, made at the end of the State\u2019s case, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. He thus concludes that a reversal of his conviction is required. We granted his petition for writ of certiorari to consider these issues. For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\n<em>FACTUAL HISTORY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In July 2004, fifteen-year-old Daniel Sims was stabbed in the back with a five-inch knife. Sims reported the stabbing to the Baltimore County police, naming and describing the petitioner, Tony Lamont Haile, as his assailant. Baltimore County Police Officer Timothy Bowman was dispatched to the petitioner\u2019s aunt\u2019s house and, while speaking with said aunt at her house, spotted the petitioner, who, upon discovering Officer Bowman\u2019s presence, fled, and continued to do so, despite the officer\u2019s explicit orders to stop. K-9 Officer Christopher Davies and Bennie, his canine, who responded to Officer Bowman\u2019s call for back-up, discovered the petitioner hiding in the backyard of a private residence, with his hands obscured in his waistband. Since the weapon used to stab Mr. Sims had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>not been recovered, Officer Davies ordered the petitioner to come out of the yard with his hands up, warning him that Bennie, the canine, would be released if he did not comply. When the petitioner refused to show his hands and remained in a position that obscured his left hand, Officer Davies again instructed the petitioner to show his hands and reiterated to the petitioner that Bennie would be released if he faded to comply. The petitioner continued to refuse to show his hands and resisted the attempts of another officer, who had arrived on the scene, to take him into custody, whereupon Officer Davies cut Bennie loose, after shouting, \u201cPolice canine, show me your hands or I\u2019ll cut the dog loose.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The canine was trained to use a \u201cbite and hold\u201d technique: it would bite down once to apprehend a suspect, and maintain its grip, and would release its hold only when the suspect has complied with the officer\u2019s instructions. Using this technique, Bennie, the canine, seized the petitioner by his upper left arm. In response, in addition to struggling, the petitioner struck Bennie repeatedly on its head, inflicting a half-inch wide cut above its right eye, and causing the canine to release its grip. Subsequently, the petitioner attempted to escape over a fence, and Officer Davies ordered Bennie to seize him again. This time, the canine took hold of the petitioner\u2019s left side. Undeterred, the petitioner continued to scale the fence, so Officer Davies ordered Bennie to release its grip, to prevent the petitioner from causing it any further injury in his attempt to escape. The petitioner was apprehended by officers on the other side of the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, counsel for the petitioner moved for judgment of acquittal. She argued that the injuries to the dog were inflicted in self-defense. The trial court denied this motion, ruling that the issue of self-defense was a matter for the jury. In his case, the petitioner testified that it was dark on the night in question, that he did not initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>realize he was being pursued by the police, and that he only fled because he assumed he was being chased by a gang member, with whom he had previously had trouble. He also testified that, although he did try to shake Bennie off, he did not recall actually striking him. Defense counsel did not move, or renew the motion, for judgment of acquittal at the close of all evidence. The jury convicted the petitioner of first-degree assault for stabbing Daniel Sims, and aggravated cruelty to an animal for the injury he inflicted upon Bennie. The petitioner was sentenced to consecutive terms of twenty and three years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The petitioner appealed his convictions to the Court of Special Appeals. In that court, he challenged, <em>inter alia</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his conviction for first degree assault, as well as the effectiveness of the assistance rendered by his defense counsel. With respect to the latter, he focused on her failure to move for judgment of acquittal at the close of all evidence. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the convictions in an unreported opinion. It declined to consider the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, because, it concluded, the evidence at trial supported the petitioner\u2019s convictions for both the assault and the cruelty counts. We granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for certiorari, <em>Haile v. State, </em>396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006), to consider the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cWas petitioner denied his right to effective assistance of counsel where his trial attorney failed to renew the motion for judgment of acquittal and the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction of aggravated cruelty to animals?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>In the interest of clarity, we will reframe the issue, addressing it as two questions: whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to sustain the petitioner\u2019s conviction for aggravated cruelty to animals, and whether the petitioner\u2019s trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to renew, at the close of all of the evidence, a motion for judgment of acquittal made at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We shall answer the first question in the negative, and hold that there was sufficient evidence to convict the petitioner of aggravated cruelty to animals. Since the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is entirely dependent on his sufficiency claim, we need not reach the second question. Nevertheless, we shall exercise our discretion to discuss it, <em>see </em>Rule 8-131(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> concluding that we should decline to hold, based only on an argument, and an unquantifiable possibility, that the evidence presented by the State may have fallen short of sufficiency, that counsel\u2019s failure to renew a motion for judgment of acquittal automatically renders that assistance ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The petitioner first argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction for aggravated cruelty to animals under Maryland Code (2002, 2012 RepLVol.) \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>section prohibits a person, \u201cexcept in the case of self-defense,\u201d from \u201cintentionally inflict[ing] bodily harm, permanent disability, or death on an animal owned or used by a law enforcement unit.\u201d His argument rests on three premises: first, that \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) required the State to prove, which it did not do, that he had the specific intent to inflict bodily harm on the canine; second, that \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) prohibits only serious bodily harm, a threshold which the injury to the canine in this case did not meet; and third, that, in any event, he struck the canine in self-defense, an enumerated exception to \u00a7 10-606(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">With regard to the first premise, his specific intent argument, the petitioner posits that it follows from the fact that \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) allows the intentional infliction of bodily harm upon an animal owned or used by a law enforcement unit in cases of self-defense, that the State is required, by that section, to prove that one accused under the statute possesses not simply a general intent to strike the animal, but the specific intent to inflict bodily harm upon it. In support of this argument, the petitioner, noting the scarcity of cases addressing the intent necessary for conviction under \u00a7 10-606(a)(3), relies on CL \u00a7 3-202(a)(l), Maryland\u2019s first degree assault statute, the language of which, \u201c[a] person may not intentionally cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury to another,\u201d he maintains, is similar to the language of \u00a7 10-606(a)(3). He asks this Court to look to the case law interpreting that statute. Accordingly, the petitioner cites to <em>Chilcoat v. State, </em>in which the Court of Special Appeals, referencing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 239, 772 A.2d 283, 301 (2001), held that first degree assault is a specific intent crime. 155 Md.App. 394, 403, 843 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>A.2d 240, 246 (2004). The petitioner submits that the same conclusion applies to the crime of aggravated assault on animals. Critical to his analysis is <em>Chen v. State, </em>370 Md. 99, 803 A.2d 518 (2002). There, this Court explained the distinction between general intent crimes and specific intent crimes, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201c \u2018A specific intent is not simply the intent to do the immediate act but embraces the requirement that the mind be conscious of a more remote purpose or design which shall eventuate from the doing of the immediate act. Though assault implies only the general intent to strike the blow, assault with intent to murder, rob, rape or maim requires a fully formed and conscious purpose that those further consequences shall flow from the doing of the immediate act. To break and enter requires a mere general intent but to commit burglary requires the additional specific intent of committing a felony after the entry has been made. A trespassory taking requires a mere general intent but larceny (or robbery) requires the specific animus furandi or deliberate purpose of depriving the owner permanently of the stolen goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cThe larger class \u201cspecific intent\u201d includes such other members as 1) assault with intent to murder, 2) assault with intent to rape, 3) assault with intent to rob, 4) assault with intent to maim, 5) burglary, 6) larceny, 7) robbery and 8) the specific-intent-to-inflict-grievous-bodily-harm variety of murder. Each of these requires not simply the general intent to do the immediate act with no particular, clear or undifferentiated end in mind, but the additional deliberate and conscious purpose or design of accomplishing a very specific and more remote result.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\"><em>Id., </em>370 Md. 99, 110 n. 5, 803 A.2d 518, 524 n. 5 (quoting <em>Harris v. State, </em>353 Md. 596, 603-04, 728 A.2d 180, 183 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Applying this analysis to \u00a7 10-606(a)(3), the petitioner concludes that its language, prohibiting the \u201cintentional!] infliction of] bodily harm, permanent disability, or death\u201d on a police dog, required the State to prove more than that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>perpetrator possessed a general intent to strike the dog, as his actions demonstrated; it required proof, also, that the perpetrator specifically intended to inflict bodily harm upon the dog. The evidence presented at trial, the petitioner submits, fell short of this requirement, because it did not prove the latter intent. This is so, he explains, because the evidence demonstrated only that the petitioner \u201cstruck the dog not with the intent to injure the dog but in order to get the dog to remove its teeth from [his] flesh. As soon as the dog released Mr. Haile, Mr. Haile ran from the dog showing further that his actions toward the dog were for the purpose of defending and protecting himself.\u201d The petitioner thus concludes that the State failed to prove that the petitioner possessed the specific intent required by \u00a7 10-606(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The petitioner\u2019s next assertion, in support of his insufficiency of the evidence argument, is that the language of \u00a7 10-606(a)(3), barring the infliction of \u201cbodily harm\u201d to a police canine, \u201cmust mean serious bodily harm, not all harm no matter how minor it may be.\u201d The petitioner finds support for this argument in the purpose paragraph of H.B. 711. <em>See </em>1999 Md. Laws Ch. 448 (H.B.711). There, the Legislature stated that its purpose in enacting the bill was to prohibit persons \u201cfrom inflicting <em>certain injuries, </em>disability, or death on animals used by law enforcement units under certain circumstances.... \u201d Emphasizing the words, \u201ccertain injuries\u201d, the petitioner reasons that this language clearly demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent to prohibit \u201csomething less than any and all injuries.\u201d In addition, the petitioner\u2019s conclusion, that this \u201csomething less\u201d must only constitute \u201cserious injuries\u201d, is premised on the enumeration of injuries in \u00a7 10-606(a)(3), and on the statutory construction doctrine, <em>ejusdem generis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We explained that doctrine in <em>In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. 186, 190, 634 A.2d 53, 55-56 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\u201c[W]hen general words in a statute follow the designation of particular things or classes of subjects or persons, the general words will usually be construed to include only those things or persons of the same class or general nature as those specifically mentioned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>(quoting <em>Giant of Md. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>274 Md. 158, 167, 334 A.2d 107, 113 (1975)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The petitioner notes that \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) generally prohibits the intentional infliction of \u201cbodily harm\u201d and, more specifically, the intentional infliction of \u201cpermanent disability or death on an animal owned or used by a law enforcement unit.\u201d Applying the doctrine to \u00a7 10 \u2014 606(a)(3), he asservates that \u201cbodily harm\u201d, as defined by the statute, cannot refer to all categories of bodily harm, including negligible and de minimis harm, but, instead, is limited to serious bodily harm, because that is the only category of harm that falls within the same class of severity as the other types of harm prohibited by \u00a7 10~606(a), namely, \u201cintentionally mutilat[ing], torturfing], cruelly beat[ing], or cruelly killfing] an animal.\u201d Taken together, the petitioner asserts that the types of harm in \u00a7 10-606(a) demonstrate, in keeping with the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>that \u00a7 10-606(a)(3)\u2019s general prohibition against intentional infliction of \u201cbodily harm\u201d must contemplate only the kind of harm that is as serious as mutilation, torture, or any other cruel actions that could, or do, inflict permanent disability or death on law enforcement animals. He thus submits, even assuming that the petitioner did possess the specific intent required by \u00a7 10-606(a)(3), that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient because the dog\u2019s injury was insignificant and, therefore, did not fall within the ambit of \u00a7 10-606(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Because this Court could, and should, find, on the basis of his prior arguments, that the evidence proffered at trial was insufficient, the petitioner explains that it is unnecessary for us to reach the issue of self-defense in this case. He submits, however, that the insufficiency of the evidence presented at trial is further demonstrated by the fact that he acted in self-defense. This is so, he explains, because the dog provoked his response by biting him, to which he simply responded by striking the canine with only the amount of force that was reasonably necessary to cause it to release him.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The petitioner\u2019s second main argument addresses the effectiveness of his trial counsel\u2019s representation. Applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693 (1984), the petitioner asserts that his counsel\u2019s failure, after presenting the defense case, to move for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-324,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> deprived him of his right to effective assistance of counsel. This is so, he submits, because although, as he has demonstrated, the evidence presented by the State was insufficient to sustain his conviction under \u00a7 10 \u2014 606(a)(3), his counsel, by failing to renew the motion for judgment of acquittal made at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, but withdrawn when he presented his case, waived the issue of legal insufficiency on appeal. He thus urges us to hold that he was prejudiced by this ineffective representation, and, therefore, to reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The State argues, as a threshold matter, that this Court should decline to address the petitioner\u2019s sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>evidence challenge. It explains that the claim, as the petitioner concedes, was not preserved for review, because of defense counsel\u2019s failure to renew her motion for judgment of acquittal. Unlike the petitioner, however, the State urges this Court to decline to hold that a failure to move for judgment of acquittal, even where the evidence is insufficient, necessarily constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. It relies on Maryland Rule 4-324 and Maryland Code (2001) \u00a7 6-104 of the Criminal Procedure Article<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u201cCP\u201d) which, it notes, together, preclude review of a sufficiency of the evidence claim where a defendant fails to move for judgment of acquittal at the close of all evidence. <em>Ennis v. State, </em>306 Md. 579, 585, 510 A.2d 573, 576 (1986). To hold as the petitioner urges would, in effect, the State argues, allow the petitioner\u2019s sufficiency claim to proceed on appeal, and, thus, would effectively render Rule 4-324 and CP \u00a7 6-104 surplusage, since there would be no need for the requirement, articulated in those provisions, that defense counsel move for judgment of acquittal before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The State next argues that, even if this Court were to consider the sufficiency claim, it is clear that the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>fully sufficient to sustain the petitioner\u2019s conviction under CL \u00a7 10-606(a)(3). Like the petitioner, the State also looks to the legislative history of the statute, which it concludes does not support the petitioner\u2019s argument that the \u201cbodily harm,\u201d contemplated by \u00a7 10-606(a)(3), necessarily refers to \u201cserious bodily harm.\u201d Indeed, it asserts that the petitioner\u2019s argument itself violates the rules of statutory construction; it clearly disregards the plain language of the statute. The State explains that the petitioner\u2019s reliance on the Legislature\u2019s stated purpose is an improper application of the canons of statutory construction, because that language conflicts with the plain text of the relevant statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The State also submits that the petitioner\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is misplaced and misapplied. Noting the perimeters of the rule as enunciated in <em>In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. at 190, 634 A.2d at 55-56, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4j\">\u201cThe doctrine of ejusdem generis applies when the following conditions exist: (1) the statute contains an enumeration by specific words; (2) the members of the enumeration suggest a class; (3) the class is not exhausted by the enumeration; (4) a general reference supplementing the enumeration, usually following it; and (5) there is not clearly manifested an intent that the general term be given a broader meaning than the doctrine requires. It is generally held that the rule of ejusdem generis is merely a rule of construction and is only applicable where legislative intent or language expressing that intent is unclear,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2g\">it maintains that CL \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) falls short of this standard because \u201cthe \u2018class\u2019 at issue \u2014 \u2018bodily harm, permanent disability, or death\u2019 \u2014 is exhausted by the enumeration,\u201d and, further, that \u201cthere is no \u2018general inference\u2019 supplementing the enumeration.\u201d In other words, the doctrine must be applied only to subsection (a)(3), the enumeration in subsection (a)(1) having no role to play in that regard. The State further explains that the statutory language of \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) was employed by the Legislature, contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertions, because it enumerates escalating types of physical harm. The inclusion of \u201cbodily harm\u201d, without specifying what degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>harm is required, the State submits, is simply an indication that the Legislature intended to include all types of physical harm inflicted on law enforcement animals, rather than limit the harm to any extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The State also disagrees with the petitioner\u2019s argument that \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) requires proof of a specific intent to inflict bodily harm. The State asserts that, unlike those crimes described by this Court in <em>Chen, </em>370 Md. at 110 n. 5, 803 A.2d at 524 n. 5, \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) does not require \u201csome specific mental element or intended purpose above and beyond the mental state required for the mere <em>actus reus </em>of the crime itself.\u201d It concludes, therefore, that the petitioner\u2019s \u201cultimate goal or motive in attacking the dog is irrelevant,\u201d because \u201cthe jury could reasonably infer that he intended to do just what he did-inflict bodily harm on [the] police dog ... to force the dog to release its hold\u201d which, in any event, still violates the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Finally, the State argues that the petitioner\u2019s actions do not fall within the \u201cself-defense\u201d exception of \u00a7 10-606(a)(3). It submits, \u201c[injuring a police dog, which is acting under the command of a police officer in the course of a lawful apprehension and in compliance with proper police dog procedures, cannot be what the General Assembly intended by the statutory exception for a \u2018case of self defense\u2019.\u201d It further reminds this Court that, although the petitioner was given several commands to show his hands in order to avoid being attacked by the dog, he did not do so, and thus provoked the conflict by failing to comply with lawful police directions. The State concludes, on these grounds, that the evidence presented at trial was more than sufficient to sustain the petitioner\u2019s conviction, though it reiterates its threshold argument, that this Court should decline to review the sufficiency issue altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">We note, at the outset, that the petitioner properly concedes that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of all the evidence, and thus, failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>renew his motion, left unpreserved his evidentiary insufficiency claim. This conclusion is not surprising in light of CP \u00a7 6-104 and Rule 4-324, both of which make clear that a motion for judgment of acquittal, made at the close of all the evidence, is a prerequisite to \u201cthe defendant ... hav[ing] review of the ruling on appeal.\u201d CP \u00a7 6-104(a) provides that where a criminal defendant moves for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s evidence, the motion is denied, and the defendant proceeds to offer his own evidence, the defendant, in effect, has withdrawn his motion. Rule 4-324(c) is to like effect. This motion has no viability unless it is renewed, if counsel moves, again, for judgment of acquittal after the close of all evidence. CP \u00a7 6 \u2014 104(b)(1); Rule 4-324(a). Counsel for the petitioner moved for judgment at the end of the State\u2019s case, but did not move for judgment of acquittal at the end of the entire case. \u201cTogether, the statute and the rule have been construed to preclude appellate courts of this state from entertaining a review of the sufficiency of the evidence, in a criminal case tried before a jury, where the defendant failed to move for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence.\u201d <em>Ennis, </em>306 Md. at 585, 510 A.2d at 576. <em>See Tull v.

Only where \u201cthe words of a statute are ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation,\u201d or \u201cwhere the words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme,\u201d must a court \u201cresolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process.\u201d <em>Id., </em>412 Md. at 276, 987 A.2d at 29 (citations omitted); <em>Chow v.

To be sure, we have found statutes to be ambiguous if they are subject to \u201ctwo or more reasonable alternative interpretations.... \u201d <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d at 1226. That is not the case with CL \u00a7 10-606(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">CL \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) is unambiguous. It\u2019s plain language provides that \u201cexcept in the case of self-defense,\u201d a person may not \u201cintentionally inflict bodily harm, permanent disability, or death on an animal owned or used by a law enforcement unit.\u201d We cannot conceive of two reasonable alternative interpretations of this language. It explicitly prohibits actions resulting in three kinds of harm \u2014 bodily harm, permanent disability, death \u2014 with specific regard to animals both owned, and used, by law enforcement. It was, therefore, unnecessary and, indeed, impermissible for the petitioner to look beyond the language of this statute for guidance, except as confirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>tion of the plain language.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Witte, </em>369 Md. at 525, 801 A.2d at 165; <em>Toler v. MVA, </em>373 Md. 214, 220, 817 A.2d 229, 233 (2003); <em>Pelican v. Provident, </em>381 Md. 327, 336, 849 A.2d 475, 480 (2004). Rather than seek confirmation of his interpretation of \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) from Subtitle 6, Crimes Relating to Animals, the petitioner asks us to look to case law interpreting a wholly separate statute, with a separate purpose, CL \u00a7 3-202(a)(1), for guidance as to the intent the Legislature required for commission of the acts it proscribes. As we have seen, on the basis of our interpretation of that statute, the petitioner asks us to conclude that \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) contemplates a specific intent to inflict harm upon a police animal. We decline to do so, and, because its language is so clear and unequivocal, decline to look beyond \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) for legislative intent. The petitioner\u2019s contention that \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) requires some specific intent finds no support in the plain statutory language. Indeed, ordinarily, the meaning of a statute cannot be gleaned, as the petitioner would have us do, from a comparison of it to an entirely distinct statute which prohibits a completely different crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We also reject the petitioner\u2019s application of <em>ejusdem generis </em>to \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) as improper. The Latin phrase literally translates to \u201cof the same kind or class,\u201d and is defined as \u201c[a] canon of construction holding that when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>general word or phrase follows a list of specifics, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only items of the same class as those listed.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 594 (9th ed.2009). This Court has applied the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>upon the existence of the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201c(1) the statute contains an enumeration of specific words; (2) the members of the enumeration suggest a class; (3) the class is not exhausted by the enumeration; (4) a general reference supplementing the enumeration, usually following it; and (5) there is not clearly manifested an intent that the general term be given a broader meaning than the doctrine requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\"><em>Boyle v. Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission, </em>385 Md. 142, 156, 867 A.2d 1050, 1059 (2005) (quoting <em>In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. at 190, 634 A.2d at 55-56). We have also explained that \u201cthe doctrine, being only a rule of construction, should not be invoked \u2018to restrict the meaning of words within narrower limits than the statute intends, so as to subvert its obvious purpose\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Blake v. State, </em>210 Md. 459, 462, 124 A.2d 273, 274 (1956), <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assess. &amp; Taxation v. Belcher, </em>315 Md. 111, 121, 553 A.2d 691, 696 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">As a rule of construction, <em>ejusdem generis </em>serves as an alternative mechanism through which the court may ascertain the intent of the Legislature. Like the unrelated case law relied upon by the petitioner, however, \u201cit is generally held that the rule of ejusdem generis is merely a rule of construction and is only applicable where legislative intent or language expressing that intent is unclear.\u201d 2A Sutherland Stat. Const. \u00a7 47.18, at 200 (7th ed.2012). As such, the petitioner\u2019s reliance on this doctrine, too, is premature, and misplaced. As we have already indicated, the intent of the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) is readily apparent in the plain language of the statute, and through its own explicitly stated intention to prohibit the infliction of non-accidental harm to animals, including those used by law enforcement. Indeed, the petitioner can point to no clearly manifested intent, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Legislature, to the contrary, that the wording, \u201cbodily harm\u201d in actuality means <em>\u201cserious </em>bodily harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Finally, we do not believe that \u00a7 10-606(a)(3) prohibits the infliction of only \u201cserious\u201d bodily harm. Nan-owing the meaning of \u201cbodily harm,\u201d as the petitioner would have us do, to mean only serious bodily harm, would subvert the statute\u2019s purpose. A longstanding principle of statutory construction provides that \u201cour interpretation of [a] statute and the legislature\u2019s intent must be examined by looking to the statutory scheme in its entirety rather than segmenting the statute and analyzing only its individual parts.\u201d <em>Marsheck v. Board of Trustees of Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Retirement System of City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 403, 749 A.2d 774, 779 (2000); <em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 275, 987 A.2d at 29; <em>Anderson v. Council of Unit Owners of Gables on Tuckerman Condominium, </em>404 Md. 560, 572, 948 A.2d 11, 19 (2008). Indeed, even \u201cthe meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which it appears.\u201d <em>Stoddard, </em>395 Md. at 663, 911 A.2d at 1250 (quoting <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339, 1341 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, instead of \u201cconfin[ing] strictly our interpretation of [the] statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone,\u201d we look, as we must, to the statutory scheme as a whole, in our effort to discern legislative intent from it\u2019s language. <em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 265, 987 A.2d at 29; <em>Johnson v.

It is also clear, upon analyzing the language of the subsection as a whole, that the Legislature did so, because it intended to create a lower threshold for violation with regard to this category. This becomes evident upon comparing the kind of harm prohibited under (a)(1)\u2014 \u201cintentional! ] mutilation], torture, cruel! ] beat[ing], or cruel! ] killing]\u201d \u2014 to the lowest degree of harm prohibited by (a)(3), namely, \u201cbodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Holding, as the petitioner would have us do, that subsection (a)(3), also, is limited to harm of equal degree as that articulated in (a)(1), would render the specificity of (a)(3) mere surplusage and, thus, unnecessary. This runs afoul of the well-settled and oft-enunciated proposition, that, in conducting statutory interpretation, \u201cwhenever possible, a statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645, 654-55 (2001); <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 302, 783 A.2d 667, 671 (2001); <em>Liverpool v.

State, </em>358 Md. 418, 429-30, 749 A.2d 787, 793 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Applying the above standard to the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is readily apparent that the petitioner\u2019s assertion of self-defense cannot succeed because he invited (\u201cprovoked\u201d) the conflict, thus failing to meet the third required element. The facts are unambiguous. The stabbing victim named and identified the petitioner as his assailant. Upon being found, the petitioner was ordered by law enforcement to stop. Disregarding this order, he fled from police. Officer Davies and Bennie, his canine, who joined the search efforts as back-ups, discovered the petitioner and ordered him to surrender and to keep his hands in unobscured view. He ignored those orders and refused to submit to arrest, even when repeatedly and explicitly warned that non-compliance would result in Bennie being released. It was only after this series of events, constituting consistent disregard for the law by the petitioner, that the canine was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The petitioner\u2019s self-defense argument also fails because he used excessive force in his interaction with the canine. In response to its trained attempts to restrain him, the petitioner struck the canine several times, inflicting a half-inch wide cut above its right eye. Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertions, such an injury is hardly \u201cinsignificant.\u201d Regardless of degree, however, the petitioner, as we have seen, violated the statute by intentionally inflicting <em>any </em>bodily harm on the police canine.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In sum, we reject the petitioner\u2019s contention that his conviction should be reversed due to the insufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. The undisputed facts show that the petitioner intentionally and repeatedly struck Bennie, who was performing its duty in accordance with police procedure, on its head, causing it bodily harm. There is absolutely no contention that Bennie, or its owner, for that matter, was acting illegally. As such, a rational jury could have found and, indeed, did find beyond a reasonable doubt, that the petitioner\u2019s conduct satisfied the elements of aggravated cruelty to animals, thus violating \u00a7 10 \u2014 606(a)(3). In light of the facts, we also reject the petitioner\u2019s contention that he acted in self-defense, and, therefore, was relieved of the consequences of his \u00a7 10 \u2014 606(a)(3) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Like the Court of Special Appeals, we believe that it is unnecessary to address the petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance, since it rests, solely, on his assertion that the evidence presented against him was insufficient to sustain his \u00a7 10 \u2014 606(a)(3) conviction. We do, however, note that a failure to renew a motion for judgment of acquittal, in our opinion, does not automatically render assistance ineffective. That would be the effect were we to hold as the petitioner would have us do. The basis of the petitioner\u2019s insufficient evidence claim, which is essential to his ineffective assistance claim, is a statutory construction and factual argument, unresolved when presented. There simply is no objective, uncontroverted or conceded error. Under such circumstances, we agree with the State; the issue of the effectiveness of counsel must await subsequent post-conviction review.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>We affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Perfect self-defense occurs when the belief of danger is subjectively held by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>accused and is objectively reasonable, while imperfect self-defense occurs when the actual subjective belief on the part of the accused is not objectively reasonable. <em>Id.., </em>380 Md. at 251-52, 844 A.2d at 439-440 (citing <em>State v.
