He requested, but was denied, a new trial based on what he alleges to be a \u201cfavorable\u201d DNA test result. His case reaches us on direct appeal under Section 8 \u2014 201(k)(6) of the Criminal Procedure Article. We affirm the postconviction court\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s motion, holding that \u2014 even if the DNA test results could be considered favorable to Brown \u2014 the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there was no substantial possibility that Brown would not have been convicted, had the DNA evidence been presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The facts underlying the issue before us are not pretty. Brown was charged and convicted for beating and raping Mildred Fleming, who allegedly used to buy drugs from him and owed him $80. The testimony at trial established that, on the night in question, Brown and Fleming ran into each other at the home of a mutual acquaintance, Jacqueline Maize. When Fleming saw Brown, she noticed that his \u201chand was bleeding\u201d and \u201casked him what had happened and what was wrong.\u201d Brown did not answer, but led Fleming into the bathroom for a chat.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Once there, Brown demanded payment of the money Fleming allegedly owed him. When Fleming was unable to make a payment, Brown punched her in the face, ripped off her shirt, and handcuffed her. After that, Brown and his three cohorts put Fleming in the trunk of a car and drove her to an apartment of another acquaintance, Patty Bruce.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">As the Court of Special Appeals summarized the facts in an unpublished 2003 opinion, at Bruce\u2019s place, they \u201cbeat Fleming with a cane and a broomstick and burned her with a heated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>knife, an iron, and a lamp bulb.\u201d Brown also \u201cput a broomstick in Fleming\u2019s rectum, then removed one of her handcuffs and ordered her to masturbate. He blindfolded her with a shirt ..., took her to the bathroom, and shoved her head into the toilet.\u201d Some time later, Brown \u201cremoved the handcuffs, took Fleming to the bedroom and raped her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">When Brown and the other men were done torturing Fleming, they \u201ctook her back to Maize\u2019s home, this time, in the passenger compartment of the car.\u201d Fleming said nothing \u201cabout the incident\u201d to Maize and \u201cgot high on crack cocaine.\u201d Fleming testified at trial that \u201cshe did not call the police or go to the hospital because she knew there was a warrant for [her] arrest for a probation violation.\u201d About one week after the incident, however, Fleming did talk to the police. \u201cShe showed them the burn marks and was taken to the hospital for treatment. Detective Sergeant Misty Saunders, who took Fleming to the hospital, testified that Fleming had \u2018soft scabs.\u2019 She took photographs, which were shown to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">At the trial, Maize \u201cconfirmed Fleming\u2019s testimony that Fleming was taken into the bathroom and that she was handcuffed when she was brought out.\u201d She testified that Brown, \u201cFleming, and the others left around 5:00 a.m., and returned sometime later. Fleming was upset and crying, and seemed scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Bruce also testified at Brown\u2019s trial. She told the jury that \u201cshe was drunk when appellant and his companions showed up at her home with Fleming. She recalled that Fleming looked \u2018like herself,\u2019 except that her hands were crossed and her shirt was hanging over her shoulder.\u201d High on \u201cPercocets and crack,\u201d Bruce \u201cwas \u2018in and out of it\u2019 when the group went into the bedroom,\u201d but \u201c[ajfter they left, she found her bedroom lamp broken and burning. Later, she discovered a burned and bent butter knife on the stove. She threw the knife away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Another witness, Dorothea Wars, testified that Fleming came to her house after the rape and showed her body, allowing the witness to see \u201ceverything that happened.\u201d Wars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u201calso described a telephone call from [Brown], in which he asked if she knew what Fleming was saying. When Wars recounted what Fleming had said about the incident, [Brown] first denied, then admitted, his participation. He asked Wars to tell Fleming that he was sorry and to convey the message that he would \u2018give her anything she wanted\u2019 if she dropped the charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The father of Fleming\u2019s child, Walter Groomes, then testified and \u201cdescribed Fleming\u2019s appearance when he arrived at Maize\u2019s residence the evening following the rape. He testified that Fleming\u2019s face and mouth were bruised, cut and swollen, her clothes were raggedy, and she had burn marks on the back and inside of her thigh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Brown himself stated to the police \u201cthat Fleming owed him money for drugs. He stated that he met her at Maize\u2019s home and drove her to Bruce\u2019s apartment, but that she rode in the car and not in the trunk. He admitted hitting her with his fist \u2018a couple times,\u2019 but denied raping her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">There was no physical evidence tying Brown to the crimes. None of Brown\u2019s blood or hair was found at the crime scene or any of the objects used in the attack of Fleming, including the broomstick. Brown\u2019s counsel emphasized this point at trial, eliciting testimony that the broomstick had been tested for blood and hair, but \u201call of it came back negative.\u201d There was testimony at trial that some fibers, which were found on the bristles of the broomstick with which Fleming was sodomized, were still to be tested for DNA. But Brown\u2019s attorney stressed that the fibers were on the bristles only and \u2014 other than those fibers \u2014 everything else was tested and \u201ceverything else came back negative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Despite Brown\u2019s counsel\u2019s efforts to establish the lack of physical evidence tying Brown to the crimes, Brown was convicted of first degree rape and related charges on September 27, 2001 after a four-day trial in the Circuit Court for Carroll County. He was also unsuccessful in appealing his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>On June 6, 2009, Brown filed a petition for postconviction DNA testing. His initial request was denied,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but on July 8, 2010, the Circuit Court heard argument on a Revised Petition for Post-Conviction DNA Testing, in which Brown asked to test for the absence of Fleming\u2019s DNA on the broom and the knives used during the attack. Brown argued that Fleming lied and \u201cif the events occurred as she claimed, then testing [would] find her DNA.\u201d In other words, Brown sought \u201cto attack [Fleming\u2019s] credibility by showing that her DNA is not on [those] items.\u201d On September 29, 2010, the Circuit Court granted Brown\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The DNA testing produced two types of results with respect to the broomstick. First, the testing indicated the presence of DNA consistent with Fleming\u2019s on the top three inches and somewhere around the mid-section of the broomstick. Second, the testing showed that Brown\u2019s DNA was not on the broomstick.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brown interpreted these results as \u201cfavorable\u201d to his case, and on May 2, 2011, filed a Motion for Relief under Section 8-201 of the Criminal Procedure Article, requesting a new trial. On April 30, 2012, the postconviction court denied the motion, having found that no \u201csubstantial possibility exists that the Petitioner would not have been convicted had the DNA testing been introduced at trial or that ordering a new trial is in the interests of justice.\u201d The court also added that \u201cthe testing results are unfavorable to the Petitioner\u201d because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>he \u201cargued that the testing would fail to find the victim\u2019s DNA, but the results could not exclude her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Brown noted a direct appeal to this Court under Section 8-201(k)(6) of the Criminal Procedure Article. He presented the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">1. Did the lower court err in finding that the DNA test results were unfavorable to Mr. Brown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">2. Did the lower court err in finding that there was not a substantial possibility that Mr. Brown would not have been convicted had the DNA test results been introduced at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">3. Did the lower court err in refusing to order a new trial in the interests of justice?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">We hold that \u2014 even if the absence of Brown\u2019s DNA on the broomstick could be considered \u201cfavorable\u201d evidence<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 there is no substantial possibility that he would not have been convicted had that evidence been introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">Brown seeks a new trial under the DNA postconviction statute, codified as Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Supp.), \u00a7 8-201 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d). Under the statute, a new trial is available as a remedy, but only when (1) \u201cthe results of the postconviction DNA testing are favorable to the petitioner,\u201d and (2) there is \u201ca substantial possibility ... that the petitioner would not have been convicted if the DNA testing results had been known or introduced at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8 \u2014 201 (i)(2)(iii). If, however, \u201cthe results of the postconviction DNA testing are unfavorable to the petitioner, the court shall dismiss the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8-201(i)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"> A postconviction court\u2019s rulings under CP \u00a7 8-201 are subject to direct review by this Court. CP \u00a7 8-201(k)(6). Because a decision on \u201cwhether to grant a new trial is within the discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>Arrington v. State, </em>411 Md. 524, 551, 983 A.2d 1071, 1087 (2009) (quoting <em>Cooley v. State, </em>385 Md. 165, 175, 867 A.2d 1065, 1071 (2005)) (quotation marks omitted), we review denials of a new trial under CP \u00a7 8-201(i)(2)(iii) for abuse of discretion. The postconviction court\u2019s factual findings are also subject to a deferential standard of review and will not be disturbed unless there is clear error. <em>Id., </em>983 A.2d at 1086-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Brown seeks a new trial, arguing that \u201c[t]he DNA test results were inconsistent with the State\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>He sees a mismatch between Fleming\u2019s testimony that his hand was bleeding right before he allegedly sodomized her with a broomstick and the lack of his DNA on the broomstick.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Brown is confident that his DNA would have been on the broomstick, if the \u201cevents really took place as Fleming claims.\u201d As a result, Brown believes that the DNA test results show that Fleming was untruthful in her testimony, and that there is a substantial possibility that he would not have been convicted if the DNA test results would have been introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The State disagrees. In its opinion, the DNA test results were not favorable and there was no substantial possibility that Brown would not have been convicted. With respect to the favorability prong, the State points out that the fact that Brown\u2019s DNA was not on the broomstick is not new evidence: \u201cBrown was aware at trial of the absence of affirmative forensic evidence that he bled on the broomstick. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>also was made aware of it.\u201d Indeed, in his Petition for DNA Testing, Brown \u201cnoted that the items were tested for blood with negative results.\u201d Furthermore, the State argues that \u201c[e]ven if the absence of blood on the broomstick constituted newly discovered evidence ... it cannot be considered \u2018favorable\u2019 because it is not exculpatory.\u201d According to the State, regardless of whether Brown \u201cactually handle[d] the broomstick, it in no way absolves him of his liability as [an] accomplice in that particular sexual assault.\u201d In any event, the State maintains that, even if the DNA test results could be considered \u201cfavorable,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> there was no substantial possibility that the trial would have reached a different outcome, had these DNA test results been introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In making these competing arguments, the parties rely on <em>Thompson v. State, </em>411 Md. 664, 985 A.2d 32 (2009) and <em>Arrington v. State, </em>411 Md. 524, 983 A.2d 1071 (2009), two cases in which we considered whether there was a substantial possibility that the defendant would not have been convicted, had the newly-discovered DNA evidence been presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">At Thompson\u2019s trial for \u201crape, burglary, felony murder and a weapons offense,\u201d the State argued to the jury that the sperm recovered during the victim\u2019s autopsy \u201ccame from the rapist\u201d and that \u201cthe blood found on Thompson\u2019s jeans was the same blood type [as the victim\u2019s].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Thompson, </em>411 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>670-71, 985 A.2d at 35-36. After the trial, however, DNA testing \u201cexcluded both [Thompson\u2019s co-defendant] and Thompson as depositors of the sperm,\u201d and \u201cthe testing on Thompson\u2019s blue jeans at the location of the bloodstain showed that the blood did not come from the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672-73, 985 A.2d at 37. Although the DNA testing conclusively established that Thompson did not rape the victim, the postconviction court denied the motion for a new trial because \u201cthe DNA evidence did not remove Thompson from the scene of the crime and thus could not exculpate him on a felony murder charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674, 985 A.2d at 38. We vacated that order and remanded with directions that the postconviction court \u201cconsider whether this highly persuasive new evidence might have made a difference to the jury as to the rape and its dual service as a predicate felony for the felony murder charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 985 A.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><em>Arrington </em>also involved the State\u2019s reliance on blood evidence, which later proved to be incorrect. Arrington was convicted of second degree murder, in part, based on the testimony that blood of the same type as the victim\u2019s was found on his sweat pants. <em>Arrington, </em>411 Md. at 529, 983 A.2d at 1072. Postconviction DNA testing \u201cconclusively proved,\u201d however, that the blood was not the victim\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 983 A.2d at 1076. Emphasizing the jury\u2019s specific questions about the blood stains and the State\u2019s express reference to the stains and the matching blood type, we held that there was a substantial possibility that the outcome at trial would have been different, had the evidence been presented at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 553-56, 411 A.2d at 1088-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Brown analogizes this case to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Arrington, </em>arguing that, as in those two cases, the DNA test results here \u201cshowed the absence of [his] DNA,\u201d and \u201cwere inconsistent with the State\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d The State counters that Brown\u2019s reliance on <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Arrington </em>is misplaced. Unlike in <em>Thompson </em>\u2014 where the State suggested that the semen found in the victim\u2019s vagina was Thompson\u2019s (or at least his accomplice\u2019s) and the blood on Thompson\u2019s pants was the victim\u2019s \u2014 and unlike in <em>Arrington </em>\u2014 where the State ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>gued that the blood on Arrington\u2019s sweat pants was the same type as the victim\u2019s \u2014 here, the State never made similar allegations about the evidence. As the postconviction court properly emphasized, \u201cthe State never presented the jury with evidence that Petitioner\u2019s DNA was on the broom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Indeed, quite the opposite from <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Arrington </em>happened at Brown\u2019s trial. Not only was the jury not led to believe that there was forensic evidence linking Brown to the crime, but it was specifically told that there was no such forensic evidence. Through Fleming\u2019s testimony, the jury knew that Brown\u2019s hand was bleeding on the night in question, and Brown\u2019s counsel emphasized in his opening statement that there was no physical evidence linking Brown to the crimes. He told the jury: the police \u201cretrieved items from the apartment [and] submitted those items to be tested for the presence of any evidence to corroborate what Ms. Fleming said. Guess what? The test came back negative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">He pursued the same theory of defense through the questioning of Detective Hundermark, stressing the absence of Brown\u2019s blood and hair on the broomstick:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">[MR WARREN]: . .. And, the reason that you requested a search and seizure warrant to seize this physical evidence [from Bruce\u2019s home] is because you felt that there may be something there that will corroborate what \u2014 some physical evidence there to corroborate what Ms. Fleming was saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">[DETECTIVE HUNDERMARK]: That, and also based on Ms. Fleming\u2019s explanation of what was utilized on her when she was tortured was an additional reason. Obviously, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">Q: And, in fact, that\u2019s why you submitted the items to the lab for comparison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">Q: Did you receive any positive results from the items that you submitted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">Q: You submitted the items for blood and hair. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">A: Blood, hair and fibers, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">Q: Blood, hair and fibers? And, all of it came back negative. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">A: Correct. . . [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Thus, this case is not like <em>Thompson </em>or <em>Arrington. </em>As the State points out, \u201cthe DNA test results did not contradict or undercut any information presented to the jury at trial.\u201d Unlike <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Arrington, </em>\u201cBrown could, and did, make the identical argument to the jury in 2001 that he now claims the DNA evidence allows: there is no forensic evidence linking him to the broomstick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Even in the absence of forensic evidence, however, there was evidence the jury found convincing. There was testimony at trial that Fleming was assaulted by Brown and another man in different locations over the course of four-and-a-half to five hours. These assaults began at Maize\u2019s apartment with Brown punching Fleming in the face and chest, ripping of her shirt, handcuffing her, and shoving her in the trunk of a car. The assaults continued in Bruce\u2019s apartment, where Brown handcuffed Fleming to a loveseat, burned her with a knife, beat her with a wooden cane, shoved her head into a toilet, sodomized her with a broomstick, made her masturbate, and raped her. There was other evidence corroborating the circumstances surrounding these crimes, including the testimony of Maize, Bruce, and Groomes, as well as the photographs of Fleming\u2019s injuries taken by the police, Brown\u2019s admission of guilt to Wars, and Brown\u2019s statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In light of this evidence, the postconviction court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the absence of Brown\u2019s DNA on the broomstick did not provide a substantial possibility that the jury would have reached a different conclusion with respect to Brown\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the jury already knew Brown\u2019s hand was bleeding on the night of the assault, but yet, no blood was found on the broomstick. The absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Brown\u2019s DNA did not create a substantial possibility of a different outcome at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Postconviction DNA testing in this case established that Brown\u2019s DNA was not on the broomstick used to sodomize the victim. But, unlike in <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Arrington, </em>the State never suggested that there was physical evidence linking Brown to the crime generally, or the broomstick in particular. On the contrary, the jury heard the victim testify that Brown\u2019s hand was bleeding and knew from expert testimony that his blood was not on the broomstick. The postconviction court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the absence of Brown\u2019s DNA did not provide a substantial possibility that Brown would not have been found guilty if the DNA evidence had been introduced at trial. The jury convicted Brown after a four-day trial, having been told time and again by Brown\u2019s counsel that there was no physical evidence linking Brown to the crimes. Thus, we affirm the court\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\">. Brown appealed to this Court and on February 3, 2010, we granted a joint motion, filed by Brown and the State, to remand the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\">. It is not entirely clear from the DNA expert\u2019s report whether she tested the bristles or just the handle of the broomstick for the presence of DNA. In the report itself, the expert refers to testing five sections of the \u201cbroom stick,\u201d including the \"remainder of broom stick (inch 27 to bristle end),\u201d but in the cover letter accompanying the report, she explains that she \"performed DNA testing in five sections along the entire <em>stick of the broom.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) The postconviction court understood the test to cover the entire broom \"through the bristles.\" In any event, the parties do not make the distinction between the handle and the bristles in their briefs, referring instead to the \"broomstick.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b612-12\">. This reference to ordering a new trial in the interests of justice is the only time Brown mentions the interests of justice as the grounds for a new trial in his brief. Under Section 8-201(i)(3), even if the court finds that a substantial possibility of a different outcome does not exist, \"the court may order a new trial if the court determines that the action is in the interest of justice.\u201d Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 8-201(i)(3) of the Criminal Procedure Article. At oral argument, Brown argued that a new trial would be in the interests of justice in this case because the DNA expert opined that the DNA evidence in this case is inconsistent with the State\u2019s theory of the case. As we discuss below, we find the DNA expert\u2019s opinion on this issue unconvincing. Brown offered no other reason for why this case would require us to hold that the postconviction court abused its discretion in denying Brown's motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b612-13\">. There can be little doubt that the other piece of DNA evidence \u2014 the two DNA profiles from which Fleming could not be excluded as a possible contributor- \u2014 could not be considered \"favorable\u201d by any stretch of the imagination, even using Brown's hypothetical that Fleming\u2019s DNA was on the broomstick, which was found outside of Bruce\u2019s apartment, because Fleming \"used it to sweep snow, not because she was sodomized with it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">. Here, Brown assigns much weight to the opinion of the DNA expert who performed the postconviction DNA testing. In an affidavit, submitted as an exhibit to Brown's motion for a new trial, the expert opined that neither (1) the presence of a DNA profile from which Fleming could not be excluded nor (2) the absence of Brown\u2019s DNA were consistent with the State's theory of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">Fleming cannot be excluded as a possible contributor of the DNA obtained from ... two sections of the broomstick. .. . However, in my expert opinion, the DNA test results ... obtained are inconsistent with Ms. Fleming\u2019s description of the assault she was subjected to by Petitioner with the use of the broomstick. Furthermore, if the alleged assault took place as described by Ms. Fleming, it is my expert opinion that DNA from the suspect would also have been recovered from the broom stick. According to the testimony of Ms. Fleming, she indicated that Mr. Brown was bleeding from his hand prior to the alleged assault. Because blood is a good source of DNA, I would expect that if Mr. Brown handled the stick with a recently bloodied hand, I would have detected his DNA on the stick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>But the DNA expert\u2019s opinion \u2014 that the location of the DNA on the broomstick was not consistent with sodomy \u2014 is outside the field of expertise of such an expert. <em>See Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 573, 611 A.2d 581, 588 (1992) (an expert may only testify to subjects within his area of expertise). As for the expert\u2019s opinion that, \u201c[bjecause blood is a good source of DNA, ... if Mr. Brown handled the stick with a recently bloodied hand, I would have detected his DNA on the stick,\u201d we explain below that the this assertion does not add anything new to the evidence the jury had before it when it convicted Brown. The jury knew that Brown's hand was bleeding, that he used the broomstick to sodomize Fleming, that there was no blood (or hair) on the broomstick, and yet, the jury convicted Brown.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">. Brown also mentions in his brief the other DNA test results, which established that Fleming could not be excluded from the two DNA profiles found on the broomstick. It is not entirely clear from Brown\u2019s arguments if he considers these test results to be \"favorable\u201d or if he only makes that claim with respect to the absence of his DNA. At one time, he posits: there is a \u201cpossibility that Fleming\u2019s DNA was found on the broom because she used it to sweep snow, not because she was sodomized with it. Indeed the location of the DNA on the broom, on the top three inches and then again between inches fifteen and twenty-seven is consistent with Fleming having used the broomstick to sweep snow.\" But that evidence would also be consistent with Fleming having been sodomized with the broomstick. Like the postconviction court, we do not see how one could characterize these DNA test results as \"favorable\u201d to Brown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">. The State also emphasizes that, when Brown requested postconviction DNA testing, he maintained that the testing would produce a different kind of a \u201cfavorable\u201d result. Namely, he contended that the testing would show that Fleming's DNA was not on the broomstick. The results showed quite the opposite: DNA profile from which Fleming could not be excluded was found in two areas of the broomstick, one of which was consistent with sodomy. According to the State, \u201c[wjhen the test results are directly contrary to what the petitioner initially defines as 'favorable,' it undermines the basis for ordering the testing to begin with, let alone any subsequent demand for a new trial.\u201d We do not need to reach this argument because our holding rests on Brown's failure to satisfy the substantial probability prong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\">. The State also \"linked this with testimony that blood of an unspecified type was found on the murder weapon.\u201d <em>Thompson v. State, </em>411 Md. 664, 670-71, 985 A.2d 32, 35-36 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\">. Detective Hundermark also testified that some fibers were found on the bristles of the broomstick, which remained to be tested for DNA at the time of Brown\u2019s trial. But Brown\u2019s counsel clarified that the fibers were in the bristles only and that the test results were negative for blood and hair:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">Q: Let me show you what\u2019s been marked as State\u2019s Exhibit 4A for identification only and ask you if that\u2019s the result \u2014 the results that you got back from Ms. Stone of the Maryland State Police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">A: That's correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">Q: Review the document, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, the fibers that came back, came back from the bristles of a broom, is that correct, not the handle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">A: That\u2019s what the document states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">Q: Okay. Thank you, Detective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-15\">A: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-16\">Q: So, with the exception of what came back in bristles, everything else came back negative. Is that fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-18\">A: Well, I don\u2019t know because my understanding was that it was a sample taken from the broom handle. I don\u2019t know if I misunderstood Ms. Stone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-19\">Q: But, you didn't find any \u2014 or the results that came back, with the exclusion of fibers that we talked about where they were recovered as still \u2014 will be cleared up \u2014 but, with the exclusion of those fibers, nothing came back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-20\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">Even if we were to entertain the possibility that Brown handled the broomstick by the bristles \u2014 thereby leaving the door open for the jury to think that the untested fibers found on the bristles were somehow linked to Brown \u2014 the State never argued that connection. In <em>Arrington </em>and <em>Thompson, </em>it was the State's reliance on the faulty evidence that convinced us that there was a substantial possibility of a different outcome at trial. Without the State\u2019s reliance on the fibers in the bristles here, the possibility of a different outcome at trial \u2014 even with this new evidence \u2014 is much less likely. Furthermore, Brown does not even mention the bristles in his brief or at oral argument. His entire argument rests on Fleming\u2019s statement that his hand was bleeding but his DNA is not on the broomstick. Even at trial, however, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>evidence that the broomstick \u2014 and presumably the bristles \u2014 tested negative for blood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\">. This holding makes it unnecessary for us to resolve the arguments raised by the State that (1) in order to be a \u2018'favorable\u201d result under the DNA statute, the actual test results must be consistent with the basis given for ordering the postconviction DNA testing; and (2) the results must be exculpatory, as opposed to merely impeaching a witness\u2019s credibility, in order to grant a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
