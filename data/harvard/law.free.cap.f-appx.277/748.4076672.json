In 1997, Michael Hoover (Hoover), a state forensic scientist, tested the controlled substances and, in both trials, testified that the substances contained cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-21\">After Shaw was convicted, Hoover admitted stealing and using heroin from the state crime lab, and pled guilty to tampering with physical evidence. Shaw challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose Hoover\u2019s criminal activity as impeachment evidence pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194,10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-22\">Assuming, without deciding, that the Washington state court\u2019s analysis was deficient under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, we conduct a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Barker v. Fleming, </em>423 F.3d 1085, 1095 (9th Cir.2005). In view of the extensive testimony in Shaw\u2019s trials that the substances at issue were cocaine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the undisclosed evidence was not material, as there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>not \u201ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result[s] of the proceeding^] would have been different.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 1096 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b772-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-23\">. Under Washington law, expert analysis is not dispositive, as \"[c]ircumstantial evidence and lay testimony may be sufficient to establish the identity of a drug in a criminal case.\u201d <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>85 Wash.App. 672, 935 P.2d 623, 625 (1997), <em>as amended </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-17\">. Shaw speculates that the prosecution would have dismissed his cases pursuant to a policy addressing Hoover\u2019s misconduct for cases pending in 1998. However, Shaw's speculation cannot serve as a basis for a <em>Brady </em>claim. <em>See Barker, </em>423 F.3d at 1099 (\u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish materiality in the constitutional sense.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
