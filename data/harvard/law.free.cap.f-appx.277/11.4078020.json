The district court sentenced him to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment. Vargas appeals, contending that the underlying deportation order failed to comport with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-24\">The elements of illegal reentry are that the defendant \u201c(1) is an alien, (2) was previously deported, and (3) thereafter entered, or attempted to enter, the United States without permission.\u201d <em>United States v. Contreras Palacios, </em>492 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir.2007). An alien may negate the second element via collateral attack of the underlying deportation order by satisfying certain criteria enumerated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). Here, Vargas attempted to obtain relief pursuant to \u00a7 1326(d) by filing a motion to dismiss before the district court. <em>See United States v. Vargas, </em>479 F.Supp.2d 252 (D.R.I.2007) (rejecting Vargas\u2019s motion to dismiss). Now, on appeal, Vargas suggests that the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-25\">At the plea hearing, Vargas initially expressed a desire to continue to pursue on appeal his collateral attack against the pri- or deportation order. The district court, however, plainly instructed Vargas that, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>pleading guilty, he would waive his right to appeal his conviction for the crime of illegal reentry. Because Vargas pleaded guilty following the district court\u2019s clear and unequivocal admonition, his challenge is foreclosed by <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 98 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). Under the <em>'Tollett </em>doctrine, subject to narrowly construed exceptions, \u201ca defendant who pleads guilty unconditionally waives all \u2018independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gaffney, </em>469 F.3d 211, 214 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Tollett, </em>411 U.S. at 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602). Vargas does not argue that his plea was involuntary, <em>see United States v. Gonzalez-Mercado, </em>402 F.3d 294, 298 (1st Cir.2005), or that the court lacked jurisdiction, <em>see United States v. Cordero, </em>42 F.3d 697, 698-99 (1st Cir.1994). Consequently, Vargas may not now renew his pre-plea collateral attack against the deportation order upon which the instant conviction is predicated. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>85 Fed.Appx. 881, 882 (4th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Ortega-Guzman, </em>76 Fed.Appx. 846, 847-48 (10th Cir. 2003) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Lemus-Barragan, </em>5 Fed.Appx. 737, 737-38 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
