The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted a 15% substantial-assistance reduction pursuant to the government\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, calculated an advisory guidelines imprisonment range of 223-278 months, and sentenced Perkins to 223 months in prison and 8 years of supervised release. On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Perkins\u2019s criminal history was overstated because of the career-offender enhancement, making the sentence unreasonable. In his pro se supplemental brief, Perkins argues that his plea was not intelligent because he did not understand the career-offender enhancement, and that his counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-22\">Perkins may not challenge his guilty plea in this direct appeal because he did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Villa-real-Amarillas, </em>454 F.3d 925, 932 (8th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 989, 166 L.Ed.2d 747 (2007). Any ineffective-assistance claims should be raised in collateral proceedings. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>356 F.3d 913, 919-20 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-25\">We conclude that Perkins\u2019s sentence, which was within the advisory guidelines range, is not unreasonable. We presume that a sentence within the advisory guideline range is reasonable, <em>see United States v. Harris, </em>493 F.3d 928, 932 (8th Cir.2007) (court of appeals accords sentence within advisory Guidelines range presumption of reasonableness), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1263, 170 L.Ed.2d 111 (2008). The record demonstrates that the court considered Perkins\u2019s history and characteristics, and specifically discussed the nature and circumstances of his ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>reer-offender predicate offenses. Nothing in the record suggests that the court misapplied the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Harris, </em>493 F.3d at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We grant counsel leave to withdraw, subject to the conditions that counsel promptly comply with the requirements of Part V of this Court\u2019s Plan to Implement the Criminal Justice Act by advising Perkins of the procedures for filing a petition for writ of certiorari pro se, and that counsel also advise Perkins of the procedures for filing a petition for rehearing pro se.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-19\">.
