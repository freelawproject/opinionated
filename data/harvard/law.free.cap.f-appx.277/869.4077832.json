The sentences were at the low end of the Guidelines sentence range, which called for a prison term of 235 to 293 months for an offense level of 38 and a category I criminal history. Zamora now appeals his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-23\">At trial, Zamora testified in his own defense. In determining his sentence range under the Guidelines, the district court enhanced his base offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, obstruction of justice, finding that Zamora\u2019s testimony constituted perjury. Zamora contends that the court clearly erred in making that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-24\">An obstruction of justice enhancement is appropriate if \u201cthe defendant willfully ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>structed ... the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Obstructive conduct includes the commission of perjury. <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.4(b)). Perjury occurs when a witness, testifying under oath, gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory. <em>United States v. Dunni-gan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). Material matters include those that \u201cwould tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">\u201c[I]f a defendant objects to a sentence enhancement resulting from [his] trial testimony, a district court must review the evidence and make independent findings to establish a willful impediment to or obstruction of justice.\u201d <em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 95, 113 S.Ct. at 1117. Although the district court should make specific findings regarding perjury, a general independent finding of perjury is sufficient if the record demonstrates all the factual predicates of perjury. <em>United States v. Dobbs, </em>11 F.3d 152, 155 (11th Cir.1994) (applying <em>Dunni-gan </em>).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s general finding of that Zamora had committed perjury was sufficient to support the enhancement because it was an independent finding and all the factual predicates of perjury were present. Specifically, Zamora\u2019s testimony directly contradicted the testimony of several co-defendants. Zamora willfully gave false testimony under oath regarding material matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-17\">. Five others were indicted along with Zamora. Three of them were Government witnesses against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
