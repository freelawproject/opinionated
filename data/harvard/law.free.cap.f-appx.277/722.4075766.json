Jernberg challenges his sentence on appeal. At the time the sentence was imposed, several relevant legal issues had not yet been resolved. In light of decisions rendered since that time, it appears that the Guidelines may have been given excessive weight as a factor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">The district court\u2019s statements at both the change of plea hearing and the sentencing hearing make clear the district court understood that the Guidelines were advisory, even under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(2), and that \u201csentencing proceedings are to begin by determining the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). Nonetheless, undue weight may have been given to the Guidelines in determining Jernberg\u2019s sentence. The district court expressly stated that it thought it was required by law to give \u201csignificant weight\u201d to the Guidelines, and the sentence imposed was at the bottom end of the calculated range. It has now been established that the \u201cGuidelines factor\u201d should not \u201cbe given more or less weight than any other\u201d factor in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 991-92, 994 (\u201cIt would have been error had the judge actually ... weighted the Guidelines range more heavily than other \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). Because we cannot be sure that the same sentence would have been imposed absent the extra weight given to the Guidelines, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-19\">SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b747-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
