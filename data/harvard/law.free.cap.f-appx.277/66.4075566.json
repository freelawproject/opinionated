Bin Li Xu has also been known as Xu Bao Lei, Bao-Li Xu, Bao Lei Xu, and Baolei Xu.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Bao Li Xu, a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, seeks review of an August 31, 2007 order of the BIA denying his motion to reopen proceedings. <em>In re Bao Li Xu, </em>No. A73 134 559 (B.I.A. Aug. 31, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, we remain mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Maghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006). When the agency denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the the agency\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Xu\u2019s motion to reopen. A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of the agency\u2019s final decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, the 90-day filing deadline does not apply to a motion to reopen that is \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">It is undisputed that Xu\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely where he filed it more than twelve years after the Immigration Judge\u2019s October 1994 in absentia exclusion order. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, Xu claimed in his motion that country conditions in China had changed, urging the BIA to consider (but not submitting) the documents we discussed in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir.2006). In his brief to this Court, Xu argues that the BIA erred in failing to consider those documents. He does not, however, challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that the evidence he did submit failed to establish changed country conditions which are material to his claim. Thus, he has waived any such argument. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005) (emphasizing that issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs ai\u2019e considered waived and ordinarily will not be ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>dressed on appeal). Even if Xu had challenged the BIA\u2019s findings regarding the evidence he submitted, we would not find an abuse of discretion because the BIA properly found that Xu\u2019s background materials had \u201cno personal connection.\u201d While we have held that \u201ca document need not specifically name the petitioner in order to merit attention.\u201d <em>Zhi Yun Gao v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 86, 88 (2d Cir.2007), here Xu\u2019s evidence discusses family planning policy enforcement in Fujian Province, while Xu is from Zhejiang Province. Thus, it was of limited probative value. Additionally, the BIA properly found that Xu\u2019s unsworn \u201caffidavit\u201d attesting to the birth of two children in the U.S. did not constitute evidence of changed country conditions where it described only his changed personal circumstances. <em>See Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that the birth of U.S. citizen children constitutes a change in personal circumstances and not a change in country conditions, and therefore does not establish an exception to the filing deadline for motions to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Moreover, with regard to the documents addressed in <em>Shou Yung Guo, </em>we cannot find that the BIA abused its discretion in failing to consider evidence that was not in the record. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c); <em>cf. Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 269 (2d Cir.2007). Finally, insofar as Xu argues that the BIA abused its discretion in failing to reopen his proceedings sua sponte in light of the documents we addressed in <em>Shou Yung Guo, </em>we lack jurisdiction to review such a challenge because the agency\u2019s decision in that respect was \u201centirely discretionary.\u201d <em>Azmond Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
