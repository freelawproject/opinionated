Grajeda\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment was 41 to 51 months, and the district court sentenced him to 41 months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. Graje-da contends that the wrongfulness of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>illegal reentry was over-represented by the Guidelines because he was motivated by a desire to be present when his wife, who is a United States citizen, gave birth to his child. He also points to his rehabilitation and stable employment in Mexico after his previous deportation as evidence that there is a low risk that he will return again illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Grajeda never objected to the district court\u2019s sentence as unreasonable, review of his sentence is for plain error only. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 390-93 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 22, 2008) (No. 07-8978); <em>see also United States v. Hernandez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272-73 (5th Cir.) (revocation context), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 325, 169 L.Ed.2d 229 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Grajeda does not allege any procedural error by the district court\u2019s in its sentencing proceedings. Grajeda contends that his within-guidelines sentence of 41 months of imprisonment was unreasonable in light of the district court\u2019s obligation to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors such as ensuring that Grajeda\u2019s sentence would reflect the seriousness of the offense. However, the district court specifically noted that Grajeda\u2019s previous incarceration of 18 months did not deter him from returning to the United States illegally and that Grajeda was previously convicted for the felony drug trafficking offense of importation of 50 kilograms or more of marijuana \u2014 facts that weigh in favor of a heavier sentence in light of other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as promoting respect for the law, affording adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and protecting the public from further crimes of the defendant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). Thus, Grajeda has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court constituted error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Ni-konova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). The judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 441 (5th Cir.2000) (plain error standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Grajeda challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almenda-rez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrella-no, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
