After reviewing the record de novo and considering Glenn\u2019s arguments on appeal, we find no basis for reversing the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision. We also conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s order dismissing Glenn\u2019s claims against Arkansas Special Agent Dale Arnold. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B); <em>Berdella v. Delo, </em>972 F.2d 204, 207-08 (8th Cir.1992) (appeal of one order does not inherently imply desire to appeal another). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\">. The Honorable William R.
