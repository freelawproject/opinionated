Because the officers had probable cause to arrest William Zan-tello for felonious assault, they are entitled to qualified immunity from Zantello\u2019s unreasonable-seizure and malicious-prosecution claims. But because material issues of fact remain over whether the officers used excessive force in carrying out the arrest, they are not entitled to qualified immunity from that claim. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">On the afternoon of July 23, 2004, William Zantello delivered an industrial-sized water cooler to the Dollar Buster convenience store owned by the Almansour family. To move the heavy cooler from his truck into the store, Zantello used the \u201cbars and yankie\u201d method, which requires the mover to yank the cooler across iron bars. As the cooler rolls along the bars, a bar eventually breaks free, and the mover brings the free bar to the front of the cooler, repeating the process and inching the cooler along to its destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">At some point during the delivery, the Almansours and Zantello became embroiled in an argument over the condition of the cooler, prompting someone \u2014 the record does not say who \u2014 to report an assault and battery to the Shelby Township police department. When officers Phelps and Underwood arrived on the scene, they found \u201csix or seven\u201d people outside the store \u201cyelling ... back and forth\u201d at each other and identified two men \u2014 David Almansour and William Zan-tello \u2014 as the central figures in the altercation. JA 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">The officers observed Almansour curse at Zantello and his daughter, and Zantello returned the favor, telling Almansour that his mother \u201cwas acting like\u201d a \u201cb* * * *.\u201d JA 305. Almansour then \u201ccharge[d] at\u201d Zantello, picked up one of the iron bars and raised it as if to hit Zantello. Zantel-lo, who also had been holding an iron bar, \u201clunged towards [Almansour] to grab [Al-mansour\u2019s] bar.\u201d JA 307. At that point, the officers entered the fray, separating the two men and arresting them. Shelby Township charged Zantello with felonious assault but dismissed the charge after Al-mansour refused to testify against Zantel-lo.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">Zantello filed this lawsuit in federal court against the two officers and the township. Invoking \u00a7 1983 and the Fourth (and Fourteenth) Amendment, he maintained that the officers unreasonably seized him, used excessive force and maliciously prosecuted him and that Shelby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Township failed adequately to train and superase its officers. Invoking Michigan law, he sought relief for assault and battery, false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and gross negligence. In ruling on the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled for the township but denied the officers relief from any of the claims. The officers filed this interlocutory appeal challenging the denial of qualified immunity from the federal claims. <em>See Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 527, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In addressing qualified immunity claims, we must adhere to the \u201crigid order of battle,\u201d <em>Brosseau v. Haugen, </em>543 U.S. 194, 201-02, 125 S.Ct. 596, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004) (Breyer, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted), set forth in <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), requiring us to consider first whether the officers violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights, and second whether the rights were \u201cclearly established,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Did the officers unlawfully arrest Zantello? No, for several reasons. First, the question in this setting is not whether the officers had evidence of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but whether they had probable cause to believe that he had committed (or was about to commit) a crime. <em>See Lyons v. City of Xenia, </em>417 F.3d 565, 573 (6th Cir.2005); <em>see also Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 37, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979). The crime at issue makes it a felony to \u201cassault[ ] another person with a[n] ... iron bar ... or other dangerous weapon without intending to commit murder or to inflict great bodily harm less than murder.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.82(1). The law thus requires \u201c(1) an assault, (2) with a dangerous weapon and (3) with the intent to injure or place the victim in reasonable apprehension of an immediate battery.\u201d <em>People v. Avant, </em>235 Mich.App. 499, 597 N.W.2d 864, 869 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Second, the undisputed facts show that the officers had a reasonable basis for concluding that Zantello had violated this law or was on the verge of doing so. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.82(1). Even when we view the facts through Zantello\u2019s eyes, this is what the officers had before them. Upon arriving at the store in response to a report of an assault and battery, they observed an \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201ctense\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d shouting match between Almansour and Zantello, both of whom were wielding iron bars. After Zan-tello cursed at Almansour and referred to his mother as a \u201cb* * * JA 305, Al-mansour charged at Zantello, threatened to kill him, \u201cpicked up one of [Zantello\u2019s] metal poles\u201d and raised it as if he \u201cwas going to take [Zantello] out with it.\u201d JA 144. Zantello responded by \u201cyell[ing] at him\u201d and \u201clung[ing] towards him ... to grab [Almansour\u2019s] bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nothing required the officers to wait until the individuals came to blows before arresting the would-be combatants; probable cause exists when the officers reasonably believe an individual is \u201cabout to commit an offense,\u201d <em>DeFillippo, </em>443 U.S. at 37, 99 S.Ct. 2627, which they could reasonably infer would have happened at any moment had they not intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Zantello counters that, because the officers could not be sure that he had the requisite intent to violate the law, they did not have probable cause. But this argument overstates the officers\u2019 burden. \u201cIntent, like any other fact, may be proven indirectly by inference from the conduct of the accused and surrounding circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>stances from which it logically and reasonably follows.\u201d <em>People v. Lawton, </em>196 Mich.App. 341, 492 N.W.2d 810, 815 (1992). No one contests that Zantello was holding an iron bar during the altercation or that he and Almansour were in the midst of a heated, expletive-filled argument, both of which would allow a reasonable officer to believe that Zantello \u201cinten[ded] to injure or place [Almansour] in reasonable apprehension of an immediate battery.\u201d <em>Avaut, </em>597 N.W.2d at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Zantello adds that, because he was not holding the iron bar when the officers arrested him, they could not reasonably believe that he was \u201cabout\u201d to assault Almansour with it. Zantello\u2019s own testimony, however, provides an adequate rejoinder. He acknowledges that he held the bar at various points during the altercation, and he concedes that he \u201clunged toward\u201d Almansour in an effort to wrestle one of the bars away from him. And of course the bars remained readily accessible to him and within his control, save for the one Almansour grabbed. Indeed, when the officers arrested him, Zantello admits, he had bent down to \u201cmov[e]\u201d the iron bars. Given the \u201ctense,\u201d \u201chostile\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d situation, the cauldron of uncertainty about what would happen next and Zantello\u2019s access to and control over the won bars, the officers had ample reason to believe that Zantello was about to commit felonious assault. Of course, even if the officers did not have probable cause to arrest Zantello for this assault offense (which they did), they surely had probable cause to arrest him for a run-of-the-mine assault. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.81 (\u201c[A] person who assaults or assaults and batters an individual ... is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days .... \u201d); <em>see also Devenpeck v. Alford, </em>543 U.S. 146,153,125 S.Ct. 588, 160 L.Ed.2d 537 (2004) (The officer\u2019s \u201csubjective reason for making the arrest need not be the criminal offense as to which the known facts provide probable cause.\u201d). The officers are entitled to qualified immunity from this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Did the officers maliciously prosecute Zantello for assault? No, we also conclude. \u201c[A]t a minimum,\u201d to succeed on a malicious-prosecution claim under the Fourth Amendment, \u201ca plaintiff must show ... that there was no probable cause to justify his arrest and prosecution.\u201d <em>Thacker v. City of Columbus, </em>328 F.3d 244, 259 (6th Cir.2003) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Even assuming the officers, as opposed to the prosecutors, could be held responsible for the decision to prosecute Zantello for felonious assault, a point we need not decide, Zantello\u2019s claim fails because his arrest and prosecution as a matter of law were based on probable cause. The officers are entitled to qualified immunity from this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">In addition to protecting individuals from unreasonable seizures and malicious prosecutions, the Fourth Amendment protects them from excessive force during the course of being arrested. <em>See Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 394-95, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). The question whether force is excessive, like the question whether probable cause exists, turns on the objective reasonableness of the officer\u2019s conduct under the circumstances, <em>id. </em>at 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, focused in this setting on \u201c[1] the severity of the crime at issue, [2] whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and [3] whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 396, 109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>S.Ct. 1865. \u201cNot every push or shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge\u2019s chambers, violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">According to Zantello\u2019s fact-supported allegations, this is what happened: After he \u201cyelled at [Almansour], and lunged towards him to grab the bar[,] ... the police officers just literally grabbed [him] and started throwing [him] around.\u201d JA 307. The officers \u201ctwisted [him] around and jerked on [him],\u201d JA 308, and \u201cslammed [him] up against the refrigerator and twisted [his] knee and twisted [his] arm,\u201d JA 296. The officers \u201cpush[ed]\u201d Zantello and \u201cman handled\u201d him while leading him to the back of the cruiser. JA 490. When the officers put Zantello in the car, \u201cthey slam[med][his] head into the police car,\u201d which gave Zantello \u201ca headache.\u201d JA 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The \u201cman handling\u201d and arm twisting, Zantello says, injured his left shoulder. As a result of the encounter, he suffered weakness and a decreased range of motion in his arm and consistent pain. The injury made it difficult to sleep, led to a prescription for pain medication and eventually required surgery for a torn rotator cuff.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">A material issue of fact exists over the officers\u2019 justifications for this use of force. Zantello did not resist or attempt to evade the arrest, the officers nonetheless \u201cman handled\u201d him and \u201ctwisted\u201d his arms while arresting him and he suffered at least one injury serious enough to require surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The evidence, we acknowledge, is not one-sided. The violent nature of the crime (felonious assault) and the fact that the officers reasonably could have concluded that Zantello posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others favor the officers. The problem for the officers is that, according to Zantello, they continued to use force even after they had full control of the scene and even after he cooperated with them. More fully developed facts might well reveal that the officers\u2019 use of force was reasonable \u2014 if, for example, the arm twisting was only slight and incidental to the officers\u2019 effort to restrain Zantello rather than a gratuitous post-arrest exercise of force. But because at this stage in the proceeding we must view the evidence in Zantello\u2019s favor, we agree with the district court that these allegations \u2014 supported by the record\u2014 create a triable issue of fact over whether the officers used excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">We also agree with the district court that this constitutional claim was \u201cclearly established.\u201d Our cases say that \u201cthe right of a nonviolent [and non-resistant] arrestee to be free from unnecessary pain knowingly inflicted during an arrest [i]s clearly established.\u201d <em>St. John v. Hickey, </em>411 F.3d 762, 772, 774 (6th Cir.2005). In the light of this precedent, a reasonable official would understand that the officers\u2019 alleged conduct violated Zantello\u2019s rights. <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). One of the officers in this case, indeed, nearly admitted as much: Officer Underwood testified that, if the officers \u201ctwisted [Zantello\u2019s] arm\u201d in the process of arresting him when he offered no resistance (which is just what Zantello alleges), that would \u201cnot be appropriate.\u201d JA 453-54. The district court did not err in concluding that Zantello\u2019s claim implicates genuine questions of material fact that a jury must decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">For these reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
