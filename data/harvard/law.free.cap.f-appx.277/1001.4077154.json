Because we conclude that the district court did not err in its claim construction and thus properly granted summary judgment of nonin-fringement, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-29\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-30\">Axis-Shield is the assignee of the patents in suit, <em>viz., </em>U.S. Patents 5,631,127 (\u201cthe '127 patent\u201d) and 5,958,717 (\u201cthe '717 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>patent\u201d). The patents relate to methods and kits for assaying homocysteine in a sample such as blood, plasma, or urine. Homocysteine is an intermediary amino acid produced in the body when methionine is metabolized to cysteine. '127 patent col.l 11.8-14. Under normal conditions, homocysteine is quickly metabolized and its concentration is virtually negligible. <em>Id. </em>Elevated levels of homocysteine, however, have been associated with the presence of atherosclerosis and other cardiac and vascular diseases. <em>Id. </em>at col.l 11.42-29. Thus, the detection of homocysteine levels in biological samples is of great clinical significance. <em>Id. </em>at col.l 11.15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Claim 1 of the '127 patent, the only independent claim of that patent, is a representative claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That claim reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-5\">1. In a method for assaying homocy-steine in a sample, said method comprising the steps of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-6\">(i) contacting said sample with a <em>homo-cysteine converting enzyme </em>and at least one <em>substrate </em>for said enzyme other than homocysteine, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-7\">(ii) assessing an <em>analyte </em>which is a substrate for said enzyme,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-8\">wherein the improvement comprises in step (i) contacting said sample with a said substrate other than homocysteine and in step (ii) without chromatographic separation <em>assessing a non-labelled ana-lyte selected from the group consisting of a homocysteine co-substrate and the homocysteine conversion products of the enzymic conversion of homocysteine by said enzyme.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\"><em>Id. </em>claim 1 (emphases added). Claim 1 of the '717 patent, which is also the only independent claim of that patent, contains similar claim language. That claim reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-12\">1. In a method for assaying homocy-steine in a sample, said method comprising the steps of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-13\">(i) contacting said sample with a <em>homo-cysteine-converting enzyme </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-14\">(ii) assessing an analyte,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-15\">wherein the improvement comprises in step (ii) without chromatographic separation <em>assessing a non-labelled analyte selected from the group consisting of the homocysteine conversion products of the enzymic conversion of homocysteine by said enzyme.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-16\">'717 patent claim 1 (emphases added). The claimed methods thus involve the steps of contacting the sample with a ho-mocysteine converting enzyme and assessing an analyte. For the '717 patent, the analyte must be \u201cselected from the group consisting of the homocysteine conversion products of the enzymic conversion of ho-mocysteine by [the homocysteine converting] enzyme.\u201d The '127 patent, in contrast, requires that the analyte be selected from either the \u201chomocysteine co-substrate\u201d or the \u201chomocysteine conversion products of the enzymic conversion of ho-mocysteine by said enzyme.\u201d In addition, both patents specify that chromatographic separation, a time-consuming and cumbersome prior art method that \u201crequires highly specialized and sophisticated equipment,\u201d is not used to assess the analyte. '127 patent col.211.6-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-17\">General Atomics manufactures and sells enzymatic homocysteine assays for the detection of homocysteine levels in human samples. For purposes of this appeal, the accused assay detects the level of homocy-steine in a sample in the following general manner: 1) a co-substrate referred to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>S-adenosyl-L-methionine (\u201cSAM\u201d) is added to the sample; 2) an enzyme referred to as homocysteine-methionine methyl transf-erase (\u201cHMTase\u201d) is then added; 3) the HMTase acts to remove a methyl group from the co-substrate SAM and attach it to the homocysteine, converting the homocy-steine into methionine and SAM into S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (\u201cSAH\u201d); 4) simultaneously, a second enzyme is added, SAH-hydrolase, which catalyzes a reaction that converts SAH to adenosine and non-sample homocysteine; 5) additional steps occur, involving adenosine deaminase and spectro photometric monitoring, to determine the level of SAH produced. <em>Gen. Atomics v. Axis-Shield, </em>No. 05-4074, 2007 WL 1089698, at *3-4 (N.D.Cal. Apr. 11, 2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those steps can be graphically depicted in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"pAst\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">The level of SAH present in the accused assay is proportional to the level of homo-cysteine in the sample. Thus, \u201cmeasuring SAH allows the amount of homocysteine to be determined.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">Axis-Shield informed General Atomics of its belief that its enzymatic homocy-steine assays infringe the '127 and '717 patents. In October 2005, General Atom-ics filed a declaratory judgment action against Axis-Shield seeking a declaration that its products do not infringe and that the patents in suit were invalid and unenforceable. In response, Axis-Shield counterclaimed, asserting claims of patent infringement. In addition to the patents in suit, Axis-Shield originally asserted two other patents, <em>viz., </em>U.S. Patents 6,063,581 (\u201cthe '581 patent\u201d) and 5,827,645 (\u201cthe '645 patent\u201d). All four patents named Erling Sundrehagen as the inventor and Axis Biochemicals as the assignee. Early in the case, however, Axis-Shield dismissed its claims regarding the '581 and '645 patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">On March 3, 2006, pursuant to the Northern District of California\u2019s Patent Local Rules, Axis-Shield served its preliminary infringement contentions and identified its first infringement theory. Axis-Shield asserted that the accused assay infringes the patents in suit based on the manner in which the HMTase enzyme is used in the assay. In particular, Axis-Shield asserted that in the accused assay the sample homocysteine interacts with HMTase enzyme and SAM, which Axis-Shield characterized, respectively, as the \u201chomocysteine converting enzyme\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>\u201chomocysteine co-substrate.\u201d Axis-Shield further asserted that the enzymatic reaction forms two \u201chomocysteine conversion products,\u201d <em>viz., </em>methionine and SAH, and that the accused assay assesses the level of SAH without chromatographic separation. Based on those characterizations, Axis-Shield contended that the accused assay met all of the limitations of the asserted claims. That infringement theory was referred to as the \u201cHMTase infringement theory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">On April 14, 2006, General Atomics moved for summary judgment based on Axis-Shield\u2019s HMTase infringement theory. While that motion was pending, Axis-Shield moved to amend its preliminary infringement contentions. In doing so, Axis-Shield asserted an alternative infringement theory, referred to as the \u201cSAH-hydrolase infringement theory.\u201d That theory focused on the latter stage of the assay during which the level of SAH is determined. Axis-Shield argued that the SAH-hydrolase acts as the \u201chomocysteine converting enzyme,\u201d adenosine acts as the \u201chomocysteine co-substrate,\u201d and SAH acts as the \u201chomocysteine conversion product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">On July 19, 2006, the district court granted General Atomics\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court focused on the \u201cassessing\u201d claim limitation required by both patents in suit. Claim 1 of the '127 patent requires \u201cassessing a non-labelled analyte selected from the group consisting of a <em>homocysteine co-substrate </em>and the <em>homocysteine conversion products </em>of the enzymic conversion of homocysteine by said enzyme.\u201d Claim 1 of the '717 patent, in contrast, only requires \u201cassessing a non-labelled analyte selected from the group consisting of the <em>homocysteine conversion products </em>of the enzymic conversion of ho-mocysteine by said enzyme.\u201d Based on that language, the district court determined that in order to infringe, the analyte assessed in the accused assay must be either a \u201chomocysteine co-substrate\u201d or a \u201chomocysteine conversion product[ ] of the enzymic conversion of homocysteine by said enzyme.\u201d After construing those claim terms, the court concluded that the SAH produced in General Atomics\u2019 assay was neither a \u201chomocysteine co-substrate\u201d nor a \u201chomocysteine conversion productf ] of the enzymic conversion of homocysteine by said enzyme\u201d and granted summary judgment in favor of General Atomics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">On August 7, 2006, 2006 WL 2329464, the district court granted Axis-Shield\u2019s pending motion to amend its preliminary infringement contentions. The court issued a claim construction ruling on September 26, 2006. General Atomics then brought a second summary judgment motion based on Axis-Shield\u2019s SAH-hydrolase infringement theory. On April 11, 2007, the court granted the motion. The court noted that under Axis-Shield\u2019s new infringement theory, SAH is the analyte that is assessed. The court determined, however, that Axis-Shield failed to show that the SAH is a \u201chomocysteine conversion productf] of the enzymic conversion of homocysteine by said enzyme.\u201d Under the new theory, the term \u201csaid enzyme\u201d referred to SAH-hydrolase, and Axis-Shield could not show that the SAH produced in the assay was a product of the SAH-hydro-lase enzymic conversion of homocysteine. As such, the court concluded that Axis-Shield failed to show that the accused assay met the \u201cassessing a non-labelled ana-lyte\u201d limitation required by the asserted claims and again granted summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of General Atomics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">On May 1, 2007, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of all outstanding claims. The district court entered final judgment on May 2, 2007. Axis-Shield timely ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>pealed the court\u2019s decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>reapplying the standard applicable at the district court. <em>See Rodime PLC v. Seagate Tech., Inc., </em>174 F.3d 1294, 1301 (Fed.Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ.P. 56(e). In addition, in deciding a motion for summary judgment, \u201c[t]he evidence of the nomnovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">A determination of infringement requires a two-step analysis. \u201cFirst, the court determines the scope and meaning of the patent claims asserted.... [Second,] the properly construed claims are compared to the allegedly infringing device.\u201d <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1454 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc) (citations omitted). Step one, claim construction, is an issue of law, <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 970-71 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc), affd, 517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996), that we review de <em>novo, Cybor, </em>138 F.3d at 1456. Step two, comparison of the claim to the accused device, requires a determination that every claim limitation or its equivalent be found in the accused device. <em>See Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., </em>520 U.S. 17, 29, 117 S. Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997). Those determinations are questions of fact, and on summary judgment, the issue is whether there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding infringement. <em>Bai v. L &amp; L Wings, Inc., </em>160 F.3d 1350, 1353 (Fed.Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">Axis-Shield raises a myriad of arguments on appeal, not all of which need to be treated by this court in light of the conclusions we have reached. Axis-Shield primarily asserts that the district court erred in granting summary judgment under both infringement theories because the court\u2019s conclusions were premised on incorrect claim construction. With respect to the first summary judgment decision relating to its HMTase infringement theory, Axis-Shield argues that the court erred in construing \u201chomocysteine conversion products\u201d and thus erred in concluding that the accused assay did not meet that claim limitation. With regard to the second summary judgment decision relating to the SAH-hydrolase infringement theory, Axis-Shield argues that the court erred in determining that the accused assay did not meet the \u201cassessing\u201d limitation of the claims. According to Axis-Shield, the court\u2019s error was based on incorrect claim construction of several claim terms, including \u201chomocysteine conversion products,\u201d \u201chomocysteine converting enzyme,\u201d and \u201chomocysteine co-substrate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">In response, General Atomics defends the district court\u2019s claim construction. Thus, according to General Atomics, summary judgment of noninfringement was proper because there <em>were no </em>genuine issues of material fact as to whether the accused assay infringed the asserted claims and General Atomics was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">\n<em>A. Axis-Shield\u2019s HMTase Infringement Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">We first address the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>premised on Axis-Shield\u2019s HMTase infringement theory. The crux of the district court\u2019s decision rested on the claim term \u201chomocysteine conversion products.\u201d In construing that term, the court concluded that \u201chomocysteine conversion products\u201d are \u201cthose products of the homocy-steine conversion reaction that are derived from homocysteine.\u201d <em>Gen. Atomics v. Axis-Shield, </em>440 F.Supp.2d 1083, 1095 (N.D.Cal.2006). The relevant issue on appeal with respect to that term is whether the district court correctly concluded that a homocysteine conversion product must be derived from homocysteine. We agree with General Atomics and the district court that it does.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">To determine the proper meaning of \u201chomocysteine conversion products,\u201d we need do little more than to look to the language of the claims. Here, the plain language of both independent claims supports the district court\u2019s construction. The claims recite that the assessed analyte is \u201cselected from the group consisting of the <em>homocysteine </em>conversion products of the enzymic conversion of <em>homocysteine </em>by said enzyme.\u201d '127 patent claim 1, '717 patent claim 1 (emphases added). That language indicates that the \u201cproducts\u201d are those products that result from the conversion of homocysteine. Indeed, the latter portion of the claim limitation \u2014 \u201cof the enzymic conversion of <em>homocysteine </em>by said enzyme\u201d \u2014 emphasizes this point by focusing solely on homocysteine and its conversion into another compound or compounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Contrary to Axis-Shield\u2019s assertion, the language of the claim does not refer to just any product resulting from the homo-cysteine conversion reaction. Had the claim been written as \u201chomocysteine conversion <em>reaction </em>products,\u201d or \u201cproducts of the homocysteine conversion <em>reaction,\u201d </em>Axis-Shield\u2019s argument might be more tenable because that might suggest that the products may be any products resulting from a homocysteine conversion reaction. Indeed, when referencing the reaction as a whole in the specification, the patentee used broader terms such as \u201chomocysteine conversion reaction\u201d or \u201creaction.\u201d <em>See </em>'127 patent col.2 11.42-45 (\u201cThe homocysteine co-substrate assessed in the method of the invention is a compound which reacts with homocysteine in the enzyme catalyzed ... <em>homocysteine conversion reaction\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at eol.3 11.1-4 (\u201c[t]he preferred homocysteine converting enzyme used according to the invention is S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase (SAH-hydrolase) which catalyses [sic] the <em>homocysteine reaction </em>\u201d) (emphasis added). However, because the plain language of the claim refers specifically to the conversion of homocysteine when defining the group of \u201cproducts\u201d from which an analyte may be selected, the claim as written indicates that \u201cproducts\u201d refers to products that result from the enzymic conversion of homocysteine, not products that otherwise result from the reaction. Such a construction gives full meaning to every word of the entire claim term. <em>Bicon, Inc. v. Straumann Co., </em>441 F.3d 945, 950 (Fed.Cir.2006) (\u201cclaims are interpreted with an eye toward giving effect to all terms in the claim\u201d). A homocysteine conversion product of the enzymic conversion of homocysteine is a product converted from homocysteine by an enzyme. For example, methionine is a homocysteine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>conversion product because it is simply homocysteine in which a hydrogen atom has been replaced by a methyl group. It is a modification of homocysteine. Thus, the district court\u2019s construction, which requires the homocysteine conversion products to be derived from the homocysteine compound, is supported by the plain language of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">In addition to the clear guidance provided by the claim language, we may also turn to the specification to determine whether the patentee attributed a different meaning to the term. As an initial matter, we note that aside from the Abstract, which mirrors the claim language, the term \u201chomocysteine conversion products\u201d does not appear in the specification. While the specification refers to other terms such as \u201cconversion products\u201d or \u201cproducts,\u201d those references, which do not relate to <em>\u201chomocysteine </em>conversion products,\u201d shed no light on the meaning of that claim term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">The district court\u2019s claim construction actually tracks the first embodiment disclosed in the specification. In describing the invention, the specification discloses the following homocysteine reaction which is catalyzed by the enzyme SAH-hydro-lase:</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">T27 patent col.3 11.1-9. According to the specification, SAH-hydrolase is the preferred homocysteine converting enzyme. The specification further discloses that the above reaction is reversible; that is, the reaction could run in either direction. In the forward direction, adenosine and ho-mocysteine combine to form SAH. In the reverse reaction, SAH hydrolyzes to form adenosine and homocysteine. <em>Id. </em>at col.3 11.10-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">This embodiment reflects the forward direction of the reaction. Adenosine acts as the homocysteine co-substrate, which the patent defines as \u201ca compound which reacts with homocysteine in the enzyme catalysed [sic], <em>e.g., </em>a SAH-hydrolase cata-lysed [sic], homocysteine conversion reaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col.2 11.42-45. SAH-hydro-lase acts as the homocysteine converting enzyme. Both adenosine and homocy-steine react in the presence of SAH-hydro-lase to yield SAH \u2014 the homocysteine conversion product. The specification teaches that \u201cthe amount of homocysteine in the sample can ... be determined from the alteration in the adenosine concentration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col.2 11.44-45. Because SAH is derived from the homocysteine molecule and is the homocysteine conversion product, the district court\u2019s construction of \u201chomo-cysteine conversion products\u201d reflects that embodiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">Axis-Shield asserts that the court\u2019s claim construction is unduly narrow in light of other embodiments disclosed in the specification, including the second embodiment referred to as the inhibition embodiment. That embodiment \u201ctake[s] particular advantage of the fact that ho-mocysteine acts as an inhibitor of SAH-hydrolase, suppressing the hydrolysis reaction which forms homocysteine and ade-nosine and pushing the reaction equilibrium in favour [sic] of SAH synthesis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col.3 11.16-20. In that embodiment, the level of homocysteine is measured by contacting the test sample with SAH and SAH-hydrolase. <em>Id. </em>at col.3 11.48-55. As a result of the hydrolysis reaction, SAH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>would break apart to form homocysteine and adenosine. <em>Id. </em>Because of the inhibiting effect homocysteine has on SAH-hydrolase, however, \u201c[a]ny homocysteine present in the test sample will counteract this net reaction, and thus inhibit the formation of adenosine, the amount of which is monitored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col.S 11.52-55. Thus, by measuring the amount of remaining adenosine, the level of homocy-steine can be determined. Specifically, the amount of adenosine would be inversely proportional to the amount of sample homocysteine. Axis-Shield argues that the district court\u2019s claim construction cannot be correct because it would not cover this inhibition embodiment. In particular, Axis-Shield notes that adenosine \u2014 which is the analyte being assessed \u2014 is neither a homocysteine conversion product because it is not derived from homocysteine, nor a homocy-steine co-substrate because it does not react with homocysteine in the homocy-steine conversion reaction of the assay under the court\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">We are not persuaded by Axis-Shield\u2019s argument. A claim need not cover all embodiments in a patent specification. <em>PSN Ill., LLC v. Ivoclar Vivadent, Inc., </em>525 F.3d 1159, 1166-67 (Fed.Cir.2008). Prosecution strategies may evolve so that some embodiments are covered in a patent and others are not. Here, while it is correct that the inhibition embodiment is not covered by the asserted claims under the district court\u2019s claim construction because the analyte that is assessed (adenosine) is neither a homocysteine conversion product nor a homocysteine co-substrate, it appears from the record that that inhibition embodiment is covered by claim 17 of the '581 patent resulting from the parent application of the patents in suit, which was originally asserted against General Atomics but subsequently dismissed from this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Axis-Shield\u2019s assertion that \u201chomocysteine conversion products\u201d must be construed broadly so that the asserted claims cover the inhibition embodiment is inapt, particularly in light of the plain language of the claim, which is both clear and unambiguous, <em>see Ethicou Endo-Suvgenj, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., </em>93 F.3d 1572, 1579 (Fed.Cir.1996) (rejecting a proffered construction because \u201cthe plain meaning of the claim [would] not bear [such] a reading\u201d), and the coverage of this embodiment in the parent patent. The patentee chose to use the term \u201chomocysteine conversion products\u201d in the asserted claims of the '127 and '717 patents, which require that the products at issue are those that result from the conversion of homocysteine. As such, we decline to depart from the plain meaning of the claim term by expanding the scope of \u201cproducts\u201d to include any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>product resulting from the homocysteine conversion reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">Accordingly, because the analyte assessed in the accused assay is SAH, which is a conversion product of SAM, not of homocysteine, we conclude that the court properly granted summary judgment of noninfringement based on Axis-Shields\u2019 HMTase infringement theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">\n<em>B. Axis-Shield\u2019s SAH-Hyd.iv\u00edase Infringement Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">The district court also granted summary judgment based on Axis-Shield\u2019s SAH-hy-drolase infringement theory, in which Axis-Shield appears to assert that the accused assay infringes the asserted claims because it allegedly uses a homocysteine conversion enzyme, <em>viz., </em>SAH-hydrolase, and assesses an analyte that is either a homocysteine co-substrate (adenosine) or a homocysteine conversion product (SAH), during the latter phase of the process. The district court rejected Axis-Shield\u2019s assertion. In a well-reasoned opinion, the court determined that the accused assay fails to meet the properly-construed claim limitations because it cannot differentiate between SAH produced from a SAH-hy-drolase reaction and that from an HMTase reaction. It therefore does not meet the \u201cassessing a non-labelled analyte\u201d limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">In challenging the court's decision, Axis-Shield raises several arguments in asserting that the accused product infringes under this alternate theory. Axis-Shield relies in part on its previous argument that the court erred in construing the term \u201chomocysteine conversion products.\u201d For the reasons stated above, that argument is rejected. Axis-Shield further argues that the court erred by improperly construing the terms \u201chomocysteine converting enzyme\u201d and \u201chomocysteine co-substrate,\u201d and also erred by failing to correctly apply other constructions stipulated by the parties. Having carefully reviewed Axis-Shield\u2019s arguments, we find no error in the court\u2019s analysis and conclude that Axis-Shield fails to identify any basis for reversing the court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we thus affirm the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment based on Axis-Shield\u2019s alternate theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">We have considered all of the remaining arguments Axis-Shield has raised in its briefs with regard to its theories of infringement and find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court correctly construed the relevant disputed terms, properly applied the stipulated claim construction, and appropriately granted summaz-y judgment of nozzin-fringement in favor of General Atomics. The decision of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">. The '127 and '717 patents derive from the same parent application and have nearly identical specifications. For ease of reference, throughout the opinion we will cite the '127 patent when referencing the common specification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">. The parties disputed certain aspects of the process employed in the accused assay. For purposes of summary judgment, however, the court drew all reasonable inferences in favor of Axis-Shield as the nonmoving party and accepted as true Axis-Shield's characterization of the process. <em>Id. </em>at *3-5. The description of the accused assay above is representative of Axis-Shield's characterization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">. Axis-Shield does not argue that, under its HMTase infringement theory, the accused assay is within the '127 patent claims because the analyte that is assessed is a homocysteine co-substrate. Therefore, our discussion with respect to Axis-Shield's HMTase infringement theory is confined to the construction of the \"homocysteine conversion product\u201d limitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">.
