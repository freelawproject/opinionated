The district court sentenced Tyler to concurrent prison terms, 60 months on Count One and 72 months on Count Three. He now appeals his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Tyler argues that, in determining the sentence range under the Guidelines, the district court erred by (1) failing to state with particularity its reasons for applying a two-level offense level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and (2) imposing a sentence above the Guideline range that amounted to an impermissible upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The court invoked the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement because it concluded that Tyler gave perjured testimony at his trial. Tyler contends that the court did not make either particularized findings as to each element of perjury or a general finding of obstruction of justice that \u201cencompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Section 3C1.1 of the Guidelines permits a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The application notes include as covered conduct \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(b)). The Supreme Court has defined perjury in this context to be \u201cfalse testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">When applying the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, \u201cthe district court should make specific findings as to each alleged instance of obstruction by identifying the materially false statements individually.\u201d <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cHowever, a general finding that an enhancement is warranted suffices if it encompasses all of the factual predicates necessary for a perjury finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Also, \u201ca remand is unnecessary if the record clearly reflects the basis for enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Uscinski, </em>369 F.3d 1243, 1246 (11th Cir. 2004). Where the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) details the statements constituting the perjury, counsel elaborates on those statements at the sentencing hearing, and the court adopts the PSI, detailed findings are not necessary. <em>United States v. Hubert, </em>138 F.3d 912, 915 (11th Cir.1998). Moreover, if the defendant does not request particularized perjury findings at the sentencing hearing, he cannot \u201ccomplain to this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number><em>United States v. Geffrard, </em>87 F.3d 448, 453 (11th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In this case, the record fully supports the court\u2019s finding that Tyler committed perjury; and more particularized findings were unnecessary. Therefore, the district court did not plainly err in applying the enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Tyler argues that the district court erred in considering his arrest record alone as a basis to increase his sentence above the Guidelines sentence range. He says that we should review a sentence above the sentence range according to the method for reviewing departures pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, even if the sentence was a variance from the sentence range pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Unreasonableness may be procedural\u2014 when a court\u2019s procedure does not follow the requirements of Booker \u2014 or substantive. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">For a sentence to be proeedurally reasonable, a district court must first correctly calculate the range under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Second, the district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) is sufficient under Booker.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">If the district court has committed no significant procedural error, we evaluate a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness for abuse of discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances, \u201c[rjegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d namely to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). We review only the final sentence for reasonableness, not each decision made in the process. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). The burden of showing that a sentence is unreasonable is on the party challenging the sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. There is a range of reasonable sentences. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Section 4A1.3 of the Guidelines provides for an upward departure if a defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or likelihood for recidivism. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). In determining the basis for an upward departure, a court may consider, among other things, \u201cprior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(E). The court, however, cannot consider \u201ca prior arrest record itself.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3). We have held that where the district court correctly calculated the advisory guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>range, considered the adequacy of the range in light of the U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and exercised its discretion to impose a sentence outside the guidelines range, the district court imposed a variance rather than an upward departure. <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert, granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 828, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The record shows that the court imposed an upward variance from the Guidelines sentence range and did not impose an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. The record further shows that Tyler\u2019s 72-months sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable. Based on its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence that was 10 months above the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\">.
