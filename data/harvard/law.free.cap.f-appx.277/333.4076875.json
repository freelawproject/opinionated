Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In January 2005, Meyers filed a lawsuit in Texas state court alleging that LPISD denied Jannell the \u201copportunity to participate and to perform at the level at which she was capable\u201d on its varsity and junior varsity softball teams in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 (\u201cTitle IX\u201d), and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Between 2000 and 2003, Jannell played on the LPISD junior varsity softball team. She played on the varsity team during the 2003-04 school year. Meyers alleged that the teams\u2019 coaches discriminated against Jannell and denied her playing time on the basis of her race. As a result, Jannell allegedly lost scholarships and other opportunities to play softball at the collegiate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">LPISD removed the case to federal court and later moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted in April 2007. Meyers filed a timely notice of appeal and challenges only the district court\u2019s disposition of her section 1981 and 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">Meyers argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment because she presented <em>prima fade </em>evidence of racial discrimination by Jannell\u2019s coaches. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Ma-cLachlan v. ExxonMobil Corp., </em>350 F.3d 472, 478 (5th Cir.2003). A court should grant summary judgment when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue at to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, All </em>U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Facts are material only if they \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., All </em>U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">B. Section 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-17\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">A local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Sevs. of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>see also Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>7 F.3d 1241 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that a school district was not vicariously liable for the unlawful actions of its superintendent). The plaintiff must identify the specific policy or custom, and show that the final policy maker, through its \u201cdeliberate conduct,\u201d was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the violation. <em>Bryan County v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 405, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997). Under Texas law, final policy-making authority in an independent school district rests with the district\u2019s board of trustees. <em>Jett, </em>7 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Although Meyers produced some evidence that Jannell was subject to racial discrimination by her coaches, even assuming that evidence is true Meyers did not identify any official policy or established custom that was the source of the discrimination, nor did she produce any evidence that LPISD was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the coaches\u2019 decision to limit Jannell\u2019s playing time. <em>See Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 405, 117 S.Ct. 1382. Additionally, Meyers produced no evidence that LPISD knew about or had constructive knowledge of any potential discrimination by the coaches. <em>See Pineda v. City of Houston, </em>291 F.3d 325, 330 (5th Cir.2002) (stating that plaintiff must show that policymaker knew about repeated violations in order for the violations to become a \u201ccustom\u201d). On this record, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment to LPISD on Meyers\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">C. Section 1981</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Section 1981 ensures that all persons in the United States have the same right to make and enforce contracts and prevents impairment of those rights by government and non-government actors. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. But \u00a7 1981 does not provide an independent cause of action. <em>Oden v. Oktibbeha County, </em>246 F.3d 458, 462-63 (5th Cir.2001). In order to remedy violations of \u00a7 1981, a plaintiff must assert a cause of action under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>Meyers\u2019s independent \u00a7 1981 claim \u2014 not brought through \u00a7 1983 \u2014 against LPISD is contrary to <em>Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist. : </em>\u201c[T]he express \u2018action at law5 provided by \u00a7 1983 for the \u2018deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,\u2019 provides the exclusive federal damages remedy for the violation of the rights guaranteed by \u00a7 1981 when the claim is pressed against a state actor.\u201d 491 U.S. 701, 735, 109 S.Ct. 2702, 105 L.Ed.2d 598 (1989); <em>see also Felton v. Polles, </em>315 F.3d 470, 482 (5th Cir.2002). This requirement \u201cis not a mere pleading formality.\u201d <em>Felton, </em>315 F.3d at 482 Because Meyers brought her \u00a7 1981 claim independently of her \u00a7 1983 claim, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment to LPISD.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">We observe that even if Meyers had pleaded her \u00a7 1981 claim correctly, Meyers was required to show that LPISD\u2019s conduct interfered with an actual contractual relationship, not a speculative or prospective one. <em>Morris v. Dillard Dep\u2019t </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Stores, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 743, 751 (5th Cir. 2001). But Meyers alleged only that LPISD\u2019s conduct, that is, the coaches\u2019 conduct, prevented Jannell from potential \u201copportunities]\u201d to play collegiate softball. Therefore, because she did not allege or show the existence of an actual contractual relationship, or even some kind of offer from a college or university, she failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Morris, </em>277 F.3d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-18\">. Meyers also asserted various state law tort claims against LPISD.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
