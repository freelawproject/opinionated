He now appeals his sentence, raising one issue: whether his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">Gonzalez first argues that the district court violated the \u201cone book\u201d rule by relying on the 1995 Sentencing Guidelines Manual instead of the 2006 Sentencing Guidelines Manual, which does not recognize multiple prior deportations as a ground for an upward departure. He argues next that, because the district court, in imposing the above-sentence range sentence, (1) never referred to a \u201cvariance\u201d or to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), (2) did not discuss the reasonableness of his sentence in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and (3) specifically referred to an \u201cupward departure\u201d in the context of the Guidelines, it was clear that the court intended his sentence to be an upward departure \u201cunder a traditional guideline calculation.\u201d Gonzalez contends that the court failed to follow the proper procedures for departing upwardly under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 because it \u201cpresumably jumped from a Criminal History Category of III to a Criminal History Category VI\u201d without explaining how he compared to other defendants who fall into criminal history category VI; thus, the court failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>to conduct the required \u201cguided analysis\u201d of the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">After <em>Booker, </em>sentencing is a two-step process that requires the district court first to \u201cconsult the Guidelines and correctly calculate the range provided by the Guidelines,\u201d and then to determine a reasonable sentence after considering \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo, and the sentence imposed for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted), which is \u201ca deferential abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence may be proeedurally unreasonable if it results from a procedure that does not follow the requirements of <em>Booker, </em>and may be substantively unreasonable, irrespective of the procedure used. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">An above-guidelines sentence is a variance, and not a Guidelines departure, where the district court: (1) correctly calculates the advisory Guidelines range; (2) considers the adequacy of this range in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and (3) concludes that the Guidelines range does not adequately address those factors. <em>See United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 828, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008). Where the court fails to cite to a specific Guidelines departure provision and states that the Guidelines do not adequately take into account the severity of the offense, the district court\u2019s imposition of an above-Guidelines sentence is not an upward Guidelines departure. <em>See United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783, 788 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that \u201c[it was] not reviewing the propriety of a \u2018guidelines\u2019 departure\u201d where the district court treated its decision to impose an above-guideline sentence as an exercise of its discretion), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 251, 166 L.Ed.2d 196 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we consider the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2006). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-14\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to the victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-15\"><em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). While the court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">The record of Gonzalez\u2019s sentencing proceeding demonstrates that the district court relied solely on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to vary upward from the prescribed sentence range, and therefore, treated its decision to impose a sentence above that range as a variance, rather than an up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>ward departure. Accordingly, it did not err in failing to follow the procedural requirements for a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, nor did it violate the one book rule. Further, because the court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the sentence imposed was reasonable in light of those factors, the sentence is not the product of an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-13\">. Gonzalez had been convicted on March <em>2, </em>2004, of Tampering with a Motor Vehicle and Possession of a Controlled Substance and sentenced to probation for a term of five years. On August 13, 2004, he was deported to Mexico. Gonzalez was deported from the United States to Mexico on four prior occasions (all for immigration violations), on January 4, 2001, July 18, 2002, June 27, 2003, and August 5, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
