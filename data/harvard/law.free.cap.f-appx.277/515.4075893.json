Richardson was sentenced within a properly-calculated range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Richardson argues that the district court erred by applying a presumption of reasonableness to the Guidelines range and required him to overcome this presumption contrary to <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S., 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Richardson argues that because the district court applied this presumption, it failed to give sufficient weight to the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States</em>, U.S. , 128 S.Ct. 586, 594,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Kimbrough v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)); <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2459. We review for procedural error under a mixed <em>de novo </em>/clear error<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> standard and review the substantive reasonableness of procedurally-sound sentences imposed inside or outside the Guidelines range under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In determining whether there was procedural error in sentencing we ask, among other things, whether the district court correctly calculated the \u201capplicable Guidelines range,\u201d and whether the court considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cto determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596. In considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentencing court, as Richardson argues, \u201cdoes not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2465; <em>see also Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97 (in considering the factors, the district court \u201cmay not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">We review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence\u201d for abuse of discretion. Where, as here, the sentence falls within a properly-calculated Guidelines range, this court has held that the sentence should be afforded a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness on appeal. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court has affirmed the use of this presumption. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597 (citing Rita) (\u201cIf the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness.\u201d); <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462 (concluding that an appellate court \u201cmay apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">Richardson urges that the sentence imposed was procedurally flawed because the district court applied a presumption of reasonableness to the applicable Guidelines range and failed to give sufficient weight to the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In rejecting Richardson\u2019s request for a below-Guidelines sentence, the district court did not require Richardson to overcome a presumption that the Guidelines range should apply or that the Guidelines range was reasonable. Unlike in the Sixth Circuit case of <em>United States v. Wilms </em>cited by Richardson, where the sentencing court stated that \u201c \u2018the guidelines are presumptively reasonable,\u201d\u2019 495 F.3d 277, 279 (6th Cir.2007), the district court did not indicate any such presumption in its decision. When Richardson\u2019s attorney asked the court for a variance from the Guidelines or from the Guidelines range, citing to Richardson\u2019s family support obligations, his education, and his work ethic, the judge considered these factors but stated, \u201cthere\u2019s other considerations\u201d such as \u201cthe societal problem of trying to deter drug trafficking. The fairness and equality of how others are treated, consistency in treating people, deterrence, et cetera....\u201d Nor did the court, in considering the consistency of sentencing, treat the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of <em>Booker </em>or the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>recent holdings of <em>Kimbrough;</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rather, it properly considered consistency as one of the factors. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 574 (addressing a <em>Booker </em>question of whether the crack/powder sentencing ratios are mandatory in light of the \u201cneed to avoid unwarranted disparities\u201d in sentencing, and holding that they are not mandatory). Finally, the judge\u2019s statement that \u201c[w]e have to have a pretty unusual reason to \u2014 to vary from the safety valve. And all the stuff you\u2019re talking about is kind of routine\u201d does not indicate that he presumed the Guidelines to be reasonable. Nor does this statement show that the judge believed that a deviation from the Guidelines would be justified only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The judge\u2019s statements during the sentencing hearing also reflected consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) describes seven factors to be considered by the sentencing judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established ...</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">(5) any pertinent policy statement\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">In imposing Richardson\u2019s sentence, the court considered and gave sufficient weight to these factors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Richardson has not shown any procedural flaw in his sentencing and also has not overcome the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his sentence on appeal. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\">. Specifically, we review the courts's interpretation or application of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\">. Although <em>Kimbrough </em>generally applies to sentencing cases involving crack or cocaine, Richardson argues that its principles are relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">. The judge stated, for example, \"And you ... came up to the checkpoint ... in a commercial tractor-trailer rig and inside was some marijuana. Roughly, 70 some kilos.\u201d He considered Richardson's personal history, including his various jobs and educational pursuits, how he was \"raised mostly\u201d by his mother, and how Richardson has family members to support. The judge's statements about the offense (drug trafficking) and the \"societal problem\u201d of attempting to deter that kind of offense show that he considered the need for the sentence imposed and the policy associated with the sentence, and as we have discussed, he expressly considered the need to treat similar offenses consistently. He also discussed the potential sentences and the sentencing range in Richardson's case, including the Government\u2019s recommendation of the safety valve, \"which was originally designed more for people who are facing heavy minimum sentences, which you\u2019re [referring to Richardson] not,\" and how the range was 41 to 51 months, but that it \"dropped down to 17.\u201d He stated, \"you\u2019re not going to be in Column 2 or Column 3 or Column 4. And you're not being prevented from the safety valve. And you are going to get less than this report .... but you're going to serve some time.\u201d Finally, he considered payment, although not labeling it as restitution, stating, \"I'm supposed to fine you thousands of dollars. I\u2019ll skip that and let you serve out in what we call community service hours .... 100 hours ... doing something useful ... to help out in the community ... that\u2019s a way of paying off a substantial fine that I\u2019m supposed to give you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
