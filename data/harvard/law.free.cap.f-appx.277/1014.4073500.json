Doyle challenges the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming a decision of the Department of the Army (\u201cagency\u201d) to remove petitioner from his position. Because we conclude that petitioner\u2019s challenges to the credibility findings made by the Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) and adopted by the Board, and to the Board\u2019s review of the agency\u2019s selection of a penalty, are without merit, we <em>affirm </em>the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-17\">Petitioner was a civilian aircraft pilot employed by the agency at the Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center Flight Activity in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Petitioner was assigned as a pilot in command on a planned thirty-nine day mission, which began on June 13, 2005, to fly an aircraft from Arizona to a military base in Apiay, Colombia and to conduct testing of a new foliage-penetrating radar system. Brian E. Trai-nor, a major in the New Mexico Air National Guard, was assigned as petitioner\u2019s co-pilot for the flight to Colombia, and two other personnel, Thomas L. Boutwell and Michael Morris, were also assigned to the mission. En route to Apiay, the crew stopped overnight in New Orleans, Louisiana; stopped for several nights at Boca Chica Airbase in Key West, Florida; landed to refuel in the Cayman Islands; and stopped overnight in Barranquilla, Colombia, and briefly in Bogota, Colombia. On approximately June 21, 2005, after flying the aircraft to Apiay as planned, petitioner was relieved of his duties based on alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-18\">On August 19, 2005, petitioner was issued a notice of proposed removal alleging three charges: \u201c1) discourtesy; 2) careless or reckless operation of an aircraft, contrary to FAA regulation \u00a7 91.13, endangering personnel and property; and 3) failure to follow orders where safety of persons or property is endangered.\u201d <em>Doyle v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>No. PH-0752-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>06-0158-1-1, slip op. at 2 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 15, 2007) (\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). The first charge contained three specifications, alleging that petitioner was rude to Trainor during a cab ride to the airport in New Orleans and alleging that on two occasions petitioner was rude to Major Kodjo Knox-Limbacker, the overall commander of the operation, during briefings in Apiay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">The second charge contained four specifications all relating to unsafe operation of the aircraft and specifically alleging that petitioner: (1) failed to follow ail' traffic control directions while departing from Lakefront Airport in New Orleans; (2) recklessly flew through a storm on his approach to Boca Chica in Key West, Florida; (3) failed to follow reasonable safety procedures on his approach to Barranquilla, Colombia; and (4) flew directly toward dangerous mountain terrain in icing conditions after he should have known to turn back, during a validation flight from Apiay, Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The third charge contained three specifications, alleging that petitioner: (1) failed to obtain required permission to enter and leave the restricted military section of the Barranquilla airport; (2) directly disobeyed air traffic control directions during an approach to Apiay, Colombia; and (3) failed to follow instructions to turn over his weapon for secure storage during his stay in Apiay, Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">On November 18, 2005, the agency sustained the charges and determined that removal was the appropriate penalty. Petitioner appealed his removal to the Board. The AJ held a hearing and subsequently issued an initial decision sustaining all three charges, but did not sustain specifications 1 and 2 of charge 2. The AJ sustained the penalty of removal. The AJ found that Trainor\u2019s testimony at the hearing was more credible than petitioner\u2019s version of the events, based on, among other things, Trainor\u2019s demeanor and the corroboration of many aspects of Trainor\u2019s testimony by other witnesses. Petitioner filed a petition for review with the full Board, and the Board denied the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">Petitioner timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">Petitioner raises two arguments on appeal. First, petitioner argues that the AJ erred by crediting Trainor\u2019s testimony over petitioner\u2019s own contradictory testimony. An AJ\u2019s credibility determinations, particularly when based in part on the demeanor of witnesses, are \u201cvirtually unreviewable\u201d by this court. <em>Chambers v. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>515 F.3d 1362, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2008); <em>Hambsch v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed.Cir.1986). Applying this standard, we will not overturn credibility determinations unless the testimony credited by the AJ is \u201cinherently improbable or discredited by undisputed evidence or physical fact.\u201d <em>Hanratty v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>819 F.2d 286, 288 (Fed. Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Hagmeyer v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>757 F.2d 1281, 1284 (Fed.Cir. 1985)). Petitioner\u2019s attacks on the AJ\u2019s credibility findings in this case fall well short of satisfying this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">Second, petitioner argues that the Board failed to consider possible \u201cundiagnosed medical issues,\u201d Br. of Pet\u2019r at 19, particularly a lack of \u201cmental stability and personality problems,\u201d Reply Br. of Pet\u2019r at 8, as a mitigating factor in determining whether the penalty of removal was appropriate. Petitioner has not shown that he argued before the Board that any past medical problems should mitigate the penalty. Accordingly, petitioner has failed to show that this issue was preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the determination of the Board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">\n<em>No costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
