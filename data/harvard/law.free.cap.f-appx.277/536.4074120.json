Gleason (\u201cGleason\u201d) appeals his sentence of seventy-eight months in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of $2,500, and a $100 assessment following his plea of guilty to one count of traveling in interstate commerce with intent to engage in illicit sexual contact with a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b). Gleason challenges his sentence on two grounds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>First, Gleason argues that the district court failed to comply with Rule 32(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and provide notice that it was considering an upward variance. Second, Gleason contends that his seventy-eight-month sentence, which exceeds the applicable Guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable. Because we hold that Gleason <em>did </em>in fact receive notice of the grounds on which the district court relied in imposing an upward variance and because we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Gleason, we AFFIRM Gleason\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Beginning on May 11, 2005, Gleason engaged in internet chats with an individual using the screen name \u201cgwenoh\u201d who claimed to be a fourteen-year-old girl from Columbus, Ohio, but who was in fact a Detective in the Dublin, Ohio Police Department. In their chats, Gleason described himself as a thirty-seven-year-old soldier in the Army, discussed various sexual activities, explained that because he had a vasectomy they could have sex without her becoming pregnant, and provided his phone number. A female employee of the Dublin Police Department called the provided number and confirmed plans to meet on May 27 at a park in Dublin, Ohio, and Gleason mentioned that he could bring some \u201cBlackberry Merlot\u201d wine. Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 11 (Aff. in Support of Complaint at 3). On May 27, 2005, Gleason was arrested in Dublin after traveling to the specified park from Ft. Knox, Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">On May 31, 2005, Gleason was released on house arrest with electronic monitoring. Gleason, then a 49 year-old active-duty Sergeant First Class in the United States Army, was stationed at Ft. Knox, Kentucky, and his Bond Order required him to remain on the military base in Kentucky (except for court appearances or meetings with counsel), to report frequently to Pretrial Services, to refrain from using computers or accessing the internet. Gleason also agreed to pay for the costs of the electronic monitoring if he was financially able to do so after supporting his family. In May 2005, Gleason was married with two male children, ages sixteen and ten, who resided with their mother in Bowling Green, Ohio. Although stationed in Kentucky, Gleason considered Bowling Green his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Investigation into Gleason revealed that he had previously chatted online with other female minors, discussed sexual activities with them, and offered to meet some of them. Gleason\u2019s computer contained images of nude or partially nude female minors, and a few images depicted underage females engaging in sexual acts. Gleason explained that his online correspondence with young girls began as a fantasy but became too real and that \u201cit started as something to do, while he was away from his family serving in the Army.\u201d J.A. at 157 (Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) at 1127, 25). According to testimony presented at Gleason\u2019s sentencing hearing by Special Agent James Olmstead of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the Department of Defense, on two occasions Gleason had previously traveled to Akron, Ohio, to meet a girl who claimed to be nineteen years old but was in fact sixteen or seventeen years old. The two had been communicating \u201cfor a couple of years.\u201d J.A. at 91 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">In August 2005, a grand jury indicted Gleason on two counts, the first count charging Gleason with traveling in interstate commerce with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b), and the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>count seeking forfeiture of certain facilitating equipment, such as Gleason\u2019s computer and cellular phone, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(a)(3). Gleason pleaded not guilty, and the district court set January 23, 2006, as the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On January 23, 2006, Gleason changed his plea and pleaded guilty to the first count in the indictment pursuant to a plea agreement and agreed to the forfeiture in the second count. At the change-of-plea hearing, the parties agreed to schedule the sentencing for sometime after July 31, 2006, so that Gleason could retire from the Army and so that his family could receive his retirement benefits. During this time, Gleason remained free on his original bond conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In February 2006, the Probation Office completed Gleason\u2019s PSR. Using the 2005 edition of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual, the probation officer arrived at a Total Offense Level of 23 for Gleason. An offense level of 23 combined with Gleason\u2019s criminal history category of I produced a Guidelines range of 46 to 57 months in prison. The probation officer recommended a sentence of 46 months, the bottom of the Guidelines range, because Gleason \u201chas no prior record of arrest and has a good record of military service.\u201d J.A. at 166 (Sentencing Recommendation).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">As of October 2006, the district court had not set a date for sentencing. On October 24, 2006, pre-trial services sought an arrest warrant for Gleason based on alleged bond violations regarding Gleason leaving his home without permission on the night of October 13 and lying twice about his activities on that night. Two days later, on October 26, the district court set a sentencing date for the morning of November 8, 2006. On October 31, 2006, a magistrate judge issued notice of a proceeding related to Gleason\u2019s alleged bond violation scheduled for the afternoon of November 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">On November 2, 2006, Gleason filed a sentencing memorandum in which he argued for a sentence lower than the 46 months recommended by the Probation Office. Gleason argued that his \u201coffense did not involve a victim,\u201d J.A. at 40-41 (Def.\u2019s Sent. Mem. at 4-5), he was unlikely to be a recidivist, he had a good employment record with the U.S. military, and the seventeen months he had spent on home detention since his arrest constituted some measure of punishment already.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">On November 6, the Government filed a sentencing memorandum in which it argued against any sentence lower than the Guidelines range. The government highlighted aspects of Gleason\u2019s conversation with the undercover officer, the images of nude teen and underage girls on his computer that it claimed \u201cwere actually child pornography,\u201d J.A. at 48 (Gov\u2019t Sent. Mem. at 3), and that Gleason had previously met a minor whom he had contacted on the internet. The government also detailed \u201cGleason\u2019s extraordinarily poor behavior while on bond,\u201d J.A. at 51 (Gov\u2019t Sent. Mem. at 6), which included spending the night of October 13, 2006, off base with a woman \u201che met through an expensive phone based \u2018dating\u2019 service and with whom he had communicated on the Internet with the help of his friends,\u201d and lying \u201cseveral times to his pre-trial services officer about the incident,\u201d J.A. at 50 (Gov\u2019t Sent. Mem. at 5). The government also pointed out that although Gleason\u2019s bond order committed him to paying for the cost of his electronic monitoring, he had only paid $100 toward that cost while paying approximately $300 per month to a telephone dating service.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">In its sentencing memorandum, the government did not specifically request an upward variance, but the government did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>observe that \u201cextraordinarily bad behavior after the offense should be considered as a basis of an upward departure.\u201d J.A. at 50 (Gov\u2019t Sent. Mem. at 5). Further, after noting Gleason\u2019s \u201ctotal disrespect of his bond conditions,\u201d the government argued that his sentence \u201cshould not merely be at the upper end of the guideline range, it should also include a longer period of supervised release than the three years recommended\u201d by the probation officer. J.A. at 51-52 (Gov\u2019t Sent. Mem. at 6-7). As a result, the government \u201crecommend[ed] a sentence at the high end of the guideline range [of 46 to 57 months] and at least five years of supervised release.\u201d J.A. at 53 (Gov\u2019t Sent. Mem. at 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">At the sentencing hearing, the government presented testimony from Jennifer Chadwick, a pre-trial services officer, regarding her reports on Gleason\u2019s alleged bond violation. Special Agent James Olm-stead of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the Department of Defense also testified, describing Gleason\u2019s prior online communication with a minor from Akron, whom he traveled to meet and groped in his ear. Olmstead testified about Gleason using his friends and his son to send and receive emails to a thirty-two-year-old woman whom he had met using a telephone dating service.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Gleason\u2019s attorney cross-examined both government witnesses and established that no evidence showed that Gleason had contacted or communicated with any underage girls while on bond. Gleason then testified that he never had sexual intercourse with any person under eighteen years of age, that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for his bond violations, and that he had \u201cpanicked and lied\u201d to his pre-trial services officer when confronted about his avoidance of electronic monitoring in October. J.A. at 113 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 47).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">After verifying that Gleason had no objections to the PSR and that he had received it at least ten days in advance of the hearing and reviewed it with his attorney, the district court found that \u201cunder the applicable advisory guidelines, the total offense level is 23.\u201d J.A. at 115 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 49). The district court then invited Gleason\u2019s attorney to argue for a lower sentence under the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>Gleason\u2019s attorney outlined the arguments made in his sentencing memorandum, and in response the district court explained why those arguments were troublesome. The district court disputed that the offense did not involve a victim and suggested that Gleason\u2019s post-offense contact \u2014 contacting younger women through a telephone dating service and enlisting the assistance of his friends and son to communicate with women over the internet \u2014 indicated that recidivism was a risk for Gleason.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The district court then sought the government\u2019s views on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and after hearing the government\u2019s statement, the district court asked \u201cwhy under all of these circumstances [relating to the bond violations] you have not sought an upward departure, and is there any basis for an upward departure in this case?\u201d J.A. at 123, 121-23 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 57, 55-57). Counsel for the government described \u201cstruggling] with this\u201d case and noted that the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum had sought \u201ca longer term of supervised release [than that recommended by the probation officer] to make sure that [Gleason] gets it, because I don\u2019t think now he gets it.\u201d J.A. at 123 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 57).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The \u25a0 district court then asked again whether \u201cthere\u2019s a basis for an upward departure in this case\u201d and the government responded that \u201c[b]ased upon the bond violations ... I think that there could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>be a foundation for an upward departure in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court recited the considerations listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), and the government specifically pointed to the need to \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). J.A. at. 124 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 58). Given uncontested evidence in the PSR regarding Gleason groping a sixteen-year-old girl, the attorney for the government mentioned being concerned by the phrasing of the question that Gleason\u2019s attorney asked Gleason regarding whether Gleason had ever had \u201csexual intercourse\u201d with a minor. <em>Id. </em>The district court queried why the government did not ask Gleason a follow-up question, and the government\u2019s attorney replied that \u201cI didn\u2019t want to embarrass Mr. Gleason on the stand.\u201d J.A. at 125 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 59). The district court replied that \u201c[i]f what he\u2019s done hasn\u2019t embarrassed him already, I don\u2019t know that anything would\u201d and that \u201cI would have not thought that you would have told me that you didn\u2019t ask someone accused and convicted who has pled guilty of this crime that you didn\u2019t ask the question because you didn\u2019t want to embarrass him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Gleason\u2019s attorney then explained that he phrased his question to differentiate sexual intercourse from sexual contact, which apparently Gleason did not dispute occurred when he traveled to Akron to meet the sixteen- or seventeen-year old girl. J.A. at 126-27 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 60-61).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The district court then expressed \u201cconcern about the offense level in this ease\u201d and suggested that Gleason\u2019s case might be \u201cappropriate for an upward departure\u201d because the court was unsure \u201cwhether [Gleason\u2019s] post-offense behavior shows respect for the law or whether his post-offense behavior convinces me that this sentence adequately protects the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d J.A. at 127-28 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 61-62). The district court also queried whether \u201ca sentence of 46 to 57 months will afford adequate deterrence\u201d and stated a belief that \u201cthe testimony of [the government\u2019s witnesses] lead[s] me to believe that this case is a candidate for an upward departure because [ ] it appears to me that Mr. Gleason was continuing the same pattern that led to this underlying offense.\u201d J.A. at 128 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 62). Noting that \u201cI have certainly departed downward when people have shown extraordinary post-offense or post-conviction rehabilitation,\u201d the district court suggested that an increased sentence might be appropriate \u201cif someone displayed behavior that was inconsistent with any type of \u2014 not remorse so much as respect for the law or understanding of what he had done and the consequences of what he had done in the first instance.\u201d J.A. at 129 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 63).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">At this point, the district court announced that \u201cI disagree with the U.S. attorney that [the recommended sentence] is adequate in light of my analysis of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B) and (C)\u201d and stated that Gleason deserved a greater sentence in the range of 63 to 78 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> J.A. at 129-30 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 63-64). The district court then invited comment from both Gleason\u2019s attorney and the government, as well as an allocution from Gleason. Gleason\u2019s attorney did not object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the lack of notice that the district court was considering a sentence above the recommended guideline range in the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Gleason began his allocution by expressing remorse over his attempted meeting with an underage girl and stated that in his telephone dating activities he had \u201cscrupulously avoided any kind of contact\u201d with underage girls and that his telephone dating activities began only after his wife filed for divorce in August 2006. J.A. at 131-32 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 65-66). The district court interrupted and expressed concern that, because Gleason had reacted to a crisis like his wife\u2019s filing for divorce by going outside the law and obligations of his bond order, with Gleason\u2019s \u201chistory, your next step would be to go outside the letter of the law because you seem to have a penchant for underage young ladies.\u201d J.A. at 132 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 66). The district court continued, stating that \u201cmy view of [your offense] is that that\u2019s the most heinous of crimes,\u201d elaborating that \u201cwhen someone of your age and maturity decides to deprive someone like a 14 year old of their innocence, to me that\u2019s a heinous crime, and there\u2019s very little worse in my view that you can do.\u201d J.A. at 132-33 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 66-67). Stating that \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about whether you would be embarrassed on the stand because no one was concerned about whether the 14 year old girl was going to be robbed of her youth,\u201d the district court then remarked that \u201cif no one else protects those children, I will. So that\u2019s why I believe, in addition to the factors that I outlined, that this is a heinous offense, and that\u2019s why I have a real concern because of your post-conviction behavior that you can easily lapse back into that behavior.\u201d J.A. at 133-34 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 67-68). The district court then asked Gleason to continue with his allocution, and Gleason simply asked for the court\u2019s mercy.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Prior to announcing Gleason\u2019s sentence, the district court stated that \u201ccounsel will have a final opportunity to make any legal objections before the sentence actually is imposed.\u201d J.A. at 135 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 69). The district court then announced Gleason\u2019s sentence of seventy-eight months of imprisonment. J.A. at 135 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 69). After stating the sentence, the district court asked \u201c[i]s there any objection to the sentence as stated.\u201d J.A. at 138 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 72). Gleason\u2019s attorney asked \u201cthe Court to note my objection to the Court\u2019s upward departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The government requested the court to clarify any findings it made in imposing the sentence, and the district court stated that \u201cI accepted the factual statements set forth not only in the PSI but also based on the testimony\u201d of the government witnesses. J.A. at 140-41 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 74-75).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">On December 8, 2006, Gleason filed a motion for reconsideration of the sentence. Gleason asked the district court to \u201cconsider reducing [the] term of imprisonment to 57 months, which is at the high end of [Gleason\u2019s] acknowledged Sentencing Guideline range of 46 to 57 months ... and which was originally requested by the Government.\u201d J.A. at 54 (Mot. to Reconsider Sent, at 1). Gleason acknowledged that \u201cviolat[ing] the Court\u2019s trust by disregarding the terms of his release\u201d meant that he \u201cmay no longer merit much consideration for a downward departure.\u201d J.A. at 55 (Mot. to Reconsider Sent, at 2). Gleason also stated that his \u201ccounsel was provided with no notice to indicate that the Court was even considering an upward departure.\u201d J.A. at 56 (Mot. to Reconsider Sent, at 3). Gleason then filed his notice of appeal on January 3, 2007. Finally, on February 22, 2007, the district court filed the Judgment in this case, the final page of which was a Statement of Reasons explaining the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>In the Statement of Reasons, the district court wrote that \u201c[t]he Court adopts the factual findings in the Advisory Guidelines Application in the Presentence Report except that the Court finds that pursuant to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3550(a) [sic], this case is appropriate for an upward departure from the Advisory Guidelines Range.\u201d J.A. at 170 (Judgment at 7). The district court then summarized the reasons stated at the hearing, stating that \u201cwhile awaiting sentencing, [Gleason] left the military base on which he was required to remain, removed his monitoring device so that his locations could not be monitored, lied to sentencing officials, and used a telephone/internet chat room to meet a woman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court then \u201cconclude[d] that the Advisory Guideline Range is inadequate to promote in this defendant a respect for the law and to provide this defendant with just punishment for the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">A. Whether Gleason Received Notice of a Possible Upward Variance as Required by Rule 32(h)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">1. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Rule 32(h) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a <em>ground not identified for departure </em>either in the presentence report or <em>in a party\u2019s pre-hearing submission, </em>the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6U\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">In <em>United States v. Cousins, </em>469 F.3d 572, 580 (6th Cir.2006), we held that Rule 32(h) \u201capplies equally to [Guidelines] departures and \u00a7 3553(a) variances.\u201d In <em>United States v. Tate, </em>516 F.3d 459, 466-67 (6th Cir.2008), we decided that the plain-error standard of review applies when a defendant argues on appeal that the district court violated Rule 32(h) but the defendant did not object in the district court to the lack of notice of the possibility of an upward variance. We explained that Rule 32(h) requires \u201c\u2018reasonable notice\u2019\u201d and that \u201c \u2018what constitutes reasonable notice will vary depending on the circumstances of the particular case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467 (quoting <em>United States v. Ragland, </em>226 Fed.Appx. 507, 510 (6th Cir.2007)). We have also suggested that \u201c[e]ven if ... the district court\u2019s notice was inadequate,\u201d affirming the defendant\u2019s sentence under the plain-error standard may still be proper when the defendant fails to demonstrate prejudice due to the lack of notice because \u201cthe evidence supporting an upward departure was essentially irrebuttable.\u201d <em>United States v. Meeker, </em>411 F.3d 736, 746 (6th Cir.2005); <em>see also Cousins, </em>469 F.3d at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">Finally, we observed in <em>Tate </em>that \u201cthe Supreme Court has recently granted cer-tiorari on the question of whether Rule 32(h) \u2018has any continuing application in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).\u2019\u201d 516 F.3d at 466-67 (quoting Question Presented, <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>No. 06-7517, <em>available at </em>http:// www.supremecourtus.gov/qp/06-07517. pdf). We explained that we would nonetheless consider the defendant\u2019s \u201cRule 32(h) objection based on the law as it has developed up to this point.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">Gleason\u2019s Rule 32(h) claim fails for two reasons. First, his claim fails because Gleason <em>did </em>in fact receive notice of the ground on which the district court relied in imposing an upward variance. Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Gleason cannot meet the requirements of the plain-error standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">First, as noted above, the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum described Gleason\u2019s conduct that gave rise to the alleged bond violations, stated that the government would present evidence on these issues at the hearing, and even suggested that \u201cextraordinarily bad behavior after the offense should be considered as a basis of an upward departure.\u201d J.A. at 50 (Gov\u2019t Sent. Mem. at 5). The district court explicitly based Gleason\u2019s sentence on Gleason\u2019s bad post-offense behavior, citing this conduct both in the Statement of Reasons, J.A. at 170, and at the sentencing hearing, J.A. at 134 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 68) (\u201cI have a real concern because of your post-conviction behavior that you can easily lapse back into that behavior.\u201d). Therefore, by its own terms, Rule 32(h) did not require that the district court give Gleason further notice because the district court did <em>not </em>in fact impose a variance based \u201con a ground not identified for departure ... in a party\u2019s prehearing submission.\u201d Fed. R.CrimP. 32(h); <em>see also Meeker, </em>411 F.3d at 745-46 (finding that information contained in the PSR provided notice \u201csufficient to permit [the defendant\u2019s] attorney to meaningfully comment on the upward departure being considered by the district court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Second, even if we did not view the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum as providing Gleason with notice that his post-offense conduct might warrant an upward variance, Gleason\u2019s claim fails under plain-error review. In <em>Meeker, </em>we held that \u201c[a] sentencing court that fails to provide reasonable notice of its intention to depart from the Guidelines range [ ] commits plain error.\u201d 411 F.3d at 744. \u201c \u2018Having demonstrated obvious error, [Gleason] must establish an effect on his substantial rights, and a serious impact to the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding, to fulfill the further requirements of the plain error test.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cousins, </em>469 F.3d at 580 (quoting <em>United States v. Lopez-Medina, </em>461 F.3d 724, 745 (6th Cir.2006)). In <em>Cousins, </em>we noted that prior decisions have examined whether a defendant could show \u201cprejudice\u201d and declined to grant relief \u201cwhere \u2018the evidence supporting an upward departure was essentially irrebuttable.\u2019 \u201d 469 F.3d at 581 (quoting <em>Meeker, </em>411 F.3d at 746). The evidence of Gleason\u2019s post-offense behavior and bond violations is essentially undisputed in this case, and the government rightly notes that \u201c[a]t sentencing, in the motion for reconsideration and in his opening brief, Gleason had three opportunities to explain how the alleged lack of notice prejudiced him, but failed to do so.\u201d Appellee Br. at 22; <em>see also </em>Reply Br. at 1 (again failing to show prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">We therefore hold that Gleason\u2019s Rule 32(h) claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">B. Whether Gleason\u2019s Sentence Was Substantively Unreasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">1. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">We review Gleason\u2019s substantive-reasonableness<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenge to his sentence using \u201can abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d that \u201ctake[s] into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We may not apply a \u201cpresumption of unreasonableness\u201d to sentences outside the Guidelines range, nor may we apply a \u201cproportional review\u201d that \u201cuses the percentage of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595-96; <em>see also United States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 580-81 (6th Cir.2007) (holding that <em>Gall </em>effectively overturned <em>United States v. Davis, </em>458 F.3d 491, 496 (6th Cir.2006), and ended our practice of applying a form of proportionality review to outside-Guidelines sentences). We \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Finally, that we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard that the Supreme Court has established for reviewing the substantive reasonableness of sentences, we affirm Gleason\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The record in this case contains ample evidence that the district court imposed Gleason\u2019s sentence after carefully considering the facts and circumstances in this case and after devoting particular attention to the values contained in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), and (C). <em>See </em>J.A. at 129-30 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 63-64) (\u201cI disagree with the U.S. attorney that [the recommended sentence] is adequate in light of my analysis of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B) and (C)\u201d); J.A. at 170 (Judgment at 7) (\u201cIt is apparent to the Court that a stricter sentence is required to afford adequate deterrence to this Defendant\u2019s criminal conduct, to protect the public from future crimes of this Defendant, and to impose upon this Defendant sufficient punishment to reflect the seriousness of the offense which he has committed.\u201d) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), and (Q). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Gall, </em>when a district court supplies a \u201creasoned and reasonable decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justif[y] the sentence,\u201d we should \u201cgive[] due deference\u201d to that decision. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 602. Accordingly, we affirm Gleason\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">For the reasons discussed above, we AFFIRM] Gleason\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\">. Although the district court described the sentence using the term \"upward departure,\u201d J.A. at 129 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 63), the district court's analysis focused on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and both Gleason and the government have treated the sentence as a variance, and not a departure. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cousins, </em>469 F.3d 572, 577 (6th Cir.2006) (explaining that sentences outside the Guidelines based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are \"variances\u201d or \"Non-Guideline departures,\" whereas sentences outside the Guidelines based on Chapter 5 of the Guidelines are \"departures\u201d or \"Guideline departures\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-6\">.
