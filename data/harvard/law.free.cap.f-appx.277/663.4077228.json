Aulston appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order affirming the denial of disability insurance benefits (DIB) and supplemental security income (SSI). In Aul-ston\u2019s applications for SSI and DIB, she alleged disability since February 2000 from back problems. After hearings in 2002 and 2003, Aulston\u2019s alleged onset date was amended to January 2002, and in July 2003 an administrative law judge (ALJ) found her disabled. The Commissioner subsequently determined that Aulston had provided erroneous information on whether she had engaged in substantial gamful activity. The matter was reopened, and after yet another hearing in 2004, the ALJ issued an opinion finding that (1) Aulston had engaged in substantial gainful activity until August 2003, and her DIB insured status had expired in March 2003; (2) her Type II diabetes and history of heart surgery were severe impairments, but not of listing-level severity; (3) her subjective complaints were not entirely credible; and (4) she had the residual functional capacity to perform work at the medium exertional level, and thus could perform her past relevant work as a certified nurse\u2019s assistant. Having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm. <em>See Flynn v. Astrue, </em>513 F.3d 788, 792 (8th Cir.2008) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We reject Aulston\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred by ignoring treating physician Safwan Sakr\u2019s opinion that the requirements of Listing 1.02 (major joint dysfunction) were met. As the district court noted, Dr. Sakr\u2019s records were not before the ALJ, and thus we disagree with Aulston\u2019s passing assertions that the ALJ was required to further develop the record or consult a medical adviser on Listing 1.02, or to explain further his finding that the limitations at issue did not meet the listing-level requirements. The Appeals Council is required to consider new and material evidence submitted after the ALJ\u2019s opinion if it relates to the period on or before the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.970(b), 416.1470(b). We interpret the Appeals Council\u2019s statement that the additional evidence did not provide a basis for changing the ALJ\u2019s decision as a finding that Dr. Sakr\u2019s records were not material. <em>See Bergmann v. Apfel, </em>207 F.3d 1065, 1069-70 (8th Cir. 2000) (whether additional evidence meets criteria is question of law this court reviews de novo; to be material, evidence must be relevant to claimant\u2019s condition for time period for which benefits were denied, and must not merely detail after-acquired conditions or post-decision deterioration of pre-existing condition). The ALJ stated in the August 2004 decision that he was reopening his July 2003 decision, which was issued almost a year before Aulston developed the symptoms for which she saw first saw Dr. Sakr in June 2004 \u2014 eleven days after the 2004 hearing \u2014 and Aulston based her claim on osteoarthritis-related back and hip problems, not on shoulder, ankle, or wrist problems from rheumatoid arthritis which were never brought to the attention of the ALJ, although Aulston was counseled. We decline to consider Aulston\u2019s undeveloped argument that she \u201cclearly\u201d met the requirements of Listing 9.08 (diabetes). <em>See SmithKline Beeeham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., </em>439 F.3d 1312, 1320 (Fed.Cir.2006) (collecting cases for proposition that unde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>veloped arguments are waived), ingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Accord-</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\">.
