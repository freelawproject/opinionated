The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues: (1) whether trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to convey a plea offer made by the government; and (2) whether the district court incorrectly enhanced Perez\u2019s sentence based on facts that were neither charged in the indictment nor found by the jury, in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-23\">At the outset, we must decide whether we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal. The government contends that we lack jurisdiction on the ground that the filing of Perez\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely. \u201cThe timely filing of a notice of appeal is a mandatory prerequisite to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>United States v. Grant, </em>256 F.3d 1146, 1150 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted). When a final decision is entered on a \u00a7 2255 motion, the time for filing a notice of appeal is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1), which provides that the notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days of entry of final judgment. <em>See Sanders v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 184, 186 n. 1 (11th Cir.1997). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>district court\u2019s final judgment on a \u00a7 2255 motion must be set out in a separate document. When the district court issues an order that denies a \u00a7 2255 motion but does not enter its final judgment in a separate document, judgment is entered 150 days from the entry of the order that denied the \u00a7 2255 motion. Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c)(2)(B). Under the \u201cmailbox rule,\u201d the date of filing with the court is the date a prisoner delivers a petition or other filing to prison authorities for mailing. <em>Adams v. United States, </em>173 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The district court entered its order denying Perez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on September 7, 2006. The court did not enter a separate document with its final judgment, and accordingly under Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c)(2)(B), judgment was entered 150 days after the district court\u2019s denial of Perez\u2019s motion, or on February 4, 2007. Perez\u2019s notice of appeal was timely because it was filed on February 28, 2007, which is within 60 days of the entry of judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a); <em>Adams, </em>173 F.3d at 1341. Thus, we have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Perez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Perez first contends that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because, according to him, counsel failed to convey to him a plea offer made by the government. In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions, and we review the court\u2019s factfindings only for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Caderno v. United States, </em>256 F.3d 1213, 1216-17 (11th Cir.2001). We give \u201csubstantial deference to the fact-finder ... in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">To make out an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the defendant must show that: (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, i.e., the performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result of that deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">In order to meet the deficient performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the defendant must show that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that [he] was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. \u201cCounsel has an obligation to consult with his client on important decisions and to keep him informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.\u201d <em>See Diaz v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 832, 834 (11th Cir.1991). This obligation includes informing a client about plea offers presented by the government. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">At a hearing before the district court, Perez\u2019s trial counsel testified that he informed Perez of the government\u2019s plea offer. The district court found that counsel\u2019s testimony was credible, and that Perez\u2019s testimony to the contrary was not credible. Perez has not shown that these findings were clearly erroneous, <em>see McPhee, </em>336 F.3d at 1275, and Perez therefore has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>see Diaz, </em>930 F.2d at 834. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Perez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Perez also contends that the district court incorrectly enhanced his sentence based on facts that were neither charged in the indictment nor found by the jury, in violation of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions. Ly<em>nn, </em>365 F.3d at 1232. We have held that <em>\u201cBooker\u2019s </em>[and <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>] constitutional rule falls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.2005). Under the prior panel precedent rule, only the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc may overrule a prior panel\u2019s opinion. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Because Perez is challenging his conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2255 motion, he is not entitled to relief under <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker. See Varela, </em>400 F.3d at 868. Thus, the district court did not err by denying his \u00a7 2255 motion as to this issue. For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Perez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-16\">. We will not consider the various arguments made by Perez with respect to claims outside the scope of the COA. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1341 n. 1 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
