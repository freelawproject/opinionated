EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b817-26\">Defendant-Appellant Jose Manuel Medellin-Munoz (\u201cMedellin\u201d) pled guilty to a one-count information charging him with Reentry of a Deported Alien Previously Convicted of an Aggravated Felony. <em>See </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(l)-(2) &amp; (b)(2). The district court sentenced Medellin to a 41-month term of imprisonment. Medellin appeals, arguing that the sentence offends 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s parsimony principle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Medellin\u2019s counsel filed a brief averring that he was unable to unearth any support for Medellin\u2019s position. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Having independently scrutinized the record, we agree with Medellin\u2019s counsel. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended Medellin, a Mexican citizen, during a traffic stop near Deming, New Mexico, on April 19, 2006. Immigration records revealed that Medellin had previously been deported as a consequence of a Nevada state court conviction for Battery with Substantial Bodily Harm in September 1998; moreover, Medellin had not been granted permission to re-enter the United States. Accordingly, Medellin was detained for prosecution and charged with a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(l)-(2), (b)(2). Medellin pled guilty on July 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The U.S. Probation Office prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), the PSR set Medellin\u2019s base offense level at 8, but added a 16-level enhancement because of his prior conviction for a violent felony. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The PSR credited Medellin for accepting responsibility for his crime of reentry. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. In sum, Medellin\u2019s total offense level was 21. After tabulating Medellin\u2019s prior convictions and arrests, the Probation Office placed Medellin in criminal history category II. Taken together with his offense level, this criminal history category resulted in an advisory guideline sentencing range of 41 to 51 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">At his sentencing hearing, Medellin assented both to the PSR\u2019s statement of facts and its calculation of his guideline range. Yet Medellin, through counsel, argued that the court should vary downward from the guideline range because the 16-level enhancement overstated the seriousness of Medellin\u2019s prior violent felony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sentencing judge was skeptical: he noted that Medellin\u2019s battery conviction resulted from a situation where Medellin and two other men attacked a security guard after he ejected them from a bar. The judge also alluded to the PSR\u2019s statement that the guard overheard the men discuss killing him so that he could not identify them. Lastly, the judge referred to the PSR\u2019s statement that Medellin had later threatened the guard with harm if he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">Before imposing sentence, the court noted that it had reviewed the PSR\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>findings, the guidelines, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In light of those inputs, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK3\">The Court notes that defendant reentered the United States after having previously been deported subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction for battery, substantial bodily harm. And reflecting on the 3553 factors, this is a serious offense. In order to provide adequate deterrence, given the defendant\u2019s prior arrest for a similar offense and [to] protect the public from further crimes, it is my opinion that the guideline sentence is appropriate in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ash\">The court then imposed a sentence of 41 months, at the bottom end of the advisory guideline range. Given the opportunity, neither the government nor Medellin\u2019s counsel offered any further objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Medellin\u2019s counsel filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, thereby triggering our duty to conduct independently a \u201cfull examination of all the proceeding[s] to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Snitz, </em>342 F.3d 1154, 1158 (10th Cir.2003) (quotations omitted). Having done so, we conclude that Medellin lacks any meritorious reason to challenge his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">We review a sentence imposed by the district court for its \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1053 (10th Cir.2006). As such, we set aside a sentence \u201conly if it is procedurally or substantively unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Geiner, </em>498 F.3d 1104, 1107 (10th Cir.2007). We presume the sentence is reasonable if it falls within the advisory sentencing guidelines range. <em>Kristl, </em>437 F.3d at 1054. <em>Cf. Rita v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465-67,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">A sentence is procedurally reasonable if it \u201creflects the sentencing court\u2019s calculation of the applicable advisory Guidelines range and its application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Geiner, </em>498 F.3d at 1107; <em>United States v. Lopez-Flores, </em>444 F.3d 1218, 1220 (10th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3043, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007) (stating that procedural reasonableness aspect centers on the method by which the court calculated the sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">At sentencing, Medellin\u2019s counsel conceded that the PSR accurately stated the pertinent facts and correctly calculated the advisory guideline range. \u201c[W]here a defendant raises no contemporaneous objection to the court\u2019s\u201d method for calculating the sentence, \u201cwe may reverse the district court\u2019s judgment only in the presence of plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Cereceres-Zavala, </em>499 F.3d 1211, 1217 (10th Cir. 2007); <em>United States v. Romero, </em>491 F.3d 1173, 1177 (10th Cir .2007), <em>cert, denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 319, 169 L.Ed.2d 225 (2007). A plain error is present \u201conly when there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) which affects substantial rights, and (4) which seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Romero, </em>491 F.3d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">Medellin\u2019s counsel dutifully acknowledged in his <em>Anders </em>brief that no non-frivolous grounds exist to challenge the procedural reasonableness of Medellin\u2019s sentence. And our review of the record revealed no procedural error. Without error there is no plain error. We may turn now to the substantive prong of our reasonableness analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">\u201cA substantively reasonable sentence ultimately reflects the gravity of the crime and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as applied to the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Atencio, </em>476 F.3d 1099, 1102 (10th Cir.2007). Thus, we must simply inquire whether the \u201csentence is reasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number><em>Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d 1109, 1114 (10th Cir.2006). Fulfilling our obligation under <em>Anders, </em>we conclude that Medellin cannot offer any colorable argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">During the attack on the security guard, Medellin and two other men punched and kicked the man and also beat him with his baton. They also apparently considered killing the security guard to silence him. Thereafter, they repeatedly menaced him with threats of retaliation. As the sentencing court noted, the Nevada battery conviction was a \u201cserious offense\u201d mandating a sentence that would deter subsequent conduct of the same sort and, in the meantime, protect the public. Moreover, the Probation Office asserted that \u201cthere are no circumstances that take the defendant\u2019s case away from the heartland of similarly situated defendants.\u201d We have identified nothing in the record that persuades us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Medellin\u2019s sentence and GRANT his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b817-19\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">. Title 18, section 3553(a) directs \"[t]he court [to] impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with\" the sentencing objectives set forth therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">. The Probation Office used the 2005 edition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-9\">. In addition to the base offense level, the guidelines direct that \"[i]f the defendant previously was deported ... after \u2014 (A) a conviction for a felony that is ... (ii) a crime of violence .. . increase by 16 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b818-15\">. Medellin\u2019s counsel agreed that the battery conviction \"fits within the guideline definition of crime of violence.\" Nevertheless, he argued for a downward variance on the ground that the guidelines' definition of \"crime of violence\u201d is broad and Medellin's crime was relatively less severe than other violent crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
