Aug. 20, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A72 054 505 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 23, 2001). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying-facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">When the BIA issues an independent decision on remand from this Court, we should review the BIA\u2019s decision alone. <em>See Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 623 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled, in paii on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). We will vacate and remand for new findings, however, if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">As the BIA found, even assuming his credibility, Liu is ineligible as a matter of law for the relief he sought based on his wife\u2019s alleged forced sterilization. In <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>we held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42) \u201cdoes not extend automatic refugee status to spouses or unmarried partners of individuals \u00a7 601(a) [of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)) ] expressly protects.\u201d 494 F.3d at 300. This holding is disposi-tive of Liu\u2019s petition for review. Indeed, we have since held that a claim based solely on a spouse or unmarried partner\u2019s forced abortion or sterilization is \u201cdoomed.\u201d <em>Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 720 (2d Cir.2007). While an individual may establish eligibility for relief based on his own \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive population control policy, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), Liu has made no such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">To the extent he argues that we should reconsider our en banc decision in <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>and read that decision \u201cnarrowly\u201d to include only fiancees and boyfriends, or remand his case for further consideration of the implications of <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>we have no authority to do so. <em>See Gold v. Feinberg, </em>101 F.3d 796, 801 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Cir.1996) (stating that a holding of our Court \u201ccan only be overruled by this Court sitting in banc or by a decision of the Supreme Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
