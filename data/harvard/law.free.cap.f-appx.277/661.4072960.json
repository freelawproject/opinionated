On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in applying a 2-level increase for making a threat of death. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-23\">Upon careful review, we conclude that the district court correctly applied section 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), because Sarver\u2019s conduct would make a reasonable bank teller fear death. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1, comment. (n.6) (intent of provision is to provide increased offense level for cases in which offender engaged in conduct that would instill a fear of death in a reasonable victim); Un<em>ited States v. Jennette, </em>295 F.3d 290, 292 (2d Cir.2002) (concluding that reasonable teller, when faced with bank robber who demands money and states that he has gun, normally and reasonably would fear for his or her life); <em>United States v. Carbaugh, </em>141 F.3d 791, 794 (7th Cir.1998) (holding that statement \u201cI have a gun\u201d can constitute threat of death under Guidelines; threat of death need not include statement of readiness or willingness to use gun; reasonable teller would ordinarily experience fear of being shot when robber confronting her announces he has gun). <em>See generally United States v.
