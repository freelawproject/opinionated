Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 558 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cBecause a guilty plea involves the waiver of several constitutional rights, it must be made intelligently and voluntarily.\u201d) (citing <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242-44, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969)). Williams alleges the district court did not comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. Rule 11 \u201censures that a guilty plea is knowing and voluntary by requiring the district court to follow certain procedures before accepting such a plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rule 11 provides that, \u201c[b]efore the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere ... the [district] court must address the defendant personally in open court ... [and] inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands ... the nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading.\u201d Fed.R.CrimP. 11(b)(1)(G). The district court must also inform the defendant of \u201cany mandatory minimum penalty.\u201d Fed.R.CrimP. lKbxixi).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Williams did not object on Rule 11 grounds during his plea colloquy, so we apply a plain-error standard of review. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <em>see also United States v. Castro-Trevino, </em>464 F.3d 536, 541 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">During the plea colloquy, the district court made a misleading statement concerning the mandatory minimum sentence that was applicable to Williams. The district court conveyed to Williams that two possible mandatory minimum sentences were applicable to his conviction: (1) a <em>ten-year </em>mandatory minimum or (2) a mandatory <em>life </em>sentence minimum. However, based on the enhancement information submitted by the Government pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), Williams effectively faced only the minimum of a life sentence. Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), the mandatory minimum for a drug offense can increase to life imprisonment if the defendant has been convicted of two or more prior drug felony offenses. The enhancement information described three such pri- or convictions. The parties do not dispute that Williams\u2019s prior convictions were more than five-years old. Therefore, Williams could not file a non-frivolous response to the enhancement information so as to challenge the validity of the prior convictions. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e) (\u201cNo person who stands convicted of an offense under this part may challenge the validity of any prior conviction alleged under this section which occurred more than five years before the date of the information alleging such prior conviction.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Nanez, </em>694 F.2d 405, 413 (5th Cir.1982). As a consequence, the district court was statutorily required to impose the sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(d)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">If the person files no response to the information ... the court shall proceed to impose sentence upon him as provided by this part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">Thus, by the operation of these statutory provisions, the district court was obligated to impose a mandatory life sentence as a minimum sentence, and a ten-year mandatory minimum was no longer a practical possibility. Since the district court misleadingly conveyed the possibility of a ten-year mandatory minimum, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>could not have understood the nature of the charge to which he was pleading. Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 11(b)(1)(G). By failing to inform Williams accurately of the proper minimum mandatory sentence, the district court was not clear about the direct consequences of a plea. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>234 F.3d 252, 255 (5th Cir. 2000) (\u201cTo be knowing and intelligent, the defendant must have a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Thus, the district court plainly erred. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. ll(b)(l)(I); <em>United States v. Adams, </em>432 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir.2006) (finding plain error when district court failed into inform defendant that he possibly could be subject to a mandatory fine if he had the ability to pay the fine)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Under <em>United States v. Watch, </em>this plain error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights: \u201c[this court] find[s] that because the district court failed to inform [the defendant] of the minimum sentence which might be imposed,[the defendant] did not fully understand the consequences of his plea, and his rights were therefore substantially affected. Consequently, [the defendant\u2019s] conviction must be vacated, and his case remanded so that he may plead anew.\u201d 7 F.3d 422, 429 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Benz, </em>472 F.3d 657, 660-62 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e hold that the failure to inform the defendant of the mandatory minimum sentence seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings because we cannot know whether the defendant would have pled differently had he been informed of the mandatory minimum as required under Rule 11.\u201d). Here, the district court was not sufficiently clear in its Rule 11 admonishment as to the applicable mandatory minimum sentence; therefore Williams could not have fully understand the consequences of his plea. His rights were substantially affected by this reversible plain error. Accordingly, we VACATE Williams\u2019s guilty plea and REMAND this case to the district court to allow Williams to plead anew.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
