Keenan, Judge), entered on September 22, 2005, declining to resentence Figueroa, after having originally sentenced him upon a guilty plea principally to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment for one count of conspiracy to deal in firearms without a license in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A), one count of dealing in firearms without a license in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A), and two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), following our <em>Crosby </em>remand, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 260, 166 L.Ed.2d 202 (2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the relevant procedural history, facts, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, and we evaluate its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>521 F.3d 149, 156-57 (2d Cir.2008). We review for \u201creasonableness\u201d the decision of a district court declining to alter a sentence following a <em>Crosby </em>remand. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir.2007), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 881, 169 L.Ed.2d 739 (2008). \u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006). We thus review a district court\u2019s sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United </em>States,U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-27\">Figueroa first argues that the District Court failed to articulate the factors used in its determination not to resentence him and that the District Court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ignoring Figueroa\u2019s history and characteristics, including his learning disability and deaths in his family, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). \u201c[T]he law does not impose \u2018any rigorous requirement of specific articulation\u2019 on sentencing judges with respect to their consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Verk-hoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 131 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 118); <em>see id. </em>(reiterating that we do not require \u201crobotic incantations\u201d of the statutory factors). Further, \u201cwe presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 30; <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d. 203 (2007) (holding that the law on what is required in a judicial opinion leaves much \u201cto the judge\u2019s own professional judgment\u201d). The record reflects that the District Court considered the information about Figueroa\u2019s history and characteristics that it was presented with both during the original sentencing and on remand. The District Court addressed Figueroa\u2019s new argument on remand regarding his remorse and found that it did not warrant an altered sentence. We thus conclude that the District Court carefully considered the section 3553(a) factors, <em>see Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468-69, and that its decision not to resentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Figueroa also argues that the District Court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) by sentencing him to a harsher term of imprisonment than necessary. We must \u201cgive[ ] due deference to the District Court\u2019s reasoned and reasonable decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 602. Here, the District Court concluded that the \u201csentence as originally imposed meets the objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d \u201cThere is no indication that the District Court actually failed to consider the requirements of the parsimony clause when deciding whether to resen-tence [the defendant] pursuant to <em>Crosby.\u201d Williams, </em>475 F.3d at 477. We find that the sentence, which was at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range, was well within the broad range of reasonable sentences that the District Court could have imposed. <em>See Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s arguments and find them without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
