Johnson raises several issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review, we affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Johnson first asserts the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his post-arrest statements because the lights waiver form that he signed did not adequately inform him of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact in resolving a motion to suppress for clear error and the court\u2019s application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Gil, </em>204 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2000). A suspect \u201cheld for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation under the system for protecting the privilege we delineate today.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1626, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). \u201cOpportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1630. The Supreme Court later clarified, however, that <em>Miranda </em>warnings do not have to be provided in the exact form as stated in that decision, as \u201cno talismanic incantation is required to satisfy its strictures.\u201d <em>Duckworth v. Eagan, </em>492 U.S. 195, 109 S.Ct. 2875, 2880, 106 L.Ed.2d 166 (1989) (quotations omitted). The Court further found that, where the defendant was informed, <em>inter alia, </em>of his right to speak to an attorney before and during questioning and to stop the questioning at any time and speak with an attorney, these statements \u201ctouched all of the bases\u201d required by <em>Miranda. Id.-, see also United States v. Street, </em>472 F.3d 1298, 1311-12 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2988, 168 L.Ed.2d 715 (2007) (noting the defendant in <em>Duckworth </em>was \u201cfully and completely advised of all of his rights\u201d). In order for a defendant\u2019s incriminatory statements to be admissible, the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>made a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>United States v. Farris, </em>77 F.3d 391, 396 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Although the rights waiver form Johnson signed did not specifically advise him of his right to consult with an attorney during questioning, it advised him he had the right to talk to a lawyer before questioning, to have a lawyer present with him during questioning, and to stop the questioning at any time until he spoke with a lawyer. Because <em>Miranda </em>requires a suspect be informed of his rights to \u201cconsult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation,\u201d and Johnson was apprised of both of these rights, the waiver form was sufficient, and Johnson made a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his rights. <em>See Miranda, </em>86 S.Ct. at 1626, 1630; <em>see also Farris, </em>77 F.3d at 396. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Johnson\u2019s motion to suppress his post-arrest statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Johnson next contends there was an insufficient basis for the voice identification Detective Tillman made of Johnson. Johnson did not object on this basis at trial, so we review this claim under a plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>314 F.3d 565, 566 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Voice identification testimony can be admitted only after it is determined sufficient evidence supports a finding \u201cthe matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). A speaker\u2019s voice may be identified by opinion testimony \u201cbased upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(5). \u201cOnce a witness establishes familiarity with an identified voice, it is up to the jury to determine the weight to place on the witness\u2019s voice identification.\u201d <em>Brown v. City of Hialeah, </em>30 F.3d 1433, 1437 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">Detective Tillman testified he heard Johnson\u2019s voice three times prior to the date on which he made his identification. This was sufficient to establish his familiarity with Johnson\u2019s voice. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 901(b)(5). Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in permitting the voice identification to go to the jury, as it was up to the jury to determine the weight to place on Detective Tillman\u2019s identification. <em>See Brown, </em>30 F.3d at 1437.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">Johnson also asserts the district court erred in prohibiting him from eliciting the exculpatory portions of his post-arrest statement from Detective Tillman. Because Johnson did not make an objee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>tion to the limitation of Detective Tillman\u2019s cross-examination during the trial, we review the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for plain error. <em>See Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1202. \u201cWhen a wilting or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 106. In light of Federal Rule of Evidence 611(a)\u2019s requirement the district court exercise \u201creasonable control\u201d over witness interrogation and the presentation of evidence to make them effective vehicles \u201cfor the ascertainment of truth,\u201d Rule 106 has been extended to encompass oral conversations. <em>United States v. Range, </em>94 F.3d 614, 621 (11th Cir.1996); Fed.R.Evid. 611(a). Accordingly, the exculpatory portion of a defendant\u2019s post-arrest statement should be admitted if it is: (1) relevant to an issue in the case; and (2) necessary to clarify or explain the portion received. <em>Range, </em>94 F.3d at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The district court did not plainly err by limiting the scope of Johnson\u2019s cross-examination of Detective Tillman because, although Johnson\u2019s exculpatory statements may have been relevant to his involvement in the offense conduct charged, they were not necessary to clarify those portions of the post-arrest interview related by the witness. <em>See id. </em>Detective Tillman\u2019s testimony was unambiguous and did not require any clarification or explanation, and regardless, the fact Johnson also stated in his interview that he was not involved in any criminal activity would not have clarified or explained the statements to which Detective Tillman testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Johnson contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conspiracy conviction, as there was no evidence presented that he ever possessed any drugs or marked money used in the drug transactions. Where, as here, the issue of sufficiency of the evidence has been preserved, we review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction <em>de novo, </em>\u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>218 F.3d 1243, 1244 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal \u201cwill be upheld if a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Determinations of the credibility of witnesses fall within the exclusive province of the jury and may not be revisited by us unless the testimony is \u201cincredible as a matter of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">\u201cTo sustain a conviction for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) an illegal agreement existed; (2) the defendant knew of it; and (3) the defendant, with knowledge, voluntarily joined it.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>433 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). \u201cAlthough mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to support a conspiracy conviction, presence nonetheless is a probative factor which the jury may consider in determining whether a defendant was a knowing and intentional participant in a criminal scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Moreover, a defendant\u2019s participation in a conspiracy can be established by circumstantial evidence, and the government need only prove that the defendant knew the general nature and scope of the conspira-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>ey. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>326 F.3d 1319,1329 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The evidence was sufficient to sustain Johnson\u2019s conspiracy conviction. Although there was no photographic or recorded evidence, and Johnson was not found in possession of any marked money or drugs, Detective Tillman\u2019s testimony allowed the jury to make the following conclusions: (1) Johnson and Malcolm Williams called the Cl together to arrange the drug transaction, after which Johnson called the Cl on his own and told the Cl to go through him for any other deals with Williams; (2) Johnson made specific references to narcotics in both of the conversations, showing he knew the nature of the illegal agreement; and (3) Johnson picked up the Cl and drove him to his meeting with Williams, participated in the meeting, and then drove the Cl back to his original location. Because Detective Tillman\u2019s testimony established Johnson facilitated the transaction and participated in the discussions in the parking lot before the money and drugs were exchanged, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude Johnson was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, as he knew of the existence of the illegal agreement and, with knowledge, voluntarily joined it. See <em>Hernandez, </em>433 F.3d at 1333. Moreover, it was the province of the jury to assess the credibility of Detective Tillman, and it could find Johnson guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on this testimony alone. <em>See Calderon, </em>127 F.3d at 1324. Accordingly, sufficient evidence supported Johnson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Johnson also contends he was denied a fair trial because the prosecutor made an improper burden-shifting argument and improperly attempted to bolster the credibility of one of its witnesses during its closing argument. Prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument, including an improper burden-shifting argument and improper vouching, requires a new trial only where the remarks were improper and prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>149 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cA defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would be different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">\n<em>A. Burden shifting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Johnson objected to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged burden-shifting comment at trial, and therefore, the claim of prosecutorial misconduct, which generally involves mixed questions of law and fact, is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Noriega, </em>117 F.3d 1206, 1218 (11th Cir.1997). \u201c[W]hile a prosecutor may not comment about the absence of witnesses or otherwise attempt to shift the burden of proof, it is not improper for a prosecutor to note that the defendant has the same subpoena powers as the government, particularly when done in response to a defendant\u2019s argument about the prosecutor\u2019s failure to call a specific witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1439 (11th Cir. 1998) (quotations omitted). Moreover, any potential prejudice regarding burden-shifting is diminished by the prosecutor\u2019s statement during closing argument \u201cthat the burden of proof [is] theirs to carry and by the trial court\u2019s explicit instruction after closing arguments to that same effect.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">The prosecutor\u2019s comment the defense had the same subpoena power as the Government was made in l\u2019esponse to Johnson\u2019s statement regarding a Government witness that was not called to testify. Such a statement is not improper, particularly when made in response to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>dant\u2019s argument about the government\u2019s failure to call a specific witness. <em>See Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d at 1438. Moreover, any potential prejudice this statement may have caused was alleviated by: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the Government held the burden of proof; and (2) the court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it was not improper for the prosecutor to note the defendant had the same subpoena powers as the Government, but the Government could not shift the burden of proof to the defense. <em>See id. </em>at 1439. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not inappropriate, and did not prejudice Johnson\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">\n<em>B. Improper vouching</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Because Johnson did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s comment until he filed his motion for a new trial, this comment is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Newton, </em>44 F.3d 913, 920 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201c[a]bsent a contemporaneous objection, the propriety of the [g]overnment\u2019s closing argument and alleged prosecutorial misconduct in improperly vouching for a witness\u2019 credibility are reviewed under a plain error standard\u201d). \u201cAttempts to bolster a witness by vouching for his credibility are normally improper and constitute error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-6\">When faced with a question of whether improper vouching occurred we ask: whether the jury could reasonably believe that the prosecutor was indicating a personal belief in the witness\u2019s credibility. In applying this test, we look for whether (1) the prosecutor placed the prestige of the government behind the witness by making explicit assurances of the witness\u2019s credibility, or (2) the prosecutor implicitly vouched for the witness\u2019s credibility by implying that evidence not formally presented to the jury supports the witness\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-7\"><em>United States v. Castro, </em>89 F.3d 1443, 1456-57 (11th Cm.1996) (quotations and citation omitted). When the defense attacks the credibility of the government\u2019s witness, however, the prosecutor is \u201centitled to argue fairly to the jury the credibility of the government and defense witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Eley, </em>723 F.2d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s comment that Detective Tillman would use a valid Cl because he would not risk his career did not amount to improper bolstering. During his closing statement, Johnson attacked Detective Tillman\u2019s credibility, stating he was desperate to use the Cl as his ticket to federal agency employment. In direct response to this attack, the prosecutor told the jury that Detective Tillman was not so desperate to become a federal agent that he would risk his career by using a Cl that was \u201cnot valid.\u201d A jury could not reasonably have believed the prosecutor was placing the prestige of the Government behind Detective Tillman by making an assurance about his credibility, or that he was implying evidence not presented to the jury supported the witness\u2019s testimony. <em>See Castro, </em>89 F.3d at 1456-57. Instead, the prosecutor\u2019s comment was a fair argument defending the credibility of the Government\u2019s witness. Accordingly, the prosecutor\u2019s remark was not improper and did not prejudice Johnson\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">Finally, Johnson contends the district court erred at sentencing because the five criminal history points it assessed against him over-represented his criminal history, as all five points were related to the same prior offense. We review <em>de novo </em>a claim the district court engaged in impermissible double counting during its calculation of the advisory guidelines range. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number><em>States v. Phillips, </em>363 F.3d 1167, 1168 n. 2 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c\u2018Impermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1168 (quotations omitted). Double counting is permissible when \u201c(1) the Sentencing Commission intended the result, and (2) each guideline section in question concerns conceptually separate notions related to sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Section 4Al.l(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines requires an addition <em>of two </em>points to a defendant\u2019s criminal history calculation if \u201cthe defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d). Section 4Al.l(e) provides that two criminal history points should be added \u201cif the defendant committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment on a sentence counted under [subsection] (a) or (b).... If 2 points are added for item (d), add only 1 point for this item.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e). The commentary to \u00a7 4A1.1 recognizes the potential overlap of subsections (d) and (e), but notes their importance to addressing separate sentencing concerns, stating that subsection (d) \u201cimplements one measure of recency ... [subsection (e) ] implements another measure of recency ... [,]\u201d and \u201ca defendant who falls within both (d) and (e) is more likely to commit additional crimes; thus, (d) and (e) are not completely combined.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, comment, (backg\u2019d). The commentary provides that, because of their potential overlap, the combined impact of the two subsections is limited to three points. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The Sentencing Commission intended for \u00a7 4Al.l(d) and (e) to apply together in certain cases, as it specifically addressed the potential overlap and noted that, although them combined effect would be to add an additional three points to a defendant\u2019s criminal history instead of four, they were not completely combined. <em>See id,.; see also Phillips, </em>363 F.3d at 1168. Therefore, the district court\u2019s double counting was permissible, and the court\u2019s sentencing calculations were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">First, the district court did not err in denying Johnson\u2019s motion to suppress his post-arrest statements because he was fully informed of his rights and voluntarily chose to waive them before speaking to law enforcement. Second, Detective Tillman heard Johnson\u2019s voice three times prior to identifying it on the date on which the offense occurred, so the district court did not plainly err in permitting his voice identification. Third, the district court did not plainly err in limiting the scope of Johnson\u2019s cross-examination of Detective Tillman by not allowing Johnson\u2019s exculpatory post-arrest statements to be admitted, because the statements were not necessary to clarify those portions of the post-arrest interview related by the witness. Fourth, the evidence presented was sufficient for conviction, as it showed that Johnson facilitated a drag transaction between two individuals. Fifth, the prosecutor did not improperly shift the burden to the defense during closing argument because he responded to a statement Johnson made in his closing argument and only told the jury the defense had the same subpoena power as the Government. The prosecutor also did not improperly bolster the credibility of a witness, as his comment was a fair argument defending the credibility of the witness after it was attacked by the defense. Finally, because the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>applied two subsections of the Sentencing Guidelines that were intended to address different sentencing issues and be applied together when necessary, it did not err in calculating Johnson\u2019s criminal history category. Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-8\">. Johnson also summarily argues his statements should not have been admitted because he was impermissibly questioned by an officer prior to waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that he felt threatened by Detective Wayne Tillman. The magistrate judge made an adverse credibility determination regarding Johnson\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing, which the district court affirmed. Because Johnson has <em>not </em>offered any other evidence on these issues or shown how the district court committed clear error when it determined his testimony was not credible, these arguments are without merit. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Pinei-ro, </em>389 F.3d 1359, 1366 (11th Cir.2004) (reviewing a district court's credibility findings for clear error).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
