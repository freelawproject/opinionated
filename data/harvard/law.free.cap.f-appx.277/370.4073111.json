Hinojosa, Sr., Texas inmate # 586249, filed a verified civil rights complaint alleging that officials of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (\u201cDefendants\u201d) violated his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by failing to protect him from an assault by a fellow inmate. On October 20, 2006, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment. Hinojosa now appeals, asserting that the district court: (1) abused its discretion by simultaneously granting Defendants\u2019 Motion for a Protective Order and denying Hinojosa\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) motion for a continuance; (2) erroneously granted Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment; and (3) abused its discretion by denying Hinojosa\u2019s Motion for Appointment of Counsel. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Hinojosa was housed in an open dormitory at the Wynne Unit in a state prison in Huntsville, Texas. On September 24, 2003, inmate Joseph Brown attacked Hino-josa without provocation in the dormitory, where Brown was also housed. No guards were present. Brown repeatedly struck Hinojosa in the head with a plastic toilet brush until the brush broke, at which point Brown attempted to stab Hinojosa with the brush handle. Another inmate intervened to stop the attack. As a result of the attack, Hinojosa suffered a head wound that bled profusely, requiring six stitches. In addition, Hinojosa had several contusions on his back as a result of Brown\u2019s attempts to stab him with the broken toilet brush. Hinojosa alleges that, as a result of his injuries, he suffered pain and has continued to experience headaches and dizziness. Following the attack, Brown was disciplined and transferred to administrative segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">Hinojosa thereafter filed this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against several prison officials, alleging failure to protect in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 13 of the Texas Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hinojosa named as defendants Texas Department of Criminal Justice (\u201cTDCJ\u201d) Executive Director Gary Johnson; TDCJ Correctional Institutional Division Director Douglas Dretke; TDCJ Wynne Unit Warden Joe Fernald; Wynne Unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Chief of Classification Kathy Laughlin; Correctional Officers Captains James Simpson, Jr. and George Webster; and Correctional Officer Angela Massie.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In his complaint, Hinojosa alleged that Brown was a delusional paranoid-schizophrenic with a propensity towards committing violent acts. He further alleged that the Wynne Unit was inherently dangerous because: the dorms where Hinojosa was assaulted were routinely understaffed; the officers assigned to the dorms routinely neglected them duties to monitor the areas and inmates in them charge; no audio or video surveillance monitored the dorms; janitorial tools \u2014 such as toilet bowl brushes, mops, and brooms \u2014 were readily available in the open dorm areas, where they can and have been converted into weapons; and inmates with mental problems and a propensity for violence (such as Brown) were not segregated and were allowed to live in the open dorms. Furthermore, Hinojosa asserted that Defendants Fernald, Laughlin, Simpson, Webster, and Massie had actual knowledge of Wynne Unit\u2019s dangerous prison conditions and the specific dangers caused by Brown\u2019s presence, and they failed to take reasonable measures to address this substantial risk of harm. With respect to Defendants Johnson and Dretke, Hinojosa alleged only that these Defendants had actual knowledge of the substantial risk of harm created by understaffing.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">After filing his initial complaint, Hinojo-sa sought discovery. On October 4, 2005, Defendants filed a motion for a protective order on the basis of qualified immunity. On January 31, 2006, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, also on the basis of qualified immunity, asserting primarily that Hinojosa could not establish that any Defendant had actual knowledge of a substantial risk to his safety. Defendants Dretke, Laughlin, Simpson, and Webster also argued for dismissal pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e, asserting that Hinojosa had not exhausted his administrative remedies against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">In response, Hinojosa filed a Rule 56(f) motion for a continuance to allow discovery before requiring Hinojosa to respond to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Noting that it appeared that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that qualified immunity protects government officials from unnecessary litigation burdens \u2014 including discovery \u2014 the district court granted Defendants protective order and denied Hinojosa\u2019s motion for a continuance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">In its order, the district court also denied Hinojosa\u2019s motion for the district court to reconsider its decision to deny appointed counsel. The district court explained that Hinojosa had no constitutional right to appointed counsel and that, \u201c[d]e-spite his limitations, Hinojosa has managed to prosecute his claims in a reasonably effective manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">After Defendants submitted an amended motion for summary judgment and Hinojo-sa filed his response, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. The court found that Defendants demonstrated that there existed no genuine issues of material fact regarding Hinojosa\u2019s claim of a constitutional violation. Hinojosa now appeals, asserting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the district court: (1) abused its discretion by granting Defendants\u2019 Motion for a Protective Order and denying Hinojosa\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion for a continuance; (2) erred in granting Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment; and (3) abused its discretion by denying Hinojosa\u2019s Motion for Appointment of Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Qualified immunity protects government officials from liability in civil suits unless their conduct violates \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The qualified immunity doctrine \u201caffords government officials not just immunity from liability, but immunity from suit,\u201d including the burdens of discovery. Van-<em>der Zee v. Reno, </em>73 F.3d 1365, 1368 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201cThe party seeking damages from an official asserting qualified immunity bears the burden of overcoming that defense.\u201d <em>Bennett v. City of Grand Prairie, </em>883 F.2d 400, 408 (5th Cir.1989). To overcome a defendant\u2019s entitlement to qualified immunity, a plaintiff must: (1) state a claim for violation of a constitutional right; (2) demonstrate that the constitutional right was established at the time of the actions at issue; and (3) show that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct was objectively unreasonable in light of the legal rules clearly established.\u201d <em>Thomas v. City of Dallas, </em>175 F.3d 358, 363-64 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">It is well settled that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscription against cruel and unusual punishment requires prison officials to protect inmates from violent attacks by other inmates. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). However, not every injury \u201csuffered by one prisoner at the hands of another ... translates into constitutional liability for prison officials responsible for the victim\u2019s safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">To establish a failure-to-protect claim, \u201cthe inmate must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm\u201d and that the prison official acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the inmate\u2019s health or safety. <em>Id. </em>A prison official acts with deliberate indifference if he \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cthe official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970. A prisoner alleging an Eighth Amendment violation need not show that prison officials believed that harm would actually occur \u2014 \u201cit is enough that the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970. A prison official\u2019s knowledge of the risk \u201ccan be proven through circumstantial evidence, such as by showing that the risk was so obvious that the official must have known about it.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 524 (5th Cir.2004). A prison official, however, may avoid liability if he \u201cresponded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not averted.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Furthermore, the mere negligent failure to protect a prisoner from assault does not comprise a constitutional violation. <em>See Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 347-48, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986); <em>Oliver v. Collins, </em>914 F.2d 56, 60 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Hinojosa asserts that the district court abused its discretion by denying his Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>56(f) motion for a continuance of summary-judgment and granting Defendants\u2019 motion for a protective order before Hinojosa could conduct appropriate discovery. As explained in Section I <em>supra, </em>the district court based its decision to deny Hinojosa\u2019s motion and grant Defendants\u2019 motion because it appeared to the district court that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We review district court dispositions of Rule 56(f) motions to suspend summary judgment and motions for protective orders for abuse of discretion. <em>Stearns Airport Equip. v. FMC Corp., </em>170 F.3d 518, 534 (5th Cir.1999) (Rule 56(f) motions); <em>Sanders v. Shell Oil Co., </em>678 F.2d 614, 618 (5th Cir.1982) (protective orders).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Although Hinojosa was unable to obtain discovery from Defendants, \u201cRule 56 does not require that any discovery take place before summary judgment can be granted.\u201d <em>Washington v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>901 F.2d 1281, 1285 (5th Cir.1990). When a party believes that \u201cit needs more time to obtain discovery to respond satisfactorily to a motion for summary judgment,\u201d Rule 56(f) is the proper remedy. <em>Int'l Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally\u2019s, Inc., </em>939 F.2d 1257, 1266 (5th Cir.1991). Rule 56(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">If a party opposing the motion shows by affidavit that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) deny the motion; (2) order a continuance to enable affidavits to be obtained, depositions to be taken, or other discovery to be undertaken; or (3) issue any other just order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8u\">Rule 56(f) discovery motions are \u201cbroadly favored and should be liberally granted\u201d because the rule is designed to \u201csafeguard non-moving parties from summary judgment motions that they cannot adequately oppose.\u201d <em>Culwell v. City of Fort Worth, </em>468 F.3d 868, 871 (5th Cir.2006). To obtain a continuance of a motion for summary judgment, the non-movant must: \u201c(I) request! ] extended discovery prior to the court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment; (ii) put the trial court on notice that further discovery pertaining to the summary judgment motion is being sought; and (iii) demonstrate to the trial court specifically how the requested discovery pertains to the pending motion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Wichita Falls Office Assocs. v. Banc One Corp., </em>978 F.2d 915, 919 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">The nonmovant \u201cmay not simply rely on vague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed, but unspecified, facts.\u201d <em>SEC v. Spence &amp; Green Chem. Co., </em>612 F.2d 896, 901 (5th Cir.1980). \u201cIf it appears that further discovery will not provide evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact, the district court may grant summary judgment.\u201d <em>Access Tele-com, Inc. v. MCI Telecomm. Corp., </em>197 F.3d 694, 720 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also Washington, </em>901 F.2d at 1285 (\u201cThis court has long recognized that a plaintiffs entitlement to discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary judgment is not unlimited, and may be cut off when the record shows that the requested discovery is not likely to produce the facts needed by the plaintiff to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\u201d). However, where a party seeks discovery \u201cgermane to the pending summary judgment motion it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>inequitable to pull out the rug from under [it] by denying such discovery.\u201d <em>Wichita Falls Office Assocs., </em>978 F.2d at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">A. Defendants Fernald, Laughlin, Simpson, Webster, and Massie</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The essence of Hinojosa\u2019s claim against Defendants Fernald, Laughlin, Simpson, Webster, and Massie is that: (1) their failure to remove Brown \u2014 a mentally unstable inmate with a propensity for violence \u2014 -from an unsupervised dormitory with unrestricted access to cleaning tools that can easily be transformed into weapons created an inherently dangerous situation for all the inmates living in Brown\u2019s dorm; (2) they knew of this substantial risk to inmate safety; and (3) they failed to take any reasonable measures in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Defendants Fernald, Laughlin, Simpson, Webster, and Massie moved for summary judgment, contending that Hinojosa failed to demonstrate deliberate indifference because he did not show that \u201cany of the Defendants possessed knowledge that [Hi-nojosa] was in danger prior to September 24, 2003.\u201d Specifically, the relevant Defendants asserted that there was no evidence that they had actual knowledge of the threat posed by Brown, especially because Hinojosa did not tell anyone in the prison that he felt threatened by Brown. Furthermore, the relevant Defendants argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish that they had actual knowledge that the availability of cleaning tools posed a substantial risk of harm to Hinojo-sa\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">From the summary judgment evidence produced thus far, it appears that Brown has serious mental problems. According to Brown\u2019s statement after the attack, he attacked Hinojosa because he thought that Hinojosa had stolen some of his commissary items and because Hinojosa \u201cwas sticking something [up] my ass; a finder and/or something like a paper clip.\u201d Brown then stated that \u201c[Hinojosa] or others was doing that\u201d and that \u201c[i]t seems like everybody know what was happening but me.\u201d Hinojosa, in his statement after the attack, stated that Brown had always exhibited \u201cextreme paranoia\u201d and \u201chad most of 6 dorm living in fear and disrespecting them.\u201d Furthermore, in an unsworn declaration,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Inmate Richard Lopez, who lived in the same dorm as Hinojosa and Brown, stated that ten days prior to Brown\u2019s attack, he warned Captain Sims (a non-defendant), via a Form 1-60, that \u201cInmate Brown was always exhibiting delusional behavior,\u201d was recently exhibiting an increased level of strange and erratic behavior, and \u201ccould hurt someone or could end up getting hurt himself.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">The summary judgment evidence produced thus far also shows that Brown had a history of violence but does not reveal any violent incidents in the recent past. Brown is a convicted murderer<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>been imprisoned since March 1974. His prison disciplinary record shows disciplinary infractions for: fighting with a weapon in December 1976 and September 1977; possession of a weapon in August 1978; and fighting without a weapon in March 1979, January 1982, and May 1982. There is no evidence of any disciplinary infractions after May 1982. Hinojosa asserted that at least Defendants Fernald, Laugh-lin, and Simpson had first-hand access to his disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Although this current evidence is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the seriousness of the threat posed by Brown and Defendants\u2019 knowledge of such a threat, Hinojosa\u2019s requested discovery may very well provide enough evidence to overcome Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. Most significantly, Lopez \u2014 in his unsworn declaration \u2014 states that: \u201cA few minutes after the incident, while the investigation was going on in the dorm, I overheard Captain Webster say that he didn\u2019t know what Inmate Brown was doing living up there because he (Brown) was violent.\u201d Although vague, Defendant Webster\u2019s alleged statement shows that he believed that Brown\u2019s violent propensities posed a substantial risk of harm to the inmates residing in the dorms and that Brown should not have resided there. Furthermore, this statement implicates Defendants Fernald, Laughlin, Simpson, and Massie because the statement suggests that Brown was objectively violent and the risk of harm Brown posed to the inmates living in the dorms was obvious.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such facts may be confirmed by Hinojosa\u2019s requested discovery, which includes: the deposition of Defendants Fernald, Webster, and Massie; a request for documents containing complaints about Brown\u2019s threatening behavior; interrogatories asking about knowledge of prior complaints about Brown\u2019s threatening and menacing behavior; interrogatories regarding knowledge about Brown\u2019s violent history, disturbed mental state, and pattern of assaulting prisoners with weapons; and a request for Brown\u2019s medical records, which may reveal the extent and seriousness of his psychological condition and the risk that such a condition would lead him to commit unprovoked violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Given Webster\u2019s alleged statement and given that Hinojosa produced evidence that the dorms were largely unsupervised<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that there had been at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>least one prior attack with unsecured cleaning tools in the dorms, Hinojosa\u2019s requested discovery could create a genuine issue of material fact regarding a constitutional violation of clearly established law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We are aware that \u201cthe problems that arise in the day-to-day operation of a corrections facility are not susceptible of easy solutions\u201d and that \u201c[pjrison administrators ... should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.\u201d <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Hinojosa, however, has been denied \u201ca full and fair opportunity to discover information essential to [his] opposition to summary judgment,\u201d and this limitation is reversible error. <em>Access Telecom, Inc. v. MCI Telecomm. Corp., </em>197 F.3d 694, 720 (5th Cir.1999). Hinojosa should have been permitted discovery tailored to uncover \u201cthose facts necessary to rule on the immunity defense,\u201d including discovery into the mental state and violent tendencies of Brown and Defendants\u2019 knowledge of such.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Lion Boulos v. Wilson, </em>834 F.2d 504, 509 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The district court, therefore, abused its discretion in denying Hinojosa\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion for a continuance and granting Defendants\u2019 motion for a protective order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We thus REVERSE the district court\u2019s order in this regard and VACATE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants Fernald, Laughlin, Simpson, Webster, and Massie. This is not to say that these Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment or qualified immunity but only that Hinojosa must be permitted a fair opportunity for discovery so that he may properly oppose any such motion for summary judgment. Because the district court erred in proceeding to rule on the summary judgment motion as it pertained to Defendants Fer-nald, Laughlin, Simpson, Webster, and Massie, and we vacate this ruling, we need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>not reach the issue of whether the district court\u2019s actual ruling on such motion was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">B. Defendants Johnson and Dretke</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Hinojosa\u2019s claim against Johnson and Dretke is that they had actual knowledge of understaffing in the Texas Prison System and the resulting substantial risk of harm created.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Defendants Johnson and Dretke moved for summary judgment, contending that: (1) Hinojosa did not present any evidence that they participated in any unconstitutional acts or implemented any unconstitutional policies; (2) if staffing was inadequate, Hinojosa did not present any evidence that Defendants could have done anything about it; and (3) Hinojosa did not present evidence that inadequate staffing caused the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The district court did not address this separate claim but rather simply granted summary judgment in favor of all Defendants on the basis that Defendants had no knowledge that Brown specifically posed a threat to Hinojosa. This rationale makes no sense with respect to Hinojosa\u2019s under-staffing claim because Hinojosa did not base his claim on Defendant Johnson\u2019s and Dretke\u2019s knowledge of the threat posed by Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Nonetheless, with respect to this claim, the district court correctly denied discovery and granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants Johnson and Dretke.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For a supervisory official to be held liable, they must \u201caffirmatively participate in acts that cause constitutional deprivation\u201d or \u201cimplement unconstitutional policies that causally result in plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Mouille v. City of Live Oak, </em>977 F.2d 924, 929 (5th Cir.1992). Hinojosa currently has no evidence that: Defendants affirmatively participated in any unconstitutional acts or implemented a policy of understaffing; Defendants were aware that any understaffing produced a substantial risk of harm to inmate safety; and Defendants failed to take or could take reasonable steps in an attempt to rectify the problem. In his Rule 56(f) motion, Hi-nojosa simply does not explain how discovery will produce any evidence addressing these deficiencies, and, thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Hinojosa discovery. <em>See Access Tele-com, Inc., </em>197 F.3d at 719-20 (finding that where a party fails to explain <em>how </em>discovery will create a genuine issue of material fact, it is not an abuse of discretion to deny a Rule 56(f) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">Because the district court properly proceeded to summary judgment on this claim, and because Hinojosa\u2019s summary judgment evidence failed to create a genuine issue of material fact, the district court correctly granted summary judgment on this claim. We thus AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants Johnson and Dretke.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">Defendants Dretke, Laughlin, Simpson, and Webster also argue that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in their favor should be affirmed because Hi-nojosa faded to exhaust his administrative remedies against them. Hinojosa concedes that he did not specifically name these Defendants in his administrative grievance. Because we have already determined that summary judgment in favor of Defendant Dretke should be affirmed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>we need not consider Hinojosa\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), as amended by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), provides that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d The PLRA does not, however, specify who must be named in a prison grievance in order to exhaust properly the prison grievance system. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 922-23, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Instead, \u201cit is the prison\u2019s requirements, and not the PRLA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 923. Defendants do not argue, and nothing in the record indicates, that the Texas grievance procedures require the prisoner to specifically name a particular official.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u201c[T]he primary purpose of a grievance is to alert prison officials to a problem, not to provide personal notice to a particular official that he may be sued; the grievance is not a summons and complaint that initiates adversarial litigation.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 522 (5th Cir.2004). However, a grievance \u201cmust provide administrators with a fan1 opportunity under the circumstances to address the problem that will later form the basis of the suit, and for many types of problems this will often require, as a practical matter, that the prisoner\u2019s grievance identify individuals who are connected with the problem.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">No party, however, has cited to Hinojo-sa\u2019s administrative grievance and it is unclear whether it is even part of the record on appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We thus REMAND to the district court to determine in the first instance whether Hinojosa\u2019s administrative grievance \u201cprovide[d] administrators with a fair opportunity under the circumstances to address the problem[s] that ... later form[ed] the basis of [Hinojosa\u2019s] suit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Hinojosa finally argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for appointment of counsel. A civil rights plaintiff has no right to appointment of counsel absent exceptional circumstances. <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). In ruling on requests for appointment of counsel, courts should consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">(1) the type and complexity of the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">(2) whether the indigent is capable of adequately presenting his case; (3) whether the indigent is in a position to investigate adequately his case; and (4) whether the evidence will consist in large part of conflicting testimony so as to require skill in the presentation of evidence and in cross examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 213 (citations omitted). Noting that \u201cHinojosa has managed to prosecute his claims in a reasonably effective manner,\u201d the district court denied Hinojosa appointed counsel. Because Hinojosa\u2019s case is not complex and Hinojosa has heretofore effectively represented himself, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying appointed counsel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-10\">. Hinojosa does not assert or provide any authority for the proposition that the Texas Constitution\u2019s prohibition against \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d affords any greater protection than the U.S. Constitution\u2019s prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d Our analysis, therefore, assumes \u2014 as do the parties \u2014 that the protections afforded by both constitutions are the same. <em>See Cantu v. State, </em>939 S.W.2d 627, 645 (Tex.Crim.App. 1997) (finding \"no significance in the difference between the Eighth Amendment's 'cruel and unusual\u2019 phrasing and the \u2018cruel <em>or </em>unusual\u2019 phrasing of Art. I, Sec. 13 of the Texas Constitution\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">. Because Defendants' exhibits in their original motion for summary judgment were illegible, the court ordered Defendants to submit an amended motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-13\">. The district court stated: \u201cHinojosa will not be allowed to conduct any further discovery until the Defendants have submitted their amended motion for summary judgment and the court has made a determination of its merits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">. The district court also vaguely noted that \"security\u201d concerns justified the protective order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\">. It is undisputed that Hinojosa\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion was made well in advance of the district court\u2019s ruling, and the motion and supporting declaration put the district court on notice that Hinojosa was seeking discovery pertaining to the summary judgment motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\">. Lopez's unsworn declaration constitutes competent summary judgment evidence because it was made from personal knowledge, set forth admissible facts, showed that he was competent to testify, and was verified as true under penalty of perjury, thus meeting the requirements of Rule 56(e)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\">. Although Lopez's complaint implies a dangerous situation, Brown\u2019s reported behavior \u2014 on its face \u2014 did not indicate that he posed a substantial threat to anyone in the dorms. According to Lopez, Brown simply \"didn't like people looking at him,\u201d \"was always accusing people falsely of going into his house/eubicle and taking things,\u201d and \"had the habit of shooting the middle finger at people who looked at him or in his direction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b400-13\">. Hinojosa is also a convicted murderer serving a ninety-nine year sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\">. A prison official\u2019s knowledge of a substantial risk of harm \"can be proven through circumstantial evidence, such as by showing that the risk was so obvious that the official must have known about it.\" <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 524 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Contrary to the. analysis of the district court, the fact that no Defendant had advance notification that Brown intended to attack Hinojosa is not dispositive. The Eighth Amendment does not impose a requirement of \"advance notification of a substantial risk of assault posed by a particular fellow prisoner.\u201d <em>Fanner, </em>511 U.S. at 849 n. 10, 114 S.Ct. 1970. A prison official may not \"escape liability for deliberate indifference by showing that, while he was aware of an obvious, substantial risk to inmate safety, he did not know that the complainant was especially likely to be assaulted by the specific prisoner who eventually committed the assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843, 114 S.Ct. 1970. It is irrelevant whether a risk comes from \u201ca single source or multiple sources\u201d or whether the risk is borne by a single prisoner for personal reasons or by all similarly-situated prisoners. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b401-11\">. In Hinojosa\u2019s verified complaint, he alleges that the dorms were largely unsupervised, stating \u201cit was not unusual for an officer to supervise two or three dorms at one time, alternating from one to another.\u201d Furthermore, Hinojosa alleged that there existed no audio or video surveillance system to provide additional supervision of the dorms. These allegations came from Hinojosa's personal knowledge and were attested to in his verified complaint \u2014 which constitutes competent sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>mary judgment evidence. <em>See Huckabay v. Moore, </em>142 F.3d 233, 240 n. 6 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\">. If Defendants were aware that permitting Brown to remain in the open dormitories created a substantial risk of serious harm to the other inmates and simply disregarded this risk, such action was not \u201cobjectively reasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the conduct in question.\u201d <em>Freeman v. Gore, </em>483 F.3d 404, 411 (5th Cir.2007). Such conduct is tantamount to simply permitting \"nature to take its course,\u201d which the Supreme Court in <em>Fanner </em>found constitutionally impermissible. 511 U.S. at 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">. Although qualified immunity is immunity from suit, including discovery, discovery may proceed against a government official where \u201cthe plaintiff's allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law,\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985), as long as such discovery is \u201c 'narrowly tailored' to the question of qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Maxey by Maxey v. Fulton, </em>890 F.2d 279, 283 (10th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">With respect to Hinojosa\u2019s claim against Defendants Fernald, Laughlin, Simpson, Webster, and Massie, the Defendants do not argue \u2014 and the district court did not find\u2014 that Hinojosa failed to state a violation of clearly established law. Furthermore, it is implicit in this opinion diat Hinojosa did in fact state such a claim. As discussed above, Hinojosa is therefore entitled to limited discovery on the question of Defendants' qualified immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b402-12\">. The district court also noted without explanation and without any indication of <em>in camera </em>review that \"many of tire records cannot be disclosed for reasons of security.\u201d We will not uphold the district court\u2019s protective order on the basis of such a vague and unsubstantiated assertion, especially because the entire basis of Defendants\u2019 motion for a protective order was its alleged entitlement to qualified immunity without any mention of \u201csecurity\u201d concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\">. This Court may \u201caffirm summary judgment on any ground supported by the record, even if it is different from that relied on by the district court.\u201d <em>Holtzclaw v. DSC Commc'ns Corp., </em>255 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. Defendants Laughlin, Simpson, and Webster argued failure to exhaust administrative remedies before the district court, but the district court did not reach the issue. No party cited to Hinojosa's administrative griev-anee during die district court proceedings, as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b404-14\">. Given that the district court denied counsel after it determined that Hinojosa would not be allowed to conduct discovery before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>responding to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the district court may wish to consider anew appointment of counsel, as it may determine that Hinojosa's incarcerated status will prevent him from adequately conducting the discovery to which he is entitled. We offer no view on the appropriate determination if the district court does in fact reconsider appointment of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
