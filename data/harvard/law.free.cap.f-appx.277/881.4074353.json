After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Dail was charged with (1) possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g), 924(a)(2); (2) possession with intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841; (3) possession with intent to distribute hydropmorphone, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841; and (4) possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Dail pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine in exchange for dismissal of the other three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Dail sold cocaine to a confidential informant. Police searched Dail\u2019s residence and discovered a loaded 9mm handgun, a box of ammunition, and small quantities of marijuana, cocaine, and pills. Dail later confessed to purchasing and selling one-quarter of a kilogram of cocaine and to distributing illegal drugs for approximately four years in the area where he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The PSI calculated a base offense level of 20, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(10), and applied a 2-level enhancement for possession of a firearm, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The PSI reported that Dail was a career offender based on four prior 1999 convictions for possession with intent to sell marijuana involving drug quantities ranging from 23.2 to 53.5 grams. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender enhancement increased his offense level from 22 to 32 and his criminal history category from IV to VI. After applying a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b), the PSI calculated a total offense level of 29 and an advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Dail objected that the career-offender enhancement resulted in an excessive sentence in light of his prior convictions that involved less than two ounces of marijuana and occurred over a 10-month period. Dail noted that his advisory guidelines range would be only 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment if not for the career-offender enhancement, which would have been a more appropriate sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">At sentencing, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations. In mitigation, Dail presented a letter from his employer and stated that he had not violated his pre-trial parole, had been employed since his arrest, and would continue to work and help raise his children. Dail contended that he was not a career criminal, although he had \u201cdone some things in the past.\u201d Dail stated that he knew that he had to take responsibility for what he had done, but he felt that it was cruel to place him in prison until he was 40 years\u2019 old for this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">In response to Dail\u2019s argument that the career-offender enhancement overstated his prior criminal record, the government argued that Dail had \u201cpage after page after page\u201d of criminal history and had \u201cfar more than what is needed to qualify as a career offender.\u201d The government stated that it was \u201ca mercy\u201d for Dail to be sentenced at the low end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">The district court stated that it had considered Dail\u2019s and his attorney\u2019s statements, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guidelines and sentenced Dail to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court noted that it saw \u201cno reason to depart from the sentence called for by the application of the advisory guidelines since the facts justify it.\u201d The district court stated that \u201csentencing [Dail] at the bottom of the advisory guidelines will take into consideration what [Dail] has said to the Court this morning.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), a district court still must correctly calculate the advisory guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). The district court then must consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201c \u2018make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented\u2019 \u201d in determining its sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">A sentencing judge is not required to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). However, \u201c \u2018[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ag-bai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). Generally, when sentencing within the advisory guidelines range, the district court is not required to give a lengthy explanation for its sentence if the case is typical of those contemplated by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at-, 127 S.Ct. at 2468).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">Appellate courts review all sentences under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189 (citing <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 591). Under <em>Gall, </em>we must engage in a two-step process of sentencing review. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c\u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">Second, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597). Our review for substantive reasonableness is also guided by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1191. The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to shown on appeal that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-21\">Here, there was no procedural error at Dail\u2019s sentencing. The district court properly stated that it had treated the guidelines as advisory, and there is no indication that the district court misapprehended its authority to vary from the advisory guidelines range. The district court also stated that it had considered the arguments raised by Dail and his counsel at sentencing and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because the district court imposed a sentence within the advisory guidelines range after indicating that it saw \u201cno reason to depart from the sentence called for by the application of the advisory guidelines since the facts justify it,\u201d the district court\u2019s explanation of its chosen sentence was sufficient. <em>See Agbai, </em>497 F.3d at 1230; <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-22\">Furthermore, we cannot say that Dail\u2019s 151-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range, was substantively unreasonable. The district court sentenced Dail well below the 20-year statutory maximum sentence. Despite Dail\u2019s argument that the prior convictions used to enhance his sentence in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>volved small drug quantities and occurred within a narrow time frame, Dail\u2019s criminal history demonstrates a long-term involvement in drug distribution. Further, Dail confessed that he had been dealing drugs from approximately 2002 through his arrest his 2006. In light of these facts and our deference to the district court\u2019s advantage in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Dail has failed to carry his burden to show that the district court abused its discretion in imposing a 151-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
