Powers appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order denying his summary judgment motion and dismissing his Employee Retirement Income Security Act lawsuit against UNUM Life Insurance Company of America (UNUM) arising from the denial of continued short-term-disability benefits. Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, which the parties agree applied below, UNUM\u2019s decision needed only to be reasonable, that is, supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Dillard\u2019s Inc. v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>456 F.3d 894, 899 (8th Cir.2006) (plan administrator\u2019s decision will be reversed only if it was arbitrary and capricious); <em>Norris v. Citibank, N.A. Disability Plan (501), </em>308 F.3d 880, 883-84 (8th Cir.2002) (reviewing de novo district court\u2019s application of abuse-of-discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-18\">We agree with the district court that the decision to deny Powers benefits as of January 11, 2004, was supported by substantial evidence. As of that date Powers did not meet the second prong of the plan\u2019s definition of disabled, i.e., that he was \u201cnot working in any occupation.\u201d Given the plan\u2019s plain and unambiguous definition of disability, it is irrelevant why Powers returned to work at a lower-paying position for another employer. We also agree with the district court that the term \u201cgainful occupation\u201d is not relevant because it does not appear in the section of the plan addressing short-term disability, and that the recurrent-disability provision does not apply in these circumstances. Finally, Powers\u2019s remaining arguments (raised for the first time on appeal) are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-19\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-15\">.
