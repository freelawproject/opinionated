We dismiss his petition in part, grant his petition in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The parties are familiar with the facts, so we do not recount them. Joginder Singh did not produce evidence of extraordinary or changed circumstances to excuse his failure to file an asylum application within one year; therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review his asylum claim and dismiss that portion of his petition. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.4(a)(4) and 208.4(a)(5). The government requested a remand for the BIA and the IJ to clarify ambiguous rulings by the BIA and the IJ. Based on this record, we cannot adequately discern the precise theory upon which the IJ and the BIA denied Joginder Singh\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. Therefore, we grant the petition in part and remand for the BIA to either remand the matter to the IJ to conduct a \u201cfull and fair\u201d inquiry into Singh\u2019s credibility and issue a legally sufficient credibility determination, or accept Singh\u2019s testimony as true and determine whether he has met his burden of proof for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 1019, 1027 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, GRANTED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
