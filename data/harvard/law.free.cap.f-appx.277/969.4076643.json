Toussaint argues that the BIA erred in finding that he had not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his imputed political opinion. Toussaint also argues, for the first time on appeal, that he established past-persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group. Toussaint fails, however, to provide any argument on the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief. For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition as to Tous-saint\u2019s asylum claim, to the extent that it is based on his imputed political opinion; deny the petition as to Toussaint\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims; and dismiss the petition as to Toussaint\u2019s asylum claim based on his membership in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">In his application for asylum, -withholding of removal, and CAT relief, Toussaint alleged that he had been and would be persecuted because of his father\u2019s political activity in Haiti. Specifically, Toussaint explained that his father had served as a judge, attorney, and Senate treasurer. While these positions opened many doors for Toussaint\u2019s family, they also exposed the family to danger. When now-former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his Lavalas political party were in power, members of the opposition party viewed Toussaint\u2019s father as pro-Lavalas and threatened him with harm. When Aristide was removed from power in 2004, Lavalas supporters viewed Toussaint\u2019s father as pro-opposition and threatened him with harm. Because of these threats, Tous-saint\u2019s family had been forced into hiding, and Toussaint had been forced to flee to the United States. Toussaint feared that, if he returned to Haiti, Lavalas supporters would target him for failing to support the Lavalas party. He feared that he would be tortured because Lavalas supporters commonly used torture as a means of overcoming political opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">At his individual hearing, Toussaint testified that because of his father\u2019s precarious political position, his family had been persecuted by both Lavalas supporters and the opposition, known as the \u201cConvergence.\u201d The persecution from Lavalas supporters consisted of constant threats to his father. The persecution from the Convergence consisted of, in June 2000, spray painting a Creole slang term for \u201cproblem person\u201d on Toussaint\u2019s family\u2019s house, Toussaint\u2019s father\u2019s car, and Toussaint\u2019s father\u2019s office door.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">Because of this persecution, Toussaint\u2019s father sent him to the United States. However, Toussaint\u2019s father could not obtain visas for Toussaint\u2019s two older brothers, one older sister, and one younger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>sister because Haitian law required visa applicants over the age of 18 to individually apply for a visa and prove individual wealth. Thus, Toussaint\u2019s family remained in Haiti. Indeed, although his father had visited him in the United States on three occasions, he had returned to Haiti after each visit. Toussaint\u2019s last communication with his father was four months before the hearing. At that time, Toussaint\u2019s father told him that condition in Haiti remained \u201cnot good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">An immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Toussaint\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. On appeal, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial. The BIA reasoned that Toussaint had not established past persecution, as the alleged harm that Toussaint and his family suffered did not rise to the level of persecution. The BIA also reasoned that the IJ correctly found that Toussaint had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution, especially as his family remained unharmed in Haiti.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo </em>and factual determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence test.\u201d <em>See D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2001). Under this test, which is \u201chighly deferential,\u201d we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). In order to reverse a finding of fact, \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">In conducting our review, we will not consider arguments presented before the IJ or BIA but not discussed on appeal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 401 </em>F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201c[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d). Also, we lack jurisdiction to consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1294 (explaining that \u201ca court lacks jurisdiction to consider a claim which has not first been presented to the Board, as an alien must exhaust the administrative remedies available to him prior to obtaining judicial review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for, <em>inter alia, </em>asylum. INA \u00a7\u00a7 208(a)(1), 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(1). To qualify for asylum, the alien must prove that he is a refugee. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). A refugee is defined in the INA as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish refugee status, the alien must establish, through specific, detailed facts, (1) his past persecution on account of a protected ground, or (2) his \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that he will be persecuted in the future because of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">A well-founded fear of future persecution may be established by showing (1) past persecution that creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a protected ground, (2) a reasonable possibility of personal persecution based on a protected ground, or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (b)(2)(i) and (iii). In establishing the possibility of personal persecution, the alien must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution.\u201d <em>Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1009 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). An alien\u2019s allegations of a future threat are less persuasive if the alien\u2019s family remains in his country without incident. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006). In establishing a pattern or practice of persecution, the alien need not prove that he would be singled out for persecution if he demonstrates (1) a pattern or practice of persecution of similarly situated individuals and (2) that his inclusion in that group of individuals makes his fear of persecution reasonable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). In establishing any of the above, the alien must demonstrate that his fear \u201cis subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">While the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have recognized that it is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that [m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted) (concluding that \u201cmenacing\u201d telephone calls and threats to the alien and her brother did not constitute past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">As to Toussaint\u2019s imputed-politiealopinion asylum claim, we hold that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s holding that Toussaint did not meet the requirements to merit asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. The evidence does not compel a finding that Toussaint suffered past persecution. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. The alleged persecution described by Toussaint, which consisted of threats and spray-painted slogans on his family\u2019s house, his father\u2019s car, and his father\u2019s office door, did not rise to the level of persecution within the meaning of the asylum statutes. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. The threats made on his family, which Toussaint failed to describe in any detail, constituted mere verbal harassment, at most. The spray-painted slogan denoting Toussaint\u2019s father as a \u201cproblem person\u201d likewise appears to have been an effort at intimidation, at most.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">Likewise, the evidence does not compel a finding that Toussaint has a well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Mendoza, 327 F.3d </em>at 1287. First, Toussaint did not provide \u201cspecific, detailed facts\u201d showing a reasonable probability that he will be singled out for persecution if returned to Haiti. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (b)(2)(i) and (iii); <em>Huang, </em>429 F.3d at 1009. Toussaint did not illustrate that Lavalas supporters or the Convergence remain interested in his father or himself. Toussaint also testified that his entire family remains in Haiti. While Toussaint did not testify that they remain in Haiti unharmed, he provided no evidence to believe otherwise. This fact suggests that the alleged danger faced by Toussaint is not as great as he claims. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1259. His explanation that his siblings had to remain in Haiti because them ages required them to individually apply for visas does not diminish this weakening effect, as Toussaint testified that he had a younger sister at the time who would not have fallen under Haiti\u2019s individual-application rule and as he did not explain why none of his siblings attempted to individually apply or otherwise seek asylum in United States. Second, Toussaint provided no evidence to suggest that he belongs to a statutorily defined group of individuals that the Lavalas party and the Convergence have a pattern and practice of persecuting. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (b)(2)\u00ae and (iii). Because Toussaint did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his imputed political opinion, we deny the petition as to this claim. <em>See D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">As to Toussaint\u2019s social-group asylum claim, we hold that we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim. <em>See Al Nujjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1294. Toussaint did not raise this argument before the IJ or BIA. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition as to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Finally, as to the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of <em>removal and </em>CAT relief, we hold that Toussaint has abandoned any argument that this was error. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2. Toussaint failed to provide any argument on this matter in his brief on appeal. Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Toussaint\u2019s withholding-of-removal and CAT-relief claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-8\">. We note that the parties disagree on the scope of our review. Toussaint argues that we should review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions, while the government argues that we should review the BIA\u2019s decision only. When the BIA issues a summary affirmance of the IJ's decision, we review the IJ's opinion. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, but issues a separate opinion, however, we review the BIA\u2019s opinion \"except to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (llth Cir.2004). Here, we find that the BIA issued a separate opinion. <em>See id. </em>The reasoning offered by the BIA diverged in two important respects from that of the IJ. First, the IJ\u2019s decision did not contain a clear past persecution finding, but the BIA\u2019s did. Second, the IJ\u2019s decision contained an express adverse credibility finding, but the BIA's opinion said nothing of Toussaint\u2019s credibility or the believability of his story. Therefore, we will review only the BIA\u2019s opinion, and will not address any issues dealing with Tous-saint's credibility. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
