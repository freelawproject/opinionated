Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.146, and he requests that we expedite his appeal. The motion to expedite the appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-24\">To the extent that he has raised the issue on appeal, Barker\u2019s contention that defendants Owens and Ruzicka are not immune from monetary damages is merit-less. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>Hulsey v. Owens, </em>63 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.1995). We agree with the district court that Barker\u2019s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief fail to state a claim for relief under Fed. R.CivP. 12(b)(6). As the decision whether to release an inmate to MRIS is entirely within the Board\u2019s discretion, Barker has no constitutionally protected interest in release. <em>See </em>Tex Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.146; <em>Allison v. Kyle, </em>66 F.3d 71, 73-74 (1995). Barker\u2019s contention that the Board deviated from the procedural requirements of \u00a7 508.146 does not allege a constitutional violation because the \u201c[m]ere failure to accord the procedural protections called for by state law or regulation does not of itself amount to a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Giovanni v. Lynn, </em>48 F.3d 908, 912 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-25\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO EXPEDITE APPEAL DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
