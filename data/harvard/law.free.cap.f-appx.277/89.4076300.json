Both judgments were entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Sweet, J.). Animpong was sentenced principally to a term of 87 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Quarshie was sentenced principally to a term of 27 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">On appeal, Animpong challenges the sentence imposed by the district court and Quarshie raises a <em>Batson </em>challenge and an issue of potential jury taint.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Animpong appeals her sentence, arguing that the district court did not understand its authority to depart from the Guidelines sentencing range once it had granted her a departure from the statutory minimum under the statutory \u201csafety valve\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(f). In <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>this court found that \u201c[djefendants eligible for safety valve relief may accordingly avoid being sentenced under statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums and may instead receive the benefit of the advisory Guidelines regime.\u201d 460 F.3d 337, 354 (2d Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Under a review of \u201cprocedural reasonableness, ... we consider such factors as whether the district court properly (a) identified the Guidelines range supported by the facts found by the court, (b) treated the Guidelines as advisory, and (c) considered the Guidelines together with the other factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).... \u201d <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 131-32 (2d Cir.2006). Despite the fact that the district court properly treated the Guidelines as advisory and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in its written sentencing opinion, Animpong contends that the district court\u2019s oral statements at the sentencing hearing demonstrate that it did not fully comprehend its authority to depart from the Guidelines. Specifically, Animpong cites to the court\u2019s statement that \u201cIf our laws were the way they had been when I first started doing this work some more than 20-odd years ago, you would not be receiving this sentence .... [Tjhough I wish I could conscientiously depart from the guidelines, I don\u2019t feel that I can.... I don\u2019t feel that I have any choice.\u201d In focusing on that limited portion of the court\u2019s statement, Animpong overlooks the court\u2019s statement that \u201cin order to depart from the guidelines, there are certain decisions, requirements that have to be met, standards that have to be met.... Unfortunately, however, this was in the view of Congress and the Sentencing Commission a very serious crime.\u201d In reviewing the record as a whole, we find that the court properly understood its authority to depart from the Guidelines under the current advisory Guidelines scheme. For that reason, An-impong\u2019s sentence is affirmed as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Quarshie argues that the district court did not adequately consider her challenge to the government\u2019s use of peremptory challenges under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). To make a <em>Batson </em>challenge,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-11\">[f]irst, the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of race. Second, if the requisite showing has been made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the jurors in question. Finally, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahq\"><em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358-59, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>(1991) (internal citations omitted). \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s decision on the ultimate question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact of the sort accorded great deference on appeal....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 111 S.Ct. 1859. During voir dire, Quarshie challenged the government\u2019s dismissal of three jurors. Although the district court did not specifically rule on whether Quar-shie had met the burden for a prima facie showing, it stated that the showing \u201cmight be arguable\u201d and asked the government for its reasoning in dismissing the three jurors. After hearing the reasons, the district court stated, \u201cI think the statistics, that is, the breakdown of the jury, doesn\u2019t really raise a presumption of discriminatory challenges by the government. But even if it did, I find that [the government\u2019s] explanations are satisfactory.\u201d The district court applied the three-part analysis for reviewing a <em>Batson </em>challenge and considered the presentations of the parties before ruling. Although Quarshie argues that there should have been a second opportunity to counter the reasons provided by the government, it does not appear from the record that Quarshie\u2019s counsel sought such an opportunity. In considering the evidence provided to the district court and the discretion we must afford the district court\u2019s findings, there is no basis on which to find that the district court improperly considered the <em>Batson </em>challenge or that its findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Quarshie argues that the district court erred in its questioning of Juror 11 after he told the court that he did not feel comfortable deliberating on the case and in the court\u2019s subsequent decision to have the remaining jurors continue them deliberations after a curative instruction. Prior to the district court\u2019s resolution of the matter, Quarshie\u2019s counsel, having been given the opportunity confer with Quarshie, stated, \u201cI haven\u2019t changed my mind. I\u2019m exactly what I said before. I\u2019m willing to go with 11 out of 12 with whatever you consider a curative instruction.\u201d If a party actively relinquishes or waives a right, that right is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (explaining that where a right has been waived, as opposed to forfeited, it is not subject to plain error review). By agreeing to the dismissal of Juror 11 and the curative instruction to the jury, Quarshie did not preserve the issue for appeal and has instead waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s actions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">We have considered defendants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
