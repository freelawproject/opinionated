Mukasey, Judge) entered on April 26 and April 28, 2006, respectively, sentencing Juan principally to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment for operating a continuing criminal enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a), concurrently with 240 months\u2019 imprisonment for running a business for the purpose of distributing narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a); and sentencing Freddy principally to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, concurrently with 240 months\u2019 imprisonment for running a business for the purpose of distributing narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a). Juan and Freddy were convicted of these and other counts following a jury trial in 1992. See <em>United States v. Fermin, </em>32 F.3d 674, 675-76 (2d Cir.1994), <em>cert, denied, </em>513 U.S. 1170, 115 S.Ct. 1145, 130 L.Ed.2d 1104 (1995). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the balance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">I. Juan\u2019s CCE Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Juan asks us to vacate his CCE conviction on the grounds that (1) the jury instructions did not comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999); (2) the Superseding Indictment failed to specify the three violations found by the jury to constitute the continuing series; and (3) the jury\u2019s response to the interrogatory regarding the three violations was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>A. Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Juan abandoned his challenge to the jury instructions at the sentencing hearing. In any event, as Juan apparently realized, the challenge is meritless. Judge Louis J. Freeh expressly charged the jury, \u201cYou must, however, unanimously agree on which three acts constitute the continuing series of violations.\u201d This instruction complied with <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>requirement that a jury \u201cagree unanimously about which specific violations make up the \u2018continuing series of violations.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Richardson, </em>526 U.S. at 815, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <em>see also </em>3 L. Sand, <em>et al, </em>Modern Federal Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal \u00a7 56.04, Instr. 56-28 (\u201cYou must unanimously agree on which three acts constitute the continuing series of violations.\u201d); <em>cf. Monsanto v. United States, </em>348 F.3d 345, 347, 349 (2d Cir.2003) (instruction that failed to \u201ctell the jury that it needed to unanimously agree on which narcotics violations constituted the \u2018series of violations\u2019 \u201d violated <em>Richardson).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\n<em>B. Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">Juan\u2019s argument that the Superseding Indictment was defective for failing to specify the three violations found by the jury to support the CCE conviction is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Flaharty, </em>295 F.3d 182, 198 (2d Cir.), cert <em>denied, </em>537 U.S. 936, 123 S.Ct. 37, 154 L.Ed.2d 237 (2002). \u201c[A]n indictment that does not identify which of many alleged felonies constituted the series is not thereby defective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197. In this case, Count 1 of the Superseding Indictment closely tracked the language of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(c) and alleged that the continuing series was composed of, among other felonies (specifically including the violations alleged in Counts 2 and 3, which were expressly incorporated into Count 1), violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b), which forbids the use of a telephone to facilitate the commission of a narcotics felony. The indictment further charged the approximate time and place of the enterprise. Such an indictment is sufficient under <em>Flaharty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\n<em>C. Jury\u2019s Response to the Interrogatory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Similarly, there is no merit to Juan\u2019s argument that the jury\u2019s responses to the special interrogatories on the CCE count require vacating his conviction. We do not require district courts to use special interrogatories for a CCE charge. <em>See United States v. Ogando, </em>968 F.2d 146, 149 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201c[W]e commit the decision of whether and how to utilize special interrogatories in such cases to the broad discretion of the district court.\u201d). We have, however, indicated that for such a charge \u201cthe trial court would be well advised to submit to the jury interrogatories that would allow an assessment of whether the jury\u2019s determination of guilt rested on permissible bases.\u201d <em>United States v. Roman, </em>870 F.2d 65, 73 (2d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Here, the jury was asked if the offense involved \u201cat least three offenses in a continuing series of violations of the federal narcotics laws?\u201d The jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>then asked to \u201cspecify three such offenses.\u201d The jury\u2019s identification of three government exhibits in response sufficiently enabled \u201can assessment of whether the jury\u2019s determination of guilt rested on permissible bases.\u201d Indeed, when the District Court asked if there were \u201cany other requests by the defendants in the presence of the jury?,\u201d Juan\u2019s attorney asked only that the jury be polled. That Juan\u2019s challenge to the jury\u2019s answer to the interrogatory did not arise until March 31, 2004, almost twelve years after the verdict was rendered, reinforces our conclusion that the answer provided sufficient specificity to support the verdict. <em>Cf. United States v. Quinones, </em>511 F.3d 289, 308 (2d Cir. 2007) (noting that defendants\u2019 failure to raise a contemporaneous objection to prosecutor\u2019s misstatement in summation reinforces conclusion \u201cthat the misstatement was inadvertent and neither intended nor understood to suggest that uncharged evidence demonstrated defendants\u2019 propensity to commit drug crimes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Because Juan\u2019s challenges to his CCE conviction fail on the merits, we need not address the government\u2019s alternative argument that they are procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">\n<em>Sentencing Challenges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The remainder of Juan\u2019s and Freddy\u2019s arguments challenge several aspects of the District Court\u2019s sentences. We review a district court\u2019s sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness, a standard \u201cakin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.), cert <em>denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 192,166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing for procedural reasonableness, an appellate court must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de nouo, </em>and apply the clear error standard when evaluating a district court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>521 F.3d 149, 156-57 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">II. Freddy\u2019s Criminal History Category</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">Freddy argues that the District Court erred by placing him in Criminal History Category (\u201cCHC\u201d) IV because (1) the law of the ease precludes changing the CHC III determination made at his first sen: tencing and (2) the government failed to prove that the conviction in question was not part of the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">\n<em>A. The La.w of the Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-15\">Freddy no longer disputes the finality of his 1987 New York state conviction for fourth-degree possession of a narcotic drug, arising from an arrest on February 20, 1986. Freddy argues, rather, that because he was first sentenced in 1993 under CHC III, the District Court violated the law of the case by sentencing him under CHC IV in 2006 following vacatur of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction by the District Court in light of <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">The law of the ease does not bar recalculation of Freddy\u2019s CHC. \u201cWhen a defendant challenges convictions on particular counts that are inextricably tied to other counts in determining the sentencing range under the guidelines, the defendant assumes the risk of undoing the intricate knot of calculations should he succeed. Once this knot is undone, the district court must sentence the defendant <em>de novo </em>and, if a more severe sentence results, vindictiveness will not be presumed.\u201d <em>United States v. Atehortva, </em>69 F.3d 679, 685-86 (2d Cir.1995) (citation omitted), cert <em>de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>nied sub nom. Correa v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 1249, 116 S.Ct. 2510, 135 L.Ed.2d 199 (1996); <em>see also United States v. Quintieri, </em>306 F.3d 1217, 1227-28 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cA district court\u2019s sentence is based on the constellation of offenses for which the defendant was convicted and their relationship to a mosaic of facts, including the circumstances of the crimes, their relationship to one another, and other relevant behavior of the defendant.... For the district court to sentence the defendant accurately and appropriately, it must confront the offenses of conviction and facts anew.\u201d), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Donato v. United States, </em>539 U.S. 902, 123 S.Ct. 2246, 156 L.Ed.2d 110 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Freddy successfully challenged his \u00a7 924(c) conviction, thereby paving the way to a new sentence on his related drug counts. <em>See United States v. Mata, </em>133 F.3d 200, 201-02 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam) (holding that district court has jurisdiction to resentence after vacatur of \u00a7 924(c) conviction and finding no double jeopardy nor due process violation); <em>United States v. Gordils, </em>117 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir.) (holding that district court may \u201cresentence a defendant on a related, unchallenged drug conviction when the defendant has successfully challenged his \u00a7 924(c) conviction pursuant to <em>Bailey </em>\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 975, 118 S.Ct. 430, 139 L.Ed.2d 330 (1997); <em>Rodriguez v. United States, </em>116 F.3d 1002 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 962, 118 S.Ct. 396, 139 L.Ed.2d 309 (1997). Nothing in the law of the case doctrine precluded the District Court from recalculating Freddy\u2019s criminal history category upon resentencing him. In fact, the District Court was \u201crequired to resentence [Freddy] in light of the circumstances as they stood at the time of his resentencing.\u201d <em>Werber v. United States, </em>149 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">We further note that even when the law of the case bars reconsideration of an issue, district courts may depart from the law of the case and \u201creconsider their own decisions for cogent and compelling reasons if those decisions have not been ruled on by the appellate court.\u201d <em>Quintieri, </em>306 F.3d at 1230. This principle applies \u201cwhether the resentencing results from a remand after direct appeal or from a successful \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 n. 8. As the government points out, by 2006, Freddy\u2019s 1987 conviction had become final and Freddy no longer challenged it on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court was therefore entitled to reconsider Freddy\u2019s CHC due to this change in the status of his 1987 conviction. <em>Cf. United States v. Cox, </em>245 F.3d 126, 130-31 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cIn light of the dismissal of his 1999 state conviction, therefore, Cox is entitled to a review of his federal sentence, which was enhanced on account of a prior conviction that now has been dismissed.\u201d); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>239 F.3d 473, 475 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam) (\u201c[Defendants who successfully attack state convictions may seek review of federal sentences that were enhanced on account of such state convictions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\n<em>B. Part of the Instant Offense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Freddy further challenges the inclusion of his 1987 conviction in the calculation of his CHC on the ground that the government failed to prove that the conviction was not part of the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In order to count a \u201cprior sentence\u201d towards a defendant\u2019s CHC, that sentence must have been imposed \u201cfor conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). \u201cConduct that is part of the instant offense means conduct that is relevant conduct to the instant offense under the provisions of \u00a7 IB 1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 1. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Guideline, in turn, encompasses acts \u201cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In the related context of the career offender guidelines, we have held that a defendant bears the burden of proving that the prior crimes were part of a common scheme. <em>See United States v. Brothers, </em>316 F.3d 120, 124 (2d Cir.2003) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Butler, </em>970 F.2d 1017, 1026 (2d Cir.) (\u201c[T]hough the government generally has the burden of proving facts upon which the requested penalties are predicated, we disagree that it has the burden of proving that the acts underlying a defendant\u2019s prior unconsolidated convictions were not committed as part of a single common scheme or plan.\u201d), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Harris v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 980, 113 S.Ct. 480, 121 L.Ed.2d 386 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Similarly, once the government established that Freddy had a prior sentence, the burden then shifted to Freddy to persuade the District Court that the prior sentence was for conduct that is part of the instant offense and so should not count in calculating his criminal history. <em>Cf. United States v. O\u2019Neil, </em>118 F.3d 65, 76 (2d Cir.1997) (holding that under criminal history guidelines once government established defendant was on lifetime parole, burden shifted to defendant to prove that he had been discharged from parole), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Saia v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 1064, 118 S.Ct. 728, 139 L.Ed.2d 666 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Accordingly, Freddy\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">III. Drug Quantity</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\n<em>A. Sufficient Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">The Fermins challenge the District Court\u2019s finding of 33.2 kilograms of cocaine in setting the base offense level. \u201cWhen addressing a claim that there was insufficient evidence to support a district court\u2019s drug quantity finding, we are mindful that the district court has broad discretion to consider all relevant information and the quantity determination will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Snow, </em>462 F.3d 55, 72 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1022, 166 L.Ed.2d 770 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">At the most recent sentencing, the District Court adopted the quantity findings that Judge Freeh had made in 1993 with respect to both defendants, further noting that Judge Freeh had likely underestimated the quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">The defendants argue that 33 kilograms must be too much because, for example, little to no drugs were actually seized; not much cash was seized and the defendants\u2019 drug ledger reflected only $36,000 in sales; and undercover agents did not observe or participate in any sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-15\">The Guidelines recognize that the quantity seized might not reflect the scale of the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, emt. n. 12 (\u201cWhere there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\u201d). Moreover, our review of Judge Freeh\u2019s determination reveals that he considered defendants\u2019 exculpatory evidence when approximating the quantity. Judge Freeh noted the \u201calmost nonexistent\u201d \u201camount of narcotics\u201d seized and the absence of drug records, money laundering activities, and witnessed transactions. And when reviewing the transcripts, Judge Freeh, who presided over defendants\u2019 trial and the retrial of their brother Hector, irequently rejected the government\u2019s interpretations of the conversations as re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>fleeting larger quantities. The quantity determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\n<em>B. Amendment 518</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">The Fermins argue that the District Court failed to apply Guidelines Amendment 518 so as to exclude from the calculation the amounts they \u201cdid not intend to provide or purchase or [were] not reasonably capable of providing or purchasing.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12; <em>see also </em>Amendment 518, U.S.S.G.App. C at 430, 431, 433 (1997) (effective Nov. 1, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">After the Fermins\u2019 first sentencings, Amendment 518 modified slightly the quantity analysis. Among other changes, the revision made \u201clack of either intent or capability a ground for reducing the quantity for which a defendant could be sentenced. The previous Note 12 had permitted a reduction of quantity only if a defendant lacked both intent and capability.\u201d <em>United States v. Dallas, </em>229 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir.2000) (citation omitted). In addition, Amendment 518 clarified somewhat the burdens on the parties with respect to these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">The Government first has to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant intended to provide the buyer with the alleged amount of drugs, and was reasonably capable of providing that amount. The defendant then \u201cmust <em>produce </em>evidence tending to establish lack of intent or inability to deliver the alleged quantity of drugs.\u201d The defendant must offer more than simply counsel\u2019s argument that he lacked intent and ability. If the defendant meets this burden of production, the burden of proof shifts back to the Government: \u201cthe ultimate burden of proof with respect to intent and ability rests with the government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hazut, </em>140 F.3d 187, 191-93 (2d Cir.1998)) (citations omitted). We noted that Amendment 518 had not altered our conclusion under prior versions that the government has the ultimate burden of proof. <em>Hazut, </em>140 F.3d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">To establish lack of intent or inability, the Fermins point to essentially the same evidence they relied on to argue that the quantity found vastly overstated their culpability. The District Court was not persuaded by this evidence, noting that the defendants\u2019 drug ledger might not \u201crelate to the entirety of the business that was done\u201d and a small profit margin could explain the absence of \u201cvast amounts of cash.\u201d The District Court determined that Judge Freeh\u2019s calculations had excluded \u201cmere puffery.\u201d Indeed, in refusing to extrapolate the quantity over the course of the conspiracy, Judge Freeh had said, \u201cAt times the organization appears to be able to distribute. At other times it appears to be unable to distribute any amount of narcotics.\u201d In addition, at least as to Juan, Judge Freeh said that all of his quantity calculations were \u201cdone on the basis of my findings that the defendant either directly transacted or controlled the narcotics or dollar amounts which are cash proceeds, or was responsible for controlling them because of his position and leadership in this conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">The District Court did not err in finding that the government had met its burden of proof in accordance with Amendment 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">\n<em>C. Freddy\u2019s Responsibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">Freddy further argues that because he was no longer the subject of an aggravating role enhancement, the District Court was now required to make particularized findings regarding the scope of the agreement and reasonable foreseeability. The absence of the role enhancement did not alter the District Court\u2019s obligations to determine the relevant conduct for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Freddy was responsible under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. More importantly, the District Court adequately discharged its obligation to explain the factual findings underlying its determination of the Guidelines range. As previously noted, the District Court adopted the quantity findings that Judge Freeh had made in 1993 with respect to both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Although the District Court did not explicitly discuss the scope of Freddy\u2019s agreement and reasonable foreseeability in 2006, the extent of Freddy\u2019s responsibility had previously been addressed by both Judge Freeh and Judge Mukasey. At Juan\u2019s sentencing on March 2, 1993, Judge Freeh found that Juan and Freddy \u201cwere equally situated as joint venturers and partners regarding the narcoties-related business---- [T]hey both had extensive and continuous conversations between themselves and others regarding the drug transactions as well as cash transactions related to those narcotics.\u201d Judge Freeh incorporated this finding when he commenced Freddy\u2019s sentencing on March 31, 1993, noting that Freddy was \u201ca joint and coventurer with respect to Juan ... in the extensive and continuous operations which both defendants undertook over an extensive period of time.\u201d On remand, at the December 1994 sentencing, Judge Muka-sey rejected the government\u2019s arguments for a supervisory role enhancement or an upward departure based on control over the resources, but found that Freddy \u201cwas sharing equally with his brother.\u201d In addition, the PSR states that Freddy \u201cwas Juan\u2019s right-hand man\u201d and that the two \u201cdiscussed most of the narcotics-related business decisions that had to be made before those decisions were made.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The basis for holding Freddy responsible for the same quantity as Juan was thus clear. <em>See Snow, </em>462 F.3d at 72 (\u201cUltimately, the question is whether the conspiracy-wide quantity was within the scope of the criminal activity the defendant agreed to and whether the activity in question was foreseeable to the defendant.\u201d); <em>United States v. Studley, </em>47 F.3d 569, 575 (2d Cir.1995) (factors to determine scope of agreement include whether participants pool them profits and resources, whether defendant assisted in designing and executing the illegal scheme, and the role defendant agreed to play in the operation).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">IV. Firearms Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">Juan and Freddy each challenge the imposition of a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a firearm in connection with a narcotics offense. \u201cThe adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Defendants point to evidence regarding the firearms and argue it is \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the firearms were connected with their narcotics offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">Juan argues that the shotgun found at 3 Way was registered to him, was not used, and was stored in a closet out of reach. Juan argues that the absence of evidence of use makes it \u201creasonable to assume that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>it is clearly improbable that the guns were related to the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Freddy argues that there was no evidence that he stored drugs or drug proceeds at his residence and the firearm found there was not loaded. As for the firearm found at 3 Way, Freddy argues that there was no evidence that drugs were stored or sold there and that the evidence established that Freddy delivered cocaine at locations other than 3 Way.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The District Court\u2019s rejection of these arguments was neither based on clearly erroneous factual findings nor legal error. Contrary to the Fermins\u2019 contentions, this enhancement does not require evidence that the weapons were used or loaded. As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">[T]he dangerous-weapon enhancement reflects the understanding that the mere presence of firearms in connection with a drug transaction can increase the risk of violence. Indeed, the mere presence of a gun, <em>loaded or not, </em>can escalate the danger. This is so not only because an unloaded firearm may quickly and easily be loaded and used ... but also because the presence of a firearm may increase the risk that others will react in violent ways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\"><em>United States v. Smythe, </em>363 F.3d 127, 129 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">As for Freddy\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence of drug activity by him at 3 Way, we previously held that \u201c[a]mple evidence demonstrated that Freddy engaged in numerous narcotics transactions from the office [at 3 Way] where the gun was found. Moreover, in a taped narcotics-related conversation Freddy made various references to this gun.\u201d <em>Fermin, </em>32 F.3d at 678. Although we stated this in the course of rejecting Freddy\u2019s sufficiency challenge to his \u00a7 924(c) conviction for use of the shotgun found at 3 Way and that conviction was subsequently vacated in light of <em>Bailey, </em>our review of the record establishes that the District Court\u2019s determinations for purposes of the enhancement were not clearly erroneous. The District Court did not err in finding the weapons\u2019 connection with the offenses not \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">V. Section 3553(a) Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">Finally, Juan and Freddy challenge the District Court\u2019s consideration of the sentencing factors set forth in Section 3553(a), Title 18 of the United States Code. Juan argues that the District Court failed to consider the improper denial of his suppression motion, as indicative of the weakness of the government\u2019s case, as well as the lesser punishments given to co-conspirators. Freddy argues that the District Court failed to consider that the offense involved only $36,000 worth of cocaine and the evidence of his rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">\u201c[T]he law in this circuit is well established that, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, we presume \u2018that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 129 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006)). We do not find this presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>overcome in this case. We previously affirmed the denial of the suppression motion, <em>see Fermin, </em>32 F.3d at 676-77, which, we note, concerned alleged government misconduct in securing authorization for the wiretaps, <em>not </em>\u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). In addition, as the government notes, Juan did not even raise this argument below. Juan\u2019s reliance on the shorter sentences for codefendants who pled guilty and the non-prosecution of co-conspirators is similarly unavailing. We do not see any inexplicable unwarranted sentencing disparity. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6); <em>United States v. Elfgeeh, </em>515 F.3d 100, 139 (2d Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Wills, </em>476 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Nor did the District Court err in failing to consider that the conspiracy involved $36,000 worth of cocaine. As discussed above, and contrary to Freddy\u2019s insistence, the District Court properly determined that the offense involved a much greater quantity of cocaine. The record further reflects that the District Court did consider Freddy\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We have reviewed all of appellants\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgments of the District Court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\">. We have held that it is not plain error to rely on a PSR's findings even though, as here, they were not explicitly adopted in open court, so long as the findings are adequate to support the sentence. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>489 F.3d 528, 539-40 (2d Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied sub noin. Bearam v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1066, 169 L.Ed.2d 814 (2008). Insofar as we discuss information derived from sealed documents, those documents are unsealed to the limited extent referenced in this order, although the full documents shall remain physically withheld from public review. <em>See United States v. Verk-hoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 124 n. 2 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\">. Reliance on <em>United States v. North, </em>900 F.2d 131, 135 (8th Cir.1990), is misplaced because the unloaded shotgun and inoperable rifle at issue in that case were found in the room of the defendant\u2019s son, who testified that the weapons were his and were used for hunting. Nor is <em>United States v. Khang, </em>904 F.2d 1219, 1224 (8th Cir.1990), helpful to defendants since in that case the government had conceded that the firearm had no relationship to the narcotics offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
