Additionally, he contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim that DHR unfairly evaluated his performance in May 2006 in retaliation for filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and this lawsuit. We address each issue in turn, and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>fact and compels judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThere is no genuine issue of material fact if the nonmoving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case and on which the party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Jones v. Gerwens, </em>874 F.2d 1534, 1538 (11th Cir.1989). \u201cGenuine disputes are those in which the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant.\u201d <em>Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., </em>93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Title VII prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>an employer from discriminating against a person based on gender. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). Under Title VII, a plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of proving discriminatory treatment by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Earley v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>907 F.2d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir.1990). Absent direct evidence of an intent to discriminate, a plaintiff may prove his case through circumstantial evidence, using the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>E.E.O.C. v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1265, 1273 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Where, as here, the district court finds the plaintiff established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination and the employer has proffered one or <em>more </em>legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment action, \u201cthe burden of production shifts to the plaintiff to offer evidence that the alleged reason of the employer is a pretext for illegal discrimination.\u201d <em>See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cTo show that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual, the plaintiff must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoheren-cies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Cooper v. S. Co., </em>390 F.3d 695, 725 (Uth Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). \u201cIf the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, a plaintiff cannot recast the reason but must meet it head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1088. \u201cQuarreling with that reason is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the plaintiff cannot create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether each of the defendant employer\u2019s articulated reasons is pretextual, the employer is entitled to summary judgment. <em>Cooper, </em>390 F.3d at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">\u201c[T]he failure to promulgate hiring and promotion policies\u201d can be evidence of pretext. <em>Carter v. Three Spyings Residential Treatment, </em>132 F.3d 635, 644 (11th Cir. 1998). A decision is even more suspicious where established rules were bent or broken to give an applicant an edge in the hiring process. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, when challenging a successful applicant\u2019s qualifications, a plaintiff must show that the disparities between the candidates\u2019 qualifications were \u201cof such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). Further, evidence that an employer had additional reasons for terminating an employee does not prove pretext. <em>Tidwell v. Carter Prods., </em>135 F.3d 1422, 1428 (11th Cir. 1998). If an employer offers different reasons for terminating an employee, those reasons must be inconsistent in order to constitute evidence of pretext. <em>Zaben v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>129 F.3d 1453, 1458-59 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Moore failed to show pretext. Evidence did not show that Moore was more qualified than the female candidates hired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>for the positions, that DHR changed its rationale for the decisions, or that DHR deviated from its internal procedures for promotions. Moreover, although emails by a supervisor addressed the recipients, including Moore, as \u201cLadies,\u201d they did not constitute circumstantial evidence of gender discrimination because they were unrelated to the promotions and Moore did not produce additional evidence supporting his claim of pretext. Additionally, although the reasons cited for promoting the female candidates in the EEOC position statement differed slightly from deposition testimony, that alone does not establish pretext. <em>See Tidwell, </em>135 F.3d at 1428. None of those reasons were inconsistent with one another. <em>See Zaben, </em>129 F.3d at 1458-59. Because Moore failed to show a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DHR\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the October 2004 and January 2005 promotions were pretexts for gender discrimination, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of DHR.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Title VII makes it unlawful for \u201can employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has made a charge, testified, or assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Where, as here, the district court finds the plaintiff demonstrated a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation and the employer proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment action, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is a pretext for retaliation. <em>See Thomas, </em>506 F.3d at 1363-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Moore contends DHR applied a different standard in evaluating him than it did to other similarly-situated employees, resulting in a reduced raise. However, the evidence did not show that Moore performed the same amount of work as his predecessor. Moore failed to show that DHR\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for increasing his performance requirements was pretext for retaliation, and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of DHR. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\">. Moore\u2019s claim against Caro Shanahan was dismissed for failure to timely perfect service on August 28, 2006. Because Moore does not challenge the dismissal on appeal, any claim in this respect is abandoned. <em>See Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998) (holding issues not raised on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
