On appeal, Zamora-Cedeno argues that (1) the district court erred by denying him a minor-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, and (2) his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">I. Minor-role reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). A sentencing court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if the court finds that the defendant was a minor participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is one who \u201cis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. The party seeking a reduction bears the burden of establishing that the defendant\u2019s role was minor by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 939. With respect to this inquiry, district courts are not required to make \u201cspecific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">In determining whether a minor-role reduction is warranted, a district court performs a two-prong analysis examining (1) the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable, and (2) the defendant\u2019s role in comparison to the other participants. <em>Id. </em>at 940. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>der the first prong, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor ... participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Under the second prong, the district court may assess a defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to \u201cother participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 944. The district court may only consider participants who are \u201cidentifiable or diseerna-ble from the evidence,\u201d and \u201cwho were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] defendant is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because [he] was somewhat less culpable than the other discerna-ble participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, to receive a minor-role adjustment, \u201cthe district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In the drug courier context, relevant facts include, but are not limited to: the amount of drugs, them fan- market value, an equity interest in the drugs, a role in planning the scheme, and the role in the distribution. <em>Id. </em>at 945. Indeed, the drug quantity \u201cmay be the best indication of the magnitude of the courier\u2019s participation in the criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Zamora-Cedeno was on a ship transporting over 10,000 kilograms of cocaine, with a value of over $150 million dollars. Furthermore, he failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he was less culpable than most other participants aboard the ship. Based on the large drug quantity and the overlap between his conduct and the conduct for which he was held accountable, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Zamora-Cedeno was not entitled to a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">II. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Zamora-Cedeno argues that his sentences were greater than <em>necessary to </em>comply with the statutory goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In particular, he argues that the district court failed to consider his individual circumstances and possible sentencing disparities with other \u201cboat cases\u201d and with four unindicted coconspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">We review the final sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). If the district court committed no significant procedural error, we evaluate a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The burden of showing that a sentence is unreasonable rests on the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). If the guideline range is calculated correctly, we ordinarily expect a sentence within that range to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">The record shows that the district court correctly calculated the guideline range, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and heard Zamora-Cedeno\u2019s arguments in mitigation. In the end, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a sentence at the low-end of that range was necessary to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Zamora-Cedeno a minor-role reduction and did not abuse its discretion in imposing concurrent 135-month sentences based on its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>factors. Accordingly, we affirm Zamora-Cedeno\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
