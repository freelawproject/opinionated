We earlier affirmed Archie Moore\u2019s conviction pursuant to his guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846 (2000), but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>190 Fed.Appx. 319 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">On remand, the district court held a resentencing hearing in accordance with <em>Booker </em>and sentenced Moore to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum sentence that Moore could have received because he had previously been convicted of a felony drug offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Moore filed a timely pro se notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which she states that she has found no meritorious issues for appeal because Moore received the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. Because Moore was not eligible for any reduction below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">In a pro se supplemental brief, Moore asserts that his guilty plea is invalid. The mandate rule \u201cforecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court,\u201d as well as \u201cissues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993). Because we affirmed Moore\u2019s conviction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>his first appeal, this claim is foreclosed by the mandate rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Moore\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Moore, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Moore requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
