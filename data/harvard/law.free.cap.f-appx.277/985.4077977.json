Because we conclude that Zakiya did not file his claim within the six-year statute of limitations, which constitutes a jurisdictional limitation, the determination of the Court of Federal Claims is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-20\">Zakiya was convicted of tax evasion and failing to file income tax returns in the District Court for the District of Maryland, and, on February 18, 1994, was sentenced by that court to imprisonment for a term of sixteen months, in addition to a three-year period of supervised release, a fine of $25,000, and a special assessment. Based on the date upon which Zakiya self-reported to serve his sentence, the term of imprisonment under his sentence ended on May 5,1996, and his administrative release date with full good time credit was more than two months earlier, on February 29, 1996. Zakiya was not released as of February 29, 1996, however, because he refused to sign an agreement to pay the fine imposed as part of his sentence, as required as a condition of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e). Because he continued to refuse to sign the agreement, Zakiya I\u2019emained confined beyond the end of his sentence of imprisonment in May 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-21\">Zakiya brought a series of petitions seeking writs of habeas corpus and manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>mus from various courts. Ultimately, on May 4, 1999, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Zaki-ya a writ of habeas corpus and directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to release Zakiya forthwith. <em>Zakiya v. Reno, </em>52 F.Supp.2d 629, 688 (EJD.Va.1999). The district court determined that Zakiya\u2019s petition was properly characterized as asserting a challenge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, as to the legality of his detention after the expiration of his sentence, rather than a challenge to the legality of his conviction and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 or 2255. The district court reasoned that section 3624(e) could not, consistent with the Constitution, be interpreted to allow the executive branch (that is, the Bureau of Prisons) to detain Zakiya beyond the end of the judicially imposed sentence of incarceration, citing concerns as to separation of powers. Pursuant to the district court\u2019s order, Zakiya alleges that he was released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons on May 5, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Zakiya initiated the present action on May 24, 2007, by filing a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims seeking money damages for his detention between February 29, 1996, and May 5, 1999. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed Zakiya\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that it suffered from two fatal jurisdictional defects. First, the Court of Federal Claims concluded that Zakiya\u2019s complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, which provides that any claim otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims must be \u201cfiled within six years after such claim first accrues.\u201d The Court of Federal Claims concluded that Zakiya\u2019s complaint was filed more than six years after his release from incarceration, which the court determined was the last possible date upon which his claim could have accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">Second, the Court of Federal Claims concluded that it also lacked jurisdiction because Zakiya had failed to make the minimum factual allegations necessary to invoke the Court of Federal Claims\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to the two statutory provisions authorizing a claim for money damages for unjust imprisonment, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1495 and 2513. The court concluded that Zakiya had not alleged, and could not allege, that his conviction had been reversed or set aside because he was not guilty or because he was innocent and unjustly convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Zakiya timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">We conclude that Zakiya\u2019s claim is barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 because it was filed more than six years after Zakiya was released from incarceration. As the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 750, 169 L.Ed.2d 591 (2008), explained, section 2501 imposes a jurisdictional requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 753-54. Despite Zakiya\u2019s contrary argument, the Court of Federal Claims was obligated to address the limitations issue sua sponte, even though the issue was not raised by the government. <em>Id. </em>at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">Zakiya also argues that the Court of Federal Claims failed to offer him an adequate opportunity to respond to the statute of limitations issue before dismissing his complaint sua sponte, and that if afforded a greater opportunity to respond, he would have established that he would be entitled to equitable tolling because he \u201chad pursued timely civil litigation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>federal courts ... [and] was barred from simultaneously pursuing a claim under 2513.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply to Appellee\u2019s Informal Br. at 2 <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Although delay caused by a defective filing in another court has often been recognized as a proper ground for equitable tolling of a limitations period, even as against the United States, in other contexts, <em>see, e.g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), it is now clearly established that the limitations period imposed by section 2501 is jurisdictional, making equitable tolling unavailable as a matter of law. <em>See John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>128 S.Ct. at 753-53. Accordingly, Zakiya could not have prevailed on equitable tolling regardless of any evidence of ongoing civil litigation that he might have produced. We conclude that Zakiya\u2019s claim is time-barred, and we need not reach the Court of Federal Claims\u2019s alternative ground for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">For this reason, the determination of the Court of Federal Claims is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-7\"> It appears that in this regard, Zakiya is referring to an action he filed against the United States and a series of individual defendants seeking money damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act and under the theory of <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), for his allegedly improper confinement. The last of these claims were dismissed by the District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia in 2005, <em>Zakiya v. United States, </em>No. CIV A 1:04CV38, 2005 WL 4860326 (N.D.W.Va. Mar. 18, 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
