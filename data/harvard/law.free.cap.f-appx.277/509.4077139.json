Barrios was sentenced to a 75-month term of imprisonment and a two-year term of supervised release. Barrios argues that his prior California convictions for robbery and witness intimidation are not crimes of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-22\">Barrios\u2019s conviction for robbery in violation of CalPenal Code \u00a7 211 is a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 because the statutory definition of the offense \u201cfalls within the generic or contemporary meaning of robbery.\u201d <em>United States v. Tellez-Martinez, </em>517 F.3d 813, 815 (5th Cir.2008). Thus, the sentence enhancement based on Barrios\u2019s robbery conviction was proper, and the district court properly calculated the advisory guidelines range. As it is unnecessary for us to determine whether Barrios\u2019s conviction for witness intimidation is a crime of violence, we forego consideration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-23\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Barrios challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b533-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
