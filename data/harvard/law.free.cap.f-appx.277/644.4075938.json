The court sentenced her to 23 months in prison to run consecutively to a sentence she was serving in Idaho. For reversal, Payseno argues that her sentence is unreasonable because the court ordered a consecutive sentence and failed to give her credit for time served in federal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-23\">We conclude that Payseno\u2019s 23-month revocation sentence is reasonable, as it is within the statutory maximum and resulted from the district court\u2019s consideration of appropriate factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (upon revoking supervised release, court may require defendant to serve in prison all or part of supervised release term authorized for offense, maximum prison sentence is 2 years if offense underlying supervised release was Class C felony); <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>453 F.3d 1004, 1006 (8th Cir.2006) (appellate court reviews revocation sentence to determine whether it is unreasonable in relation to, inter alia, advisory Guidelines range and other \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that Payseno\u2019s revocation sentence run consecutively to her Idaho sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(i) (\u201cany term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of ... supervised release shall be ordered to be served consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving\u201d); <em>United States v. Caves, </em>73 F.3d 823, 824-25 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (Chapter 7 policy statements are advisory, rather than binding; court did not abuse discretion by imposing consecutive sentence for serious violation of supervised-release conditions). Last, the court properly declined to give Payseno credit for time served in federal custody, because authority to give such credit is left to the Attorney General. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) (defendant shall be given credit toward service of term of imprisonment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>any time spent in official detention prior to date sentence commences that has not been credited against another sentence); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 333-37, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992) (Attorney General computes amount of credit after defendant begins sentence; \u25a0 district court cannot apply \u00a7 3585(b) at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-20\">. The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
