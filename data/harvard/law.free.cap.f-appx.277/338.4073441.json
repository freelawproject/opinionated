The BIA summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) decision to deny her application for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), and voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-21\">In her petition, Wang exclusively argues the merits of her asylum application, namely, that she was forcibly sterilized in China and might be jailed upon her return because she did not pay the fine for violating the family planning policy. However, Wang does not challenge in this court, nor did she challenge in her appeal to the Board, the IJ\u2019s finding that her asylum application was untimely. Accordingly, Wang has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, and this court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). Her petition for review is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-22\">Wang\u2019s motion for stay of deportation is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
