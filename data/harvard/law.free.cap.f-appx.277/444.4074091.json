We affirm, although on a different ground than that articulated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">On March 1, 2007, Morales-Garza filed a <em>pro se </em>\u201cPetition for Summary Judgment,\u201d which the district court construed as a complaint, against Susana Lorenzo-Gi-guere, an attorney in the Voting Section of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Morales-Garza alleges that the absentee voting process of the United States failed to comply with the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (\u201cHAVA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15301 <em>et </em>seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of this allegation, Morales-Garza, an inventor, claimed that he developed a system of voting that has made it possible to ensure the privacy of absentee voters. Because of his invention, Morales-Garza sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 15481(c)(2), which preserves paper balloting procedures, \u201cno longer protects or excuses paper ballot voting systems\u201d from the alleged privacy requirement of \u00a7 15481(a)(1)(A)\u00ae. Morales-Garza claimed that the present system \u201cpermits intimidation, inhibition and vote trade\u201d and that his new system could remedy these problems. In a later filing, Morales-Garza also suggested potential liability for Lorenzo-Giguere under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which provides a cause of action where any person acting under color of state law violates the Constitution or a federal law, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498, which provides a cause of action where the United States uses a patented invention without license.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">On May 1, 2007, Lorenzo-Giguere, represented by the United States, filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Lorenzo-Giguere argued, in part, that Morales-Garza lacked standing, that there was no private right of action in HAVA, and that the claims were barred by sovereign immunity and collateral estoppel. On September 11, 2007, 2007 WL 2688444, the district court granted Lorenzo-Giguere\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Morales-Garza\u2019s claims were \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d On September 14, 2007, Morales-Garza filed a motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e), which the district court denied on October 10, 2007. Morales-Garza appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) <em>de novo. Ramming v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.2001). This Court, however, may affirm on any ground supported by the record, including one not reached by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>district court. <em>Moncrief Oil Int\u2019l Inc. v. OAO Gazprom, </em>481 F.3d 309, 311 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Morales-Garza\u2019s claims are without merit, because the federal statutes under which he seeks relief do not permit him to sue an attorney in the Justice Department to seek adoption of his voter privacy system. Although the district court cited only Rule 12(b)(1) in dismissing Morales-Garza\u2019s complaint, Rule 12(b)(6) provides a clearer basis for dismissal and we affirm on that ground. <em>See Scott v. Fiesta Auto Ctr. of San Antonio, </em>273 F.3d 1095, 2001 WL 1085192, at *1 (5th Cir. Sept.7, 2001) (per curiam) (unpublished) (stating that \u201c[g]enerally, if it appears from the face of the complaint that a federal claim is without merit, the court should dismiss for failure to state a claim, and not on jurisdictional grounds\u201d). Under Rule 12(b)(6), a court should dismiss a complaint if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This Court \u201caccepts all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Reliable Consultants, Inc. v. Earle, </em>517 F.3d 738, 742 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Here, Morales-Garza has not pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face under either HAVA, \u00a7 1983, or federal patent law. First, HAVA does not provide the declaratory relief sought by Morales-Garza. <em>See Sandusky County Democratic Party v. Blackwell, </em>387 F.3d 565, 572 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201cHAVA does not itself create a private right of action.\u201d); <em>Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. McPherson, </em>No. C 06-4670, 2006 WL 3462780, at *6 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 28, 2006) (same); <em>Taylor v. Onorato, </em>428 F.Supp.2d 384, 386 (W.D.Pa.2006) (same). Second, \u00a7 1983, even if used to assert any potential right under HAVA, does not apply to federal officers, such as Lorenzo-Giguere, who act under federal law, and thus relief is not available under this statute. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (providing a federal cause of action against persons acting \u201cunder color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia\u201d); <em>Campbell v. Amax Coal Co., </em>610 F.2d 701, 702 (10th Cir.1979) (stating that \u00a7 1983 \u201cdoes not apply to federal officers acting under color of federal law\u201d). Third, Morales-Garza has not stated a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a), which allows owners of patents to recover reasonable compensation when their invention \u201cis used or manufactured by or for the United States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right.\u201d Morales-Garza has not alleged that he has a patent on his voter privacy system or that the United States or Lorenzo-Giguere has used his system without permission. To the contrary, Morales-Garza actually claims that the United States and Lorenzo-Giguere have harmed him by <em>not </em>adopting his proposed new system for absentee voting. Accordingly, we hold that Morales-Garza has failed to state a claim and that the district court\u2019s dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Morales-Garza\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. Although not specifically stated in his complaint, Morales-Garza has conceded that he is suing Lorenzo-Giguere in her official capacity only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">. Morales-Garza previously filed a nearly identical \"Petition for Summary Judgment\" against the United States Election Assistance Commission (\"EAC\u201d) on July 3, 2006. <em>See Morales v. U.S. Election Assistance Comm'n, </em>No. 1:06-46, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96797 (E.D.Va. Aug. 14, 2006). The district court construed Morales-Garza's filing as a motion for summary judgment, denied relief, and entered judgment for the EAC. <em>See id. </em>at *1-2. The district court found that Morales-Garza did not properly serve the complaint, made no showing that Congress unequivocally waived sovereign immunity for any federal agencies as part of HAVA, and did not allege injury sufficient to establish standing. <em>See id. </em>at *2. Morales-Garza did not appeal that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
