PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"alu-dedup-0\">Reinzie Felix Esfandiary seeks review of a final order of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), adopting and affirming an Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) denial of Mr. Esfandiary\u2019s applications for asylum, restriction on removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). For the reasons set forth below, the petition for review is dismissed in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">Mr. Esfandiary is a native and citizen of Indonesia. He entered the United States in July 1993 as a non-immigrant visitor and remained in this country beyond the six-month period authorized by his visa. In April 2003, the Department of Homeland Security served him with a Notice to Appear. In removal proceedings, Mr. Es-fandiary conceded he was removable as charged and filed for relief in the form of asylum, restriction on removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">In 2005, Mi-. Esfandiary received a hearing on the merits. At the outset, the IJ denied Mr. Esfandiary\u2019s request for a continuance to allow him to attempt to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal. The IJ then invited Mr. Esfandiary to testify. Mr. Esfandiary stated that he was a practicing Catholic in Indonesia, but he has since become a Seventh Day Adventist. He had attended Catholic school as a child and said he was fearful attending such a school because Christian schools were rare and his school was surrounded by Muslim schools. He explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>those attending Catholic school were not \u201cfree in [their] movements\u201d and were not \u201cfree in [their] speech.\u201d Admin. R. at 73. He was forbidden from celebrating Christmas and was forced to study Arabic. He testified that he had seen in the newspaper and on the Internet that Muslims kill Christians. But he conceded that he had never suffered physical harm on account of his religion. He believes that the situation for Christians in Indonesia has worsened since he left. And his fear of returning to Indonesia has increased since the birth of his infant son, who has a disability associated with his spinal cord and kidneys. Mr. Esfandiary stated that if his son does not receive good medical treatment like he does in the United States, \u201che will die.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78. He also stated that the disabled are discriminated against in Indonesia: they \u201ccan\u2019t do anything,\u201d they are not \u201cable to work,\u201d and they \u201chave to stay at home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84. Finally, he indicated that if he returned to Indonesia, he would continue to be a Seventh Day Adventist.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The IJ issued an oral decision denying the relief sought. The IJ found Mr. Es-fandiar/s 2003 asylum application was not filed within the one-year statutory time limit and he failed to show extraordinary or changed circumstances sufficient to excuse his untimely filing. The IJ further found that Mr. Esfandiary \u201cwould be able to find an area in Indonesia to live [where] the possibilities of harm are very slight\u201d and concluded that he did not meet his burden of proving eligibility for restriction on removal or protection under the CAT. <em>Id. </em>at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. Specifically, after determining that the record supported the IJ\u2019s finding that Mr. Esfan-diary was not eligible for asylum, the BIA \u201cagree[d] with the Immigration Judge that [Mr. Esfandiary] failed to demonstrate that he would more likely than not face persecution on account of a protected ground or torture for any reason upon return to Indonesia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The BIA then observed that Mr. Esfandiary, in his brief to the BIA, had argued only one issue: that the IJ \u201cabused his discretion by denying [Mr. Esfandiary\u2019s] motion for a continuance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The BIA disagreed, noting that it is a matter of prose-cutorial discretion whether and when to commence removal proceedings and that Mr. Esfandiary had failed to show good cause to warrant a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">In this court, Mr. Esfandiary asserts that he met his burden of showing he is eligible for restriction on removal and CAT relief, and it is therefore \u201cnot reasonable\u201d for him \u201cto relocate internally in Indonesia.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 4. He also attempts, as far as we can tell, to raise a claim that there exists a pattern or practice of persecution against Christians in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">II. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the issues raised by Mr. Esfandiary. <em>See Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 1274, 1281 (10th Cir.2006). Our jurisdiction to review a final order of removal arises under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), but it is not unlimited. Here, it is unclear whether Mr. Esfandiary intends to challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum. He takes issue with the BIA\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely in his petition for review, but he does not address the timeliness of his asylum application in his opening brief; instead, he makes passing references to asylum, <em>see </em>Pet\u2019r Br. at 5. Generally, arguments not raised or inadequately presented in an opening brief are deemed waived. <em>Bronson v. Swensen, </em>500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir.2007); <em>Krastev v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1268, 1280 (10th Cir.2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>But even assuming he did not waive the argument, we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s timeliness determination because Mr. Esfandiary does not raise \u201ca constitutional claim or question of law.\u201d <em>Diallo, </em>447 F.3d at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Further, Mr. Esfandiary failed to raise on appeal to the BIA his pattern-or-practice claim. <em>See Sidabutar v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1116, 1118 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201c[W]e generally assert jurisdiction only over those arguments that a petitioner properly presents to the BIA.\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Nor did the BIA take up the issue on its own and rule on it. <em>Cf. Sidabutar, </em>503 F.3d at 1122 (finding no failure to exhaust administrative remedies where the BIA sufficiently considered claim, even though claim had not been raised before the BIA on appeal). Thus, to the extent he raises a pattern-or-practice claim in this court, we are without jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">III. Remaining Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">We do, however, possess jurisdiction to review Mr. Esfandiary\u2019s restriction on removal and CAT claims \u2014 even though he did not brief those claims before the BIA \u2014 because the BIA considered and ruled on them. <em>See id. </em>This court reviews</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">a BIA decision ... for substantial evidence supporting the agency\u2019s decision. [0]ur duty is to guarantee that factual determinations are supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence considering the record as a whole. Agency findings of fact are conclusive unless the record demonstrates that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. We do not weigh the evidence or ... evaluate the witnesses\u2019 credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citations and quotations omitted). Because a single member of the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision in a brief order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5), we review the BIA\u2019s opinion rather than the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Sidabutar, </em>503 F.3d at 1123. However, \u201cwhen seeking to understand the grounds provided by the BIA, we are not precluded from consulting the IJ\u2019s more complete explanation of those same grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cIn other words, because an (e)(5) affirmance is, by definition, a truncated process which can rest on what has been said below, we may consult the IJ\u2019s opinion to the extent that the BIA relied upon or incorporated it.\u201d <em>Sarr v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 783, 790 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">To be eligible for restriction on removal, Mr. Esfandiary must establish that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [Indonesia] because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). That is, he \u201cmust establish a clear probability of persecution on account of one of the statutorily protected grounds listed above.\u201d <em>Uanreroro v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 1197, 1202 (10th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). \u201cA clear probability means the persecution is more likely than not to occur upon return.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">\u201cTo receive the protections of the CAT, an alien must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be subject to torture by a public official, or at the instigation or with the acquiescence of such an official.\u201d <em>Sidabutar, </em>503 F.3d at 1125 (quotations omitted). A CAT claim differs from a restriction on removal claim in that \u201cthere is no requirement that the petitioned ] show that torture will occur on account of a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Mr. Esfandiary contends that the BIA erroneously agreed with the IJ\u2019s determination (1) that he is ineligible for restriction on removal because he \u201chas demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>strated that it is more likely than not that he would suffer from religious persecution\u201d if he returns to Indonesia, PetT Br. at 6, and (2) that he is ineligible for CAT relief because his \u201ccredible testimony regarding his future fears\u201d demonstrated that \u201cit is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Indonesia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. These cursory assertions fall far short of demonstrating that, based on the record, \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude\u201d that Mr. Esfandiary is entitled to restriction on removal or CAT relief. <em>Sidabutar, </em>503 F.3d at 1122. Rather, substantial evidence in the record supports the agency\u2019s determinations that Mr. Esfandiary failed to demonstrate he would more likely than not face persecution or torture if he returned to Indonesia. Likewise, Mr. Esfandiary\u2019s contention that it is unreasonable for him to relocate internally in Indonesia is without merit. The IJ\u2019s findings are clearly supported by substantial evidence in the record and Mr. Esfandiary does no more than summarily assert fear of persecution by Muslims in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The petition for review is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction as to Mr. Esfandi-ary\u2019s asylum and pattern-or-practice claims, and it is DENIED as to his restriction on removal and CAT claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b841-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(0; 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
