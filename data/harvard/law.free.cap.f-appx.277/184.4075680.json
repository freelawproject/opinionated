Shortly thereafter, he was charged as being removable based on his entry into this country without being-admitted or paroled. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(I) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(I) ]. Montano-Hernandez appeared before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) in November 2005 and applied for asylum, withholding of removal and for relief under the CAT, alleging that he had been threatened and attacked for refusing to join a violent gang known as \u201clas maras.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">The IJ concluded that Montano-Her-nandez was not persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Alternatively, the IJ determined that Mon-tano-Hernandez was not credible because of inconsistences between his testimony, his asylum application, and witnesses\u2019 written statements. The BIA dismissed the appeal, citing the same inconsistencies to support its conclusion that Montano-Her-nandez was not credible. Montano-Her-nandez filed a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">Judicial review of final orders of removal is available only if the alien has exhausted administrative remedies available \u201cas of right.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> INA \u00a7 242(d)(1) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) ]. \u201cTo exhaust a claim before the agency, an applicant must first raise the issue before the BIA or IJ ... so as to give it \u2018the opportunity to resolve a controversy or correct its own errors before judicial intervention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bonhometre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442, 447 (3d Cir.2005) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>(citing <em>Zara v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 927, 931 (9th Cir.2004)). \u201cSo long as an immigrant petitioner makes some effort, however insufficient, to place the Board on notice of a straightforward issue being raised on appeal, a petitioner is deemed to have exhausted her administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Yan Lan Wu v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 418, 422 (3d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Bhiski v. Ashcroft, </em>373 F.3d 363, 367-68 (3d Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The government contends that Monta-no-Hernandez failed to exhaust his claim that the IJ \u201cerred by failing to conduct a full and fair hearing, thus violating [Mon-tano-Hernandez\u2019s] due process rights as afforded by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d It is clear that Montano-Hernandez did not raise this claim in his Notice of Appeal to the BIA or in his brief filed in support of the Notice of Appeal. <em>See Yan Lan Wu, </em>393 F.3d at 422. When a petitioner advances a due process claim, however, exhaustion of administrative remedies may not be required because the BIA generally lacks jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges. <em>See Sewak v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 667, 670 (3d Cir.1990). But a due process claim alleging an error that is correctable through the administrative process is subject to the exhaustion requirement. <em>See Khan v. Attorney General, </em>448 F.3d 226, 236 n. 8 (3d Cir.2006) (\u201c[B]ecause this claim, stripped of its \u2018due process\u2019 label, is a claim of procedural error that could have been addressed by the BIA on appeal, the requirement that [the petitioner] exhaust remedies applies.\u201d). Although Montano-Hernandez presented his claim \u201cin the language of procedural due process,\u201d <em>Bonho-metre, </em>414 F.3d at 448, the gravamen of his argument is that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by the evidence. Because the BIA had the ability to hear, adjudicate, and remand this claim, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d), Montano-Hernandez\u2019s failure to present it to the Board generally would render the claim unexhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Here, however, the BIA addressed the adverse credibility determination sua sponte. When the BIA sua sponte addresses an otherwise unexhausted issue, failure to raise the issue on administrative appeal may be excused. <em>See Sidabutar v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1116, 1119-22 (10th Cir.2007); <em>Ye v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Security, </em>446 F.3d 289, 296-97 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1186 (9th Cir.2001); but <em>see Amaya-Artunduaga v. Attorney General, </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review an otherwise unexhausted claim that the BIA addresses sua sponte). To the extent we retain jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s sua sponte consideration of the adverse credibility determination, we conclude that the Board\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence, as governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Gabuniya v. Attorney General, </em>463 F.3d 316, 322 n. 7 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on inconsistencies between Montano-Hernandez\u2019s testimony, his asylum application, and witnesses\u2019 affidavits. For instance, Montano-Hernan-dez\u2019s asylum statement indicated that in May 2002 gang members assaulted him, his girlfriend, and his cousin as they left a party. Montano-Hernandez repeatedly testified, however, that the incident occurred in March 2002. An affidavit from Montano-Hernandez\u2019s cousin provides yet a third date for the assault: the beginning of June 2002. That affidavit also claims that the gang \u201ctook knives out and cut us.\u201d But Montano-Hernandez testified that he was cut by gang members in a separate incident 15 days after the party, and that his aunt took him to a hospital for medical treatment. An unsworn statement submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ted by Montano-Hernandez\u2019s aunt, however, states that she took him to the hospital to be treated for \u201cblack and blues, and some scratches\u201d suffered when Montano-Hernandez was attacked after the party. Although Montano-Hemandez\u2019s asylum application indicates that the gang threatened him \u201cseveral days after th[e] first attack,\u201d it does not include any reference to being cut or going to the hospital. These are substantial inconsistencies, and we cannot find that \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B); <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 247 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">For these reasons, we will deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-12\">. Monlano-Hernandez had applied for asylum, but the IJ deemed the application untimely under INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B)] (requiring filing within one year of arrival). Montano Hernandez did not make any arguments concerning the timeliness of his asylum application in his appeal to the BIA, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 242(d)(1) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)], and, even if he had, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s timeliness determination. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(3) [8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(3) ] (stating that \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\u201d relating to the timeliness of an asylum application).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-18\">. A claim is \"available as of right\u201d if \"(I) the alien\u2019s claim was within the jurisdiction of the BIA to consider and implicated agency expertise, and (2) the agency was capable of granting the remedy sought by the alien.\u201d <em>Bonhometre, </em>414 F.3d at 447.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b211-15\">. Montano-Hernandez devotes the majority of his brief to arguing that he satisfies the statutory criteria for withholding of removal and CAT relief. In particular, he claims that young males in El Salvador who refuse to join criminal gangs constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d and that the government of El Salvador will \"acquiesce\u201d in the gang\u2019s torture of him. Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision based only on the adverse credibility determination, we cannot reach these issues. <em>See Yatskin v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[A] reviewing court should judge the action of an administrative agency based only on reasoning provided by the agency .... \u201d); <em>see also SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
