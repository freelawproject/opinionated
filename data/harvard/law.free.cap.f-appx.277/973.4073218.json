In his <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition, Clark raised four claims of error as to his convictions in the state trial court proceedings. Clark later amended his \u00a7 2254 petition to add a claim challenging the state habeas proceedings and specifically the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of his application for a certificate of probable cause (seeking review of the denial of his state habeas petition) as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-16\">The magistrate judge entered a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommending (1) denial of Clark\u2019s \u00a7 2254 claims as procedurally defaulted, as found by the state habeas court, because Clark did not raise them on direct appeal and he had not argued cause and prejudice to excuse the default,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) denial of Clark\u2019s challenge to the state habeas corpus proceedings as improper under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as a non-cognizable federal habeas corpus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-17\">In his objections to the R &amp; R, Clark argued that there was cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default in his state direct appeal due to ineffective assistance of his trial and appellate counsel, and, alternatively, that procedural default would be a miscarriage of justice because he is actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-18\">In an order dated September 28, 2007, the district court agreed with the R &amp; R and similarly concluded that (1) Clark\u2019s \u00a7 2254 claims were procedurally barred and Clark had failed to show cause and prejudice through ineffective assistance of counsel or a fundamental miscarriage of justice based on actual innocence to overcome the default, and (2) Clark\u2019s challenge to the state habeas corpus proceeding was barred under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and not a cognizable federal habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>claim. Accordingly, the district court dismissed Clark\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Clark filed a motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) in which he rear-gued his claims of cause and prejudice and fundamental miscarriage of justice to overcome the procedural default. In an order dated November 2, 2007, the district court granted Clark\u2019s motion for COA, but stated only that Clark \u201chas adequately demonstrated debatability of at least one of the underlying claims presented in this case.\u201d The district court\u2019s order did not further specify on what particular issues the COA was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">A habeas corpus petitioner must obtain a COA in order to proceed on appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1). In order to obtain a COA, a petitioner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where the district court has denied a habeas corpus petition on procedural grounds, the petitioner must show that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether (1) the district court was correct in its procedural ruling, and (2) the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1604, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). The court issuing the COA \u201cshall indicate which specific issue or issues,\u201d if any, satisfy the COA standard. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3). Appellate review is then limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Here, the district court failed to satisfy the statutory requirement in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3) to specify which issue or issues had met the COA standard. The district court stated only that Clark had \u201cadequately demonstrated debatability of at least one of the underlying claims presented in this case.\u201d The district court\u2019s order fails to indicate which of the five issues raised by Clark in his \u00a7 2254 petition are subject to appellate review. Further, the district court\u2019s order is unclear as to whether it concluded that Clark had shown that the district court\u2019s procedural rulings were debatable or that Clark\u2019s underlying \u00a7 2254 claims had debatable merit. To the extent the district court was referencing the merits of Clark\u2019s underlying claims, it would be improper to grant a COA on the merits of those claims where the district court dismissed them on procedural grounds and did not discuss or even reach them in its order. <em>See Ross v. Moore, </em>246 F.3d 1299, 1300 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Therefore, because the district court failed to specify the issue or issues for appeal in its COA order, we vacate the district court\u2019s order granting a COA and remand to the district court for it to specify which issue or issues satisfy the COA standard, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-13\">. The R &amp; R also recommended that, to the extent Clark's \u00a7 2254 petition raised his direct appeal claim that the state trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of similar criminal transactions, Clark had failed to establish that the admission of that evidence rendered his trial fundamentally unfair. The district court, however, did not address this claim in its order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b998-20\">. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v.
