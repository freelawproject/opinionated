Aguirre argues that his sentence, which is within a properly-calculated advisory guideline range, is unreasonable because the district court erred in applying a three-level enhancement required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E). Aguirre asserts that the application of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) overstates the seriousness of the offense and represents an \u201cunsound judgment\u201d that results in an \u201cunwarrantedly harsh sentence for the unarmed offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">After entering the bank and approaching the teller window, Aguirre handed the teller a note stating that he had a gun. During the course of the bank robbery, Aguirre kept one hand under his shirt and gestured to the teller as if he had a gun. He verbally told the teller that he had a gun and would use it. In response to these threats, the teller removed cash from her drawer and gave it to Aguirre.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">There is no evidence that the district court committed a significant procedural error at sentencing. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>U.S., 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, where the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range, the sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S., 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Aguirre has failed to demonstrate that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see also United States v. Souther, </em>221 F.3d 626, 629 (4th Cir.2000) (\u201cWe agree with the Third and Eleventh Circuits that a concealed hand may serve as an object that appears to be a dangerous weapon.\u201d). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
