Naith Massingill, Texas prisoner # 420353, filed a civil rights complaint asserting that various Texas prison policies violated his rights to freely practice his religion, the Israyl Identity Faith, under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). He appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ment in favor of the defendant. Massingill does not challenge the district court\u2019s rejection of his claims for a segregated prison cell or for access to prepackaged food without payment during his Sabbath. His failure to brief these issues on appeal results in them abandonment. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Massingill asserts that the district court erred in relying upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e) to dismiss his claims. The district court properly held that \u00a7 1997e(e) bars claims for compensatory damages for a First Amendment violation without a prior showing of physical injury. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 374-75 (5th Cir.2005). The district court acknowledged that Massingill could raise a claim for injunctive or declaratory relief without a showing of physical injury and addressed the merits of Massingill\u2019s claims in conjunction with those requested bases for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Massingill contends that the district court erred in relying upon <em>Powell v. Estelle, </em>959 F.2d 22, 23-26 (5th Cir.1992), <em>superseded by statute as stated in Diaz v. Collins, </em>114 F.3d 69 (5th Cir.1997). Although in <em>Po'well </em>we did not address each element of the test set forth in <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), we have since considered all of those elements in other First Amendment challenges to prison grooming policies. <em>See Green v. Polunsky, </em>229 F.3d 486, 490-91 (5th Cir.2000). Even though Massingill cites to cases from other circuits and district courts that have overturned similar grooming policies, they are not binding precedent, being only persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Massingill further asserts that the district court erred by requiring him to prove that the prison regulations affected an activity central to his beliefs, urging that the RLUIPA expresses no such requirement. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-5(7). Contrary to this assertion, the district court did not impose such a requirement and properly stated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Massingill also insists that the defendant\u2019s evidence was insufficient to overcome Massingill\u2019s RLUIPA claims in an \u201cas-applied\u201d challenge. His conclusional allegations are insufficient to meet his summary judgment burden. <em>See Michaels v. Avitech, Inc., </em>202 F.3d 746, 754-55 (5th Cir.2000). Moreover, Massingill has failed to establish that any substantial burden placed on the practice of his religion outweighed the substantial interests of prison officials in safety, prisoner identification, and hygiene. <em>See Longoria v. Dretke, </em>507 F.3d 898, 901-02 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Diaz, </em>114 F.3d at 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Massingill also contends that the district court erred by allowing the defendant to present unpublished case law without giving him a copy. As no such rule is to be found in the Federal Rules of Evidence or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there was no error. <em>But see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 32.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">Massingill advances that the district court should have scheduled and held an evidentiary healing to help him \u201ccomplete\u201d the record for appellate review. As Massingill\u2019s claims fail legally rather than on any factual insufficiency, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting summary judgment without holding a hearing. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994). Additionally, as Massingill has failed to show a genuine issue of material fact, he has not established that he was entitled to a jury trial. <em>See Plaisance v. Phelps, </em>845 F.2d 107, 108 (5th Cir.1988). And, to any extent that Massingill is asserting that the district court was biased against him, he has failed to point to preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>dice arising from an extrajudicial source evincing bias. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Massingill maintains that the district court improperly dismissed his case to induce him to appeal and thereby generate additional fees for the federal court system. As Massingill has not established that he is entitled to relief on the merits of his claims, this unsubstantiated assertion is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Massingill has not established any genuine issue of material fact that would overcome the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), (e); <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.l994)(en banc). As a result, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. For these reasons, Massingill\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is DENIED. <em>See Lakedreams v. Taylor, </em>932 F.2d 1103, 1107 (5th Cir.1991); and his motion for expedited consideration of his request for injunctive relief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Chi. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
