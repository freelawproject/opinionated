We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Morgan seeks damages and attorney\u2019s fees under the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), asserting that a reimbursement provision in his employment contract rendered his last work week\u2019s wages \u201cunpaid.\u201d None of Morgan\u2019s wages have been deducted or returned to the County, and Morgan has presented no evidence that he actually \u201cbanked\u201d any of his wages in anticipation of reimbursing the County. The reimbursement provision can no longer have any effect on Morgan\u2019s wages because the County\u2019s claims under the provision have been dismissed with prejudice. Because he no longer has any live claims to \u201cunpaid\u201d wages, Morgan\u2019s FLSA claims are moot. <em>See Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Morgan also seeks to maintain a claim under section 216(b) on behalf of other \u201csimilarly situated\u201d employees. Without any live claims of his own, however, he lacks standing to represent a class of employees, as there has been no class certification. <em>See Kremens v. Bartley, </em>431 U.S. 119, 132-33, 97 S.Ct. 1709, 52 L.Ed.2d 184 (1977) (\u201c[I]t is only a \u2018properly certified\u2019 class that may succeed to the adversary position of a named representative whose claim becomes moot.\u201d); <em>U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, </em>445 U.S. 388, 398, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980) (\u201cWhen ... there is no chance that the named plaintiffs expired claim will reoccur, mootness can still be avoided through certification of a class prior to expiration of the named plaintiffs personal claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Morgan seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the reimbursement provision deprived him of a property interest in \u201cfree and clear\u201d wages and a liberty interest in being \u201cfree from restraint.\u201d Morgan has not established that he has actually been deprived of any of these interests, however. He was not terminated or prevented from working elsewhere, and he was not actually deprived of any wages. Morgan\u2019s section 1983 claims are therefore moot, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b758-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
