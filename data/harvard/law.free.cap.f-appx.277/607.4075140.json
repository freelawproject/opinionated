After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b632-19\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b632-20\">Jeffrey Collins pleaded guilty to charges of continuing criminal enterprise, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848, money laundering, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1), and escape, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a), and he was sentenced to 23 years\u2019 imprisonment. As part of his plea agreement, he committed to aid the forfeiture of assets that he acquired through an extensive drug importation scheme beginning in the 1980\u2019s. Significant to this appeal, he also agreed not to contest any forfeiture proceedings commenced by the government. The for-feitable assets were under his control through various corporations located in the Principality of Liechtenstein. Instead of assisting the forfeiture, however, Collins contested it for years in the courts of Liechtenstein. In response the government obtained a ruling from the district court in Collins\u2019s criminal case that Collins breached his plea agreement by contesting the forfeiture of the Liechtenstein assets. We upheld that decision. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>503 F.3d 616 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">In 2005 the government also initiated a civil forfeiture proceeding in the district court. Through that litigation, the government laid claim to funds, equivalent in amount to Collins\u2019s forfeited assets, in a bank in the United States with an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>bank account belonging to the bank in Liechtenstein that held Collins\u2019s assets. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(k). Collins contested that claim in the civil proceeding. After the district court found that Collins breached his plea agreement, the court specifically enforced the forfeiture terms of the plea agreement by dismissing from the civil case Collins\u2019s claims to the contested assets, and it entered judgment for the government. That judgment precipitated this appeal from the civil case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We have already ruled that Collins\u2019s plea agreement was valid, that the district court had jurisdiction to enforce it, and that his attempt to contest the government\u2019s forfeiture efforts was a breach of his agreement. <em>See Collins, </em>503 F.3d at 618-19. Collins may not relitigate those issues in this appeal. <em>See Tyrer v. City of South, Beloit, </em>516 F.3d 659, 663 (7th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Collins argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his claim to the Liechtenstein-based assets. As is the standard for reviewing equitable remedies in general, we would review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to specifically enforce the plea agreement by dismissing Collins\u2019s claims to those assets. <em>See, e.g., Raymond v. Ameritech Corp., </em>442 F.3d 600, 606 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Chi. Dist. Council of Carpenters Pension Fund v. K&amp;I Constr., Inc., </em>270 F.3d 1060, 1065 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Bryant v. City of Chi, </em>200 F.3d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Bradley, </em>381 F.3d 641, 648 (7th Cir.2004) (contract principles govern breach of plea agreements); <em>United States v. Grimm, </em>170 F.3d 760, 763-65 (7th Cir. 1999) (when government breached plea agreement, specific performance was appropriate remedy). It would appear that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Collins\u2019s claims to the forfeited assets was an appropriate remedy for his breach of the plea agreement. The district court\u2019s finding that Collins was in breach of the plea agreement by contesting the forfeiture proceedings would have no teeth if Collins could continue contesting the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">But we need not even go this far because Collins\u2019s appeal itself is really just another attempt to contest the forfeiture of his assets, further violating his plea agreement. As we said in the earlier appeal, <em>see Collins, </em>503 F.3d at 618-19, Collins obligated himself not to block the government\u2019s forfeiture efforts. This obligation remains binding. <em>See Nunez v. United States, </em>495 F.3d 544, 546-47 (7th Cir.2007) (where plea itself is valid, waiver within the plea agreement is valid); <em>United States v. Nave, </em>302 F.3d 719, 720-21 (7th Cir.2002) (same). His latest appeal violates his agreement to abandon such a challenge. Because Collins validly waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s ruling favoring the government\u2019s forfeiture efforts, we must dismiss Collins\u2019s appeal, as we would dismiss any appeal that violates a plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Blinn, </em>490 F.3d 586, 588-89 (7th Cir.2007) (dismissing appeal pursuant to waiver of challenge to district court\u2019s judgment); <em>Nave, </em>302 F.3d at 720-21 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">We note that because Collins\u2019s plea agreement requires us to dismiss this appeal, we need not reach Collins\u2019s argument that the government initiated the <em>forfeiture </em>suit beyond the statute of limitations. The government argues that the applicable five-year statute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, is tolled because the assets at issue were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>located in Liechtenstein. <em>See United States v. All Funds in Account Nos. 747.034/278, 747.009/278, &amp; 747.714/278 Banco Espa\u00f1ol de Cr\u00e9dito, Spain, </em>295 F.3d 23, 27 (D.C.Cir.2002). But the statute under which the government seized the interbank accounts, \u00a7 981(k), states that the forfeited funds are \u201cdeemed to have been deposited into the interbank account.\u201d The parties do not address whether this latter language means that the forfeited assets are no longer legally absent. Similarly, we need not consider whether Collins\u2019s assets had to be deposited in the Liechtenstein accounts after Congress enacted \u00a7 981 (k) for that statute to support the government\u2019s seizure in this case. <em>See United States v. Union Bank for Savings &amp; Investment (Jordan), </em>487 F.3d 8,15-16 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\">.
