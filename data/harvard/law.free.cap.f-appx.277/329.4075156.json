Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), complaining that his civil rights were violated when federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) employees placed him and another prisoner in a \u201cstrip-cell\u201d at the Special Housing Unit (SHU) at the federal prison in Pollock, Louisiana. In addition to seeking $16.35 million in damages, Burnette sought in-junctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The magistrate judge (MJ) assigned to the case reviewed Burnette\u2019s pleadings and recommended that all of Burnette\u2019s claims be dismissed with prejudice as frivolous and for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae and (ii). The district court concurred with the MJ\u2019s reasoning and denied and dismissed Burnette\u2019s lawsuit. Burnette timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">We review the dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae as frivolous for abuse of discretion, <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005), and we review the dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim under the same de novo standard of review applicable to dismissals made pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir. 1999); <em>see also In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (de novo review of dismissal for failure to state a claim using revised Fed. R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6) standard). Because the district court referred to both sections of the statute when it dismissed Burnette\u2019s complaint, review here is de novo. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">Burnette first contends that the conditions of his confinement in an SHU \u201cstrip-cell\u201d violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment, which protects inmates from cruel and unusual punishment and imposes a duty on prison officials to \u201censure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care.\u201d Farmer <em>v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Treating Burnette\u2019s allegations as \u201ctrue (even if doubtful in fact)\u201d under the Fed.R.CivP. 12(b)(6) standard set forth in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>Burnette\u2019s pleadings contain \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\u201d with respect to some of the BOP officials named in his lawsuit. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). According to his pleadings, Burnette was forced to share a trash bag as a toilet with an inmate who was mentally unstable, and Burnette could not escape the smell or leaking of the bagged sewerage in his indoor cell because BOP officials refused to allow the cellmates to remove the bagged sewerage and sealed the cell door with tape. In a similar case, we found that less egregious deprivations of toilet facilities during a prisoner\u2019s outdoor confinement stated a prima facie claim under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 352-53 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Burnette also alleged that several prison officials either ordered the conditions of his confinement in the SHU strip-cell or were aware of but deliberately indifferent to those conditions. Burnette alleged that Lt. Henry Bowers made good on an earlier threat by ordering Burnette\u2019s confinement in the strip-cell under the conditions described in Burnette\u2019s pleadings. Burnette alleged that Capt. Frederick Jefferson authorized the conditions of Burnette\u2019s detention in the strip-cell. Burnette also stated that on October 17, 2004, Associate Warden J.T. Rathman observed the \u201cinhumane conditions\u201d of Burnette\u2019s confinement, but after interviewing Burnette in a separate room, Rathman ordered Burnette\u2019s return to the strip-cell. On October 19 and 20, 2004, the institutional duty officer, Bruce Freas, became aware of the conditions of Burnette\u2019s confinement, indicated his disapproval, and stated that he would file a complaint to the Warden, but Burnette alleges that Freas failed to do so. Thus, Burnette alleged \u201c \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\u2019 \u201d with respect to his claims against Lt. Bowers, Capt. Jefferson, Associate Warden Rathman, and Duty Officer Freas regarding the conditions of his strip-cell confinement. <em>In re Katrina Canal, </em>495 F.3d at 205 (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp., </em>127 S.Ct. at 1974); <em>see also Palmer, </em>193 F.3d at 352-53. For similar reasons, these claims do not lack \u201can arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment in part and remand for further consideration of these claims. By contrast, Burnette\u2019s allegations of Eighth Amendment violations by Lt. Garrows, Lt. Bynum, and Dr. Gallager do not meet these standards, and the dismissal of those claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Burnette also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims regarding deliberate indifference to his medical and psychological needs, but these claims are frivolous. Burnette alleged that Dr. N. Pasao and Chief Psychologist Randy Brandt failed to treat him properly, but records that Burnette submitted with his pleadings show that Burnette was treated by Dr. Pasao and visited by Brandt on the dates in question. Accordingly, Burnette was not denied care, and his allegations, at most, \u201camount to a disagreement\u201d with his treatment and \u201cfall short of a constitutional or federal claim.\u201d <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also Domino v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 755 (5th Cir.2001). Moreover, Burnette does not identify any harm that resulted from any denial or delay of medical or psychological treatment. <em>See Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (1993). Therefore, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Burnette\u2019s claims concerning the denial or delay of medical and psychological care as frivolous and for failure to state a claim was not erroneous and will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Burnette contends that the district court erred in dismissing his retaliation claims. Burnette alleged that in response to his objections regarding the addition of inmates to his cell, BOP staff by shut off his water, cancelled his recreation privileges, confiscated his bedding and reading materials, and began writing retaliatory and unwarranted incident reports against Burnette. Thus, Burnette alleged \u201c \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\u2019 \u201d with respect to his retaliation claims. <em>In re Katrina Canal, </em>495 F.3d at 205 (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp., </em>127 S.Ct. at 1974); <em>see Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164-66 (5th Cir. 1995). For similar reasons, these claims do not lack \u201can arguable basis in law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>fact.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>192 F.3d at 507. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment in part and remand for further consideration of Burnette\u2019s retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Because Burnette\u2019s brief on appeal does not address the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for a temporary restraining order, for appointment of counsel below, for an evidentiary hearing, or for leave to amend his complaint a second time, any objections to the denial of these motions are deemed abandoned. <em>See Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (same). The MJ did not specifically consider Burnette\u2019s allegations that prison officials failed to protect him from fellow inmates, violated his due process rights in disciplining him, and adopted culpably unconstitutional policies. While his pleadings indicate that he may have intended to bring such claims, Burnette did not brief these issues or the MJ\u2019s failure to consider them, and they, too, are deemed abandoned. <em>See Grant, </em>59 F.3d at 524. For the first time on appeal, Burnette attempts to raise claims regarding sexual assaults by a physician assistant named \u201cMr. Herren\u201d and by a cell-mate, claims under the Convention Against Torture, and allegations regarding obstruction of justice. Because we typically do not consider claims that are raised for the first time on appeal, <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225, we decline to consider these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Finally, Burnette seeks appointment of counsel on appeal, but because this litigation presents no \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the motion is denied. <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED with respect to Burnette\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims against Lt. Garrows, Lt. Bynum, and Dr. Gallager, and his claims regarding the denial or delay of medical and psychological care. The judgment is VACATED as to the Eighth Amendment claims against Lt. Bowers, Capt. Jefferson, Associate Warden Rathman, and Duty Officer Freas, as well as the retaliation claims, and this matter is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
