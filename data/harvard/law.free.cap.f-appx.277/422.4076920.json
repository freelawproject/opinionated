He began working at the Denham Springs Post Office in 1998. In February 2000, Augustus became the postmaster at Denham Springs. Soon thereafter, Fallon alleges that numerous conflicts arose. Fallon initially filed discrimination and retaliation claims in federal district court, alleging that Augustus, an African American, discriminated against Fallon because Fallon was Caucasian and from New Orleans and because of Fallon\u2019s injury, which diminished his capacity to complete various work assignments. Potter filed a motion for summary judgment, urging that the court dismiss certain of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Fallon\u2019s claims that he failed to timely exhaust through the administrative process and that Fallon\u2019s remaining claims failed as a matter of law because he could not establish that he suffered an adverse employment action, that similarly situated employees in his class were treated more favorably, or, for the retaliation claims, that he suffered injury or harm or that the Postal Service\u2019s legitimate reasons for its conduct were merely pretextual. In his opposition to Potter\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Fallon abandoned his discrimination claims based on race and disability,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> leaving only his claims of retaliation and a retaliatory hostile work environment. He alleged retaliation from March 2000 \u201cuntil the end of plaintiffs employment\u201d that was \u201csequential, if not continuous.\u201d Potter replied that Fallon had failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliation and that even if he did, there wei\u2019e legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for Augustus\u2019 conduct. Furthermore, Potter urged, Fallon failed to show causation, as much of the alleged harassment occurred prior to his EEOC activity, and even if he had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case and shown that Potter\u2019s legitimate reasons were pretextual, the Fifth Circuit does not recognize a cause of action for a retaliatory hostile work environment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The district court granted Potter\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Fallon had not made a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliatory harassment because he was \u201cunable to establish a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action,\u201d and that even if Fallon had made a <em>prima facie </em>case, Fallon failed \u201cto make the requisite showing that defendant\u2019s reasons [for the alleged harassment] were pretextual.\u201d Fallon appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">On appeal, Fallon alleges retaliatory incidents within several categories, which, combined, he urges, create a hostile work environment. First, Fallon alleges that Augustus subjected him to performance evaluations and observations more so than other employees, such as bolting a permanent observation chair in Fallon\u2019s mail van, recruiting outside observers to evaluate Fallon\u2019s casing rate;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> skewing the results of performance tests, telling Fallon to place his mail ease next to the seat in his van \u2014 contrary to postal standards \u2014 in order to increase his delivery speed, and punishing Fallon for his alleged failure to meet demonstrated performance by preventing him from casing newspapers before other mail and suspending him for fourteen days. Second, Fallon alleges that Augustus engaged in threatening behavior, assigning him to a small cubicle, staring at him in a hostile manner, \u201cbumping\u201d him, and constantly counting Fallon\u2019s casing speed. Third, Fallon alleges that Augustus enforced policies against Fallon and not other employees, requiring Fallon to hold six inches of mail in his left hand while casing, preventing him from drinking beverages on the workroom floor, and investigating a bomb threat made by Fallon but failing to investigate similar threats made by other employees. Finally, Fallon alleges that Augustus exacerbated Fallon\u2019s medical problems and interfered with Fallon\u2019s attempts to obtain workers\u2019 compensation, assigning Fallon to difficult routes after he injured his left knee and shoulder, failing to inform him of various medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>benefits and reimbursement opportunities for medical expenses, failing to report various of Fallon\u2019s injuries, and withholding medical forms and pulling forms from Fallon\u2019s files. On appeal, Fallon urges that all of these activities occurred as part of a retaliatory hostile work environment. In a separate individual retaliation claim, Fallon alleges that Augustus made six comments about Fallon\u2019s participation in EEOC activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>taking all facts and evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the non-movant. However, to avoid summary judgment, the non-movant must go beyond the pleadings and come forward with specific facts indicating a genuine issue for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework for Title VII claims resting on circumstantial evidence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the plaintiff must make a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliation. If he succeeds in doing so, \u201cthe burden then shifts to the defendant-employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the defendant provides such reasons, \u201c \u2018any presumption of retaliation drops from the case,\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the burden \u201cshifts back upon the plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the articulated reason was merely a pretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, Fallon \u201cmust show \u20181) that [he] ... engaged in a protected activity; 2) that an adverse employment action occurred; and 3) that a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u2019\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For the \u201ccausal link\u201d prong, Fallon must demonstrate that the adverse employment action would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d the protected activity in order to prove unlawful retaliation, meaning that, to survive the summary judgment motion, he must show that there is a \u201cconflict in substantial evidence\u201d on this issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cEvidence is \u2018substantial\u2019 if it is \u2018of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">Fallon has failed to show a conflict in substantial evidence on the issue of causation for many of his claims. Although \u201c[c]lose timing between an employee\u2019s protected activity and an adverse action against him may provide the \u2018causal connection\u2019 required to make out a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>case of retaliation,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> much of the harassment that allegedly contributed to the hostile work environment occurred before the EEOC activity and thus fails to create a disputed fact issue as to causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Fallon pled that he participated in two EEOC actions labeled as # 195 and # 166. In his opposition to Potter\u2019s motion for summary judgment, he alleged that # 195 began with his \u201crequest for informal counseling on June 20, 2001,\u201d and that # 166 began -with his counseling request on April 11, 2002. Fallon also alleged that Augustus learned on April 13, 2000, that Fallon, while working elsewhere under a different supervisor, had filed an EEO complaint in 1994. Fallon did not, however, introduce evidence that establishes a conflict in substantial evidence as to whether Augustus\u2019 actions \u201cwould not have occurred but for\u201d Augustus\u2019 learning of Fallon\u2019s EEOC activity that had occurred approximately six years earlier at another job.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">On appeal, Fallon argues that his first \u201cprotected activity\u201d occurred not with the EEO claims or with Augustus\u2019 knowledge of Fallon\u2019s old EEO claim but rather on March 31, 2000, when a supervisor allegedly \u201crequired plaintiff to hold 6\" of flats in one arm.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Fallon \u201ccomplained to Augustus that Bethely [another employee] did not have to do this. Augustus replied, \u2018Worry about yourself.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Fallon stated in his affidavit before the district court that he \u201cdid not expressly claim that this was racially motivated, but it was obvious that this was a racial complaint.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Fallon also argues that on April 6, 2000, Fallon again complained that other employees were not required to hold six inches of mail while casing, stating in his deposition that he \u201casked Augustus if Bethely were going to have to hold 6\" of flats.\u201d Although Fallon argues on appeal that he \u201cabandoned all claims except that of retaliatory harassment based on all protected complaints of discrimination, not merely formal EEO complaints,\u201d his statements regarding the six-inch casing requirements do not constitute \u201cprotected activity\u201d under Title VII.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We are persuaded that the first protected activity relevant to this case occurred on June 20, 2001, when Fallon commenced his first EEOC informal counseling. Much of the harassment alleged by Fallon occurred prior to these dates; for these claims, Fallon has failed to show a conflict in substantial evidence as to whether his protected activity caused the alleged retaliatory hostile work environment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The harassment alleged by Fallon that occurred after Fallon commenced his EEOC activities in 2001 included, <em>inter alia, </em>1) various statements by Augustus telling Fallon that he should drop his EEO claims, 2) assignment to a physically demanding route and other work that exacerbated his health problems, 3) telling Fallon that he should and could do his route in time, despite having received a report recommending that Fallon get surgery, 4) giving part-time and flexible employees work while assigning Fallon to less work, 5) continuing to prohibit Fallon from drinking Coke on the mail floor while allowing co-employees to drink on the floor, 6) failing to update Fallon\u2019s medical reports, 7) pulling medical records from Fal-lon\u2019s flies, and 8) investigating a joking bomb threat that Fallon had made, while failing to investigate similar threats by other employees. Potter provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for all of the alleged harassment,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and Fallon failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>to meet Ms burden of persuasion to then show that Potter\u2019s reasons were pretextual.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although the district court did not fully address some of these incidents that allegedly created a retaliatory hostile work environment, we have addressed them and on <em>de novo </em>review find no error.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We now turn to Fallon\u2019s single claim of retaliation regarding Augustus\u2019 alleged comments about Fallon\u2019s EEOC activities.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The district court did not address this claim in its opinion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Fallon alleged below that Augustus said to him, \u201cYou just keep filing those EEO complaints and I promise you one thing \u2014 there won\u2019t be a person in this post office to testify against me,\u201d \u201cYou need to call her [an EEOC officer] and talk to her so you can drop this EEO,\u201d \u201cYou need to tell her you don\u2019t need redress .... cause you\u2019re canceling the EEO complaint,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ll never have anyone in this post office stand up for you. If you continue to file these charges, I\u2019ll show you what you\u2019re up agamst.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">The Supreme Court clarified the Title VII standard for retaliation in <em>Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White. </em>The Court observed that \u201c[t]he anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Injury or harm turns on \u201cwhether a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,\u201d meaning the action \u201cwell might have dissuaded a reasonable worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We are persuaded that Fallon\u2019s evidence presents a genuine fact issue<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> as to whether Augustus\u2019 statements would have discouraged a reasonable employee from continuing to pursue EEO claims, and that the district court erred in granting Potter\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to this single retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

The district court addressed some of Fal-lon\u2019s complaints as individual retaliation complaints and others as hostile work environment complaints. On appeal, Fallon has abandoned the individual retaliation claims, with the exception of Augustus' alleged comments about Fallon\u2019s EEOC activity. The remainder of his claims fall under his allegations of a retaliatory hostile work environment. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18 n. 2. (\"Although each of the [instances] ... of Augustus\u2019 harassment is addressed individually, it is Mr. Fallon\u2019s position that they must all be considered together as part of a hostile work environment that was pervasive, if not severe.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-5\">.

The alleged \"demonstrated performance examinations\u201d and \"covert observations\u201d first occurred on April 17 and 19, 2000, according to Fallon's pleadings. Fallon alleged that on \u201cApril 13, 14, 15, 17, and 19, 2000,\u201d Augustus bumped him and timed his casing rate with a stop watch. Fallon alleged that on April 27, 2000, Augustus bolted the permanent observation chair in his van, that on May 1, 2000, \"Augustus threatened plaintiff with disciplinary action for taking too much time to case and deliver the mail,\u201d that on May 8, 2000, \"Augustus stated Fallon's casing time in front of other employees, embarrassing Fallon,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and that on May 9, 2000, Augustus issued a letter of warning and a memorandum to Fal-lon, indicating that he was using \u201cunauthorized and unjustified overtime\" and stating the \u201cresults of the casing counting and route observations.\u201d Augustus\u2019 rejection of Fallon's request for overtime and his \"14-day no time off suspension ... for poor office procedures and failure to deliver the mail per demonstrated performance\u201d allegedly occurred on October 5, 2000, and December 1, 2000, respectively. Fallon further alleged that Augustus refused to allow Fallon to drink a Coke at the cashier\u2019s work station on February 8, 2001, and told him to hold six inches of mail in his left arm while casing \"both before and after he [Fallon] injured his left arm on March 29, 2001.\u201d Although he alleged that later Coke incidents occurred in January, February, and March of 2002, the first incident occurred earlier according to his pleadings. Fallon alleged that Augustus assigned him to inside duty and began \"constant counting\u201d of Fallon's casing on April 1, 2001, and that Augustus interfered with his receiving forms regarding eligibility for Continuation of Pay, and expense sheets for traveling to doctors in April of 2000, and that on April 23 \"Augustus, in a sarcastic and threatening way, asked plaintiff, \u2018How you doing getting authorization to see your doctor?' \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\">. Potter alleged in his motion for summary judgment and his reply brief in support of his motion for summary judgment that Augustus assigned Fallon to various jobs \u2014 casing and different, less strenuous routes, for example\u2014 as a result of work limitation requirements from doctors. Explaining the alleged \"staring\u201d and \"bumping,\u201d Potter argued that Augustus, as a supervisor, was required to observe Fallon, and that Augustus and Fallon worked in a small space; furthermore, Augustus is much taller than Fallon, he urged. Potter alleged that Augustus evaluated Fallon's work performance and issued warnings of underperformance because several outside evaluations showed that Fallon was casing at a rate below the standard required by the Postal Service handbook. Both of the outside evaluators provided declarations regarding Fallon\u2019s sub-standard casing speed. Augustus required Fallon to hold six inches of mail while casing because this is a Postal Service standard, he argued. Potter further alleged that Augustus assigned Fallon more casing work and fewer non-carrier duties after receiving a doctor\u2019s report indicating Fallon's work limitations. He assigned Fallon to less work after Fallon was relegated to light duty status as a result of his workers\u2019 compensation claim; light duty employees receive work only when work is available, as Fallon conceded in his pleadings. Potter stated that Augustus prohibited employees from drinking soft drinks on the work floor after an employee spilled liquid on the mail. And Potter alleged and showed, in response to Fallon\u2019s assertions that Augustus had withheld a CA-17 form and prevented it from being sent, that Fallon\u2019s medical reports in his August 6, 2002, (or August 5, as alleged by Fallon) CA-17 form arrived at the Department of Labor; the Department of Labor rejected Fallon\u2019s second claim for Workers' Compensation because it found that the reports did not show that the first, on-the-job injury caused Fallon's recurring injuries alleged in his second claim, not because form CA-17 was untimely. Even if the lateness of the first claim otherwise affected Fallon, as Fallon argues, Fallon's brief does not point us to any place in the record with facts, apart from Fallon\u2019s own pleadings and deposition (referring to affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>vits that are not in the record), showing that Augustus pulled medical files or failed to send medical files or forms. He argues that Cathy Evans, a supervisor, thought that Augustus was removing medical files from her office and that she exclaimed, \"Oh, my God, could this be a conspiracy?\u201d But the record cites to which Fallon points are his own affidavits, not an affidavit from Evans. Finally, Potter alleged that Augustus investigated Fallon\u2019s bomb threat because a co-worker of Fallon's gave Augustus a written statement reporting the threat; Potter provided a copy of the statement to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">. <em>See Baker, </em>430 F.3d at 754 (citing <em>Patrick v.
