(\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), challenge on this appeal the district court\u2019s order granting the Defendant\u2019s, Rica Foods, Inc. (\u201cRica\u201d), Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Amended Complaint (\u201cSAC\u201d). Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in dismissing their securities and common law fraud claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alternatively, they argue that even if dismissal was proper, the court erred in dismissing with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-26\">We review de novo the propriety of the district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Ox</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number><em>ford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, </em>297 F.3d 1182, 1187 (11th Cir.2002). Although the plaintiffs allegations are accepted as true, <em>id., </em>\u201cconclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal.\u201d <em>Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., </em>372 F.3d 1250, 1262 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Jaharis, </em>297 F.3d at 1188) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The district court did not err in granting Rica\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state securities fraud claims, Counts I \u2014 III of the SAC. The SAC does not allege with particularity how Rica\u2019s representations were misleading, nor does it allege that Rica made the representations with the level of scienter required under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPSLRA\u201d) \u00a7 101(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The district court did err, however, in dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims, Counts IV-VII of the SAC. The court found that Plaintiffs failed to allege that Rica\u2019s misrepresentations proximately caused their economic loss as required by <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005) <em>(\u201cDura Phann\u201d). </em>The court held that Plaintiffs adequately pleaded their fraud claims except for this defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\"><em>Dtira Pharm </em>involved the interpretation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4), which requires that \u201c[i]n any private action arising under this chapter, the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving that the act or omission of the defendant alleged to violate this chapter caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages.\u201d The \u201cchapter\u201d referenced in \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4) is Chapter 2B of Title 15 of the United States Code, commonly known as the \u201cSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">The Court held that to satisfy \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4)\u2019s causation requirement \u201ca plaintiff [must] prove that the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation (or other fraudulent conduct) proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s economic loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 125 S.Ct. at 1633. Thus, <em>Dura Pharm </em>involved a \u201c[p]rivate federal securities fraud actionf ] ... based upon federal securities statutes and their implementing regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341,125 S.Ct. at 1630. The narrow scope of the holding is perhaps best reflected in the Court\u2019s opening statement: \u201cA private plaintiff who claims <em>securities fraud </em>must prove that the defendant\u2019s fraud caused an economic loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 125 S.Ct. at 1629 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The district court erred by requiring Plaintiffs to plead <em>Dura Pharm\u2019s </em>loss causation analysis because Counts IV-VII of the SAC do not allege securities fraud, i.e., these claims do not \u201carise under\u201d the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rather, these counts allege basic common law fraud. Specifically, they allege that Rica (through its president and CEO) misrepresented \u2014 both fraudulently and negligently \u2014 its intention to hold a private stock sale for the Plaintiffs, and, as a result, they were forced to sell their stock at a lower price. Curiously, the district court at times refers to these counts as \u201ccommon law fraud claims\u201d and \u201ccommon law misrepresentation\u201d claims (R.4-104 at 32), but appears to treat them as claims for \u201csecurities fraud\u201d in discussing the loss causation requirement (R.4-104 at 35). But, because these claims do not arise under the Securities Exchange Act, \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4)\u2019s heightened causation requirement, as interpreted by <em>Dura Pharm,, </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">To adequately plead causation in a fraud claim under Florida law, a plaintiff must only allege damage or injury as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>result of the misrepresentation. <em>Lance v. Wade, </em>457 So.2d 1008,1011 (Fla.1984) (listing as the fourth element of fraud \u201creliance on the representation to the injury of the other party\u201d). The SAC satisfies this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in dismissing them complaint with prejudice. We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny leave to amend for abuse of discretion, <em>Jennings v. BIC Corp., </em>181 F.3d 1250, 1254 (11th Cir. 1999), and we find no abuse of discretion here in the dismissal with prejudice of the securities claims. Plaintiffs were given several chances to correct previously defective complaints, and before granting-leave to file the SAC, the court admonished Plaintiffs they had only one more shot at pleading properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">In summary, we affirm dismissal with prejudice of Plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state securities fraud claims, Counts I \u2014 III of the SAC. We reverse dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims, Counts IV-VII of the SAC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-27\">. Plaintiffs do not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of their promissory estoppel claims, Counts VIII and IX of the SAC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b957-9\">. Rica argues on appeal that it is entitled to attorney's lees under Florida law as the \"prevailing party\u201d on Plaintiffs' state law securities fraud claim. An application for fees in this court should be filed with the clerk of this court. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 39-2. An application for fees in the district court must first be addressed in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
