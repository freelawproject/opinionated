Following a hearing, the District Court sentenced Denmark to 93 months imprisonment. Denmark filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-22\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and proceedings below, we will not revisit them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-23\">Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Denmark\u2019s appointed counsel has examined the record, concluded that there are no non-frivolous issues for review, and requested permission to withdraw. This request was accompanied by a brief identifying the following issues as arguably possessing merit: (1) whether the District Court properly applied a base offense level of 24 to the arson crimes; (2) whether Denmark qualified for a two-level enhancement as a leader or organizer of the arson crimes; (3) whether the District Court properly applied the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 fraud/misrepresentation guideline as opposed to the \u00a7 2J1.3 perjury guideline to the bankruptcy offense; and (4) whether the District Court correctly calculated the amount of the loss attributable to the bankruptcy offense as between $200,000 and $400,000 pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>With regard to the first issue, Denmark\u2019s counsel cites U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.4, providing for a base offense level of 24 \u201cif the offense ... involved the destruction or attempted destruction of a dwelling ... or a place of public use\u201d and notes that the building in question was a nightclub that sold alcoholic beverages to members of the public. With regard to the second issue, counsel notes that the club belonged to Denmark; that Denmai\u2019k was the only individual at the scene with a motive to burn the club down; that Denmark was convicted of the conspiracy offense; and that Denmark instructed a janitor who had arrived on the scene to leave. With regard to the third issue, counsel notes that Denmark\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3) necessarily entailed a finding that Denmark acted knowingly and with the intent to defraud the creditors and also notes that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(B) contains a specific reference to bankruptcy proceedings. With regard to the fourth issue, counsel notes that, in convicting Denmark on the bankruptcy count, the jury accepted the government\u2019s theory that Denmark did not list the mortgage on his bankruptcy schedules in order to conceal his expected receipt of more than $200,000 in insurance proceeds from the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In a series of submissions accompanying his informal brief, Denmark argues that: (1) the sentencing factors found by the District Court had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) his trial counsel and appellate counsel were ineffective; and (3) the retroactive application of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) to his <em>pre-Booker </em>conduct violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">As Denmark concedes, his first argument is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556 (3d Cir.2007), in which we held that the preponderance of the evidence standard applies to the determination of facts relevant at sentencing. With regard to Denmark\u2019s second argument, this Court generally does not entertain ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal; rather, \u201ca defendant must raise ineffective assistance of counsel in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in order that the district court may create a sufficient record for appellate review.\u201d <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Forte, </em>806 F.2d 73, 77 (3d Cir. 1986). Finally, as Denmark concedes, this Court rejected his third argument in <em>United States v. Pennavaria, </em>445 F.3d 720 (3d Cir.), cert <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 531, 166 L.Ed.2d 394 (2006), in which we held that the retroactive application of <em>Booker </em>did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">. Denmark also advised his appellate counsel that there were two cases pending the Supreme Court that \u201cmight warrant raising\u201d\u2014 <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) and <em>Claiborne v. United States, </em>549 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2245, 167 L.Ed.2d 1080 (2007). He also referred to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Booker </em>itself. None of these cases provides a basis for appellate relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
