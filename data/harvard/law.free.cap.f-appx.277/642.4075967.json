Wright\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-24\">Wright pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement containing a waiver of any right to appeal unless his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum or was an illegal sentence. We now enforce the appeal waiver because the record establishes Wright knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement and appeal waiver; the appeal falls within the scope of the waiver; and no injustice would result from enforcing the waiver. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc) (discussing enforceability of appeal waiver); <em>United States v. Estrada-Bahena, </em>201 F.3d 1070, 1071 (8th Cir.2000) (per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>curiam) (enforcing appeal waiver in <em>An-ders </em>case).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for appeal beyond the scope of the waiver. Therefore, we affirm Wright\u2019s sentence, dismiss the appeal, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-25\">. The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
