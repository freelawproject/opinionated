He was subject to a 10 year statutory mandatory minimum sentence, but the district court granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on Primers\u2019 substantial assistance and sentenced him to 84 months imprisonment. Judgment was entered on June 26, 2003. In January 2008 Primers filed a motion to reduce his sentence, citing Amendment 706, and for appointment of counsel. The district court appointed counsel and then denied the motion to reduce sentence. Primers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">Primers\u2019 guideline range was not based on the amount of drugs under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, but on his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Accordingly, his original sentence is unaffected by the guideline amendments, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Tingle, </em>524 F.3d 839 (8th Cir.2008) (per curiam), and we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-20\">. The Honorable Fernando J.
