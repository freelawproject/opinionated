For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Deliberate indifference may be exhibited by prison medical personnel in responding to prisoners\u2019 needs or by prison officials in intentionally denying or delaying access to care or interfering with prescribed treatment. <em>See Meloy v. Bachmeier, </em>302 F.3d 845, 849 (8th Cir.2002). Here, DuBois did not show that physician assistant Mark Steil provided him inappropriate treatment, or that DuBois suffered any injury from a change in medication against his wishes. <em>See Gibson v. Weber, </em>433 F.3d 642, 646 (8th Cir.2006) (deliberate-indifference claim based on inadequate medical treatment requires proof that defendant knew of and disregarded excessive risks to inmate\u2019s health, and that injury in fact resulted); <em>see also Meuir v. Greene County Jail Employees, </em>487 F.3d 1115, 1118-19 (8th Cir.2007) (inmate has no constitutional right to particular course of treatment, and his mere disagreement with medical treatment is not basis for \u00a7 1983 liability). Warden Robert Dooley undisputedly lacked medical training, and his only involvement was to respond to DuBois\u2019s administrative remedy request. <em>See Meloy, </em>302 F.3d at 849 (noting that prison officials cannot substitute their judgment for medical professional\u2019s prescribed treatment); <em>Tlamka v. Serrell, </em>244 F.3d 628, 635 (8th Cir.2001) (supervisor liability occurs for Eighth Amendment violation when supervisor is personally involved in violation). We thus conclude that summary judgment was proper. <em>See Popoalii v. Corr. Med. Servs., </em>512 F.3d 488, 499 (8th Cir.2008) (standard of review); <em>Bloom v. Metro Heart Group of St. Louis, Inc., </em>440 F.3d 1025, 1028-29 (8th Cir.2006) (speculation and conjecture do not create genuine issue of material fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-14\">We decline to consider arguments and issues DuBois did not raise in his initial brief, and he cannot amend his complaint on appeal. See <em>Stone v. Harry, </em>364 F.3d 912, 914-15 (8th Cir.2004); <em>Mahaney v. Warren County, </em>206 F.3d 770, 771 n. 2 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam); <em>Henry v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>451 F.2d 355, 356 (8th Cir.1971) (per curiam). Rather, he may file another action to pursue any new claims he believes he has.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment and deny the pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\">.
