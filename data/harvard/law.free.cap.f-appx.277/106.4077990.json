We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In the <em>post-Booker </em>era, see <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), there is no \u201cpresumption, rebuttable or otherwise, that a Guidelines sentence is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006). While a court of appeals \u201cmay, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), a district court \u201cmay not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 596-97. <em>See also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">A district court may vary from a Guidelines range for a number of reasons that fall short of a determination that the Guidelines range is unreasonable. The district court may decline to apply a Guidelines sentence because the district judge decides that a case falls \u201coutside the \u2018heartland\u2019 to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply ... [or that] the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations, or [that] the case warrants a different sentence regardless.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2465. <em>See also Kimbrough v. United States, </em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 570, 574-75,169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">Here, the district court stated at the sentencing hearing: \u201c[U]nless I find something in 3553 which justifies me not accepting what Congress has deemed to be an appropriate punishment for this offense, I really don\u2019t have any discretion I don\u2019t think.\u201d Moreover, from its other remarks and questions during the hearing, we infer that the district court believed that it would have to find that a sentence within the Guidelines range was unreasonable before it could impose a non-Guidelines sentence. We conclude that the district court misapprehended its authority to impose a non-Guidelines sentence. This was procedural error, <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, and we therefore vacate the judgment and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-18\">Appellant argues that the sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court, in considering Valdez\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), did not give adequate weight to his close family ties or family responsibilities, or appropriately evaluate his criminal record. We express no view regarding the substantive reasonableness of Valdez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-19\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. Jurisdiction may be restored to this court by letter to the Clerk\u2019s Office from any party, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>event the renewed appeal will be assigned to this panel for disposition. <em>See United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 21-22 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
