R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b744-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">Petitioner Kian Hwa Kwee, a citizen of Indonesia of Chinese descent, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s (BIA) final order of removal and denial of eligibility for withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-21\">Because the BIA expressly adopted and affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) entire decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). The IJ\u2019s determinations that a petitioner is not eligible for withholding of removal is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, and reversal is proper only if the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998). Adverse credibility findings are also reviewed for substantial evidence, though a credibility determination must be supported by \u201cspecific and cogent\u201d reasons, and any noted inconsistencies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony must \u201cgo to the heart of the asylum claim.\u201d <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 884 (9th Cir.2004) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-22\">Kwee argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is unsupported by substantial evidence. To the contrary, the IJ gave \u201cspecific and cogent\u201d reasons for his adverse credibility finding. <em>Id. </em>The IJ cited Kwee\u2019s vague and contradictory testimony with respect to the two alleged incidents of persecution in Indonesia. The inconsistencies in Kwee\u2019s testimony, involving the sole incidents of alleged persecution Kwee experienced, were not minor, but rather went \u201cto the heart\u201d of his claim. <em>Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-23\">Because Kwee\u2019s testimony was properly discredited, and because he does not argue that any other evidence supports his claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>we affirm the IJ\u2019s finding that he was ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254-55 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b744-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
