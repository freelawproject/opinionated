McAvoy, Judge), granting summary judgment to the Commissioner on Jackson\u2019s Social Security claim, and a February 14, 2006 order dismissing his discrimination claim. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">We review orders granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and focus on whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, LLP, </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). In order to challenge a Social Security benefits determination in the federal courts, an aggrieved individual must first obtain a \u201cfinal decision of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). A final decision is rendered \u201cwhen the Appeals Council either considers the application on the merits or declines a claimant\u2019s request for review, and not simply when the ALJ issues its decision.\u201d <em>Pollard v. Halter, </em>377 F.3d 183, 191 (2d Cir.2004). Here, the uncontroverted evidence demonstrated that Jackson did not seek review of the ALJ\u2019s decision before the Appeals Council; therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the Commissioner on Jackson\u2019s Social Security benefits claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">The order dismissing Jackson\u2019s discrimination claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed <em>de novo. See Binder &amp; Binder PC v. Barnhart, </em>481 F.3d 141, 148-149 (2d Cir.2007). The district court properly dismissed the discrimination claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, \u201cbecause Title II of the ADA is not applicable to the federal government.\u201d <em>See Cellular Phone Taskforce v. FCC, </em>217 F.3d 72, 73 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">This Court has considered Jackson\u2019s remaining claims and finds them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
