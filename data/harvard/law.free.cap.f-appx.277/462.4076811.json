She argues that (1) the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed to give proper weight to the opinions of her treating and examining doctors; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that she is able to perform sedentary work activities; and (3) the ALJ improperly evaluated her credibility. Because the ALJ\u2019s determination is based on substantial evidence and applies the proper legal standards, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">Foster\u2019s alleged disability stems from a slip-and-fall accident at her place of employment in February 2002. After her accident, she continued working for another employer until February 2004, when she claims her pain became disabling. She filed an application for disability insurance benefits in July 2004, alleging disability due to low back pain, shoulder pain, and depression. The application was denied initially and on reconsideration, and Foster requested a hearing before an ALJ. In May 2006 the ALJ determined that while Foster\u2019s pain and depression were considered \u201csevere\u201d under the appropriate regulations, she was nonetheless capable of maintaining sedentary employment with \u201cno more than superficial contact with others.\u201d Based on the testimony of a vocational expert, the ALJ determined that Foster was capable of performing jobs available in the national economy, and accordingly was not disabled. When the Appeals Council denied Foster\u2019s request for review, the ALJ\u2019s decision became the Commissioner\u2019s final decision for judicial review. Foster appealed to the district court. The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge, who affirmed the decision of the ALJ. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">Our review of a denial of disability benefits is limited. \u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s decision is granted great deference,\u201d and we will not disturb that decision unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence or is based on an error of law. <em>Leggett v. Cha-ter, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a scintilla, less than a preponderance, and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hollis v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1378, 1383 (5th Cir.1988) (internal citation omitted). In applying this standard we may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our own judgment for that of the Commissioner. <em>Id. </em>After reviewing the record and the ALJ\u2019s detailed decision, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Foster first argues that the ALJ did not give proper weight to the opinions of her treating physicians. Contrary to this assertion, Foster\u2019s medical records show that the ALJ did not reject her physician\u2019s findings. Most of the lengthy excerpts Foster includes in her briefing are simply recitations of her subjective complaints, not medical findings by a physician. <em>See Chambliss v. Massanari, </em>269 F.3d 520, 522 (5th Cir.2001) (subjective complaints must be corroborated by objective medical evidence). What objective evidence she has provided supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that she is not disabled. Following Foster\u2019s fall in 2002, Dr. Chimenti opined that Foster was capable of light-duty work. As discussed below, the ALJ found no credible evidence that Foster\u2019s condition worsened between that time and February 2004, when she claimed disability. Further, according to Foster\u2019s MRI, her low back problems ranged only from \u201cminimal\u201d to \u201cvery mild,\u201d and her shoulder arthritis was minimal. Most importantly, none of Foster\u2019s treating or examining doctors ever opined that Foster was disabled or lacked the functional capacity to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The ALJ thoroughly discussed and properly accounted for the views of Foster\u2019s treating physicians. The ALJ\u2019s determination of Foster\u2019s residual functional capacity is consistent with those views and is supported by substantial evidence in the record. The ALJ found Foster could maintain sedentary employment while lifting no more than 10 pounds and performing no overhead work. The ALJ found her able to stand and walk for 2 of 8 hours, and sit for 6 of 8 hours. The ALJ determined Foster was capable of performing \u201csimple, repetitive work while having no more than superficial contact with others.\u201d These findings are well supported by the evidence, and as the ALJ noted, \u201cgiv[e] the claimant the benefit of the doubt regarding the limitations due to her medically determinable impairments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">As to Foster\u2019s depression, she has failed to demonstrate that the ALJ\u2019s determination was unsupported by the evidence. It is true that Foster\u2019s psychologist, Dr. Brooks, assigned Foster a subjective GAF score of 48, which tends to indicate \u201cserious problems.\u201d <em>See Boyd v. Apfel, </em>239 F.3d 698, 702 (5th Cir.2001). This score, however, is greatly undermined by Dr. Brooks\u2019s objective findings discussed in the body of his report. Dr. Brooks noted that Foster presented well during her evaluation, was cooperative, made good eye contact, spoke in an articulate fashion, and exhibited cognitive abilities \u201cin the average range.\u201d Her memory was intact, and Dr. Brooks reported that she seemed \u201cable to handle her routine needs and to provide adequate parenting for her children.\u201d While Foster did exhibit \u201csome flattening of affect,\u201d Dr. Brooks went on to note that \u201cshe also seemed capable of spontaneity and emotional reactions.\u201d Dr. Brooks concluded his report with the statement that \u201c[Foster\u2019s] depression alone does not appear to be so severe that she would be unable to function. She is competent.\u201d Consistent with these observations, a physician who reviewed Foster\u2019s mental health records found that Foster was only \u201cmoderately limited\u201d in 3 of 20 categories, and \u201cnot significantly limited\u201d in the other 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Foster has failed to demonstrate that the ALJ\u2019s assessment of her mental capacity lacked adequate support. To the contrary, the ALJ\u2019s findings are well-reasoned and are appropriately based on the evidence in the record. The ALJ recognized that Foster had some difficulty with concentration and with performing complicated tasks, but nonetheless found her able to \u201cperform simple work with understanding and carrying out simple one- or two-step instructions, dealing with standardized situations with occasional or no variables in situations on the job ... and reading, writing, and speaking in simple sentences using normal work order.\u201d Foster demonstrated mild impairment in \u201csocial functioning,\u201d and the ALJ appropriately found that she was able to perform work with \u201conly superficial contact\u201d with others. These determinations are consistent with the record and are not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Foster\u2019s next argument is that she lacks the residual functional capacity to perform the jobs identified by the ALJ. Based on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, the ALJ determined that Foster could perform the jobs of compact assembler, fabricator/assembler, and semi-conductor wafer breaker, all positions existing in substantial numbers in the national economy. Foster argues, in a conclusory fashion, that these jobs exceed the scope of her limitations, citing to descriptions of these tasks in the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(\u201cDOT\u201d). Foster has not, however, explained how these job descriptions exceed her functional capacity as determined by the ALJ. Foster claims the position of compact assembler \u201crequires more reaching than anticipated\u201d by the ALJ. This assertion is inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s findings. The only \u201creaching\u201d restriction the ALJ found credible was that Foster could do no overhead work, and Foster fails to show that the position of compact assembler requires any overhead work. Her other arguments are conclusory and unpersuasive. The DOT job descriptions are consistent with the ALJ\u2019s determination that Foster could perform sedentary work with no overhead reaching and only superficial contact with others. As above, those findings are based on substantial evidence, and the vocational expert\u2019s testimony was properly based on the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical incorporating these limitations. Mas<em>terson v. Barnhart, </em>309 F.3d 267, 273 (5th Cir.2002) (hypothetical question to vocational expert properly posed where it incorporated the limitations recognized by ALJ).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ\u2019s determination on this point was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Finally, Foster challenges the ALJ\u2019s determination that her allegations were \u201cnot totally credible.\u201d An ALJ has discretion to judge a claimant\u2019s credibility and must evaluate subjective complaints in light of the objective medical evidence on record. <em>Johnson v. Heckler, </em>767 F.2d 180, 182 (5th Cir.1985). Here, the ALJ gave several reasons for finding Foster not totally credible. At the beginning of the hearing, Foster indicated she had great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>difficulty raising her right hand for the oath, but later during testimony she spontaneously raised her right hand while gesturing with no apparent pain or difficulty. Further, the ALJ found \u201cno credible evidence\u201d to indicate that Foster\u2019s discomfort became significantly worse after her initial injury in 2002. Foster testified that after her fall she worked at RV Outlet Mall for 18 months, but quit in February 2004 when her employer refused to transfer her to an accounting position. The ALJ viewed this as evidence that Foster believed herself able to maintain a sedentary accounting position in February 2004, which was inconsistent with her allegation of disability beginning at that time. The record also indicated that after her fall in 2002, while Foster claimed to be unable to work her first job and was drawing workers\u2019 compensation benefits, she was continuing to work full-duty at her second job delivering flowers. The ALJ viewed this as showing a willingness to provide false information for secondary gain. On the whole, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Foster\u2019s allegations were \u201cnot credible and appear exaggerated for secondary gain on occasion\u201d is well-reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Foster has not shown any reversible error. Because the ALJ\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence in accordance with the correct legal standards, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\">. Foster makes an additional argument, not raised below, that her excessive absenteeism would prevent her <em>from </em>maintaining any <em>of </em>these jobs. Even if she had preserved this argument, it is without merit. The vocational expert testified that three absences a month would prevent a person from pursuing any of the jobs he identified. Foster\u2019s evidence does not support her claim that she would miss this much work due to her \u201cmonthly doctor visits.\" Rather, the documentation she cites shows only that in some, scattered months she has been to the doctor once or twice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
