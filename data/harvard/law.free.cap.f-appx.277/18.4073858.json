We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-20\">Appellant first contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, because the judge did not place enough weight on his drug addiction, his personal upbringing, and his efforts at rehabilitation when evaluating whether the sentence was greater than necessary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district judge retains broad discretion to determine how much weight to place on these factors, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and there is nothing to support the contention that this broad discretion was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-23\">Appellant next contends that the district court erred by finding him to be a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Appellant argues that his state conviction for cultivation of marijuana was not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as that term is defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). A controlled substance offense is defined by the Guidelines as \u201can offense under federal or state law ... that prohibits the <em>manufacture, </em>import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) (emphasis added). The term \u201cmanufacture\u201d is not further defined in the Guidelines, but a comparison to substantive federal criminal law confirms that \u201cthe manufacture ... of a controlled substance\u201d encompasses cultivation of marijuana. Under federal criminal law prohibiting controlled substance offenses, \u201cmanufacture\u201d is defined as \u201cthe <em>produc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>tion, </em>preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of a drug or other substance,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(15) (emphasis added), and \u201cproduction\u201d is defined as \u201cthe manufacture, planting, <em>cultivation, </em>growing, or harvesting of a controlled substance,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 802(22) (emphasis added). Federal convictions for cultivating marijuana plants are routinely upheld as convictions for manufacturing a controlled substance under these statutes. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Huels, </em>31 F.3d 476 (7th Cir.1994). Thus, the crime of which Appellant was convicted would qualify as a controlled substance offense under federal law. In order to ensure that \u201cthe manufacture ... of a controlled substance\u201d has a \u201cuniform definition independent of the labels used by the various States\u2019 criminal codes,\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 592, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), we conclude that his state conviction for cultivation of marijuana was a controlled substance offense within the meaning of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>514 F.3d 256, 268-69 (2d Cir.2008) (using authorities interpreting federal statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d to interpret Guidelines\u2019 definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because of the \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d between the two terms).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Finally, Appellant contends that the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4 was improper. In light of our holding that Appellant was properly deemed a career offender, this argument is moot. The statute of conviction for the bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d), has a statutory maximum of twenty-five years. Therefore, because Appellant is a career offender, his base offense level was, by rule, thirty-four. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). The district court, after applying the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4, adopted a base offense level of thirty-four. Thus, any putative error in applying the two-level enhancement was necessarily harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
