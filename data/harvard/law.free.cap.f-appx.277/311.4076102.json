Pafe challenges the Board\u2019s adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">The Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). The INA defines a \u201crefugee\u201d as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2007). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182,187 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2007); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir.2006). A determination regarding eligibility for asylum is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). This court will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented by the petitioner was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">We find sufficient evidence supports the Board\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the record does not compel a different result. Therefore, we will not disturb the Board\u2019s denial of Pafe\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-17\"> Although Pafe makes passing reference to it in her brief, she does not present any substantive argument challenging the Board\u2019s affirmance of the immigration judge\u2019s denial of withholding of removal or protection under the CAT. Accordingly, those claims have been abandoned. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
