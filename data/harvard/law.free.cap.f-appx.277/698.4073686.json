R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">Mamuka Kvinikadze, a native and citizen of Georgia, petitions pro se for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s claims on the basis of an adverse credibility finding. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir. 2003). We grant the petition in part, deny the petition in part, and dismiss the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-15\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Kvinikadze plausibly and reasonably explained why he did not include two details from his asylum application \u2014 that he was cut during a beating by police and that he took a two-week trip. <em>See Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1166-67 (9th Cir.2000) (reversing where IJ based adverse credibility determination on the omission of a detail of petitioner\u2019s persecution from an asylum application).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">Kvinikadze\u2019s contention that the IJ\u2019s reliance on the asylum officer\u2019s notes affected his proceedings fails because Kvini-kadze did not specify what prejudice he suffered. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Kvinikadze\u2019s contention that the IJ was biased, because Kvinikadze failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 780 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss the petition with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-18\">We grant the petition with respect to the asylum, withholding of removal and CAT claims, and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part; DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b723-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
