Because Mr. Naumenko is unable to show that his claims fall within the statutorily defined jurisdiction of the CFC, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">This court reviews a decision of the CFC dismissing a complaint for lack of jurisdiction without deference. <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>252 F.3d 1329, 1333 (Fed.Cir.2001). The plaintiff has the' burden of establishing that the CFC has jurisdiction over his complaint. <em>Id. </em>We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-16\">Under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, the CFC is a court of limited jurisdiction. The Tucker Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1I\">The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-17\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). It is well-established that \u201c[t]he Tucker Act itself does not create a substantive cause of action; in order to come within the jurisdictional reach and the [sovereign immunity] waiver of the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages.\u201d <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc) (citing <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 216, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-18\">In this case, Mr. Naumenko seeks damages for, inter alia, constructive wrongful termination of employment, employment discrimination, fraud, battery, a violation of California labor law, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, premises liability, strict liability for ultra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>hazardous activity, and stolen property. The caption of Mr. Naumenko\u2019s complaint filed in the CFC names as Defendants \u201cTechnical Trouble Shooting, Anesko Inc., et al.\u201d J.A. at 1. After reviewing Mr. Naumenko\u2019s complaint, the trial judge issued an order to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In the show cause order, the trial judge noted that Mr. Naumenko\u2019s complaint appears to seek damages from private parties, not the United States, and that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 only grants the CFC jurisdiction over suits against the United States. In his response to the show cause order, Mr. Naumenko stated that he has paid Social Security and Medicare taxes, and that he and his family are in the United States pursuant to a green card. Mr. Naumenko also mentioned patent law and suggested the existence of an express or implied contract with the United States. Lastly, Mr. Nau-menko appeared to suggest that his claims are directed against private parties, stating that \u201cthe insurance company[ie]s falci-ficate [sic] and lie on all of documents and statements, this should be looked at by the federal jurisdiction.\u201d J.A. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">After reviewing Mr. Naumenko\u2019s response to the show cause order, the trial judge dismissed Mr. Naumenko\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In the order of dismissal, the trial judge explained that Mr. Naumenko \u201cfailed ... to cite to a specific statute, provision of the U.S. Constitution, Executive Order, regulation, or any specific express or implied contract with the United States which entitles him to collect money damages from the Federal Government, as required by the Tucker Act.\u201d J.A. at 16. The trial judge also noted that Mr. Nau-menko\u2019s complaint appeared to be directed against private parties, rather than the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">In his submissions to this court, Mr. Naumenko does not identify any claim against the United States. Instead, Mr. Naumenko seeks a judgment against several private parties including, inter alia, \u201cAnesko, Technical Trouble Shooting ... Law offices CA Bar, ... Universal Care Inc, Golden Eagle Inc,....\u201d Appellant Supp. Memorandum at 2-3. Because Mr. Naumenko has not identified any claim against the United States, we agree with the trial judge that the CFC lacks jurisdiction over Mr. Naumenko\u2019s complaint. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the CFC dismissing Mr. Naumenko\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
