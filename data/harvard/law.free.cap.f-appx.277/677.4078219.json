We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002), and we grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The BIA abused its discretion in denying as untimely Singh\u2019s motion to reopen. Singh reasonably relied on his former attorney\u2019s repeated fraudulent assurances that he was representing Singh in this court. Once Singh realized he had been deceived, he acted with due diligence to have new counsel review his case. <em>See Rodriguez-Lariz, </em>282 F.3d at 1225. The former attorney, Randhir S. Kang, has since been disbarred from this court and has resigned from the state bar with charges pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We therefore remand to the BIA for further proceedings. <em>See generally INS v. Ventura, 537 </em>U.S. 12, 16,123 S.Ct. 353,154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam). In light of our disposition, we need not address Singh\u2019s due process contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b702-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
