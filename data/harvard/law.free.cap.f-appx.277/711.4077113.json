See <em>Sillah v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir.2008). Therefore we dismiss the portion of Singh\u2019s petition challenging the denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\"><em>We </em>conclude that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence because the IJ\u2019s negative assessment of Singh\u2019s demeanor is entitled to special deference. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999). In addition, the IJ properly found that Malkiat Singh\u2019s testimony was vague and lacked detail. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). Because Malkiat Singh provided no other evidence to support his claim, he has failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted if returned to India. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995). Because Singh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimonial evidence that the IJ determined to be not credible in connection with his withholding of removal claim, the IJ and BIA also properly denied Singh\u2019s CAT protection claim. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
