Department of </em>Justice, SF0752060209-I-1, 105 M.S.P.R. 221 (Feb. 26, 2007). The Board sustained Mr. Haight\u2019s removal from service by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-24\">Before coming to ATF, Mr. Haight served as a police officer with the Stockton Police Department (SPD) in California. While at SPD, he was promoted to Lieutenant with a one-year probationary period, but in 1988 the SPD chief returned him to the rank of Sergeant due to pending investigations into alleged misconduct. Mr. Haight filed for disability retirement, and appealed the SPD chiefs decision. Mr. Haight later settled both matters with the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-25\">After settling with the city, Mr. Haight applied for a job with ATF. Mr. Haight\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>answers on his ATF application and related paperwork did not reveal that he had left SPD after signing a settlement agreement halting further investigations into his conduct at SPD, nor did his answers show that he had also retired from SPD for medical reasons leading to a disability pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">ATF first learned of questions concerning Mr. Haight\u2019s background in 1994. ATF agent Ronald Walters was assigned to look into the matter, but did not have access to his ATF employment documents, and no action was taken against Mr. Haight in 1994. Following an anonymous tip in 2004, a second ATF agent visited SPD and reviewed Mr. Haight\u2019s ATF employment documents. That agent noticed discrepancies between Mr. Haight\u2019s SPD record and his initial disclosures to ATF. After an interview with the second agent in 2004, the chair of ATF\u2019s Professional Review Board proposed Mr. Haight\u2019s removal, and ATF\u2019s Bureau Deciding Official sustained the proposal on December 5, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Mr. Haight filed an appeal with the Board following his removal. The Board held a hearing and sustained both of ATF\u2019s charges against Mr. Haight, although it did not sustain all of the specifications supporting those charges. Mr. Haight appealed the Board\u2019s initial decision to the full Board, which denied Mr. Haight\u2019s petition for review. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">We affirm a decision of the Board unless it is: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">I. The Board Properly Sustained The Agency\u2019s Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">The Board properly sustained ATF\u2019s first charge against Mr. Haight, which was based on his lack of candor both during his initial interviews with the agency and during the 2004 interview concerning his hiring. The Board also properly sustained ATF\u2019s second charge, which was based on Mr. Haight\u2019s false answers to a variety of questions posed on employment and security forms. We accord great deference to the Board\u2019s credibility determinations. Griessenauer <em>v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">The Board found that Mr. Haight failed to offer any credible explanation for the false answers he provided to various questions on his employment forms. The Board also found Mr. Haight\u2019s explanations about his answers in the interviews \u201cwholly unbelievable, then and now.\u201d We defer to the Board\u2019s credibility determinations with respect to Mr. Haight\u2019s explanations because the Board\u2019s credibility determinations are not discredited by undisputed evidence or physical fact. In short, the Board\u2019s holdings concerning both of the agency\u2019s charges are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">II. The Agency Provided Mr. Haight with Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">The Board properly held that the agency provided Mr. Haight with due process. Due process protects an employee\u2019s property interest in continued employment. <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). The essential requirements of due process are notice and an opportunity to respond. <em>Id. </em>at 546-48, 105 S.Ct. 1487. In <em>Louderndll, </em>the Supreme Court cautioned against excessive delays in \u201cpost-termination\u201d healings \u2014 hearings held after an employee has been deprived of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>property interest in employment. <em>Id. </em>at 547,105 S.Ct. 1487.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">This case does not concern a post-termination delay. ATF did not deprive Mr. Haight of any property interest before it began its adverse action \u2014 he continued to hold his position and receive pay during the entire period of \u201cdelay.\u201d Further, as the Board found, ATF provided Mr. Haight notice and an opportunity to respond. The Board therefore correctly held that the agency provided Mr. Haight with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">III. The Agency\u2019s Charges Are Not Barred by Laches</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">The Board properly held that the agency\u2019s charges are not barred by laches. To invoke a laches defense, a party has the burden to prove: \u201c1. the plaintiff delayed filing suit for an unreasonable and inexcusable length of time from the time the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of its claim against the defendant, and 2. the delay operated to the prejudice or injury of the defendant.\u201d <em>A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L. Chaides Const. Co., </em>960 F.2d 1020, 1032 (Fed.Cir.1992) (en banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">As the Board properly held, Mr. Haight did not prove either element of laches. First, Mr. Haight did not show that the agency\u2019s \u201cdelay\u201d in filing suit was unreasonable or inexcusable. Mr. Haight asserts that the agency knew all it needed to know in 1994 to take action. However, Mr. Wolters testified that he lacked access to Mr. Haight\u2019s employment forms in 1994. Until the agency compared Mr. Haight\u2019s background with those forms, it was not aware of the conduct that formed the basis for its action. Second, Mr. Haight failed to show that the Board\u2019s findings concerning prejudice are unreasonable or unsupported by substantial evidence. Mr. Haight asserts that he was actually prejudiced by the agency\u2019s delay in bringing charges because an \u201cexculpatory\u201d 1994 report by Mr. Wolters is now lost, and because of Mr. Wolters\u2019 failure to remember details surrounding the 1994 investigation. But nothing that Mr. Wolters could have written in his \u201cexculpatory\u201d report would change the undisputed testimonial and documentary evidence upon which the Board relied when it sustained the charges against Mr. Haight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">IV. The Penalty of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">The Board properly affirmed the agency\u2019s penalty of removal. We will not disturb an agency\u2019s choice of penalty \u201cunless the severity of the agency\u2019s action appears totally unwarranted in light of all factors.\u201d <em>Lachance v. Devall, </em>178 F.3d 1246, 1251 (Fed.Cir.1999) (quotations omitted). Mr. Haight asserts that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that the Agency\u201d considered \u201cother methods of addressing the issues raised in the proposal.\u201d This assertion is incorrect because the deciding official here explicitly \u201cconsidered [Mr. Haight\u2019s] request that a lesser penalty be imposed in this case.\u201d The official rejected a lesser penalty because of the gravity of the charges, Mr. Haight\u2019s prior disciplinary record, and Mr. Haight\u2019s failure to take responsibility for his actions. Accordingly, the agency\u2019s penalty decision was not totally unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">We have considered, but reject the remainder of Mr. Haight\u2019s arguments. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
