He argues that the district court committed reversible plain error by entering a judgment reflecting that he was convicted of an offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(b)(2) because he did not have a prior conviction that qualified as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d He also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Campos correctly concedes that review of his first argument is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 52(b); <em>United States v. Peltier, 505 </em>F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 22, 2008) (No. 07-8978). To obtain relief, he must show that the district court committed (1) an error (2) that is clear or obvious and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If Campos makes this showing, then the decision to correct the error is within this court\u2019s discretion. <em>Id. </em>The maximum penalty for unlawful reentry of an alien whose removal was subsequent to, <em>inter alia, </em>a prior felony conviction, is 10 years. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). The maximum penalty for unlawful reentry of an alien whose removal was subsequent to, <em>inter alia, </em>a prior aggravated felony conviction, is 20 years. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). An \u201caggravated felony\u201d is defined in relevant part as a crime of violence for which the punishment is no less than one year of imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The presentence report reflects that Campos has only one prior felony convietion \u2014 that being for attempted robbery. The trial court sentenced Campos to 75 days of imprisonment and five years of probation on the attempted robbery charge. Thus, Campos\u2019s prior felony conviction is not a qualifying \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Because Campos does not have a qualifying prior \u201caggravated felony\u201d conviction, he cannot be convicted under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Accordingly, the district court committed a clear or obvious error when it entered a judgment reflecting that Campos was convicted pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Nevertheless, Campos is not entitled to resentencing because he cannot show that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. First, no record evidence exists to support the proposition that the district court\u2019s sentence was influenced by an incorrect understanding of the statutory maximum sentence in this case. And second, the sentence imposed was within a properly calculated guidelines range \u2014 which Campos does not contest\u2014 and the sentence was below the statutory maximum of 10 years of imprisonment under the correct subsection of \u00a7 1326(b). As a result, the district court did not commit reversible plain error. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. The judgment, however, is modified in accordance with this opinion to reflect a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Castro-Trevino, </em>464 F.3d 536, 543 n. 16, 547 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">In light of <em>Apprendi, </em>Campos also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>rather than as elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S., 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
