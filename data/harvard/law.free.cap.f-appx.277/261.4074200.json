Before the IJ, Anam, a Javanese Muslim, testified that his store was looted and burned along with other surrounding stores, which were predominantly Chinese-owned. The IJ denied Anam\u2019s applications because he did not find Anam\u2019s testimony to be credible. We will deny Anam\u2019s petition for review because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 561 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-20\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Where the BIA substantially adopts the findings of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>He Chun Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-21\">The IJ found that Anam was ineligible for asylum as a result of his failure to file his application within one year of the date of his arrival in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>found that Anam did not show extraordinary or changed circumstances to excuse his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). We will not disturb these findings because we lack jurisdiction to review agency determinations of asylum-application untimeliness, <em>see Tar-rawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir.2003); we lack jurisdiction over these particular untimeliness findings because Anam failed to challenge them before the BIA, <em>see Bonhometre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442, 447-48 (3d Cir.2005); and, in any case, Anam does not challenge the findings in this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">To obtain withholding of removal, Anam bore the burden of establishing that his life or freedom would be threatened in Indonesia on account of his race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Romanishyn v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>455 F.3d 175, 178 n. 1 (3d Cir.2006). We agree with the IJ and the BIA that Anam failed to establish past persecution; thus he is not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b); <em>Gabuniya v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 316, 321 (3d Cir.2006). Even if Anam\u2019s testimony was credible, the burning of his store by rioters does not amount to past persecution. Rather, as the IJ found, he was the victim of generally harsh conditions shared by all store owners in the area. <em>See Fatin v. I.N.S., </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993) (\u201c[T]he concept of persecution does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d) Additionally, Anam did not demonstrate that this incident occurred because of \u201chis race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d as required under \u00a7 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Anam also failed to show that he faced a clear probability of future persecution. A large portion of Anam\u2019s appellate brief is devoted to describing the discrimination faced by the ethnic Chinese and Christian populations in Indonesia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Anam\u2019s contention appears to be that during a riot, despite being a Javanese Muslim, he might be mistaken for Chinese or Catholic and persecuted on that basis. Such a fear, however, is too speculative. <em>See Kratchmarov v. Heston, </em>172 F.3d 551, 555 (8th Cir.1999). Moreover, even if Anam could demonstrate that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of Chinese Christians in Indonesia, he cannot \u201cestablish ] his ... own inclusion in and identification with such group of persons such that it is more likely than not that his or her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to [Indonesia].\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Because Anam relies on the same evidence to support his application for protection under CAT, that application was also justifiably denied. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">For the above-stated reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-13\">. Anam arrived in the United States in 2001 but did not file his asylum application until 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\">. Anam has submitted several articles as \"exhibits\u201d documenting conditions in Indonesia. Our consideration of Anam's petition, however, is limited to the information contained in the administrative record. <em>See Al-Fara v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 733, 743 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
