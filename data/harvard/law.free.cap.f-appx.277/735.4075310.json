Webster appeals the district court\u2019s order sanctioning him pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. We review a district court\u2019s imposition of section 1927 sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>Pacific Harbor Capital, Inc. v. Carnival Air Lines, </em>210 F.3d 1112, 1117 (9th Cir. 2000). We reverse the sanctions order.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Under section 1927, the district court may sanction an attorney who \u201cmultiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. This court has held that \u201c \u2018section 1927 sanctions must be supported by a finding of subjective bad faith,\u2019 which \u2018is present when an attorney knowingly or recklessly raises a frivolous argument, or argues a meritorious claims for the purpose of harassing an opponent.\u2019\u201d <em>B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dept., </em>276 F.3d 1091, 1107 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>In re Keegan Mgmt. Co., Sec. Lit., </em>78 F.3d 431, 436 (9th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">In support of sanctions, the district court found that Webster had \u201crefused to dismiss [his client\u2019s] action ... despite defense counsel\u2019s letter ... requesting such dismissal,\u201d and that he \u201csimply had no legally justifiable reason for continuing to maintain this lawsuit once the County unequivocally abandoned any attempt to enforce the Employment Agreement that formed the basis for the present action.\u201d <em>Morgan v. County of Yolo, </em>Slip Copy, No. 2:03-ev-2228-MCE-JFM, 2006 WL 2692872, at *2 (E.D.Cal. Sep.18, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-15\">The court did not, however, make any finding that Webster had acted in \u201csubjective bad faith\u201d or with a \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201creckless\u201d state of mind. Although Webster\u2019s effort to recover as damages in the section 1983 action the fees and costs incurred by Morgan in defending the state court action failed, and properly so, that result was not so obvious in advance that it can be inferred that Webster knowingly or recklessly pursued a futile claim. Webster appears to have had nothing to gain by advancing frivolous claims, and nothing in the record suggests that he did not sincerely believe he was advancing colorable claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-16\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
