After careful consideration, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-23\">Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., (\u201cOld Dominion\u201d) provides long-term disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>benefits to qualified participants through its employee benefit plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). Plan participants are eligible for long-term disability benefits if they are \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d The Plan defines total disability as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">Total disability, as it applies to this benefit, shall mean that you are prevented solely by an <em>illness </em>or <em>injury </em>from performing the regular and customary duties of your employment. You do not have to be confined to your home, but must be under the regular and continuing care of a <em>physician. </em>Beginning 24 months after the disability began, to be considered to be totally disabled, you must not be able to engage in any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In addition, the Plan gives the plan administrator, in this case, Old Dominion, \u201csole discretionary authority to determine eligibility for plan benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Ellsworth Larson was an Old Dominion truck driver for over twenty years, and thus a Plan participant. In December 2001, Larson reported experiencing significant lower back and right leg pain. An MRI showed a herniated disc and epidural fibrosis (scar tissue around the nerves in the back), and Larson subsequently filed a disability claim. Larson thus started to receive long-term disability benefits under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In early 2004, because two years had passed since Larson first reported his back injury, the requirements for receiving long-term disability benefits under the Plan changed. Benefit Management Services, Inc. (\u201cBMS\u201d), hired by Old Dominion as the Plan\u2019s claims administrator, thus decided to reevaluate Larson\u2019s level of disability. Although Larson\u2019s treating physician continued to believe that Larson was unable to perform any work, partly because of Larson\u2019s self-reported levels of pain, a functional capacity evaluation (\u201cFCE\u201d) and an independent medical examiner both found that Larson was capable of sedentary employment. BMS therefore notified Larson via letter that his benefits were being terminated effective September 30, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Larson, through counsel, subsequently requested the documentation supporting the benefit termination, and BMS sent Larson a copy of his FCE and the independent medical examiner\u2019s report. Larson then appealed the termination decision. At this time, Larson supplemented the record with a sworn affidavit in which he claimed that he does not do \u201cany bending or stooping\u201d and that the \u201conly thing\u201d he was able to carry at the grocery store was \u201csomething light like a loaf of bread.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">In the course of considering this appeal, BMS arranged for video surveillance of Larson. In March 2005, three weeks after Larson filed his affidavit, Larson was taped picking up large, heavy bags of fertilizer at Lowe\u2019s, loading them into his vehicle, unloading and carrying them, pouring the contents into a spreader, walking behind the spreader for two hours, and stooping to move objects as needed. Larson did not limp or otherwise show limited mobility while performing this yard work.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">In April 2005, BMS sent Larson a letter notifying him that his appeal had been denied. Larson\u2019s counsel requested the documentation relied upon to deny the appeal, and thus learned about the video. Larson then filed a second appeal, supplementing his file was a second sworn affidavit and a note from his treating physician. Both Larson\u2019s affidavit and his physician\u2019s note emphasized that Larson\u2019s back pain ebbed and flowed, and that, even if he was at times able to engage in strenuous work for a couple of hours, he was still unfit for any form of meaningful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In December 2005, Larson\u2019s second appeal was denied. Unlike Larson\u2019s two previous denial letters, which came from BMS, this letter came from Old Dominion\u2019s Director of Employee Benefits. The letter lays out in detail the basis for the benefits termination: Larson\u2019s performance on the FCE, the independent medical expert\u2019s opinion, and the surveillance video. The letter also considers the opinion of Larson\u2019s treating physician, stating that Old Dominion did not find the treating physician\u2019s assessment dispositive, since it was at least partly based on Larson\u2019s self-reports of pain \u2014 self-reports that were brought into question by the surveillance video.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In April 2006, Larson filed a complaint against Old Dominion and BMS (collectively, \u201cthe defendants\u201d) in the Middle District of North Carolina pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). Larson argued that the defendants failed to provide a full and fair review of his claim on appeal, and that the defendant\u2019s denial of his benefits was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and, in February 2007, a magistrate judge issued a lengthy opinion recommending that the defendants\u2019 motion be granted and Larson\u2019s motion be denied. Larson filed several objections to the magistrate\u2019s report, and, after reviewing Larson\u2019s objections and the magistrate\u2019s recommendations, the district court made a <em>de novo </em>determination to dismiss Larson\u2019s claim with prejudice. Larson subsequently filed a timely appeal, which we now review.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">As a threshold matter, the parties disagree as to the appropriate standard of review. We need not resolve this question because, for the reasons stated, the administrator\u2019s rejection of Larson\u2019s claim would be sustained under any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">First, Larson contends that the process underlying the defendants\u2019 termination decision was flawed. As evidence of this, Larson points to the fact that the defendants failed to comply with ERISA\u2019s procedural requirements. In particular, Larson argues that the defendants failed to disclose information related to his claim, <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-l(h) (2007), and to provide sufficient notification of the reasons for the denial of his appeal, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2560.503 \u2014 l(j). In addition, Larson also argues that the defendants improperly \u201cafford [ed] deference to the initial adverse benefit determination\u201d in denying his appeals. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2560.503-1(h)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">We reject Larson\u2019s arguments. As the magistrate judge recognized in his opinion, it is well-established that failure to technically comply with all of ERISA\u2019s procedural requirements does not automatically invalidate an otherwise sound denial of benefits. <em>See, e.g., Ellis v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>126 F.3d 228, 238 (4th Cir. 1997); <em>Brogan v. Holland, </em>105 F.3d 158, 165 (4th Cir.1997). \u201cSubstantial compliance\u201d is typically sufficient. <em>Sheppard &amp; Enoch Pratt Hosp., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>32 F.3d 120, 127 (4th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). To substantially comply with ERISA\u2019s regulations, an administrator must supply the claimant \u201cwith a statement of reasons that, under the circumstances of the case, permitted a sufficiently clear understanding of the administrator\u2019s position to permit effective review.\u201d <em>Brogan, </em>105 F.3d at 165 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">In this case, the defendants complied with this standard. Even if BMS\u2019s letters terminating Larson\u2019s benefits and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>denying Larson\u2019s first appeal were insufficient, Larson was provided with all information relevant to his claim on request. Furthermore, Old Dominion\u2019s letter denying Larson\u2019s second appeal thoroughly outlined Old Dominion\u2019s reasons for affirming the prior termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">We thus conclude that Larson possessed a \u201csufficiently clear understanding of the administrator\u2019s position,\u201d and that he was therefore able to effectively appeal his benefits termination. Indeed, Larson filed two lengthy administrative appeals, and does not bring to our attention any information that he would add to the administrative record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Likewise, there is nothing in the record other than Larson\u2019s conclusory assertion indicating that the defendants improperly \u201cdeferred] to the initial adverse benefit determination.\u201d Rather, Old Dominion\u2019s analysis and statements in the letter denying Larson\u2019s second appeal indicate that Larson\u2019s claims were given a fresh look. Larson has simply not shown that the defendants committed any procedural errors that warrant even a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Second, Larson also claims that the defendants substantively erred in terminating his benefits. To support his claim, Larson contends that the defendants both undervalued the evidence supporting his claim- \u2014 chiefly, the MRI results, the opinion of his treating physician, and his self-reports \u2014 and overestimated the importance of the FCE and the surveillance video. In particular, Larson argues that the FCE and the surveillance video only provided a \u201csnapshot\u201d of his true abilities, and that this is insufficient to terminate his benefits. <em>See Stup v. UNUM Life Ins. Co., </em>390 F.3d 301, 309-11 (4th Cir.2004) (FCE); <em>Hines v. Unum Life Ins. Co., </em>110 F.Supp.2d 458, 463-64 (W.D.Va.2000) (surveillance video).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">We again disagree. It is not error for a plan administrator to deny benefits when conflicting evidence is presented. <em>See Elliott v. Sara Lee Corp., </em>190 F.3d 601, 606 (4th Cir.1999). While Larson\u2019s MRI results support the opinion of his treating physician, an independent medical examiner looked at the same MRI results and concluded that Larson could perform sedentary work, and an ERISA plan administrator is not required to show a treating physician any special deference. <em>See Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003). Moreover, the other evidence in the record \u2014 specifically, the FCE and the surveillance video \u2014 strongly supports Old Dominion\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">As the magistrate judge emphasized, the surveillance video is particularly damaging to Larson\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As noted, the video showed Larson carrying heavy bags, performing two hours of yard work without a limp, and stooping to move objects as needed. Not only does this video demonstrate that Larson can engage in physical activity far more strenuous than sedentary employment, but it also directly contradicts Larson\u2019s sworn affidavit submitted with his first appeal. This calls into question the credibility of Larson\u2019s self-reports of pain. Given this video, and the other evidence in the record, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Old Dominion\u2019s position is soundly based, and that Old Dominion therefore did not err in denying Larson\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that Old Dominion\u2019s decision to terminate Larson\u2019s benefits was both procedurally and prejudice. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> Larson argues that the defendants initiated surveillance without sufficient justification. We disagree. As defendants argue in their brief, Larson's affidavit accompanying his first administrative appeal contained strong statements about his level of disability (unable to lift anything more than a loaf of bread, cannot stoop, etc.). It cannot be unreasonable for an administrator to want verification before taking such statements at face value, particularly when they are a vital part of the claimant\u2019s evidence of disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
