M &amp; S also filed a third party claim against Scottsdale for bad faith insurance settlement practices, in violation of the West Virginia Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cUTPA\u201d), W. VACode \u00a7 33-11-4(9). Scottsdale removed this case to fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>eral court. After reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions, the district court granted Scottsdale\u2019s motion for application of Virginia law and its motion for partial summary judgment as to the UTPA claim. Shortly thereafter, the district court granted Scottsdale\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the remaining insurance coverage claim. M &amp; S appeals the district court\u2019s decisions to us. For the reasons below, we affirm the district court\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On October 19, 2000, M &amp; S filed a civil suit (\u201cthe underlying action\u201d) against Sandeastle and P.K. Spencer (\u201cSpencer\u201d), a principal with Sandstone, alleging fraud and breach of the parties\u2019 Residential Monitoring Receivable Financing Agreements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 17, 2001, M &amp; S amended its complaint to assert two additional causes of action \u2014 negligent misrepresentation and negligent supervision \u2014 against Spencer and two additional Sandeastle principals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">On June 6, 2002, M &amp; S moved for a default judgment against Sandeastle. Because no representative for Sandeastle appeared on the day of the trial, the district court conducted a hearing on M &amp; S\u2019s default motion. The default hearing focused solely on M &amp; S\u2019s breach of contract claim and the resultant damages. On October 3, 2003, the district court granted M &amp; S\u2019s motion for default judgment and awarded damages in the amount of $508,054.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">On October 1, 2004, M &amp; S filed a civil action in West Virginia state court against Sandcastle\u2019s insurer, Scottsdale, to recover the default judgment award.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, M &amp; S alleged that Scottsdale\u2019s actions violated West Virginia\u2019s UTPA. After Scottsdale removed the claims to federal district court, the parties contested whether West Virginia law or Virginia law should apply to the claims. The district court, in a memorandum opinion and order, granted Scottsdale\u2019s motion for application of Virginia law and its motion for partial summary judgment, which resulted in the dismissal of M &amp; S\u2019s UTPA claim. Subsequently, the district court granted Scottsdale\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the remaining insurance coverage claim. M &amp; S appeals both of these decisions to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant Scottsdale\u2019s motions for summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to M &amp; S. <em>Volvo Trademark Holding Aktiebolaget v. Clark Machinery Co., </em>510 F.3d 474, 481 (4th Cir.2007). \u201cAn award of summary judgment may be appropriately made only \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is enti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tied to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481-82 (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). We now address M &amp; S\u2019s claims <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Scottsdale argues that Virginia law should apply to both the insurance coverage and UTPA claims, while M &amp; S contends that West Virginia law is applicable since the events underlying the default judgment took place in West Virginia. Using West Virginia choice of law rules, the district court held that Virginia law applied to the parties\u2019 claims. M &amp; S posits that the district court did not properly apply West Virginia\u2019s choice of law rules, and that West Virginia law should regulate the claims between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">As the district court in the instant case sits in West Virginia, West Virginia\u2019s choice of law rules provide the appropriate framework for this inquiry. <em>See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941). West Virginia courts generally use <em>lex loci deliciti </em>to resolve choice of law conflicts, but for \u201cparticularly thorny conflicts problems\u201d, <em>see e.g., Oakes v. Oxygen. Therapy Services, </em>178 W.Va. 543, 544, 363 S.E.2d 130 (1987), the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has relied on the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971), Sections 6<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 145 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, to provide the framework for determining the applicable law. When reviewing complex contracts, <em>see e.g., New v. Tac &amp; C Energy, Inc., </em>177 W.Va. 648, 355 S.E.2d 629 (1987) and \u201cparasitic\u201d torts \u2014 i.e., torts dependent upon an underlying breach of contract claim, <em>see e.g., Oakes, </em>178 W.Va. at 544, 363 S.E.2d 130 \u2014 West Virginia courts have resorted to using the Restatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-20\">The district court separately analyzed the choice of law issue in the context of the UTPA claim and the insurance coverage claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ***8 With respect to the UTPA claim, the district court held that the facts in this case were sufficiently thorny to justify utilizing the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws because \u201ctangible injuries\u201d were not present and due to the \u201cesoteric nature of the harm here along with the locus of where it was inflicted.\u201d (J.A. 335.) We agree with the district court\u2019s decision to use the Restatement, in part, because the central thrust of this case is a breach of contract claim. While the negligence claims are not technically dependent upon the breach of contract claim, the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>underlying the torts \u2014 i.e., Sandcastle\u2019s false representation that it was not involved in a civil action involving more than $10,000 \u2014 was a necessary precursor to M &amp; S\u2019s decision to sign the financing agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In addition, it is difficult to pinpoint the precise location of the injury in this case because of its exclusively financial nature. Finally, since this dispute involved actions taken by three parties in at least four states, <em>lex loci deliciti </em>is ill-equipped to resolve this choice of law dilemma and as such, it is appropriate to review the additional factors set out in Sections 6 and 145 of the Conflict of Laws Restatement (Second).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Applying the Restatement to the facts of this case, the district court held that Virginia law applied to the UTPA claim for several reasons, including: (1) M &amp; S (a partnership based in New York) and Scottsdale (an Ohio citizen with its principal place of business in Arizona) were only related through their contact with Sandstone, a company based in Virginia; (2) the financial injury alleged by Sandstone had its \u201croots in a Virginia commercial transaction\u201d (J.A. 389-340); (3) the relationship between Sandcastle and Scottsdale was centered in Virginia; (4) Scottsdale had no expectation of being hauled into court under West Virginia\u2019s UTPA; and (5) due to the centrality of Sandcastle\u2019s role in this conflict, Virginia\u2019s policies for insurer malfeasance have a significant role in this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">While the contacts between M &amp; S, Sandcastle, and West Virginia were substantial \u2014 e.g., the operations financed via the loan agreements occurred in West Virginia \u2014 we ultimately agree with the district court\u2019s decision to apply Virginia law to the UTPA claim. The heart of M &amp; S\u2019s UTPA claim alleges that Scottsdale \u201cengaged in unfair claim settlement practices\u201d as defined by UTPA, during the underlying action. However, there is little connection between Scottsdale\u2019s actions (or lack of action) in declining to accept Sandstone\u2019s tender and the state of West Virginia. Since Scottsdale has no corporate operations in West Virginia, its decision to forego representing Sandstone must have occurred outside of West Virginia. Sandcastle\u2019s relationship with both M &amp; S and Scottsdale serves as the litigating parties\u2019 sole connection to each other in the instant case. As evidenced by the underwriting papers, Sandcastle\u2019s business operations were concentrated in Maryland and Virginia, and as such, Scottsdale could not have envisioned being hauled into a West Virginia court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Finally, the fact that M <em>&amp; </em>S and Sandcastle are not West Virginia residents and have extremely limited commercial contacts with West Virginia favors the view that West Virginia insurer malfeasance law will not be undermined in any material manner if it is not applied in this case. On the other hand, as Sandcastle is a Virginia citizen, Virginia has an interest in ensuring that Virginia law regulates how insurance companies defend its insured\u2019s claims. Thus, based on the litigating parties\u2019 limited contacts with West Virginia, we find that the district court correctly determined that Virginia law should be applied to the UTPA claim. Since Virginia does not have a statute analogous to West Virginia\u2019s UTPA, M &amp; S\u2019s UTPA claim is not viable and as such, the district court\u2019s decision to apply Virginia law and grant Scottsdale\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to M &amp; S\u2019s UTPA claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">With respect to the insurance coverage claim, the district court held that Virginia law was applicable because (1) the CGL policy was formed and entered into in Virginia with the assistance of Sandcastle\u2019s insurance agent and (2) delivered to Sandcastle in Virginia, where it was domiciled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>and (3) Sandcastle never informed Scottsdale that it was doing business in West Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The West Virginia state courts have often addressed choice of law issues in the context of interpreting insurance policies, and in particular, motor vehicle policies. They have generally concluded that the law of the state where the policy is issued will apply to judicial proceedings involving the interpretation of that policy. <em>Howe v. </em>Howe, 218 W.Va. 638, 644, 625 S.E.2d 716 (2005). However, the West Virginia state courts have set out an exception to that general rule when \u201cthe risk insured was principally located where another state has a more significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">While West Virginia certainly had a relationship to the parties and the underlying transaction, Virginia clearly had a more significant relationship for the same reasons detailed in the UTPA choice of law analysis in the previous section, in addition to the fact that the insurance policy was issued in Virginia. Thus, Virginia law must be applied to the insurance coverage claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">In granting Scottsdale\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the insurance coverage claim, the district court held that the default judgment only applied to M &amp; S\u2019s breach of contract claim because (1) M &amp; S\u2019s failure to discuss its negligence claims in the pretrial order \u201cpractically robbed the amended pleading of any further effect\u201d (J.A. 364) and (2) \u201ca careful reading of the operative pleadings in the underlying action discloses that Sandcastle was sued only for breach of contract.\u201d (J.A. 364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">We first turn to the issue of the pretrial order. According to the district court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXH\">... [if][M &amp; S] desired to pursue any extant negligence claims against Sandcastle after voluntarily dismissing its individual, corporate agents who were targeted by those claims, one would have expected the negligence claims to appear in the all-encompassing pretrial order or to have at least been added by amendment of that critical document after the last corporate agent-defendant, Spencer, was voluntarily dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">(J.A. 364-365.) M &amp; S argues that the district court erred because both West Virginia law<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the local district court rules provide that only CONTESTED issues of fact and law be set out, and the purpose of the pretrial order was to set out the damage calculations. Rule 16.7 of the Local Rules of the Southern District of West Virginia states, in part, that a proposed pretrial order must include <em>\u201ccontested </em>issues of law requiring a ruling before trial\u201d and a \u201csingle listing of the <em>contested </em>issues of fact; and a single listing of the <em>contested </em>issues of law ...\u201d (emphasis added). M &amp; S argues that because Sandcastle did not respond to its Amended Complaint, all of the facts in the Amended Complaint were deemed admitted and uncontested.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">Scottsdale responds that federal law and our precedent mandate that a party waives its claim if it is not included in a pretrial order. We agree with Scottsdale. The \u201c[f]ailure to identify a legal issue worthy of trial in the pretrial conference or pretrial order waives the party\u2019s right to have that issue tried.\u201d <em>McLean </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>Contracting Co. v. Waterman Steamship Corp., </em>277 F.3d 477, 480 (4th Cir.2002) (citing to Fed.R.CivP. 16, advisory notes which state, in part, \u201c[C]ounsel bear a substantial responsibility for assisting the court in identifying the factual issues worthy of trial. If counsel fails to identify an issue to the court, the right to have the issue tried is waived.\u201d). The purpose of the pretrial order is to provide notice to the district court of all issues that remain unresolved. While neither Sandcastle nor Scottsdale responded to M &amp; S\u2019s Amended Complaint, and Sandcastle\u2019s attorney withdrew months before the trial, those events alone do not provide incontrovertible evidence that the issues in the Amended Complaint were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Nothing would have prevented Sandcastle or Scottsdale from appearing at the trial to contest any or all of the claims in question. Thus, M &amp; S should have included all of its claims, including the negligence claims, in the pretrial order. Its failure to do so was a de facto waiver of its negligence claims against Sandcastle and its insurer, Scottsdale. <em>See </em>6A Charles A. Wright <em>et al., Federal Practice and Procedure Civ.2d. </em>\u00a7 1522 (updated through 2008) (\u201c[T]he pretrial order is treated as superseding the pleadings and establishing the issues to be considered at trial.\u201d). As such, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant Scottsdale\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the insurance coverage claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">For the reasons stated above, the district court\u2019s judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\">. According to the Amended Complaint, these agreements \"provide financing secured by contracts owned, acquired, or originated by [Sandeastle] for alarm monitoring services provided or arranged by [Sandeastle].\u201d (J.A. 26 at H 10.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">.

It is unclear whether the district court actually used the Restatement analysis in its choice of law analysis for the insurance coverage claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\">. The district court never reached the question of whether there was actually any difference between Virginia and West Virginia law as to the insurance coverage issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b315-15\">. Since West Virginia law is inapposite to this case, there is no need to address this argument. In addition, we find that since this is a procedural issue, federal law is applicable. <em>See Erie R.
