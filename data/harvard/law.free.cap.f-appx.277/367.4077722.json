Flemons, Forrest City, AR, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b392-13\">Before HIGGINBOTHAM, BENAVIDES, and DENNIS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b392-14\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">In 2002, Michael Flemons was convicted of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and multiple counts of aiding and abetting health care fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was ordered to pay approximately $2.7 million in restitution. Once in prison, Flemons joined the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Flemons alleges that the amount he is required to pay under the program was increased, subsequent to his initial classification, to an unreasonable amount given his financial condition. Flemons filed a <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion to Modify Restitution Payment Schedule\u201d asking the court to modify its restitution order by imposing a reasonable payment schedule. He did not seek to have his restitution obligations terminated either permanently or during his incarceration. The district court responded to Flemons\u2019 motion by letter and \u201cdecline[dj\u201d to adjust his restitution payment. Flemons appealed, and the Government opted not to participate in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">We address <em>sua sponte </em>our jurisdiction. Although an unusual method of disposition, under these circumstances, we conclude that there is an appealable final order. The court\u2019s letter, a copy of which appears in the record, specifically addressed Flemons\u2019 motion and declined to grant relief. \u201cAs a general rule, a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>judgment terminates litigation on the merits and leaves the district court with nothing to do except execute the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The corresponding docket sheet entries, while wanting, reflect in the first entry that the letter was sent to Flemons, and in a second entzy, that the letter \u201cterminated\u201d Fleznons\u2019 motion. The text of the letter makes clear that the court was denying relief. Neither party was arguably misled or prejudiced by the disposition. Were we to diszniss for a want of jurisdiction, \u201cthe district court would siznply [eiz-ter a formal order], frozn which a tiznely appeal would then be takezz. Wheels would spin for no practical puzpose.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Turning to the mezits of Flemons\u2019 motion, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">[a] restitution order shall provide that the defendant shall notify the court and the Attorney General of any material change in the defendant\u2019s economic eiz-cuznstances that might affect the defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution.... The Attorney General shall certify to the court that the victim or victims owed restitution by the defendant have been notified of the change iiz circumstances. Upon receipt of the notification, the court may, on its own motion, or the motion of any paz'ty, including the victim, adjust the payment schedule, or require iznmediate paymezzt in full, as the interests of justice require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">To the extent Flemons is attempting to attack the terms of the restitution order as originally imposed by the district court or its legality, this motion is not a proper vehicle to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, we are concerned only with whether Flemons deznon-strated a material change in circumstances such that it was error for the distzict court not to adjust his payment schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">According to his motion, the amouizt of Fleznons\u2019 IFRP payment is such that he has had to have family and friends send him znoney so that he can meet the obligation. Moreover, he claims that the BOP raised his monthly payzneizt based on a ozze-time gift from his rnothez\" libez'ally construed, his financial circumstances \u201cchanged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">On this record, we are unable to review meaningfully Flemons\u2019 claizn. The record essentially coznprises <em>in toto </em>Flemons\u2019 <em>pro se </em>three-page motion and five-page appellate brief. The district court denied Fleznons\u2019 motion without znaking any fhzdings or providing any reasons.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is unclear whether the district court understood Flemons\u2019 znotion to be attacking the aznoizzzt of the restitution award or simply requestizzg a znodification of the payizzezzt schedule. No hearing was held before the district court, and the motion was not refezred to a zzzagistrate judge. Nor did the Govez-zzment respond to Flemons\u2019 motion. Without a fuller and more reliable picture of Fleznons\u2019 claizn, and given the quasi-coercive nature of the IFRP6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>cannot dismiss out of hand his allegation of changed circumstances,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it would be imprudent for us to render a decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We express no opinion as to the merits of Flemons\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
