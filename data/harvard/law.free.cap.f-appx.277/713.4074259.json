Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir.2008). Therefore we dismiss the portion of Harbhajan Singh\u2019s petition challenging the denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 to review Harbhajan Singh\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT protection. We review the BIA\u2019s decision for substantial evidence, a deferential standard under which it must be upheld unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>See Njuguna v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 765, 769 (9th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir. 2004). On this record, we are not compelled to reach a different result. <em>See Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
