Straus, denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Gjonbalaj, Xhem </em>No. A78 696 496 (B.I.A. Aug. 24, 2007) <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 696 496 (Immig. Ct. Hartford, Conn. April 21, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland, Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, a determination \u201cbased on flawed reasoning ... will not satisfy the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 400 (2d Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We will vacate and remand for new findings if the agen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Gy\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Id. </em>at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">As an initial matter, although Gjonbalaj is challenging the denial of relief in \u201casylum-only\u201d proceedings, not a removal order, we nonetheless have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) because the denial of relief in these circumstances is the functional equivalent of a removal order. <em>See Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 134-35 (2d Cir.2006). However, because Gjonbalaj failed to raise his claim for CAT relief in his brief to this Court, we deem that claim waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The regulations provide that an applicant who has established past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). That presumption, however, may be rebutted by a showing that circumstances in the applicant\u2019s home country have fundamentally changed so as to negate his fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A). Here, because we conclude that the IJ committed multiple errors in determining that the Government established a fundamental change in circumstances, we conclude that remand is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The IJ\u2019s finding that the 2005 State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Serbia and Montenegro(\u201c2005 Report\u201d) made \u201cabsolutely no mention ... of any violence or persecution against ethnic Albanians\u201d was not supported by substantial evidence. The 2005 Report notes instances of \u201capparently politically motivated killings of ethnic Albanians,\u201d and \u201creports of attacks and threats against ethnic Albanian political and institutional figures as well as private persons.\u201d Indeed, it would appear that the IJ\u2019s reliance on some portions of the 2005 Report and not others indicates that he \u201cignored the complexities of the reported information.\u201d <em>Tambadou v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 298, 302, 304 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The IJ similarly mis-characterized the record in stating that a letter from Shirley Cloyes of the Albanian American Civic League made \u201cabsolutely no mention\u201d of \u201cpersecution or violence against ethnic Albanians\u201d in light of the fact that it describes \u201ctorture and murder of Albanians inside of Kosovo.\u201d The IJ also failed to assess whether circumstances had changed with respect to \u25a0 Gjonbalaj\u2019s claim that he feared persecution on account of his involvement with the KLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">In addition, the IJ\u2019s failure to identify the legal standard on which he relied in assessing whether the background materials demonstrated a fundamental change in circumstances frustrates our ability to determine whether his finding was correct. <em>See Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 225, 227 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">We conclude that inasmuch as the IJ appears to have had \u201can inaccurate perception of the record, omitting potentially significant facts,\u201d <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. I.N.S., </em>359 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir.2004), and because we cannot predict with confidence that absent the noted errors, the agency would again deny relief, <em>see id.; Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339-40 (2d Cir.2006), we must grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
