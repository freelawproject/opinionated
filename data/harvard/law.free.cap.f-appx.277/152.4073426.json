We will deny her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">Roopchand, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, entered the United States on February 26, 2000. She then failed to depart when her nonimmigrant visa expired. At a hearing before the IJ, Roopc-hand admitted that she was removable as charged and requested voluntary departure. The IJ\u2019s written order of November 17, 2005, stated that Roopchand\u2019s \u201capplication for voluntary departure was granted until [March 17, 2006] ..., with an alternate Order of removal to Trinidad and Tobago.\u201d (A158 (emphasis omitted).) The order further indicated that the parties waived their rights to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-16\">Roopchand allegedly married a United States citizen on February 23, 2006. She accordingly filed a motion to reopen her removal proceedings on March 13, 2006, together with an 1-130 petition and requests to extend her voluntary departure period. On May 25, 2006, the IJ denied the motion to reopen because it was not filed within the applicable 90-day time period. The IJ concluded that her November 17, 2005 order became final on November 17, 2005, because both parties had waived them appellate rights. The BIA dismissed Roopchand\u2019s appeal on March 7, 2007, 2007 WL 1192389. It expressly found that, \u201c[although her motion was filed within the voluntary departure period, it was not filed within the 90-day period following the [IJ\u2019s] administratively final decision\u201d of November 17, 2005. (A5.) Roopchand filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-18\">It is undisputed by the parties that motions to reopen \u201cshall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); <em>nee alno </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that the November 17, 2005 voluntary departure and alternate removal order, containing an express waiver of the parties\u2019 appellate rights, was final as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>November 17, 2005, and therefore immediately triggered the 90-day period. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(b) (stating that an order of removal becomes final \u201c[u]pon waiver of appeal by the respondent\u201d). Because the motion to reopen was not filed until March 18, 2006, it was rejected as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">However, Roopchand argues that the order did not become final until her voluntary departure period subsequently expired on March 17, 2006. In advancing this theory, she relies heavily on an administrative regulation stating that an order of removal shall become final:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">If an immigration judge issues an alternate order of removal in connection with a grant of voluntary departure, upon overstay of the voluntary departure period except where the respondent has filed a timely appeal with the [BIA], In such a case, the order shall become final upon an order of removal by the [BIA] or the Attorney General, or upon overstay of any voluntary departure period granted or reinstated by the [BIA] or the Attorney General.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(f). We must reject the theory of finality offered by Roopchand.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">She cites no judicial or administrative decision adopting (or even addressing) her understanding of finality. As the government points out, this Court expressly addressed 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(f) in the context of determining whether there was a requisite final administrative order for purposes of judicial review. In <em>Obale v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>453 F.3d 151 (3d Cir.2006), the BIA issued an order affirming the IJ\u2019s removal ruling and granting the petitioner an additional 30-day voluntary departure period from the date of the BIA\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>at 154. We held that \u201cthe BIA\u2019s affirmance of [the IJ\u2019s removal] determination effected a \u2018final\u2019 order on the date of the BIA\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160 (footnote omitted). In the process, we specifically rejected the notion that the administrative provision meant that an order did not become \u201cfinal\u201d until the petitioner overstayed the period for voluntary departure. <em>Id. </em>at 157-60. Because the regulation \u201cwould be inconsistent with the statutory definition of a final order of removal if applied to determine finality for purposes of judicial review, we declined] to enforce it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Especially given Roopchand\u2019s failure to address or even cite our previous decision in <em>Obale, </em>there would appear to be no legitimate reason why its reasoning should not apply in the context of a motion to reopen. In fact, the theory of finality offered by Roopchand renders her own motion to reopen premature because it was filed <em>before </em>her voluntary departure date. But if she had actually waited until after her voluntary departure date to file the motion, she would then be statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status due to her failure to depart. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(l)(B). Under the circumstances, the administrative regulation she cites \u201cmay have been intended solely to specify when an order of removal may be executed\u201d by immigration authorities. <em>Obale, </em>453 F.3d at 160 n. 9. As we further observed in <em>Obale, </em>\u201cif there is no final order of removal until \u2018overstay of any voluntary departure period,\u2019 then there is never a final order when the [alien] voluntarily departs in a timely fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such a result would appear not only absurd but \u201cinconsistent with Congressional intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, Roopchand was not denied a fair opportunity to obtain relief. On the contrary, she chose to request the privilege of voluntary departure, and she then had three full months following the IJ\u2019s November 17, 2005 voluntary departure and alternative removal order in which to file a timely motion to reopen. But she did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>In light of our previous ruling in <em>Obale, </em>we find that the BIA (and the IJ) properly calculated the 90-day time period for a motion to reopen and then correctly determined that Roopchand\u2019s motion to reopen must be denied as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-14\">. We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. While generally reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, wo review its legal conclusions de novo. <em>See, e.g., Barrios v. Att'y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 272, 274 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
