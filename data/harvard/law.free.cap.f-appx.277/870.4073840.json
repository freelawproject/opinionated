The district court thereafter sentenced Smith to concurrent prison terms: 210 months on Count One and 84 months on Count Two. He now appeals his convictions and his sentence on Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">Smith\u2019s appeal of his convictions seeks two forms of relief, a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to convict, and, alternatively, a new trial on the grounds that the district court abused its discretion in barring under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) statements Officer Kenneth Goebel previously made, which purportedly shed light on his truthfulness, and in limiting Smith\u2019s cross-examination of Goebel. For convenience, we address these new trial grounds first.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) states in relevant part: \u201cSpecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>attacking or supporting the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness, other than conviction of crime as provided in rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 608(b). \u201c[E]xtrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019 prior misconduct should be excluded where that evidence is probative only of the witness\u2019 general propensity for truthfulness; such evidence should be admitted, however, where it is introduced to disprove a specific fact material to the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>United States v. Calle, </em>822 F.2d 1016, 1021 (11th Cir.1987). In other words, the rule \u201cprohibits a party from introducing extrinsic evidence of pri- or misconduct merely to impeach the general credibility of a witness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Goebel was reprimanded in 2002 for comments he made about inappropriate police practices. During the investigation that led to the reprimand, Smith stated that some of his comments were made in jest. Accor ding to Smith, the comments constituted false statements and, thus, evidence that Goebel was untruthful as to anything he might say \u2014 including the testimony he was giving in the instant case. Under Rule 608(b), out-of-court witness statements such as Goebel\u2019s \u2014 even if they show untruthfulness \u2014 are excludable. <em>See e.g., United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 688 (11th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Castro, </em>89 F.3d 1443, 1458 (11th Cir.1996). In short, the district court committed no abuse of discretion in excluding the proffered statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Smith argues that the court abused its discretion in limiting his cross-examination of Goebel about the reprimand, saying that there exists a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d the limitation influenced the jury\u2019s verdicts because Goebel\u2019s testimony was the only evidence tying him to the crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">\u201cSubject to the Sixth Amendment, the district court has the discretionary authority to limit cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. Beale, </em>921 F.2d 1412, 1424 (11th Cir.1991). Additionally, specific instances of conduct, \u201cif probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness ... concerning the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness or untruthfulness----\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 608(b). We have recognized the importance of the right to full cross-examination when applied to the government\u2019s star witness or a witness who provides an essential link in the government\u2019s case. <em>United States v. Lankford, </em>955 F.2d 1545, 1548 (11th Cir. 1992). Nevertheless, the right is not without limitation, as the Sixth Amendment only protects cross-examination that is relevant. <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.2005). One purpose of cross-examination is, of course, \u201cto impeach the credibility of opposing witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Lindstrom, </em>698 F.2d 1154, 1160 (11th Cir.1983). Such cross-examination includes the \u201cgeneral character for truthfulness\u201d of the witness. <em>Lyons, </em>403 F.3d at 1256. Even relevant evidence, however, \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403. In <em>Calle, </em>we found no abuse of discretion in limiting cross-examination on collateral matters. 822 F.2d at 1020 (holding district court properly limited cross-examination about questions concerning compliance with plea agreement and tax returns, as they were collateral to core issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">Evidentiary decisions do not constitute reversible error \u201cunless a substantial right of the party is affected.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 103(a). Furthermore, errors that do not \u201caffect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a). A defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudiced when there exists \u201ca reasonable probability that ... the outcome of the trial would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 218, <em>169 </em>L.Ed.2d 168 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in the court\u2019s limitation of Smith\u2019s cross-examination of Goebel. The only indication of falsehood regarding the reprimand is that Goebel stated comments he made were made in jest. The statements were remote in time and were collateral to the main issues. The use of the comments during cross-examination would likely have confused the jury as the jury would need to understand that Goebel\u2019s reprimand was not for making false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Smith argues had the court not excluded the statements Goebel made during the reprimand investigation, the evidence of guilt would have been insufficient to convict him on Count One, and on Count Two as well, since conviction on the Count Two offense depended on his commission of the Count One offense. Since we uphold the court\u2019s exclusion of the statements at issue, his sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument depends on the sufficiency of the other evidence in the case. In our view, the evidence of guilt was more than necessary to convict. In addition to Goebel, Smith was confronted with the testimony of two other officers \u2014 Goebel\u2019s partner, Steve Heaven, and Ronald Robinson. Heaven, like Goebel, saw Smith with a gun in his hand; Robinson found the pill bottle and crack cocaine that Goebel described. We turn now to Smith\u2019s Count One sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Smith asks that we remand his Count One sentence for reconsideration. \u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant when that defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cAlthough a defendant must ordinarily petition the district court for modification of his sentence, [we have held where the defendant] raised the sentencing issue on appeal ... it is unnecessary to require him to take this additional step.\u201d <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d 1216, 1228 (11th Cir.1995) (vacating the sentence and remanding the case to the district court to determine whether to adjust sentence under an amended guideline).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">The November 1, 2007, Sentencing Guidelines list a base offense level of 26 for possessing greater than 20 but less than 35 grams of cocaine base. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7) (2007). Smith was sentenced under the November 1, 2006, Guidelines, which listed a higher base offense level of 28 for possession of the same amounts. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6) (2006). The amendment reducing the base offense level by two is listed in the category of covered amendments for which 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) applies retroactively. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c)(amend.706) (March 3, 2008); U.S.S.G. (amend.713) (March 3, 2008). Therefore, the district court may reduce the term of imprisonment upon motion of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2). The two-level reduction authorized by the amendment could reduce Smith\u2019s sentence on the crack cocaine conviction to as low as 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. at Sentencing Table. Whether Smith\u2019s Count One sentence should be reversed is a matter for the district court to consider. We therefore vacate his Count One sentence and remand the sentence on that count for reconsideration. Smith\u2019s convictions, however, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
