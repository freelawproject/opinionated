For reversal, Lanagan argues that the district court erred in applying a dangerous-weapon enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-23\">After careful review, we find that the district court\u2019s application of the section 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement is not clearly erroneous, because a shotgun and ammunition were found in the house from which Lanagan had sold cocaine and kept drug paraphernalia. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>493 F.3d 928, 931-32 (8th Cir.2007) (standard of review), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1263, 170 L.Ed.2d 111 (2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), comment.
