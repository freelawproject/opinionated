He also challenges the court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his state-law claim and argues that his counsel below was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-23\">After reviewing the record de novo, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in a light most favorable to Medina-Salas, <em>see Jacob-Mua v. Veneman, </em>289 F.3d 517, 520 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review), we conclude that summary judgment was proper for the reasons stated by the district court. We also conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 over Medina-Salas\u2019s state-law claim, <em>see Johnson v. City of Shorewood, Minn., </em>360 F.3d 810, 819 (8th Cir.2004) (district court has discretion to decline supplemental jurisdiction where it has dismissed all original-jurisdiction claims; generally, when court eliminates all federal-law claims before trial, balance of factors to be considered under \u00a7 1367 will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over remaining state-law claims), and that Medina-Salas\u2019s assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel is not cognizable, <em>see Glick v. Henderson, </em>855 F.2d 536, 541 (8th Cir.1988) (there is no statutory or constitutional right to effect assistance of counsel in civil case).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-24\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Medina-Salas\u2019s motion to supplement his appellate brief is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-19\">.
