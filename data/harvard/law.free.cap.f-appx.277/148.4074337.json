For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Nickens is presently incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution at Cresson, Pennsylvania (\u201cSCI-Cresson\u201d). In June 2005, Nickens commenced an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against prison officials (the \u201cCommonwealth Defendants\u201d) alleging that since he has been incarcerated at SCI-Cresson, he has been unable to communicate with his wife, Helen Nickens, who is deaf and uses a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (\u201cTTY/TDD\u201d) to communicate via a telephone line. According to Nickens, the prison\u2019s failure to provide him with the use of a TTY/TDD violates the Americans With Disabilities Act (the \u201cADA\u201d) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the \u201cRA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nickens sought compensatory damages and an order requiring the prison to purchase a TTY/TDD.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In September 2006, Nickens filed a motion for partial summary judgment on his ADA and RA claims. Soon thereafter, the Commonwealth Defendants filed a cross motion seeking judgment on the grounds that Nickens lacks standing to bring the present claims, and that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to commencing this action. On March 23, 2007, Magistrate Judge Keith A. Pesto recommended granting the Commonwealth Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion on the ground that Nickens lacks standing to bring a claim \u201cunder the ADA (or any other federal law)\u201d on the basis of his wife\u2019s disability. On April 16, 2007, 2007 WL 1141549, the District Court adopted Magistrate Judge Pesto\u2019s report and recommendation, denied Nickens\u2019s motion, and granted the Commonwealth Defendants\u2019 motion. The present appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for lack of standing. <em>Biener v. Calio, </em>361 F.3d 206, 210 (3d Cir.2004). We may affirm the District Court\u2019s order on any ground supported by the record. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">In order to satisfy the \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of standing\u201d under Article III, a plaintiff must meet three requirements. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <em>UPS Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. v. United States Postal Serv., </em>66 F.3d 621, 626 (3d Cir. 1995). First, the plaintiff must have suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>fered an \u201cinjury in fact-an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of. <em>Id. </em>Third, it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Here, Magistrate Judge Pesto found that Nickens fails to meet the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d component of constitutional standing because he failed to show that \u201che has suffered some concrete and particularized injury separate and apart from the world in general.\u201d (Report &amp; Recommendation, at p. 2.) According to the Magistrate Judge, Nickens did not suffer an injury because he himself is not disabled. We disagree. The prison\u2019s failure to provide Nickens with the use of a TTY/ TDD so that he could communicate with his wife constitutes a concrete and particularized injury sufficient to satisfy the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d requirement of Article III standing. Furthermore, Nickens appears to meet the remaining elements of constitutional standing, as his inability to communicate with his wife was plainly caused by SCI-Cresson\u2019s failure to provide him with use of a TTY/TDD, and a decision favorable to Nickens would undoubtedly redress his injuries. <em>See Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560-61,112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Therefore, we believe that the District Court erred insofar as it found that Nick-ens lacked constitutional standing to bring his dispute to federal court. Nevertheless, we will affirm the court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the Commonwealth Defendants because Nickens fails to satisfy another prerequisite to suit\u2014 exhaustion of his administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cPLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Under the PLRA, a prisoner is required to pursue all avenues of relief available within the prison\u2019s grievance system before bringing a federal civil rights action concerning prison conditions. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). \u201c \u2018[Pjrison grievance procedures supply the yardstick\u2019 for determining what steps are required for exhaustion.\u201d <em>Williams v. Beard, </em>482 F.3d 637, 639 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 231 (3d Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections provides for a three-tiered grievance system which selves as a prisoner\u2019s administrative remedy. DC-ADM-804 Part VI (the \u201cGrievance Policy\u201d) sets forth specific instructions for initiating a grievance and pursuing it through the administrative process. First, the prisoner must submit an Initial Grievance to the Facility Grievance Coordinator using the form identified as \u201cDC-804, Part 1.\u201d (DC-ADM-804 Part VLA.6.) After the Grievance Coordinator has completed the Initial Review, the prisoner may file an appeal to the Facility Manager. (DC-ADM-804 Part VI.C.) The appeal must be submitted, in writing, within 10 working days from the date of the Initial Review decision. (DC-ADM-804 Part VLC.l.b.) \u201cEach appeal must be clearly labeled as an appeal at the top of the document. In cases appealing an Initial Review decision, the appeal must also include the grievance number at the top of the document.\u201d (DC-ADM-804 Part Vl.C.l.e.) An inmate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>who is dissatisfied with the disposition of an appeal from the Facility Manager may submit an appeal to the Secretary\u2019s Office of Inmate Grievances and Appeals within 15 days of the Facility Manager\u2019s decision. (DC-ADM-804 Part VLD.l.b.) This final appeal may not be taken until the prisoner has complied with all procedures established for the first two steps of the grievance procedure. (DC-ADM-804 Part VI. D.l.d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The administrative record in this case indicates that Nickens filed his first grievance, Grievance No. 105350, on December 23, 2004. (Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Attachment B.) In the \u201cDC-804, Part 1, Official Inmate Grievance,\u201d Nickens alleged that, under DOC policy and federal law, the prison was required to provide him with use of a TTY/ TDD. <em>(Id.) </em>On January 11, 2005, Corrections Officer Jadloeki conducted an Initial Review and provided Nickens with the telephone number for the TTY/TDD relay operator. <em>(Id.) </em>He further instructed Nickens to write to him if, after trying that number, he was still unable to make contact with his family. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">It appears that the next action that Nickens took was on February 9, 2005, when he submitted a second \u201cDC-804, Part 1\u201d form concerning his inability to contact his wife. (Grievance No. 109578, Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Attachment C.) Nickens again complained of the prison\u2019s failure to provide a TTY/TDD, and explained that the number for the relay operator was not working. In the box provided for the Facility Grievance Coordinator\u2019s name, Nickens instead wrote \u201cAdministrative [sic] Good.\u201d The Facility Grievance Coordinator, Rebecca M. Reifer, construed Nickens\u2019s filing as a second grievance, and, on February 14, 2005, completed a \u201cDC-804, Part 3, Grievance Rejection Form\u201d informing Nickens that his grievance was being rejected because \u201cthe issue presented on the attached grievance has been reviewed and addressed previously in grievance no. 105350 dated 12/27/04.\u201d <em>(Id.; </em>DC-ADM-804 Part VI.B.6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Next, on April 28, 2005, Nickens filled out a Form DC-135A, \u201cInmate\u2019s Request to Staff Member,\u201d in which he complained once again about his inability to contact his wife. (Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Attachment E.) According to the Grievance Policy, inmates are encouraged to use this form to notify the Unit Manager of a problem so that it can be resolved informally without resort to the grievance system. (DC-ADM-804 Part VI.A.4.) Nickens addressed this form to \u201cAdministrative D.J. Good.\u201d Despite Nickens\u2019s designation, Nickens\u2019s Unit Manager, Tim Smith responded to this request, explaining that the problem appeared to be that Helen Nickens had not been at home when the calls had been placed. Smith instructed Nickens to schedule times with his wife for a phone call. Nickens did not submit any other documents to the grievance department complaining of the prison\u2019s failure to provide for use of a TTY/TDD.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Therefore, Grievance Nos. 105350 and 109578, and the April 28, 2005 DC-135A, are the only documents that Nickens submitted as part of his effort to obtain administrative relief. In his opposition to the Commonwealth Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Nickens argued that he attempted to appeal from the denial of his grievances, but that Ms. Reifer prevented his appeals from reaching Superintendent Good. However, even assuming that Nickens\u2019s filings were attempts to appeal to Superintendent Good, his efforts nonetheless fail to satisfy the exhaustion requirement under the PLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>First, to the extent that Nickens argued that his second grievance \u2014 which, as noted above, was addressed to Superintendent Good \u2014 was an attempt to appeal from the Initial Review of his first, it was both untimely under DC-ADM-804 Part VLC.l.b. and in violation of DC-ADM-804 Part VLC.l.e. Specifically, Nickens was required to submit, within 10 days from the date of the Initial Review decision (January 11, 2005), a document that was clearly labeled at the top as an appeal from Grievance No. 105350. (DC-ADM-804 Part VLC.l.b.); (DC-ADM-804 Part VLC.l.e.). Instead, Nickens waited nearly one month to raise the issue again, and failed to properly identify the document he submitted as an appeal. Although the Grievance Policy does not specifically preclude an inmate from using an Official Inmate Grievance form for an appeal, it is clear that this form is intended for a different use, and the Grievance Policy does make clear that all appeals must be clearly labeled as such. <em>(Id.) </em>Therefore, Nick-ens\u2019s second grievance does not comply with administrative requirements pertaining to appeals from an Initial Review decision. Similarly, insofar as Nickens intended his April 28, 2005 DC-135A \u2014 which he also addressed to Superintendent Good\u2014 to be an appeal from the denial of his second grievance, it was likewise untimely under DC-ADM-804 Part VLC.l.b. and in violation of DC-ADM-804 Part VLC.l.e. As for Nickens\u2019s allegations that Ms. Reifer repeatedly crossed out Superintendent Good\u2019s name in order to obstruct his appeals, the record does not support his allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">This Court\u2019s case law makes clear that a prisoner must complete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules in order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement of the PLRA. <em>See Williams, </em>482 F.3d at 639; <em>Spruill, </em>372 F.3d at 228, 231. Because Nickens failed to do so, he cannot proceed with this action in federal court. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">. In die complaint, Nickens also alleged a violation of the \"Pennsylvania Handicappers Civil Rights Act.\u201d However, neither Magistrate Judge Pesto nor the District Court recognized this claim in considering the parties' summary judgment motions. Because Nick-ens does not challenge the District Court's failure to consider this claim, we will not do so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">. On the same day that he filed a notice of appeal, Nickens filed a \u201cResponse to the Court Memorandum Order.\u201d The District Court construed this filing as a motion for reconsideration and, on April 23, 2007, denied relief. At that time, Nickens\u2019s notice of appeal became effective. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i). Since Nickens did not subsequently amend his notice of appeal to seek review of the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration, that order is not presently before us. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">. The Commonwealth Defendants moved for summary judgment on this basis, and Nickens submitted a response. <em>See Ray v. Kertes, </em>285 F.3d 287 (3d Cir.2002) (holding that exhaustion under the PLRA is an affirmative defense to be pled and proven by the defendants).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
