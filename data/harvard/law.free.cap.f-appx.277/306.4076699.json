Canady appealed his sentence, claiming that: (1) the district court failed to consider one of the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007); and (2) the court erroneously refused to consider the 100:1 crack/cocaine disparity. We affirmed his sentence; however, the Supreme Court subsequently vacated the judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). <em>See United States v. Canady, </em>178 Fed.Appx. 213 (4th Cir.2006), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 854,169 L.Ed.2d 706 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-28\">In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575. <em>Kimbrough </em>has thus abrogated <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that sentencing court may not vary from guideline range solely because of 100:1 ratio for crack/cocaine offenses), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008). The district court did not have the benefit of <em>Kimbrough </em>when it determined Canady\u2019s sentence. To give the district court the opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Kim-brough, </em>we conclude that resentencing is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-18\"> On remand, Canady will be resentenced under the guidelines for crack/cocaine offenses that took effect on November 1, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
