He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a two-level adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 for his self-described minor role in the offense as a courier.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">Whether a defendant was a minimal or minor participant is a factual determination that will not be held clearly erroneous unless it is implausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>United States v. Villa-nueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). According to the presentence report, Jau-regui purchased a pick-up truck from his drug supplier, consented to the installation of a hidden compartment in the vehicle, loaned the vehicle to his supplier six to seven times within a year, and was to be paid $4,000 for transporting almost 10 kilograms of cocaine. In light of these facts, the district court did not clearly err in denying him a minor-role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
