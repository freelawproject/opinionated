For the reasons stated by the BAP, we affirm its judgment, and remand the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings. <em>See Wall St. Plaza, LLC v. JSJF Corp. (In re JSJF Corp.), </em>344 B.R. 94 (9th Cir. BAP 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-24\">Wall Street Plaza, LLC (\u201cWSP\u201d) obtained a California state court judgment against JSJF for $183,240.67 in damages for breach of the terms of a lease, the event that prompted JSJF to seek protection in bankruptcy. The controversy before the bankruptcy court involved two claims by WSP: one for attorneys\u2019 fees (\u201cClaim 11\u201d) and an amended claim which added damages for breach of the lease (\u201cClaim 20\u201d). The bankruptcy court disallowed Claim 11 on the merits and, in effect, disallowed Claim 20 by denying leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>to amend Claim 11. The proposed decree closing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case contained an admission by JSJF that if the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment were reversed, to the extent allowable, the claims would qualify for full payment under the Chapter 11 Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The BAP held that the bankruptcy court\u2019s disallowance of Claim 11 under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(b)(6) was an error of law. Quoting \u00a7 502(b)(6), the BAP explained that the plain language of the statute \u201cdirects the bankruptcy court to allow the claim \u2018except to the extent ... if such claim is the claim of a lessor for damages resulting from the termination of a lease of real property, such claim exceeds\u2019 the formula it sets out.\u201d The BAP described \u00a7 502(b)(6) as a \u201clandlord\u2019s cap\u201d that may limit the amount of a lessor\u2019s claim, but does not, as the bankruptcy court seemed to believe, create a requirement for its allowance. Thus, \u00a7 502(b)(6) \u201cbecomes significant only if the claim otherwise allowable under non-bankruptcy law exceeds the cap calculated under the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The BAP explained that in <em>Kuske v. McSheridan (In re McSheridan), </em>184 B.R. 91 (9th Cir. BAP 1995), it had \u201cconstrued \u00a7 502(b)(6) as formulating a three-part test for determining what charges are \u2018rent reserved.\u2019 \u201d It criticized bankruptcy courts that have read <em>McSheridan </em>to be about claims allowance or disallowance. Instead, <em>McSheridan </em>\u201cconcerns which portions of a lessor\u2019s claim are limited by \u00a7 502(b)(6).\u201d The BAP remanded for the bankruptcy court to determine \u201cwhether the landlord\u2019s cap applies to some or all of claim 11 under <em>McSheridan, </em>and, if so, what that cap is.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The BAP also held that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in disallowing Claim 20 as an amendment to Claim 11. It explained that the \u201cgravamen of [Claim 11] was the assertion of all of Wall Street\u2019s rights vis-a-vis JSJF arising out of the lease litigation which resulted in the state court judgment, and Claim 20 sought to correct the error and set forth the proper amount of Wall Street\u2019s claim.\u201d Thus, the BAP believed that Claim 20 did not assert a new theory of relief and could be construed as an amendment to Claim 11. The BAP then concluded that the bankruptcy court made an error of law in determining that JSJF\u2019s having to address the merits or pay the claim was sufficient prejudice under the Third Circuit\u2019s case in <em>In re O\u2019Brien Environmental Energy, Inc., </em>188 F.3d 116 (3d Cir.1999). It remanded Claim 20 for a \u201cdetermination of the claim and the extent to which it may be limited by the \u00a7 502(b)(6) cap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">The BAP also addressed the equities in this case. It explained that \u201cJSJF\u2019s own plan of reorganization, schedules, and disclosure statement included Wall Street\u2019s claim for lease damages, and JSJF knew that Wall Street intended to assert its rights against it.\u201d Furthermore, \u2018Wall Street\u2019s successful assertion of those rights triggered JSJF\u2019s bankruptcy filing, and it referenced the judgment by court, case number, and date in its initial timely claim, claim 11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">This court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>In re El Toro Materials Co., Inc., </em>504 F.3d 978, 981-82 (9th Cir.2007), explains the proper use of \u00a7 502(b)(6). We recognize that <em>El Toro </em>was filed after the bankruptcy court perhaps felt itself bound by the earlier BAP decision in <em>McSheridan, </em>which could have been read superficially as supporting at least part of its rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">The judgment of the BAP is affirmed, and the case is remanded to the bankruptcy court to carry out the terms of the BAP remand. Costs to the Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b742-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
