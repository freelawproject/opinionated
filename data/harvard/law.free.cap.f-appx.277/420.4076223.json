He argues that the district court erred in assessing a criminal history point for his prior misdemeanor conviction for attaching a tag not assigned in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 320.261. Under that section, a person commits an offense by \u201cknowingly attach[ing] to any motor vehicle ... any registration license plate, ... which ... was not issued and assigned or lawfully transferred to such vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hernandez-Guido was convicted of that offense when he was stopped in Venice, Florida while driving a vehicle with a license plate that belonged to another car.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In determining a defendant\u2019s criminal history score, \u201c[s]entences for misdemean- or and petty offenses are counted,\u201d except for offenses listed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) and \u201coffenses similar to them.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). In determining whether a prior offense is \u201csimilar\u201d to a listed offense in \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l), this court employs a \u201ccommon sense approach which relies on all possible factors of similarity.\u201d <em>United States v. Hardeman, </em>933 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Hernandez-Guido argues that his offense of attaching a tag not assigned is similar to \u201c[djriving without a license or with a revoked or suspended license,\u201d an offense listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), or failing to maintain automobile insurance, the offense we concluded should not be counted under \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l) in <em>Hardeman. </em>We disagree. The punishments for Hernandez-Guido\u2019s offense and the offense of driving without a license or with a revoked or suspended licence do have, under Florida law, similar punishments. <em>See </em>Fla. St. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 320.261 and 322.34(2)(a). In addition, Hernandez-Guido\u2019s sentence of six months probation indicates that the sentencing court did not perceive his offense as very serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Nevertheless, to commit the offense of attaching a tag not assigned, Hernandez^ Guido had to knowingly attach a tag to a vehicle that was not assigned, issued, or lawfully transferred to that vehicle. <em>See </em>Fla. St. Ann. \u00a7 320.261. Because Hernandez-Guido had to expend resources to locate a tag belonging to one vehicle and affix it to another vehicle, his offense involved a greater degree of culpability and likelihood of future criminal conduct than the offenses of driving without a license, driving with a revoked or suspended license, and failing to maintain automobile insurance. <em>See Hardeman, </em>933 F.2d at 281. Accordingly, the district court did not err in assessing Hernandez-Guido a criminal history point for his conviction for attaching a tag not assigned. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Hernandez-Guido challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). Hernandez-Guido\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-11\"> Pursuant to 5rn Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
