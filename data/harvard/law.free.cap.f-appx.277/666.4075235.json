Hernandez, a native and citizen of Mexico, asserted claims of disparate treatment, retaliation, and hostile work environment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983. Hernandez also alleged that Tanninen conspired with city officials to bury proof of his employment discrimination claims in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). On Defendants\u2019 motion, the district court granted summary judgment on all claims, citing Hernandez\u2019s purported lack of evidence. The district court erred; there are disputed issues of fact on Hernandez\u2019s claims. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">A district court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. See Universal Health Servs. v. Thompson, </em>363 F.3d 1013, 1019 (9th Cir. 2004). We likewise review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Leong v. Potter, </em>347 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir. 2003). Evidentiary rulings made in the context of summary judgment are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Fonse-ca v. Sysco Food Serv. of Arizona, Inc., </em>374 F.3d 840, 845 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Initially, the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Hernandez\u2019s retaliation claim, because that claim was not specifically alleged in Hernandez\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) charges. \u201cSubject matter jurisdiction extends over all allegations of discrimination that either fell within the scope of the EEOC\u2019s <em>actual </em>investigation or an EEOC investigation which <em>can reasonably be expected </em>to grow out of the charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>See Josephs v. Pacific Bell, </em>443 F.3d 1050, 1062 (9th Cir.2006) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Hernandez\u2019s retaliation claim\u2014 which had not materialized at the time of his EEOC complaint because he had yet to be transferred out of his job \u2014 could reasonably have been expected to grow out of his charges that he was working in a hostile discriminatory environment. <em>Id. </em>We reverse the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Hernandez\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">Employment discrimination claims are analyzed under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden shifting framework. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment, a plaintiff must show that: \u201c(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for his position; (3) he experienced an adverse employment action; and (4) similarly situated individuals outside his protected class were treated more favorably, or other circumstances sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>rounding the adverse employment action give rise to an inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>Fonseca, </em>374 F.3d at 847 (quoting <em>Peterson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>358 F.3d 599, 604 (9th Cir.2004)). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: \u201c(1) she engaged in a protected activity, such as the filing of a complaint alleging racial discrimination, (2) the [defendant] subjected her to an adverse employment action, and (3) \u2018a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Manatt v. Bank of America, NA, </em>339 F.3d 792, 800 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Ray v. Henderson, </em>217 F.3d 1234, 1240 (9th <em>Cir.2000)) </em>(footnotes omitted). The quantum of evidence needed to establish a prima facie ease is \u201cminimal\u201d and less than a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Cordova v. State Farm Ins. Cos., </em>124 F.3d 1145, 1148 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Once a prima facie case is established, the defendant must offer \u201ca legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Fonseca, </em>374 F.3d at 849. If a legitimate reason is provided, the plaintiff must then show that the reason given is pretextual. <em>See Pottenger v. Potlatch Corp., </em>329 F.3d 740, 746 (9th Cir. 2003). \u201c[A] plaintiff can prove pretext either (1) indirectly, by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence because it is internally inconsistent or otherwise not believable, or (2) directly, by showing that unlawful discrimination more likely motivated the employer.\u201d <em>Lyons v. England, </em>307 F.3d 1092, 1113 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). The evidence used to establish the plaintiffs prima facie case may be sufficient to rebut a defendant\u2019s evidence and show that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason for the adverse action is a pretext. <em>Chuang v. Univ. of Cal Davis, Bd. of Trustees, </em>225 F.3d 1115, 1127 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The district court granted summary judgment on the disparate treatment claim, concluding that Hernandez had failed to show satisfactory job performance or an adverse employment action. There are disputed issues of fact as to both elements. Although Hernandez was given written and verbal reprimands for alleged poor performance, contrary evidence suggests that those admonishments were pretextual. Hernandez had uniformly positive job evaluations both before and after he worked at the Fire Shop. Two of Hernandez\u2019s former co-workers submitted affidavits stating that Hernandez\u2019s work at the Fire Shop was scrutinized more heavily because of his race. One of those coworkers offered an unprompted statement during an exit interview that he believed Hernandez was being discriminated against on account of race. This conflicting evidence is more than adequate to raise a disputed issue of fact as to Hernandez\u2019s job performance. <em>Messick v. Horizon Indus., </em>62 F.3d 1227, 1229-31 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Similarly, there are disputed fact questions as to whether Hernandez suffered an adverse employment action. Defendants contend that Hernandez\u2019s decision to transfer out of his job in the Fire Shop- \u2014 to a lower-paying position with inferior benefits \u2014 was \u201cvoluntary.\u201d Hernandez\u2019s affidavit maintains he was told that he could either accept the transfer or be terminated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two additional affiants sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ported Hernandez\u2019s characterization of the transfer. Hernandez met the \u201cminimal\u201d burden necessary to establish a prima fa-cie showing of an adverse employment action. <em>Cordova, </em>124 F.3d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Hernandez also established a prima facie case of retaliation. The district court erred in its conclusion that there was no causal link between a protected activity and an adverse employment action. In March 2002, Hernandez complained to the city\u2019s human resources department that his drill had been vandalized. He told human resources that he believed the vandalism was racially motivated. He reiterated those complaints a month later to the city\u2019s Fire Chief. After these complaints, starting in June 2002, Hernandez received a series of verbal and written reprimands. As a result of a confrontation with a coworker in December 2002 \u2014 prompted by Hernandez\u2019s accurate complaint that the co-worker had made a faulty repair \u2014 Hernandez was transferred out of the Fire Shop. The time between Hernandez\u2019s complaints and the subsequent negative evaluations and adverse employment action is sufficiently close for Hernandez to carry his prima facie burden. <em>See Bell v. Clackamas County, </em>341 F.3d 858, 865 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cTemporal proximity between protected activity and an adverse employment action can by itself constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence of retaliation in some cases.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Finally, as to both the disparate treatment and retaliation claims, the district court erred when it found that Hernandez had produced \u201cno evidence\u201d to rebut Defendants\u2019 proffered reason for the adverse action as pretextual. Defendants maintain that Hernandez was transferred out of the Fire Shop because he was, in effect, a bad mechanic. A variety of evidence showed otherwise. Hernandez offered affidavits from two co-workers who testified that he was discriminated against on account of his race. The employee with whom Hernandez was involved in an altercation was not reprimanded or disciplined in any form, while Hernandez was transferred out of the Fire Shop. <em>See Fonseca, </em>374 F.3d at 850 (evidence that white workers not punished for the same conduct as Hispanic plaintiff supports claim of pretext). Finally, Hernandez offered evidence \u2014 including deposition testimony from Fire Shop employees \u2014 that showed that certain Fire Shop and Fire Department personnel had made anti-Hispanic racist remarks. Hernandez\u2019s indirect and direct evidence raised a disputed issue of material fact as to whether Defendants\u2019 proffered reason for the adverse action was pretextual. <em>See Chuang, </em>225 F.3d at 1127-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Next, the district court granted summary judgment on Hernandez\u2019s hostile work environment claim because it concluded that his allegations \u201cfall short of the severity of conditions that constitute a hostile work environment.\u201d \u201cIn determining if an environment is so hostile as to violate Title VII, we consider whether, in light of \u2018all the circumstances,\u2019 the harassment is \u2018sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., </em>360 F.3d 1103, 1112-13 (9th Cir.2004) (internal citations omitted). Hernandez, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to him, has raised a disputed issue of fact as to the severity of the conditions at the Fire Shop. In opposition to summary judgment, Hernandez placed evidence in the record to show that: coworkers refused to engage with him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>purposely gave him misleading advice on how to perform repairs; his equipment was vandalized by co-workers hostile towards him because of his race; human resources personnel investigating his complaints dismissed his charges of racism as \u201csarcastic\u201d; and, superiors and co-workers had made racist comments regarding Hispanics generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Defendants dispute Hernandez\u2019s depiction of the Fire Shop as a hostile workplace and placed countervailing evidence in the record tending to show that any perceived hostility towards Hernandez was a result of his incompetence as a mechanic. But it is not for us \u2014 or the district court\u2014 to weigh evidence on summary judgment and choose the version of events we consider more persuasive or believable. <em>See McGinest, </em>360 F.3d at 1113 n. 5. Hernandez\u2019s allegations of hostility, if credited, describe conduct that \u201cpollute[d] [Hernandez\u2019s] workplace, making it more difficult for [him] to do [his] job, to take pride in [his] work, and to desire to stay on in [his] position.\u201d <em>Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co., </em>25 F.3d 1459, 1463 (9th Cir.1994). We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Hernandez\u2019s hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Finally, we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hernandez\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy claim. To establish a \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy claim, the plaintiff must show: \u201c[1] the existence of a conspiracy to deprive the plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws; [2] an act in furtherance of the conspiracy; and [3] a resulting injury.\u201d <em>Scott v. Ross, </em>140 F.3d 1275, 1284 (9th Cir.1998). The district court granted summary judgment on this claim based on its conclusion that Hernandez had \u201cproduced no evidence\u201d in support of a conspiracy or race-based discriminatory animus. The district court\u2019s conclusion is unwarranted; Hernandez produced evidence in support of both elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Hernandez provided an affidavit from his former attorney, Gregoi\u2019y Ferguson, documenting a conversation with Tanninen wherein Tanninen admitted that Hernandez was subject to race-based discrimination at the Fire Shop.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tanninen subsequently refused to corroborate that admission after conferring with Deputy Fire Chief Steve Streissguth. When asked about these statements in an interview with a city investigator, Tanninen denied that Hernandez\u2019s co-workers were biased against him and gave inconsistent answers on the issue of whether there was a perception that Hernandez was hired because of his race. Tanninen also equivocated on the content of his conversation with Streissguth; he refused to say that Streissguth had told him to tell the truth, urging him instead to simply do what \u201cis right.\u201d This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Hernandez, goes to show that a conspiracy existed between Tanninen and the city to cover up the investigation of race-based hostility. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that the evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>so one-sided and undisputed that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim. <em>Fonda v. Gray, </em>707 F.2d 435, 438 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201cA claim of conspiracy, being dependent on questions of intent, may not always be amenable to disposition on summary judgment.\u201d); <em>Scott, </em>140 F.3d at 1285 (affirming denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on \u00a7 1985(3) claim given the \u201cinconsistencies in [the defendant\u2019s] testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\">. The district court abused its discretion when it excluded Hernandez\u2019s affidavit on a \"sham affidavit\" rationale. The district court did not point to any specific instance where Hernandez's affidavit contradicted his prior deposition testimony; a comparison of the two reveals that no contradiction exists. <em>Messick, </em>62 F.3d at 1231 (holding that \u201csham affidavit\" doctrine does not apply to later affidavit where a party is merely \"elaborating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>upon, explaining or clarifying prior testimony\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">. The district court abused its discretion when it excluded the Ferguson affidavit as hearsay. Although the Ferguson affidavit contained two out-of-court statements, neither statement was hearsay. The first statement was from one of Hernandez\u2019s co-workers, Roger Osborn, who told Tanninen that Hernandez \"had gotten his job because he was Mexican, and that [his co-workers] were not going to put up with that.\u201d This statement is not hearsay; it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but rather as evidence of Defendants' racially-tinged motives. <em>See Bergene v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement &amp; Power Dist., </em>272 F.3d 1136, 1142 (9th Cir.2001). The second statement, from Tanninen to Ferguson, is not hearsay as to the conspiracy claim because it is an admission of a party-opponent. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
