Straus denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Kulyak, Anatoliy Andreyevich </em>No. A71 416 311 (B.I.A. Aug. 2, 2007),<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>aff'g </em>No. A71 416 311 (Immig. Ct. Hartford, Conn. May 12, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, we review the BIA\u2019s August 2007 decision regarding whether the Government established a fundamental change in circumstances; with regard to the other issues in this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified and supplemented by the BIA decision. <em>See id.; Yan Chen, </em>417 F.3d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. DHS, </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, a determination \u201cbased on flawed reasoning ... will not satisfy the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 400 (2d Cir.2005). We will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Id. </em>at 406. We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">A. Jurisdiction and Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">As an initial matter, we doubt that, as the Government argues, our jurisdiction is limited by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) because that provision does not apply to removal orders of aliens found deportable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), that is, based on a single conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude. We similarly doubt the Government\u2019s assertion that we do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of Kulyak\u2019s motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>continuance. <em>See Sanusi v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 193, 198-99 (2d Cir.2006). We need not decide those issues at this time, however, because we find that the petition lacks merit for the reasons set forth below. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 338 n. 2 (2d Cir.2006). Because Kulyak failed to raise his claims for CAT relief and humanitarian asylum in his brief to this Court, however, we deem those claims waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">B. Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"Ags\">Assuming that we do have statutory jurisdiction, we nonetheless conclude that the agency\u2019s denial of Kulyak\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal was not in error. The regulations provide that an applicant who has established past persecution shall be presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). That presumption, however, may be rebutted by a showing that circumstances have fundamentally changed so as to negate his fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A). Here, the BIA permissibly found that the Government established a fundamental change in country conditions given that the 2002 U.S. Department of State Country Report for Moldova in the record indicates that the Moldovan government generally respects its citizens\u2019 constitutional right to practice religion and has permitted some minority Christian groups to register with it. Moreover, given that the 2002 U.S. Department of State International Religious Freedom Report for Moldova reported that \u201cgenerally amicable relations among religions\u201d had \u201ccontributed to religious freedom,\u201d we do not agree with Kulyak that the BIA erred in finding that conditions in Moldova have changed. Considering the record as a whole, we therefore find no error in the IJ\u2019s determination that he failed to overcome the record evidence rebutting the presumption of a well-founded fear. Nor can we find that the agency erred in finding that Kulyak failed to establish that Pentecostal Christians in Moldova are subject to a pattern or practice of persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">As Kulyak concedes, his argument that he is not removable because his refugee status was not revoked is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Maiwand v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 101,105-07 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">C. Motion for Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">We find no abuse of discretion in the IJ\u2019s denial of Kulyak\u2019s motion for a continuance. We have held that \u201c[a]n IJ would .... abuse his discretion in denying a continuance if \u2018(1) [his] decision rests on an error of law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding or (2)[his] decision\u2014 though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding \u2014 cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morgan v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 549, 551-52 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Zervos v. Verizon New York, Inc., </em>252 F.3d 163, 169 (2d Cir. 2001)). Here, Kulyak\u2019s counsel partially acceded to the IJ\u2019s characterization of the proposed expert testimony as concerning future rather than current conditions in Moldova. As a result, we cannot say that the IJ\u2019s denial rested on a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d factual finding or an error of law. <em>See Morgan, </em>445 F.3d at 551-52. Nor do we consider his denial of the motion to be outside \u201cthe range of permissible decisions,\u201d notwithstanding the centrality of the country conditions issue, because there is no indication that had Kulyak\u2019s expert testified, the IJ would have found that his testimony was both pertinent and suffi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>dent to overcome the State Department reports. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\"> The BIA's August 2007 decision is construed to have incorporated by reference its August 2004 order to the extent that decision was undisturbed by the April 2007 stipulation and order entered by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
