Sept. 24, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A78 294 685 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 5, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">When, as here, the BIA adopts and supplements the Id\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in, part, on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Chen failed to establish that upon her return to China she will more likely than not be tortured because of her illegal departure. The background evidence Chen presented concerning the threat of torture for repatriated citizens is similar to that found insufficient to compel a finding of probable torture in <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005). Also, as in <em>Mu Xiang Lin, </em>Chen presented no \u201cparticularized evidence\u201d suggesting that she faced a greater threat of torture than other repatriated citizens. <em>See. id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">Insofar as Chen bases her CAT claim on the' likelihood that she will be tortured either by the Chinese government for reasons other than her illegal departure or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201csnakeheads\u201d due to her inability to repay her loan, these arguments are unexhaust-ed. As the Government has raised exhaustion as an affirmative defense to petitioner\u2019s CAT claim, we will not consider them further. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1 (2d Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED-. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-13\">. Similarly, to the extent Chen asserts that she fears future persecution other than torture from either the Chinese government or snakeheads, her failure to raise these arguments before the immigration judge renders them unreviewable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
