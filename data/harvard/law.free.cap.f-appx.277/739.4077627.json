The Board dismissed Hafer\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d protection complaint against United Airlines (\u201cUnited\u201d) after a district court issued an order confirming United\u2019s reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (\u201cConfirmation Order\u201d). We review the Board\u2019s decision de novo, <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., </em>204 F.3d 1272, 1275 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">An OSHA investigator determined that Hafer\u2019s complaint, filed against United under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(a) of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21 st Century (\u201cAIR 21\u201d), was meritless. An Administrative Law Judge later dismissed Hafer\u2019s appeal of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) investigator\u2019s determination. Hafer appealed to the Board. In 2002, the Board stayed Hafer\u2019s claim pursuant to United\u2019s voluntary petition for bankruptcy. In 2006, after the bankruptcy judge confirmed United\u2019s reorganization plan, the Board dismissed Hafer\u2019s pending appeal because the claim had been discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-16\">The Board properly dismissed Hafer\u2019s appeal. The Board\u2019s decision is compelled by the terms of the Confirmation Order which enjoins the continuation of any claims against United. The decision is also consistent with the discharge provisions contained within the bankruptcy code. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(d)(1)(A) (\u201c[T]he confirmation of a plan ... discharges the debtor from any debt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>arose before the date of such confirmation ....\u201d); 944(b)(1) (\u201c[T]he debtor is discharged from all debts as of the time when ... the plan is confirmed .... \u201d); 524(a)(2) (\u201cA discharge ... operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action----\u201d); <em>In re Orange Tree Assocs., </em>961 F.2d 1445, 1448 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Hafer\u2019s claim does not fall under any of the statutory exceptions to discharge and we reject his request that we judicially create a separate and unique exception to cover AIR 21 claims. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a) (listing nineteen exceptions to discharge available for individual debtors); 1141(d)(6) (listing two exceptions to discharge that apply to corporate debtors, both relating to fraud); <em>FCC v. NextWave Pers. Commc\u2019n, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 293, 302, 123 S.Ct. 832, 154 L.Ed.2d 863 (2003) (\u201c[W]here Congress has intended to provide regulatory exceptions to provisions of the Bankniptey Code, it has done so clearly and expressly....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Though we recognize that the policy underpinning AIR 21 is laudable, Congress crafted the discharge provision, along with the rest of the bankruptcy code, to provide debtors a \u201cfresh start.\u201d <em>See Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v. Katz, </em>546 U.S. 356, 364, 126 S.Ct. 990, 163 L.Ed.2d 945 (2006). The plain language of the Confirmation Order and the bankruptcy code foreclose our adoption of Hafer\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Because we hold that the Board properly dismissed Hafer\u2019s claims, we need not respond to Hafer\u2019s contention that the Board erred when it initially stayed Hafer\u2019s appeal. We note, however, that after he became aware of United\u2019s bankruptcy petition, Hafer failed to avail himself of multiple opportunities to revive his claim. He could have filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay in the bankruptcy court, Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9014(a); 4001(a)(1), but did not. Further, he could have filed an interlocutory appeal from the Board\u2019s initial stay determination, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(b)(4)(A), but did not exercise that option either.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">No court has held that a claim such as this one \u2014 brought by a private party for compensatory damages and equitable relief, and dismissed by the agency as merit-less \u2014 falls within the statutory exception for stays brought \u201cby [a] governmental unit to enforce [its] ... police or regulatory power.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(b)(4). We decline the opportunity to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b764-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
