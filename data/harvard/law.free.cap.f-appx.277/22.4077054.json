Adeniyi was indicted for his participation in an \u201cadvanced fee scheme\u201d in which he and his confederates defrauded four victims, collectively, out of more than $300,000 by duping them into believing that they would receive large sums of money, via investments, commissions or bequests, if only they paid up front a fee to cover putative administrative and other costs. Adeniyi was convicted, following a jury trial, of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to pass fictitious obligations, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; substantive wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343 and 2; and passing fictitious obligations, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 514(a)(2) and 2. He was sentenced principally to a term of 41 months\u2019 imprisonment. He argues on appeal that the admission of out-of-court statements and the failure to excuse a juror during trial require his conviction to be vacated. The parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-17\"><em>A. Admission of Third-Party Statements Made at Adeniyi\u2019s Arrest. </em>Adeniyi argues that the district court erred in admitting a Secret Service agent\u2019s testimony regarding statements made by Adeniyi\u2019s common-law wife, Yinka Wilkerson, at the time of Adeniyi\u2019s arrest. Agent John Bross testified that when he and fellow agents arrived at Adeniyi\u2019s home to arrest him, they saw Adeniyi\u2019s car out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>front. They knocked several times on the door, announcing \u201cpolice\u201d and \u201cSecret Service\u201d a number of times. After about three or four minutes, Wilkerson opened the door. The agents asked for Adeniyi, and Wilkerson replied that he was \u201ctraveling on business.\u201d When asked where Adeniyi was traveling, Wilkerson \u201cpaused and looked down, and kind of shrugged her shoulders and said I don\u2019t know. He just told me that he was traveling on business.\u201d The agents then obtained permission to enter the home and found Adeniyi hiding in the basement, crouched behind a couch in the darkness. Wilkerson did not testify at trial. Her statements were admitted through Agent Bross\u2019s testimony, offered as evidence of Adeniyi\u2019s consciousness of guilt in that they evinced a coordinated attempt to frustrate law enforcement efforts to arrest Adeniyi. The district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Tocco, </em>135 F.3d 116, 128 (2d Cir.1998). As the above makes clear, the jury heard overwhelming evidence that Adeniyi attempted to avoid apprehension. The testimony recounting Wilkerson\u2019s remark was cumulative of this evidence, and, therefore, any alleged error in its admission would not be grounds for reversal. <em>See United States v. Dukagjini, </em>326 F.3d 45, 61-62 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><em>B. Admission of Victims\u2019 Statements to Investigating Agent. </em>Adeniyi argues that his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him was violated when the district court allowed an agent to testify regarding the information he received from two victims that led him to investigate Adeniyi. Adeniyi failed to object to this testimony on Confrontation Clause grounds at trial and so we review this claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Dukagjini, </em>326 F.3d 45, 60 (2d Cir.2003). The agent\u2019s testimony about the victims\u2019 statements was properly admitted because it was not offered for the purpose of establishing the truth of the matters asserted. <em>See Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The district court admitted limited testimony as background evidence to explain what caused the agent to open an investigation. \u201cBackground evidence may be admitted to ... furnish an explanation of the understanding or intent with which certain acts were performed.\u201d <em>United States v. Reifler, </em>446 F.3d 65, 92 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court\u2019s admission of this testimony was not error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\"><em>C. Juror Disclosure During Trial. </em>Adeniyi argues that he was deprived of his right to trial by an impartial jury, because a juror failed to disclose information during voir dire which, if revealed would have justified that juror\u2019s removal for cause. \u201c[A] party moving <em>for </em>a new trial based on juror nondisclosure or misstatements\u201d must satisfy a two-pronged test: (1) \u201cthe party must show that a \u2018juror failed to answer honestly a material question on <em>voir dire.\u2019 </em>and (2) \u201cthe party must show that \u2018a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>285 F.3d 158, 170 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, </em>464 U.S. 548, 556, 104 S.Ct. 845, 78 L.Ed.2d 663 (1984)). The juror disclosed, on the second day of trial, that he had personal experience of fraud, in the form of bounced checks submitted to his business, but that it had not occurred to him during <em>voir dire </em>that this might make him a crime victim. The district court found that the juror did not fail to answer honestly a material question on <em>voir dire </em>(because \u201cthe information he provided was not directly responsive to any of the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tions asked of him by the Court\u201d), and that nothing in the juror\u2019s disclosure, or in his responses to further questioning, permitted an inference of bias or provided the basis for a challenge for cause. The decision whether to replace a sitting juror is within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c). Abuse of that discretion will be found only \u201cwhere there is bias or prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Purdy, </em>144 F.3d 241, 247 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). The record evidence is sufficient to place the district court\u2019s decision to retain the juror within its broad discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Finding no merit in Adeniyi\u2019s remaining arguments, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
