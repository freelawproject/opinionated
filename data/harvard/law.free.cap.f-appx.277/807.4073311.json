HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Lyle Dean Easky pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma to the offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The court sentenced him to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal Mr. Easky contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG), Mr. Easky was assigned a base offense level of 14 for being a felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6). He received a two-level enhancement for obstructing justice, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, and a two-level reduction for accepting responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 14. Because he had 14 criminal-history points, his criminal-history category was VI. Of his 14 points, two came from a conviction of larceny of merchandise from a retailer, one from conviction of petit larceny, three from a conviction of unlawful possession of a controlled drug, three from a conviction of possession of a stolen vehicle and resisting arrest, and three from a conviction of unlawful possession of a controlled drug and paraphernalia. He received two additional criminal-history points because the instant offense was committed less than two years after his release from custody. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(e). The resulting Guidelines range was 37 to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Mr. Easky to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment, the middle of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">On appeal Mr. Easky does not challenge the Guidelines calculation. Rather, he argues that his sentence is too harsh under the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that both his offense and his criminal history are less serious than they may appear. Although he concedes that he possessed a loaded semi-automatic pistol, he says that he did not use the gun or threaten anybody with it. As for his criminal history, he states that much of it is tied to his severe drug addiction, and \u201c[t]he victim of these offenses was the Defendant himself, whose health and liberty were at stake.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 9. He further asserts that his larceny offenses were minor thefts. Accordingly, he concludes that drug treatment and the minimum sentence in the Guidelines range (37 months\u2019 imprisonment) would \u201ceffectuate the sentencing purposes o[f] 3553(a)(2),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10, and that a longer sentence is therefore unnecessarily harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201cwe review sentencing decisions for reasonableness .... \u201d <em>United States v. Atencio, </em>476 F.3d 1099, 1102 (10th Cir.2007). \u201cA substantively reasonable sentence ultimately reflects the gravity of the crime and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as applied to the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review under \u201cthe familiar abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Sentences within a correctly calculated Guidelines range are accorded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1055 (10th Cir.2006); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Mr. Easky has failed to overcome the presumption that his within-Guidelines sentence was reasonable. In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we \u201cdefer not only to a district court\u2019s factual findings but also to its determinations of the weight to be afforded to such findings.\u201d United <em>States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 808 (10th Cir.2008). The district court considered Mr. Easky\u2019s drug problem and need for treatment, together with his \u201cnumerous\u201d arrests \u201cfor violent and alcohol and drug-related offenses.\u201d R. Vol. IV at 9. The court recognized the \u00a7 3553 factors, recommended that Mr. Ea-sky serve his sentence in a \u201cfacility where he can be treated by the Bureau of Prisons Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program,\u201d <em>id., </em>and requested \u201cthat he be provided the 500-hour treatment program ... and any other drug treatment program that [the Bureau of Prisons] can enlist the defendant in to give him assistance and help,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 9-10. We cannot say that the sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">We AFFIRM the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
