Romero-Castillo contends that the district court abused its discretion in imposing his sentence because it failed to adequately consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We presume that a sentence imposed within the properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). A district court must explain the sentence it imposes sufficiently for this court to effectively review its reasonableness, but need not mechanically discuss all the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006). The court\u2019s explanation should indicate that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the arguments raised by the parties. <em>Id. </em>We do not evaluate the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation \u201cin a vacuum,\u201d but also consider \u201c[t]he context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-17\">Romero-Castillo has not overcome the presumptive reasonableness of his sen-tenee within the guidelines range, and the district court did not abuse its discretion. The district court discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and, in particular, extensively discussed Romero-Castillo\u2019s contention that his substance abuse problems constituted a mitigating factor that warranted a sentence below the guidelines range. In considering the need to protect the public and the most effective way to treat Romero-Castillo\u2019s addiction, the district court found that a sentence within the guidelines range, although not at the high end of the sentencing range for which the Government advocated, was sufficient but not greater than necessary. In light of the evidence of Romero-Castillo\u2019s extensive criminal history, which included at least eight convictions for driving while impaired or intoxicated, two controlled substance offenses involving sales of marijuana to undercover police officers, and several instances of entering the United States illegally, the district court reasonably determined within its discretion that the nature of his offense justified the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">We affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
