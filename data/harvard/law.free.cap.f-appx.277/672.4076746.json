Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Onofre Ramirez contends that his motion to reopen was timely because there is no time limit for motions to reopen that seek relief under CAT and because he only recently became aware of \u201cwidespread torture\u201d in Mexico. Onofre Ramirez filed his motion to reopen outside the ninety-day time limit set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), which does apply to CAT claims. In addition, he failed to present material evidence of changed country conditions that was not available and could not have been presented at the previous proceeding. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128,1131-32 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">Onofre Ramirez also contends that the Board erred in concluding that even if the motion to reopen were timely, he did not establish a prima facie case of eligibility for relief under CAT. The generalized evidence attached to the motion did not meet the CAT standard. <em>See Nuru, v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that CAT applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to his native country); <em>Ordonez v. INS, 345 F.3d </em>777, 785 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that motion to reopen must establish prima facie case demonstrating reasonable likelihood that requirements for relief have been satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b697-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
