Magdaleno, a former Washington County Sheriffs Deputy, filed this action under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et </em>ser/., alleging discrimination on the basis of his post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). The district court granted summary judgment to the County, holding there is no triable issue of fact as to whether Magdaleno is \u201cdisabled\u201d under the ADA. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the facts are known to the parties, we revisit them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">Magdaleno asserts he is \u201cdisabled\u201d under the ADA because: (1) he has an actual disability, defined as a physical or mental impairment that \u201csubstantially limits\u201d a major life activity, and (2) alternatively, the County \u201cregarded\u201d him as having a disability. <em>See Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 193-94, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">First, Magdaleno asserts he has an actual disability under the ADA because his PTSD \u201csubstantially limits\u201d his major life activity of interacting with others. To show a substantial limitation on his ability to interact with others, Magdaleno must establish his \u201crelations with others were characterized on a regular basis by severe problems, for example, consistently high levels of hostility, social withdrawal, or failure to communicate when necessary.\u201d <em>See McAlindin v. County of San Diego, </em>192 F.3d 1226, 1235 (9th Cm.1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the impairment\u2019s impact must be \u201cpermanent or long term.\u201d <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., </em>534 U.S. at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681 (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1630.2(j)(2)(ii) \u2014 (iii) (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">The undisputed evidence shows Magdal-eno\u2019s inability to interact with others was of limited duration and limited severity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>and was allayed by anti-depressant medication. Thus, there is no triable issue of fact as to whether Magdaleno had an actual disability under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Alternatively, Magdaleno contends the County regarded him as having an impairment that substantially limited his ability to interact with others. Under the ADA, individuals who are \u201cregarded as having\u201d a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits [a] major life activit[y]\u201d are disabled. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(2)(A), (C). To establish a disability under the \u201cregarded as\u201d prong, Magdaleno must show the County \u201cmistakenly believe[d] that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limit[ed]\u201d Magdaleno\u2019s ability to interact with others. <em>See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The undisputed evidence shows the County did not regard Magdaleno as substantially limited in his ability to interact with others. That the County was aware of Magdaleno\u2019s PTSD diagnosis, required him to submit to a psychological evaluation, and took steps to accommodate his PTSD, is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact on the \u201cregarded as\u201d prong. <em>See Thornton v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., </em>261 F.3d 789, 798 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[Wjhen an employer takes steps to accommodate an employee\u2019s restrictions, it is not thereby conceding that the employee is disabled under the ADA or that it regards the employee as disabled.\u201d); <em>Cody v. CIGNA Healthcare of St. Louis, Inc., </em>139 F.3d 595, 599 (8th Cir.1998) (\u201cA request for an evaluation is not equivalent to treatment of the employee as though she were substantially impaired.\u201d). Thus, there is no triable issue of fact as to whether the County regarded Magdaleno as having a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Washington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b704-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
