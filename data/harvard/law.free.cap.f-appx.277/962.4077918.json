We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-20\">We review for abuse of discretion a dismissal without prejudice of a complaint for failure to serve a defendant under Rule 4(m). <em>Lepone-Dempsey v. Carroll County Comm\u2019rs, </em>476 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2007). The record is undisputed that White did not serve the defendants under Rule 4(m), and in his brief, White makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>no argument that the district court erred in its application of the Rule. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">White\u2019s argument that his motion for court-appointed counsel should have been granted also fails. To the extent \"White is seeking reconsideration of our order, his request is untimely because it was filed more than 21 days after this Court denied his motion for court-appointed counsel. 11th Cir. R. 27-2. To the extent \"White is challenging the denial of his motion by the district court, his argument fails because his complaint was not novel or complex. \u201cCourt appointment of counsel in civil cases is warranted only in \u2018exceptional circumstances,\u2019 and whether such circumstances exist is also committed to district court discretion.\u201d <em>Steele v. Shah, </em>87 F.3d 1266, 1271 (11th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Kilgo v. Ricks, </em>983 F.2d 189, 193 (11th Cir.1993)). \u201cThe key is whether the <em>pro se </em>litigant needs help in presenting the essential merits of his or her position in the court.\u201d <em>Kilgo, </em>983 F.2d at 193. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">We also deny White\u2019s motion to reconsider his request to file a supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">The dismissal of \"White\u2019s complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
