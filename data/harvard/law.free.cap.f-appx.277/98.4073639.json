Kravitz, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b122-23\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b122-24\">Martinez appeals from the November 13, 2006 order of the district court declining, after this Court\u2019s remand pursuant to <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), to resentence him. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-25\">We review sentencing decisions for reasonableness, asking \u201cwhether the sentencing judge exceeded the bounds of allowable discretion, committed an error of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). Martinez argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court unreasonably failed or refused to consider Martinez\u2019s 17-day incarceration in a state facility in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We find no error in Martinez\u2019s sentence. The district court\u2019s order declining to re-sentence Martinez explicitly articulated its reasoning with respect to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court specifically noted Martinez\u2019s \u201cviolent criminal history,\u201d and the \u201cobvious need to protect the public from [Martinez\u2019s] further violent crimes.\u201d In light of these considerations, and after considering \u201cthe sentencing range under the Guidelines and the policy statements,\u201d the district court determined that a 115-month sentence, the longest term suggested by the Guidelines, was appropriate. Although the district court did not explicitly address Martinez\u2019s request that it consider the 17 days he spent in state custody on charges related to his firearms offense, in light of its demonstrated consideration of the relevant factors and policy statements, this omission provides no basis upon which to disturb the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 33 (noting that the district court\u2019s failure to address explicitly a defendant\u2019s sentencing argument is not sufficient to overcome this Court\u2019s presumption that the district court \u201cfaithfully performed its obligation to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">We dispose of Martinez\u2019s remaining claims, which challenge the district court\u2019s application of a preponderance of the evidence standard to certain facts relevant to sentencing, in an accompanying opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Avd\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
