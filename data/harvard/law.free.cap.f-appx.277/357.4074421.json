As an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), he was sentenced by the district court to 212 months in prison followed by five years of supervised release. He appeals his conviction and sentence, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the district court\u2019s admission of a statement he made to an arresting officer, and the denial of his <em>Batson </em>motion. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">Reed and two co-defendants, Eric Bol-den and Larry Bushnell, were tried before a jury on November 30 and December 1, 2006. A third co-defendant, Larry Solomon, pleaded guilty the day before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-18\"><em>A. Jury Selection and the </em>Batson <em>Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-19\">During jury selection, five African-American jurors were struck from the ve-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>nire panel. The government struck two; the record does not indicate who struck the other three. After the announcement of the petit jury panel, defense counsel made a joint <em>Batson </em>challenge to its composition. The government responded by stating that one of the African-American venire members had indicated that \u201che didn\u2019t really want to be here because ... he was missing work\u201d and that the other had said that \u201che had a problem with the Harris County Sheriffs officers.... \u201d Thereafter, defense counsel responded, \u201c[o]kay\u201d; the court asked if there were any other challenged strikes; and after defense counsel said, \u201c[tjhat\u2019s all,\u201d the court overruled the <em>Batson </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Later at trial, following the government\u2019s case-in-chief, Bolden\u2019s counsel clarified for the record that \u201cthe jury panel ha[d] no African-Americans.... \u201d The district court remarked that \u201c[tjhere were black venire men. And the five jurors whom we discussed ... were all black. The defendants are black. The two prosecutors are black. What else do we need?\u201d Bolden\u2019s counsel replied, \u201c[n]othing,\u201d and the court said, \u201c[o]kay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>B. The Evidence Admitted at Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEA\">At trial, Reed stipulated that he was a convicted felon and that the firearm in question had traveled in interstate commerce. Therefore, the only issue was whether he possessed the firearm. To prove this element, the government called Rolanda Bushnell, Officers Pat Siddons and Preston Moore, and a fingerprint examiner, Michael Salvidar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Rolanda Bushnell testified that on June 21, 2004, she parked a rented jeep at her residence where her brother, Larry Bushnell, and the other co-defendants were present. According to Rolanda Bushnell, the vehicle contained no firearms when she left the keys in it, and she did not drink Crown Royal. At some point that afternoon, Reed, Larry Bushnell, Bolden, and Solomon borrowed the jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Meanwhile, Officer Siddons testified that around 6:00 p.m. that same day, he responded to an incident in the Fifth Ward area of Houston, Texas. There he stopped a jeep that was speeding toward him by blocking its path and pointing his weapon at the occupants. Officer Moore arrived on the scene less than a minute thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Siddons further testified that after the jeep stopped, he instructed the four occupants to raise their hands. The driver, Bolden, and the front-seat passenger, Reed, did not immediately comply. Instead, they both \u201cdropped their hands down into the floor board area of the vehicle.\u201d Only after Siddons repeatedly demanded that the two men raise their hands did they comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">According to Siddons, after back-up officers arrived one or two minutes later, Reed was removed from the jeep, handcuffed, and placed in the back of Siddons\u2019s patrol car. Upon taking Reed into custody, Siddons discovered a \u201cblue velvet Crown Royal bag that was in plain view in the [front] passenger floor board area\u201d near Reed\u2019s feet. Inside the bag was a .357 revolver. Siddons placed both the revolver and the Crown Royal bag in Moore\u2019s patrol car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">Siddons found three additional firearms on the floor board in the back seat of the jeep \u2014 one on the rear floor board near Larry Bushnell (who was sitting behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Reed) and the other two on the rear floor board near Solomon (who was sitting behind Bolden). Moore testified that he found a fifth firearm on the front floor board on the driver\u2019s side where Bolden was seated. All of these weapons were placed in Moore\u2019s patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">On redirect examination, Siddons testified that after Reed was removed from the jeep, Reed told him that \u201che had just been robbed and that he was trying to keep the other guy from killing him \u2014 or keeping the other guy from killing a person.\u201d Reed\u2019s defense counsel objected to the admission of this statement on the grounds that it was irrelevant and beyond the scope of Siddons\u2019s direct testimony, and the district court allowed the evidence to come in, stating \u201cnothing outside of cross after this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Reed\u2019s defense consisted of testimony by his co-defendant, Solomon. Solomon testified that all five firearms belonged to him, and that when the jeep was stopped by police, all five firearms were near him on the rear floor board. He also testified that he did not have a Crown Royal bag and that he did not slide anything under the seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\n<em>C. The Verdict and Reed\u2019s Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Reed guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2), and Bolden and Larry Bushnell guilty of them respective charges. As an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), Reed was sentenced by the district court to 212 months in prison and five years of supervised release on August 15, 2005. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Reed argues that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support a jury finding that he possessed a firearm beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the district court abused its discretion in admitting testimony on redirect examination regarding a statement he made to Siddons during the arrest; and (3) the district court clearly erred in denying his <em>Batson </em>challenge to the government\u2019s peremptory strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">This court \u201creview[s] a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Ferguson, </em>211 F.3d 878, 882 (5th Cir.2000). In evaluating whether the evidence was sufficient to convict Reed, the court \u201cmust determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and drawing all reasonable inferences from the evidence in support of the verdict, a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence and the evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf, however, the evidence gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt, as well as to a theory of innocence, the conviction must be reversed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 882-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government had the burden to prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that Reed had been convicted of a felony; (2) that he possessed a firearm; and (3) that the firearm traveled in or affected interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Fields, </em>72 F.3d 1200, 1211 (5th Cir.1996). Because the parties stipulated that all of the firearms were manufactured outside of Texas and that Reed was a convicted felon, Reed\u2019s challenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the sufficiency of the evidence pertains only to the second element.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Possession of a firearm may be actual or constructive. <em>United States v. De Leon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 496 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cActual possession means the defendant knowingly has direct physical control over a thing at a given time.\u201d <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>150 F.3d 401, 416 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cConstructive possession means ownership, dominion or control over a thing, or control over the premises where the thing is found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When there is joint occupancy or presence at a location in which a weapon is found, such as here, this court applies a \u201c \u2018commonsense, fact-specific approach\u2019 [in] determining whether constructive possession was established.\u201d <em>United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 349 (5th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Smith, </em>930 F.2d 1081, 1086 (5th Cir.1991)). The evidence must support \u201cat least a plausible inference that the defendant had knowledge of and access to the illegal item.\u201d <em>United States v. Hinojosa, </em>349 F.3d 200, 204 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u201c[M]ore evidence than mere physical proximity of the defendant to the [firearm] is required.\u201d <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>953 F.2d 898, 901 (5th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). Nor is evidence that the defendant operated the vehicle, eluded the police, and made furtive movements near the location of the firearm, by itself, sufficient to establish constructive possession. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>24 F.3d 732, 735 (5th Cir.1994). \u201c[W]hile dominion over the vehicle certainly will help the government\u2019s case, it alone cannot establish constructive possession of a weapon found in the vehicle, particularly in the face of evidence that strongly suggests that somebody else exercised dominion and control over the weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u201csomething else (e.g., some circumstantial indicium of possession) is required besides mere joint occupancy.... \u201d <em>Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Applying these principles to the present case, the evidence was sufficient to establish that Reed constructively possessed the .357 revolver. First, Rolanda Bushnell testified that Reed and his co-defendants borrowed the car with no firearms inside it. Second, Siddons testified that when he stopped Reed, he observed both Reed and the driver reach towards the floor board (where both Reed and the driver had access to firearms). Third, when Reed was removed from the vehicle, the .357 revolver was found at his feet inside a Crown Royal bag. Finally, Solomon testified that he did not kick any firearms under the seat or hide any firearms in a Crown Royal bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Reed argues that this evidence, by itself, cannot establish constructive possession, particularly in light of the countervailing evidence (1) that the .357 revolver was not in plain view but inside the Crown Royal bag; (2) that there was no evidence that Reed handled the .357 revolver or the Crown Royal bag or had placed either in the jeep; and (3) that Solomon testified that all five guns belonged to him. Reed further argues that his statement regarding a robbery, as testified to by Siddons, is unclear; that nothing links the .357 revolver to a robbery or to Reed\u2019s unspecified efforts to keep someone from getting killed; and that any inference from the statement to a conclusion that Reed had knowledge of the .357 revolver is too remote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Contrary to Reed\u2019s argument, his statement to Siddons constituted the requisite \u201ccircumstantial indicium of possession\u201d \u2014 the \u201csomething else ... besides mere joint occupancy\u201d \u2014 that, when taken together with the evidence of Reed\u2019s proximity to and furtive movements toward the .357 revolver, sufficiently proved constructive possession. He told Siddons that \u201che had just been robbed and that he was trying to keep the other guy from killing him \u2014 -or keeping the other guy from killing a person.\u201d This statement, when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, indicated that Reed had knowledge of the .357 revolver and a self-defense or defense-of-others motive for possessing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">At the same time, Solomon\u2019s testimony regarding all five firearms being near him on the rear floor board was contradicted by Siddons\u2019s and Moore\u2019s testimony regarding where they found the firearms. After hearing this conflicting testimony, the jury was free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Ramos-Garcia, </em>184 F.3d 463, 465 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201cWe determine only whether the jury\u2019s decision was rational without passing on whether ... we believe it was the correct one ... [and] therefore must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict without second-guessing the weight or credibility given the evidence by the jury.\u201d). In addition, Solomon\u2019s alleged ownership of the firearms did not prevent Reed from constructively possessing the .357 revolver during the incident at issue. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that Reed possessed a firearm beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\n<em>B. Admission of Reed\u2019s Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Reed\u2019s challenge to the admission of his statement on Siddons\u2019s redirect examination is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Insaulgarat, </em>378 F.3d 456, 464 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). It is generally true, as Reed argues, that the scope of cross examination cannot exceed the scope of direct examination, <em>id. </em>at 465 n. 12, and that this principle applies to redirect examination as well. <em>See United States v. Reliford, </em>210 F.3d 285, 305 (5th Cir.), <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom. Clinton v. United States, </em>531 U.S. 920, 121 S.Ct. 296, 148 L.Ed.2d 235 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Federal Rule of Evidence 611(a), however, provides the district court with substantial discretion to manage the examination of witnesses at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">Fed.R.Evid. 611(a). Here, the district court properly exercised its discretion under Rule 611(a) to allow the prosecutor, on redirect examination of Siddons, to inquire into the statement made by Reed that \u201che had just been robbed and that he was trying to keep the other guy from killing him \u2014 or keeping the other guy from killing a person.\u201d <em>See also Feutralle v. United States, </em>209 F.2d 159, 162 (5th Cir.1954) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>(\u201cConsiderable discretion is allowed the trial court in the manner in which the examination of witnesses shall be conducted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Indeed, Reed cites no authority to the contrary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He suggests instead that the probative value of the statement was outweighed by the prospect of confusion and prejudice. <em>See </em>4 Jack B. Weinstein <em>&amp; </em>Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 611.03[4](a) (2d ed.1997) (explaining that under Rule 611, a district court balances \u201cthe factors of prejudice, confusion, and delay against the probative value of the testimony\u201d in deciding whether to limit cross examination). But that argument, too, is unavailing. Reed\u2019s statement was highly probative because it indicated that he had knowledge of the .357 revolver and a motive for possessing it; and admission of the statement was not overly prejudicial or confusing because it provided no detailed insight or unnecessary digression into the events that occurred before the police arrived (discussion of which the district court had prohibited) beyond a basis for that knowledge and motive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court properly exercised its discretion in admitting Siddons\u2019s testimony on redirect examination regarding Reed\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\"><em>C. </em>Batson <em>Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The district court\u2019s denial of Reed\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge is reviewed for clear error and \u201cis entitled to great deference, since findings in this context largely turn on an evaluation of the credibility or demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.\u201d <em>United States v. Bentley-Smith, </em>2 F.3d 1368, 1372-73 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">\u201c[A] prosecutor violates the equal protection clause when he strikes veniremen of the defendant\u2019s race based on the assumption that they would be lenient toward the defendant because of race.\u201d <em>United States v. De La Rosa, </em>911 F.2d 985, 990 (5th Cir.1990). <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), sets forth a three-step inquiry for a defendant\u2019s challenge to a peremptory strike based on race. \u201cFirst, the defendant must make out a prima facie case \u2018by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. California, </em>545 U.S. 162, 168, 125 S.Ct. 2410, 162 L.Ed.2d 129 (2005) (quoting <em>Bat-son, </em>476 U.S. at 93-94, 106 S.Ct. 1712). \u201cSecond, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the \u2018burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion\u2019 by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 94, 106 S.Ct. 1712). \u201cThird, \u2018[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide ... whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>crimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Here, the government concedes that \u201cthe district court found that the defendants met the first prong.\u201d The burden thus shifted to the prosecutor to come forward with a race-neutral explanation for each strike. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 125 S.Ct. 2410. The Supreme Court has explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6H\">[a] neutral explanation ... means an explanation based on something other than the race of the juror. At this step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"><em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 360, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991). The government met this burden when it explained that one of the African-American venire members had indicated that \u201che didn\u2019t really want to be here because ... he was missing work\u201d and that the other had said that \u201che had a problem with the Harris County Sheriffs officers\u201d \u2014 reasons that facially had nothing to do with race.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">As a result, the issue centers on the third step \u2014 whether the district court decided if Reed had proved purposeful racial discrimination. <em>Johnson, </em>545 U.S. at 168, 125 S.Ct. 2410. On this point, Reed argues that \u201cthe record is completely barren of any reasoning or analysis by the district court, which simply declared the <em>Batson </em>challenges overruled,\u201d and that therefore the court \u201cfailfed] to adhere to its obligation ... and failed to apply the correct legal standard to determining the challenge to the ... peremptory strikes.\u201d In addition, Reed asserts that \u201cthe district court actually substituted its own (inadequate) reasons for those the Government offered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">These arguments lack merit. First, after the prosecutor offered the race-neutral justifications for the strikes, defense counsel responded, \u201c[o]kay.\u201d The court then asked if there were any other challenged strikes; and after defense counsel said, \u201c[tjhat\u2019s all,\u201d the court overruled the <em>Bat-son </em>motion. With this concession and with no additional evidence of discrimination, the district court\u2019s overruling of the <em>Bat-son </em>motion adequately conveyed its decision that Reed had failed to prove purposeful racial discrimination, and Reed has not cited any authority that requires a more specific, express indication of that decision beyond what was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Second, Reed\u2019s characterization of the district court substituting its own race-neutral reasons for those of the government is inaccurate. By the time Bolden\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>counsel, following the government\u2019s ease-in-chief, clarified for the record that \u201cthe jury panel ha[d] no African-Americans,\u201d the district court had long concluded the <em>Batson </em>analysis and overruled the motion. Reed cannot challenge that ruling now based on the district court\u2019s comments later in the proceeding. Accordingly, the district court properly denied Reed\u2019s <em>Bat-sou </em>challenge to the government\u2019s peremptory strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Finding the evidence sufficient to support Reed\u2019s conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2), and finding no <em>error </em>in the disti\u2019ict court\u2019s challenged rulings, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\">. Salvidar testified generally about the ability to lift fingerprints from firearms and about his inability to lift any identifiable prints in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-15\">. The Crown Royal bag was not produced at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">. Reed also asserts that the subsequent disappearance of the Crown Royal bag means that the jury was never provided an opportunity to consider the actual evidence against him, and that as a result, the jury could not have found that he possessed the .357 revolver beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial testimony regarding the Crown Royal bag, however, was rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>vant only to show that the .357 revolver was not in plain view, a fact that does not alter the outcome of the analysis here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">. Reed\u2019s reliance on Federal Rule of Evidence 611(b) is misplaced. Although the rule provides that \u2018\u2018[c]ross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness,\u201d it also contains the caveat that \u201d[t]he court may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 611(b). If the court has such discretion on cross examination, then it follows logically that the court has similar discretion on redirect examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\">. The government also points out that, even if it had not offered this testimony during its case-in-chief, it could have waited until its rebuttal case, called Siddons back to the stand, and used the testimony to rebut Solomon\u2019s testimony that he possessed all five firearms. Accordingly, efficiency interests support the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion to permit the challenged testimony on redirect examination as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. Although Reed asserts that the government misquoted the prospective jurors when explaining its non-discriminatory reasons, the record indicates that the prosecutor fairly paraphrased their statements. In addition, although Reed argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision in <em>Snyder v. Louisiana, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1203, 170 L.Ed.2d 175 (2008), illustrates the inadequacy of the government\u2019s proffered reasons, that case is distinguishable. In <em>Snyder, </em>the Court held that the prosecutor's proffered reasons for striking an African-American juror were pretext for racial discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 1212. The first reason, the juror's nervousness, was insufficient by itself because the record materials could not convey the juror\u2019s demeanor absent a specific finding by the trial judge; and the second reason, the juror\u2019s student-teaching obligations, failed because it appeared speculative and implausible in light of the brevity of the trial and of the prosecutor\u2019s acceptance of white jurors who disclosed conflicting obligations that appeared at least as serious. <em>Id. </em>at 1209-12. Here, however, neither of the government\u2019s proffered reasons centered on a juror's demeanor or appeared implausible in comparison with accepted jurors' responses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
