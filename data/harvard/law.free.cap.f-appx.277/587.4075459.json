He was indicted by a federal grand jury under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) for unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. After the district court denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a <em>Terry </em>stop, Young pled guilty and was sentenced to 235 months imprisonment. Young appeals (1) the denial of his motion to suppress and (2) his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b612-21\">In reviewing a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts de novo. <em>United States v. Pasquarille, </em>20 F.3d 682, 685 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-22\">Officers have the authority to stop and temporarily detain citizens \u201cif the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot,\u2019 even if the officer lacks probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The reasonableness of a <em>Terry </em>stop and search is determined by examining \u201c(1) whether there was a proper basis for the stop, which is judged by examining whether the law enforcement officials were aware of specific and articulable facts which gave rise to a reasonable suspicion; and (2) whether the degree of intrusion into the suspect\u2019s personal security was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>reasonably related in scope to the situation at hand.\u201d <em>United States v. Hardnett, </em>804 F.2d 353, 356 (6th Cir.1986). On appeal, Young argues that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him and, in the alternative, that the scope of the search was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In finding that the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop Young, the district court relied on (1) testimony from arresting officers Gray and Smith that Young made a \u201cflagging\u201d gesture toward the officers; (2) testimony from Gray that Young asked the officers if they were looking for marijuana; (3) the complex\u2019s reputation as a drug hot spot; and (4) the fact that Young walked away from the officers when he realized they were police. Young argues that the district court erred in crediting the officers\u2019 testimony and that the remaining facts are insufficient to support reasonable suspicion under <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>340 F.3d 368 (6th Cir. 2003). We reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous. Both officers indicated that they saw Young make a \u201cflagging\u201d gesture. Though Smith did not recall Young asking the officers if they were looking for marijuana, the court reasonably determined that the officers\u2019 stories were not inconsistent: Gray, who was in the passenger\u2019s seat, was closer to Young than Smith, and Smith\u2019s testimony that he did not remember hearing the statement was not inconsistent with Young\u2019s testimony. The court also noted that \u201cneither officer was impeached in such a way as to bring into question them general veracity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Viewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact in their totality, the officers \u201cwere aware of specific and articulable facts which gave rise to a reasonable suspicion\u201d that Young was engaged in criminal activity. <em>Hardnett, </em>804 F.2d at 356. Young-asked the officers if they were \u201clooking for some weed.\u201d When Gray responded \u201cyeah, sure, you got some,\u201d Young approached the vehicle. A reasonable officer could conclude that Young was intending to sell marijuana to the officers. This conclusion is supported by the fact that Young made a flagging gesture towards the car. Gray testified that this gesture had been used by individuals who attempted to sell drugs to him in the complex in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In isolation, the fact that Gray walked away from the officers or that the incident occurred in an area known for drug activity might be insufficient to support the stop. <em>Patterson, </em>340 F.3d at 371-72. When viewed with the rest of the record evidence, however, these facts support the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>263 F.3d 571, 594 (6th Cir.2001) (\u201cIt is possible for factors, although insufficient individually, to add up to a reasonable suspicion.\u201d (citation and quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">Young argues that, even if the officers had reasonable suspicion to detain him for questioning, them decision to frisk him was unreasonable in light of the fact that Young cooperated with the officers and that he was stopped near his home. This argument is unavailing. Officers who stop a person who is \u201creasonably suspected of carrying drugs\u201d are \u201centitled to rely on them experience and training in concluding that weapons are frequently used in drug transactions.\u201d <em>United States v. Heath, </em>259 F.3d 522, 530 (6th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Garcia, </em>496 F.3d 495, 505 (6th Cir.2007) (concluding that a pat-down was reasonable when \u201cthe officers reasonably suspected the [suspects] of drug trafficking\u201d). On this record, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>officers could properly frisk Young. <em>See Heath, </em>259 F.3d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The district court sentenced Young to 235 months imprisonment, at the upper end of the guidelines range. Young appeals this sentence. The thrust of Young\u2019s argument is that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was \u201cgreater than necessary to effectuate the purposes of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">We review Young\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. Uni<em>ted States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We reject Young\u2019s argument. In sentencing Young, the district court recognized that Young had \u201ca long history of gun violence, physical violence, various conflicts with the law,\u201d and a gang affiliation. The court determined that a sentence at the upper end of the guidelines range was needed to protect the public and provide just punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Young argues that his criminal history is \u201calready taken into account in the computation of the guidelines range.\u201d This argument is inapposite, as Young was given a within-guidelines sentence. In any event, Young had 28 criminal history points, over twice the number required to fall into criminal history Category VI. Many of his offenses were violent. The court acted within its discretion by sentencing Young at the upper end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Finally, Young argues that the district court relied too strongly on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor. He fails, however, \u201cto identify any relevant factor that the district court neglected to consider.\u201d <em>United States v. Crowell, </em>493 F.3d 744, 751 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
