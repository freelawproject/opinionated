We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-23\">I. Design Defect Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b709-24\">Under California product liability law, \u201c[a] manufacturer ... is liable in tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>if a defect in the ... design of its product causes injury while the product is being used in a reasonably foreseeable way.\u201d <em>Soule v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>8 Cal.4th 548, 560, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 882 P.2d 298 (1994). Under the \u201crisk/benefit\u201d version of California\u2019s design defect law \u2014 the only version under which Madera is proceeding here \u2014 a plaintiff must establish four elements to make out a prima facie case. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ. Jury Inst. (\u201cCACI\u201d) \u00a7 1204. As applied to this case, these four elements are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">(1) Taser manufactured the M26 Ta-ser/holster;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">(2) \u201cAt the time of the use,\u201d the Ta-ser/holster \u201cwas substantially the same as when it left [Taser]\u2019s possession;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">(3) The Taser/holster \u201cwas used ... or misused ... in a way that was reasonably foreseeable to\u201d Taser; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">(4) The Taser/holster\u2019s \u201cdesign was a substantial factor in causing harm to\u201d Torres.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-8\"><em>Id. </em>Madera cannot make out a prima facie case because the Taser and holster were not \u201cused\u201d when the injury occurred. Ma-dera\u2019s argument that \u201cuse\u201d is not required under the \u201crisk/benefit\u201d theory fails. California\u2019s \u201crisk/benefit\u201d jury instructions contain variants on the word \u201cuse\u201d in two places, <em>see </em>CACI \u00a7 1204 (elements (2) and (4)), forcing us to conclude that <em>a California court </em>would likely recognize that a \u201cuse\u201d requirement exists in all risk/benefit cases. <em>Goldman v. Standard Ins. Co., </em>341 F.3d 1023, 1026 (9th Cir.2003) (on issues governed by state law, federal court\u2019s role is to determine what meaning state\u2019s highest court would give to state law).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">The verb \u201cuse\u201d is defined as \u201c1. To bring or put into service or action.... 2. To put to some purpose: avail oneself of....\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s II New Riverside University Dictionary </em>1271 (1994). Although California courts have found that storage of an item can constitute \u201cuse,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Nelson v. Superior Court, </em>144 Cal.App.4th 689, 698, 50 Cal.Rptr.3d 684 (2006), it has only applied such a broad definition of use where the product itself immediately and directly caused the harm while in storage. <em>Id. </em>If we were to accept Madera\u2019s broad definition of use, it would follow that the M26 Taser and its holster would be in \u201cuse\u201d even if Officer Noriega had left them behind in her locker when she reached down and drew her Glock. We cannot accept that the California courts would sanction such a broad definition of use, and therefore hold that Madera cannot make out a prima facie design defect claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">II. Negligent Design Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">Summary judgment was also appropriate as to Madera\u2019s negligent design claims. A product is not negligently designed so long as \u201cthe manufacturer took reasonable precautions in an attempt to design a safe product or otherwise acted as a reasonably prudent manufacturer would have under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Barker v. Lull Engineering, Co., </em>20 Cal.3d 413, 434, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443 (1978), <em>accord Crawford v. Weather Shield Mfg., Inc., </em>136 Cal.App.4th 304, 38 Cal.Rptr.3d 787, 798, <em>granting pet\u2019n for review on unrelated issue, </em>44 Cal.Rptr.3d 632, 136 P.3d 168 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Here, the only evidence regarding Ta-ser\u2019s decision-making process on the M26\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>design is that it developed a variety of different prototypes for the M26, presented these prototypes at \u201cone of the largest training conferences of police ... officers in the country,\u201d determined that the handgun-shaped design \u201cwas significantly better in terms of accuracy\u201d than the other prototypes, and received \u201coverwhelming feedback\u201d from training officers that they preferred the handgun-shaped design to the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Absent any contradictory evidence\u2014 which Madera has not produced \u2014 reasonable jurors would have no choice but to conclude that Taser exercised reasonable care in choosing the gun-shaped design for its M26. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 </em>U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Nissan Fire &amp; Marine v. Fritz Companies, </em>210 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court correctly granted summary judgment on Madera\u2019s negligent design claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">As to Madera\u2019s additional claim that Taser negligently designed its M26 <em>holster, </em>the appropriate standard of care for a weapon manufacturer is beyond the \u201ccommon knowledge of [laypersons]\u201d and, thus, it was incumbent upon Madera to present at least <em>some </em>expert testimony regarding this customary standard of care. <em>See Miller v. L.A. County Flood Control Dish, </em>8 Cal.3d 689, 700, 702, 106 Cal.Rptr. 1, 505 P.2d 193 (1973) (requiring expert testimony in negligence case to establish how a \u201creasonably prudent builder\u201d would have acted in a particular situation). Madera has failed to do so. Moreover, even if <em>expert </em>testimony were not required to establish this element, Madera has produced no <em>other </em>evidence from which a jury could deduce the appropriate standard of care to allow it to compare Taser\u2019s actions with this industry standard. Accordingly, summary judgment was proper as to Plaintiffs\u2019 negligently designed holster claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">III. Failure to Warn</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Under California law, a manufacturer can be held strictly liable for failing to warn a product\u2019s foreseeable user about that product\u2019s risks, even if those risks come from a foreseeable <em>mis </em>use of the product. <em>Huynh v. Ingersoll-Rand, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 825, 833, 20 Cal.Rptr.2d 296 (1993). However, \u201cliability [for failure to warn] does not attach if the dangerous propensity is either obvious <em>or known to the injured person </em>at the time he uses the product.\u201d <em>Burke v. Almaden Vineyards, Inc., </em>86 Cal.App.3d 768, 772, 150 Cal.Rptr. 419 (1978) (emphasis added). The district court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that the danger of weapon confusion was known to Officer Noriega because her previous mis-draw incident was \u201cexactly the type of event ... Plaintiffs argue they should have been warned about by Defendant, i.e., an alleged danger or risk of weapons confusion between the M26 and a firearm\u201d \u2014 is correct, as is the district court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the Madera Police Department (\u201cMPD\u201d) had \u201cactual awareness\u201d of this danger because Officer Noriega reported the incident to her supervisor, Sgt. Lawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Madera\u2019s counterargument \u2014 that the danger of <em>actually shooting someone </em>with a gun rather than an M26 was not known to Officer Noriega or the MPD because Officer Noriega had never <em>actually shot someone </em>by mistake- \u2014 is unpersuasive. The undisputed evidence is that Officer Noriega was concerned enough about mis-drawing her Glock the first time that she reported the incident to two colleagues (one of whom was a supervisor) and continued practicing drawing the proper weapon \u201call the time\u201d so as to avoid making the same mistake again. The MPD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>also was in the process of devising a training program to help officers avoid this confusion. From these facts, no reasonable juror could conclude anything other than that Officer Noriega and the MPD appreciated the danger attendant to mistaking a firearm for an M26, <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505, and that Taser\u2019s \u201cduty to warn\u201d was absolved by this actual knowledge, <em>Burke, </em>86 Cal. App.3d at 772,150 Cal.Rptr. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Accordingly, summary judgment was properly granted on Madera\u2019s two failure to warn claims (M26 and holster), as neither the M26 nor the Taser-made holster was defective for failing to contain a warning advising Madera of the dangers of confusing a strong-side holstered M26 with a lethal firearm \u2014 a danger it already knew existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">IV. Negligent Warning</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Madera\u2019s negligent warning claims fail for the same reason: just as in the strict liability context, a manufacturer has no duty to warn in the negligence context if the complained-of danger is either obvious or known to the user. <em>See Krawitz v. Rusch, </em>209 Cal.App.3d 957, 965-66, 257 Cal.Rptr. 610 (1989). Because the danger of weapon confusion was known to both Officer Noriega and the MPD, no duty to warn could have been negligently breached by Taser, and the district court properly granted summary judgment for Taser on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">V. Training-Related Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Madera also brings three training-related claims against Taser: (1) strict liability for defective training; (2) strict liability for defectively designed training materials; and (3) negligent training. The district court rejected all three, concluding respectively that: (1) \u201c[tjraining is a serviced not a product,] and [thus] is not subject to strict products liability theories\u201d (citing <em>Jimenez v. Superior Court, </em>29 Cal.4th 473, 479, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 58 P.3d 450 (2002)); (2) Taser\u2019s training materials were \u201cincident to\u201d the service of training and thus were not subject to strict products liability theories (citing <em>Ferrari v. Grand Canyon Dories, </em>32 Cal.App.4th 248, 259, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 65 (1995)); and (3) Taser was not, itself, negligent in training Officer Noriega, as Taser\u2019s connection to her training was indirect \u2014 she was trained by MPD officers who were, in turn, trained by Lewis, who worked for ALD De Nio Enterprises (\u201cALD\u201d), a Taser-approved Law Enforcement Product Distributor for California, not <em>Taser.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Again, however, the contention central to all permutations of Madera\u2019s training-related claims is that Taser improperly failed to alert the MPD (and its officer users) that holstering the M26 and a firearm on the same side of an officer\u2019s body creates a risk that an officer will draw one weapon when she means to draw the other. If there was nothing improper about failing to warn Madera of this danger (or, put another way, if failing to warn Madera could not have in any way \u201ccaused\u201d the injury because Madera knew about this danger already), then Taser cannot be liable under <em>any </em>of the three proposed theories. <em>See Burke, </em>86 Cal.App.3d at 772, 150 Cal.Rptr. 419, and <em>Krawitz, </em>209 Cal. App.3d at 965-66, 257 Cal.Rptr. 610. As explained above, both Officer Noriega and the MPD were aware of the potential for weapon confusion <em>before </em>the Torres shooting and, thus, Taser\u2019s failure to alert Ma-dera about this danger via its training materials or the indirect training it may have provided through ALD\u2019s Lewis does not give rise to an independent cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Madera\u2019s three training-related claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>VI. Breach of Warranties</p>\n<p id=\"AEL\">Madera also claims that Taser breached express and implied warranties when the M26 and holster \u201cfailed to perform in a safe manner.\u201d Neither Madera\u2019s Complaint nor its subsequent filings explain exactly what promises it believes Taser made (either explicitly or implicitly) when the MPD purchased its M26s. Without any elaboration as to exactly which warranties are at issue, it is impossible to determine whether Taser breached these unspecified \u201cwarranties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Moreover, the California Supreme Court has recently emphasized that \u201c[t]he law of contractual warranty governs <em>damage to the product itself\u201d </em>that results from a product defect, <em>Jimenez, </em>29 Cal.4th at 483, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 58 P.3d 450 (emphasis added); it does not govern damage to other products <em>or injuries to individuals </em>that result from that same product defect, <em>id; see also Seely v. White Motor Co., </em>63 Cal.2d 9, 15, 45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d 145 (1965) (\u201c[T]he warranty theory [is] not suited to the field of liability for personal injuries.\u201d). Instead, when a product defect causes \u201cphysical harm to [a] person, ... [a] plaintiff [may] recover [via] <em>strict products liability.\u201d Jimenez, </em>29 Cal.4th at 482-83, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 58 P.3d 450 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Here, Madera has not even <em>alleged </em>(much less put forth any evidence) that the M26 or its holster were damaged in any way during the Torres incident; Madera seeks damages <em>only </em>to compensate it for the personal injury Torres sustained at the hands of Officer Noriega. Without any allegation that the M26 or the holster \u201cdefect\u201d led to any damage to those products themselves, Madera cannot prevail on its breach of warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b709-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\">. The only California case Madera cites as supporting its contention that \"use\u201d is not required is <em>Zentz v. Coca Cola Bottling Co., </em>39 Cal.2d 436, 247 P.2d 344 (1952), a case in which Coca Cola was found liable when a bottle of Coke exploded, even though nobody had touched it. Even in <em>Zentz, </em>however, it was the defendant's product \u2014 a Coca-Cola bottle \u2014 that caused the alleged harm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
