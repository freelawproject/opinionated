In addition to a prison term of 188 months and other sanctions, Abuhouran was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $6,917,246.10. This Court affirmed. <em>See United States v. Abuhouran, </em>161 F.3d 206 (3d Cir.1998). His repeated efforts to obtain post-conviction relief have been unsuccessful. Among those efforts was a motion, filed in November 2006, seeking-termination of the restitution order pursuant to \u201cthe former [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3579(f)[ (2) ], and the later [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3663(f)(2).\u201d By order entered December 18, 2007, the District Court denied the motion, noting that those statutory provisions were not in effect at the time Abuhouran was sentenced. Abuhouran appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-23\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because this dispute is purely a matter of statutory interpretation, we review the District Court\u2019s ruling <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>novo. See Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 567 (3d Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Rostoff, </em>164 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Relying on <em>United States v. Holland, </em>380 F.Supp.2d. 1264 (N.D.Ala.2005), Abu-houran argues that his restitution order has \u201cexpired.\u201d In <em>Holland, </em>the defendant\u2019s order of restitution was entered pursuant to the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (\u201cVWPA\u201d), which provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">The end of such period [of restitution payments], or the last of such installments shall not be later than\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">(A) the end of the period of probation, if probation is ordered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">(B) five years after the end of imprisonment imposed, if the court does not order probation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">(C) five years after the date of sentencing in any other case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(f)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <em>Holland </em>court held that this provision \u201cclearly provides a five-year time limit on all restitution obligations.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>380 F.Supp.2d at 1269. Therefore, even though the defendant\u2019s 1995 restitution order purported to create a continuing payment obligation during his 210 month sentence, the <em>Holland </em>court ordered the Bureau of Prisons to stop collecting restitution payments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1269-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Congress eliminated \u00a7 3663(f) with the passage of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d) in 1996. The MVRA became \u201ceffective for sentencing proceedings in cases in which the defendant is convicted on or after the date of enactment of this Act,\u201d April 24, 1996. <em>See United States v. Cottman, </em>142 F.3d 160, 168 n. 10 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, \u00a7 211). Because Abuhouran was convicted in September 1996, the District Court held that former \u00a7 3663(f) did not apply to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">Importantly, however, this conclusion overlooks <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>162 F.3d 87 (3d Cir.1998), where we held that applying the MVRA to a defendant whose offenses pre-dated the Act violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See id. </em>at 91. Abuhouran committed his crimes pri- or to the MVRA\u2019s enactment. Therefore, the VWPA applied to the imposition of his restitution order. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>193 F.3d 200, 205 (3d Cir.1999). Under the VWPA, sentencing judges were permitted to order a defendant to pay restitution immediately, within a specified period, or in installments. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(f)(1), (3). As noted above, however, the statute provided that the payment period could not extend beyond the term of probation where no term of imprisonment is imposed, \u00a7 3663(f)(2)(A), beyond five years after the end of any term of imprisonment imposed, \u00a7 3663(f)(2)(B), or beyond five years after the date of sentencing in any other case, \u00a7 3663(f)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Abuhouran asserts that \u00a7 3663(f)(2)(C) effectively voided the restitution order five years after he was sentenced.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Notably, however, that provision applies only where the defendant is sentenced to neither probation nor imprisonment. Defendants like Abuhouran, who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, are subject to \u00a7 3663(f)(2)(B). That provision prohibits the sentencing court from establishing a period or setting a schedule of installments more than five years after the \u201cend of the term of imprisonment.\u201d Because Abu-houran is currently serving his term of imprisonment, he is within the period established by \u00a7 3663(f)(2)(B), and any payment schedule set by the sentencing court is still applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We conclude that no substantial issue is presented on appeal. Therefore, we will grant the Appellee\u2019s motion for summary action and will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-16\">. The notice of appeal sought generally to appeal the order of December 18, 2007, which disposed of at least nine other motions filed by appellant. Abuhouran has since requested, however, that the appeal be narrowed to only \u201cthe issue of the statute of limitation on the collectibility of restitution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3579(f)(2)(C).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-11\">. Section \u00a7 3579(f) of Title 18, which Abu-houran cited in his November 2006 motion, is the predecessor to \u00a7 3663(f). The provision was renumbered without substantive change in 1984. <em>See Hughey v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 411, 412-13 &amp; n. 1, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-12\">. Of course, <em>Holland </em>is not binding upon this Court. Perhaps more importantly, though, <em>Holland </em>involved a defendant who was \"left ... holding the bag\u201d while his co-defendant, who was jointly responsible for the restitution payment, \"escaped\u201d his obligation. <em>Holland, </em>380 F.Supp.2d at 1269. The <em>Holland </em>court found those circumstances \u201coutrageous\u201d and \"a travesty that calls for correction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same cannot be said of Abuhouran's situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">. If Abuhouran was ordered to pay restitution immediately, something that is not clear from the record, he arguably could not invoke the time limitations in \u00a7 3663(f)(2). <em>See FDIC v. Dover, </em>453 F.3d 710, 713-15 (6th Cir.2006) (holding that time limits contained in \u00a7 3663(f)(2) did not apply because the sentencing court had ordered the restitution to be paid immediately); <em>United States v. House, </em>808 F.2d 508, 511 (7th Cir.1986) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-22\">If those limitations apply to an order requiring immediate payment, however, Abu-houran is still required to pay the restitution under \u00a7 3663(f)(2)(B), as discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
