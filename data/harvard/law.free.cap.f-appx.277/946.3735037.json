Cummings (\u201cLawrence\u201d), proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders determining that his obligations under a state court divorce decree are partially dischargeable and partially non-dischargeable, and denying recusal of the bankruptcy judge. On appeal, Lawrence argues that (1) the bankruptcy court erred in finding that it was barred by the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine from independently redetermining what portion, if any, of the underlying state divorce court judgment was intended to be in the nature of \u201csupport\u201d within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5); and (2) the bankruptcy judge abused his discretion in denying Lawrence\u2019s motion for recusal. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error and AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">Lawrence and Susan Cummings (\u201cSusan\u201d) were divorced in 1996. The state divorce court awarded Susan $6,300,000 as an \u201cequitable distribution,\u201d payable in three annual lump sum installments of $2,100,000 each, but did not indicate what portion of the award, if any, was intended as support. <em>Cummings v. Cummings, </em>244 F.3d 1263, 1264-65 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(\u201cCummings </em>7\u201d). Shortly before the first installment was due, Lawrence filed a bankruptcy petition seeking to discharge his obligation to Susan under the divorce decree. The bankruptcy court initially found that the entire award was dischargeable as a property settlement, but we vacated that order discharging the award on appeal. <em>Cummings I, </em>at 1267. In particular, we noted that the state divorce court had concurrent jurisdiction with the bankruptcy court to determine whether the divorce obligation was \u201cin the nature of support\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(5), and we ruled that the bankruptcy court should await the divorce court\u2019s clarification of its intent regarding the amount of support provided in its award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">On remand, however, the bankruptcy court entered an order finding that it had exclusive jurisdiction over the case and enjoining Susan from seeking a clarification order from the divorce court. Rl-26 at 3. Susan petitioned us for a writ of mandamus, which we granted, directing the bankruptcy court (1) to vacate its \u201c[exclusive ^jurisdiction order,\u201d (2) not to hinder Susan \u201cfrom obtaining a clarification from the state divorce court as to what portion, if any, of the equitable distribution was intended as support,\u201d and (3) \u201cnot to schedule further proceedings on the dischargeability issue until [Susan] had had a reasonable opportunity to obtain clarification from the [divorce] court\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. The divorce court then entered an order clarifying that it intended the first two lump sum payments to serve as support, but not the third payment. Rl-26 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>4. Lawrence appealed the merits of that order, and the state appellate court affirmed without opinion the divorce court\u2019s order. <em>Cummings v. Cummings, </em>835 So.2d 1143 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App.2002) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Thereafter, based on the divorce court\u2019s clarification order, the bankruptcy court found that, the first two payments were nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(5), while the third payment was dischargeable. The bankruptcy court refused to consider Lawrence\u2019s attempt to challenge the divorce court\u2019s finding that the first two payments were intended to be in the nature of support, finding that the issue was barred by the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine. Accordion Folder 1-11-4 at 8. Lawrence appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling, and the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Meanwhile, Lawrence also had unsuccessfully moved to recuse the bankruptcy judge for bias, based on two specific statements. The first statement appeared within a footnote of an order denying Susan\u2019s emergency motion for financial support; the bankruptcy judge compared Lawrence\u2019s comfortable lifestyle, based on his apparent ability to pay for the services of a prestigious South Florida law firm, to Susan\u2019s \u201cdeplorable\u201d living conditions and <em>pro se </em>status. Rl-26 at 4-5. The second statement was made during a 2001 hearing in Susan\u2019s separate bankruptcy proceedings upon the confirmation of Susan\u2019s own bankruptcy reorganization plan; the bankruptcy judge expressed \u201chope that Ms. Cummings is successful in her pursuit as far as the recovery of moneys owed to her. I sincerely mean that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The bankruptcy court denied the motion for recusal, and the district court held that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion because the two challenged comments (1) did not stem from an extrajudicial source, (2) were \u201conly two fairly innocuous statements\u201d made over the course of approximately ten years of legal proceedings, and (3) would not lead \u201cany reasonably objective lay person\u201d to doubt the bankruptcy judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. Lawrence, who had been represented by counsel throughout the bankruptcy and district court proceedings, filed a timely appeal <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">First, Lawrence argues that, on remand following <em>Cummings I, </em>neither the bankruptcy court nor the divorce court followed our \u201cclear guidelines\u201d to determine the original intent of the divorce court as to what portion of the divorce judgment should function as support. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. Lawrence also asserts that the first two lump sum installments total more than $4,000,000, well over the $8,000 per month that the divorce court found that Susan needed to maintain her accustomed standard of living. In light of that discrepancy, Lawrence maintains that the divorce court\u2019s clarification that the first two of the three lump sum payments were intended as support was arbitrary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In his reply brief, Lawrence explains that he is not trying to \u201cre-litigate\u201d any issue, but rather, he wants \u201ca court\u201d to consider for the first time his evidence that the divorce court\u2019s 2002 clarification order did not accurately reflect that court\u2019s original intent in its 1996 divorce decree. Reply Br. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">We have \u201cjurisdiction over all final orders of a district court exercising appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>jurisdiction over bankruptcy court orders.\u201d <em>In re Pugh, </em>158 F.3d 530, 532 (11th Cir.1998), (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)). \u201cIn exercising such jurisdiction, we review conclusions of law made by the district and bankruptcy courts <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>Claim preclusion applies to an order or judgment when four conditions .-\u00e1re met: (1) \u201cthe prior judgment must be valid in that it was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction and in accordance with the requirements of due process\u201d; (2) \u201cthe judgment must be final and on the merits\u201d; (3) \u201cthere must be identity of both parties or their privies\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe later proceeding must involve the same cause of action as involved in the earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>In re Justice Oaks II, Ltd., </em>898 F.2d 1544, 1550 (11th Cir.1990). By contrast, under the closely related doctrine of the \u201claw of the case,\u201d \u201cwhen a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues of subsequent stages of the same case.\u201d <em>Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 815-16, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 2177, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988) (citation omitted). We have explained the difference between claim preclusion and law of the case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD0\">[wjhile the law of the case does not bar litigation of issues \u2018which might have been decided but were not[.]\u2019 [I]t does require a court to follow what has been decided explicitly, as well as by necessary <em>implication, </em>in an earlier proceeding. The distinction between law of the case and claim preclusion is that the former bars relitigation of legal rules while the latter bars relitigation of claims (i.e., legal rules applied to the facts of the case). In addition, law of the case bars only those legal issues that were actually, or by necessary implication, decided in the former proceeding, while claim preclusion bars relitigation not only of claims raised but also claims that could have been raised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\"><em>Justice Oaks II, </em>898 F.2d at 1549 n. 3 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Here, the bankruptcy court correctly found that, in light of the divorce court\u2019s clarification order, it was precluded by the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine from re-litigating the issue of to what extent the divorce court intended its award to constitute support. In <em>Cummings I, </em>we expressly acknowledged the state court\u2019s authority and concurrent jurisdiction to determine whether an obligation is in the nature of support within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(5). <em>Cummings I, </em>244 F.3d at 1267. We stressed that bankruptcy courts should avoid \u201cincursions into family law matters out of consideration of court economy, judicial restraint, and our deference to our state court brethren and their established expertise in such matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the bankruptcy court on remand thereafter sought to assert exclusive jurisdiction over the case and enjoin Susan from seeking the divorce court\u2019s clarification, we granted mandamus relief and expressly directed the bankruptcy court to vacate its \u201c[ejxclu-sive ^jurisdiction order\u201d and abate further proceedings on the dischargeability issue until Susan had the opportunity to obtain such clarification. R1-26 at 3-4. As such, our two decisions established the rule that the bankruptcy court\u2019s review was limited only to determining the intent of the divorce court when it made the award, not second guessing the amount of the award that should have been labeled as support. Thus, the bankruptcy court properly disregarded Lawrence\u2019s attempt to present additional evidence to show that the award amount was excessive when compared to Susan\u2019s monthly support needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">As we noted in <em>Cummings I, </em>the divorce court was a court <em>of competent </em>jurisdiction to consider the support issue, and neither party disputes that the divorce court\u2019s decision met the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>ments of due process. The divorce court\u2019s clarification order resolved the support issue on the merits, Lawrence appealed that order, and the state appellate court affirmed. The parties were identical in both proceedings. Thus, once the divorce court resolved the issue of its intent, Lawrence was precluded from relitigating that claim before the bankruptcy court. <em>See Justice Oaks II, </em>898 F.2d at 1550. At that point, the only thing left for the bankruptcy court to do was to take the final analytical step and apply the divorce court\u2019s factual clarification to the dischargeability context under \u00a7 523(a)(5). Notably, our decision in <em>Cummings I </em>also spoke to that issue as well, clarifying that \u201c[t]o the extent the [divorce] court intended a portion of the obligation to function as support, that debt is nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(5).\u201d <em>Cummings I, </em>244 F.3d at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">The bankruptcy court correctly found that it was barred by the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine from independently determining to what extent the divorce court\u2019s judgment was intended to be in the nature of support within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(5). Accordingly, the bankruptcy court properly found that the first two lump sum payments were not dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(5) based on the divorce court\u2019s clarification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Second, Lawrence contends that the bankruptcy judge abused his discretion in failing to recuse himself from the adversary proceeding. In support of his motion, Lawrence argues that the bankruptcy judge\u2019s comment regarding Lawrence\u2019s ability to pay for the services of a prestigious South Florida law firm while Susan and the Cummings\u2019s children \u201csuffer[ed] from deplorable living conditions\u201d was directly refuted by overwhelming evidence in the bankruptcy case establishing his own \u201cdire financial condition,\u201d and thus must have been developed from an extrajudicial source of information. Rl-26 at 4-5. In addition, Lawrence points to the bankruptcy judge\u2019s on-the-record statement that he \u201chope[d] that Ms. Cummings is successful in her pursuit as far as the recovery of moneys owed to her,\u201d which Lawrence labels as \u201ccheerleading\u201d and evidence of an \u201cobvious bias.\u201d Rl-24 at 13-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">We review the denial of a motion for recusal for abuse of discretion. <em>Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.2000). The proper standard under \u00a7 455(a) is \u201cwhether an objective, fully informed lay observer would entertain significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A judge must be recused if the judge is personally biased or prejudiced against a party or in favor of an adverse party, or whenever the judge\u2019s \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144, 455(a). \u201cThe exception to this rule is when a judge\u2019s remarks in a judicial context demonstrate such pervasive bias and prejudice that it constitutes bias against a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">In this case, the bankruptcy judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Lawrence\u2019s motion for recusal. The only grounds cited in support of the motion were two isolated comments made over the course of ten years of protracted litigation. Despite Lawrence\u2019s suggestion to the contrary, neither of the two challenged comments was based on information derived from an extra-judicial source. First, the bankruptcy judge\u2019s juxtaposition of Lawrence\u2019s apparent ability to afford the services of a prestigious law firm to Susan\u2019s \u201cdeplorable\u201d living conditions and <em>pro se </em>status in that court was a comment based on the judge\u2019s firsthand knowledge of the bankruptcy pleadings themselves. Rl-26 at 5. That comment directly related to an issue then before the court, namely, Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>san\u2019s asserted entitlement to emergency-financial support, a request that the court coincidentally denied. Lawrence\u2019s contention that the judge necessarily must have consulted some unidentified extra-judicial source of information, while disregarding the record evidence of Lawrence\u2019s own \u201cdire financial condition,\u201d is unsupported and baseless. Rl-24 at 14. Second, the bankruptcy judge\u2019s comment regarding his hope that Susan would be successful in collecting money owed to her also stemmed solely from a judicial source; it occurred on the occasion of the confirmation of her own bankruptcy reorganization plan. Contrary to Lawrence\u2019s claim that the judge was cheerleading Susan\u2019s attempts to collect the equitable distribution from Lawrence, we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy judge reasonably could have made this statement as an innocuous expression of hope in her ability to one day satisfy her individual debts to her own creditors. <em>See </em>Rl-26 at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">In light of the extensive history of this case, we conclude that the two isolated comments Lawrence relies upon do not evince pervasive bias and prejudice against Lawrence, and we determine that a reasonable, fully informed objective observer would not entertain any significant doubt about the bankruptcy judge\u2019s impartiality in the proceedings. <em>See Christo, </em>223 F.3d at 1333. Accordingly, we decide that the bankruptcy judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Lawrence\u2019s motion for re-cusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">Lawrence appeals the district court\u2019s af-firmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders determining that his obligations under a state court divorce decree are partially dischargeable and partially non-discharge-able, and denying his motion for recusal of the bankruptcy judge. Lawrence argues that (1) the bankruptcy court erred in finding that it was barred by the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine from independently redetermining what portion of the underlying state divorce court judgment was intended to be \u201cin the nature of support,\u201d as opposed to a property settlement; and (2) the bankruptcy judge abused his discretion in denying Lawrence\u2019s motion for recusal. The bankruptcy court correctly held that it was bound by the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine from reexamining what portion of the divorce court\u2019s award was in the nature of support, and the bankruptcy judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Lawrence\u2019s motion for recusal because the two challenged comments were isolated, did not arise from an extra-judicial source, and would not lead a reasonable observer to question the judge\u2019s impartiality. The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">. Lawrence also incorporates by reference his reply brief to the district court, in which he argued that the bankruptcy court was not prohibited from independently evaluating what portion of the divorce judgment was in the nature of support because the divorce court never addressed the issue in the context of federal bankruptcy law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
