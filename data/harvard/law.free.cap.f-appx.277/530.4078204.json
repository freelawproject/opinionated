Barzilay, Judge of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b555-9\">SUTTON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">After Degussa Admixtures voluntarily dismissed with prejudice its state-law action against Douglas Burnett and Sika Corporation, the district court granted Burnett and Sika\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Because the district court neither plainly erred in determining that Michigan law governs the motion nor abused its discretion in granting the motion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">In 1986, Burnett started working for Degussa, a manufacturer of admixtures for concrete, and eventually became a salesman for the company responsible for western Michigan. During his tenure with De-gussa, Burnett signed a confidentiality agreement but not a noncompete agreement. In August 2005, Burnett left De-gussa and landed a job as a salesman covering all of Michigan for Sika Corporation, one of Degussa\u2019s competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">In his first couple months with Sika, Burnett persuaded several former customers to switch to Sika products. Convinced that Burnett could not \u201cturn over those customers so quickly ... without relying on [confidential] information\u201d he had acquired at his former employer, JA 587, Degussa filed a complaint against Burnett and Sika in federal court on diversity grounds. In particular, Degussa alleged that Burnett breached his confidentiality agreement with Degussa, that Sika induced that breach and that Burnett and Sika violated the Michigan Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 445.1901 <em>et seq. </em>Degussa sought a temporary restraining order, damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-17\">The district court denied Degussa\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order, reasoning that Degussa \u201cfailed to allege with any specificity the confidential information that Burnett possesses\u201d and that \u201cgeneralized allegations of impropriety do not demonstrate that, absent an injunction, [Degussa] will suffer irreparable harm.\u201d JA 129-30. After considerable discovery, Degussa withdrew its request for a preliminary injunction and made a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d to dismiss its complaint without prejudice. JA 297. Burnett and Sika responded by filing a motion for costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The court granted Degus-sa\u2019s motion contingent on the company paying Burnett and Sika their costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>fees. Degussa then withdrew its previous motion to dismiss and filed a motion to dismiss its complaint <em>with </em>prejudice, contending that such a dismissal \u201cwill protect Defendants against a new action based upon the dismissed claims and that it therefore would not be appropriate to further award Defendants fees or costs.\u201d JA 374. Burnett and Sika again sought fees. The district court granted Degussa\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, denied Burnett and Sika\u2019s motion for costs and fees under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11 and 41(a) and granted Burnett and Sika\u2019s motion for fees (totaling roughly $114,000) under the Michigan Uniform Trade Secrets Act. Degussa challenges the attorney\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">This case initially presents a choice of law question: Does federal or state law govern? Degussa contends that the fee provision in the Michigan Uniform Trade Secrets Act amounts to a procedural, not a substantive, rule under <em>Erie Railroad. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), and thus does not apply. The district court held that Degussa waived this argument by failing to raise it in a timely manner and that, in the alternative, the argument was without merit. Degussa challenges only the latter determination in its primary appellate brief and asks us to review that determination for plain error. Leaving to the side whether even a plain error would excuse Degussa\u2019s waiver, <em>cf. United, States v. Rogan, </em>517 F.3d 449, 454 (7th Cir.2008) (\u201c[Tjhere is no general doctrine of plain-error review in civil cases.\u201d), Degussa has not shown that the district court\u2019s decision to apply Michigan law was \u201cobvious[ly] or clear[ly]\u201d wrong, <em>see United, States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 386 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc) (holding, in the criminal context, that plain error requires, at a minimum, a showing of error that \u201cwas obvious or clear\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">While Degussa captures the <em>Erie </em>dichotomy correctly \u2014 it indeed requires a federal court sitting in diversity to apply state substantive law and federal procedural law, <em>see Erie R.R., </em>304 U.S. at 78, 58 S.Ct. 817 \u2014 the district court did not clearly err in invoking the Act here. \u201c[I]n an ordinary diversity case where the state law does not run counter to a valid federal statute or rule of court, and usually it will not, state law denying the right to attorney\u2019s fees or giving a right thereto, which reflects a substantial policy of the state, should be followed.\u201d <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 259 n. 31, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration in original). Federal courts sitting in diversity thus customarily will apply state \u201cfee-shifting rules that embody a substantive policy, such as a statute which permits a prevailing party in certain classes of litigation to recover fees.\u201d <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 52, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Michigan follows the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d meaning that \u201cattorney fees generally are not recoverable from the losing party as costs in the absence of an exception set forth in a statute or court rule expressly authorizing such an award.\u201d <em>McAuley v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>457 Mich. 513, 578 N.W.2d 282, 285 (1998). The Michigan Uniform Trade Secrets Act provides an exception: \u201cIf a claim of misappropriation is made in bad faith, a motion to terminate an injunction is made or resisted in bad faith, or willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 445.1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>This provision amounts to a substantive rule under <em>E\u00f1e, </em>requiring federal courts to apply it in a diversity case. As a state law that \u201cpermits a prevailing party in [a] certain class[ ] of litigation to recover fees,\u201d the attorney-fee provision \u201cembodies] a substantive policy\u201d of the State, <em>Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 52, 111 S.Ct. 2123\u2014 a policy that deters frivolous trade-secret actions that threaten \u201cfree and open competition in the manufacture and sale of unpatented goods\u201d or that discourage \u201cworkers from pursuing their livelihoods when they leave their current positions,\u201d <em>PepsiCo, Inc. v. Redmond, </em>54 F.3d 1262, 1268 (7th Cir.1995) (\u201c[T]rade secret law does not provide a reserve clause for solicitous employers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Nor has Degussa pointed to any federal statute or rule that conflicts with the policies underlying the Act\u2019s attorney-fee provision. As the Ninth Circuit recently concluded in addressing an identical provision of California law, the Act\u2019s attorney-fee provision is substantive because it \u201capplies only in cases where a trade secret misappropriation claim was filed,\u201d it \u201cdoes not supplant or collide directly with any Federal Rule, and it embodies a substantive state policy against the frivolous filing of trade secret claims.\u201d CRST <em>Van Expedited, Inc. v. Werner Enters., Inc., </em>479 F.3d 1099, 1111 (9th Cir.2007) (citation omitted); <em>cf. </em>10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2669 (\u201cIn these circumstances the federal court should permit an award of a fee on the theory that it is part of the substantive right in issue. A contrary conclusion ... would encourage [forum shopping].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\"><em>First Bank of Marietta v. Hartford Underwriters Insurance Co., </em>307 F.3d 501 (6th Cir.2002), is consistent with this decision. In that case, we concluded that an Ohio provision allowing for attorney\u2019s fees was \u201cprocedural in nature,\u201d so that Rule 11, rather than Ohio law, governed \u201csanctions for frivolous conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529. Yet, unlike the provision in today\u2019s case, that provision was \u201ca general statute that allows for the award of attorneys fees based upon the conduct of the parties and the attorneys in filing and litigating the claim, rather than for success on the underlying merits of the claim.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Nielson v. Bob Schmidt Homes, Inc., </em>69 Ohio App.3d 395, 590 N.E.2d 1291, 1293 (1990) (stating that Ohio\u2019s \u201cfrivolous conduct statute\u201d \u2014 the statute at issue in <em>First Bank of Marietta </em>\u2014 \u201capplies to all civil actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In contrast, the Act is not a \u201cgeneral\u201d sanctions statute that, like Rule 11 and the Ohio statute at issue in <em>First Bank of Marietta, </em>applies to all civil actions and that is intended to police conduct in litigation; it is a specific statute that applies only to trade-secret claims and that is intended to encourage innovation, competition and job mobility in the marketplace. And, unlike sanctions under the statute in <em>First Bank of Marietta, </em>an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Act hinges largely on a joai'tys success on the underlying merits of the claim; the court may award fees only to the prevailing party. <em>Cf. Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 53, 111 S.Ct. 2123 (\u201cRule 11 sanctions do not constitute the kind of fee shifting at issue in <em>Alyeska </em>[because they] are not tied to the outcome of litigation.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration in original); <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Latin Am. Imports, S.A., </em>127 Fed.Appx. 157, 159-60 (6th Cir.2005) (citing <em>First Bank of Marietta </em>for the proposition that \u201cwhen the issue of whether to award attorneys\u2019 fees depends on the underlying substantive claim, the issue is substantive in nature\u201d). The district court thus did not clearly err in determining that the Act is substantive for <em>Erie </em>purposes. <em>See Weiss v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>283 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir.2002) (reversing a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s judgment awarding attorney\u2019s fees\u201d because the \u201ccourt, sitting in diversity, was bound to apply the substantive law of Ohio\u201d and because \u201cOhio law does not permit a court to award attorney\u2019s fees [in a particular type of action] except with explicit statutory authorization and to the prevailing party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The next question is whether the district court correctly applied the Act in imposing fees on Degussa for bad faith in bringing this trade-secrets claim. We review a district court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion, while applying clear-error review to any factual findings underlying that decision. <em>See Bergman v. United States, </em>844 F.2d 353, 357 (6th Cir. 1988); <em>see also Geier v. Sundquist, </em>372 F.3d 784, 789-90 (6th Cir.2004). The clearly erroneous standard applies to a \u201cfinding [of] bad faith.\u201d <em>Bergman, </em>844 F.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The Act imposes two requirements on a party seeking attorney\u2019s fees: (1) that the party is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d; and (2) that the opposing party\u2019s \u201cclaim of misappropriation is made in bad faith.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 445.1905. All agree that Burnett and Sika were prevailing parties. So the issue is whether the court erred in finding bad faith. Although no Michigan court has defined \u201cbad faith\u201d under the Act, other courts construing identical provisions from other States have concluded, as the district court did here, that bad faith \u201crequires objective speciousness of the plaintiffs claim ... and ... subjective bad faith in bringing or maintaining the claim.\u201d <em>Gemini Aluminum Corp. v. Cal. Custom Shapes, Inc., </em>95 Cal.App.4th 1249, 116 Cal.Rptr.2d 358, 368 (2002); <em>see also Berry v. Haw. Express Serv., Inc., </em>No. 03-00385, 2007 WL 689474, at *13-15 (D.Haw. Mar. 2, 2007) (applying the same test under Hawaii law and noting that other jurisdictions that have addressed the issue also have applied the same test).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">We see no reason not to apply this conventional test here. The Michigan courts have indicated that they will seek guidance from their sister state courts in construing the Act, and the parties at all events both subscribe to this formulation of the bad faith test. <em>See Niemi v. Am. Axle Mfg. &amp; Holding, Inc., </em>No. 269155, 2007 WL 29383, at *2 n. 1 (Mich.Ct.App. Jan. 4, 2007) (\u201cSection 9 of the Michigan Uniform Trade Secrets Act requires that the act be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of th[e] act among states enacting it. Thus, it is appropriate to seek guidance from the decisions of other jurisdictions.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted and alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The district court did not commit clear error in finding bad faith or otherwise abuse its discretion in imposing fees on Degussa. In filing this action, Degussa acknowledged that it had no direct evidence that Burnett had used, or was threatening to use, its alleged trade secrets. <em>See </em>JA 515 (Degussa\u2019s counsel \u201cconceding]\u201d that Degussa \u201cdid not catch [Burnett] red-handed\u201d); JA 610 (Degussa\u2019s vice president disclaiming any allegation that Burnett \u201cthreatened to disclose information\u201d); JA 727 (Degussa\u2019s sales manager saying that he had \u201cno evidence\u201d that Burnett had disclosed confidential information to \u201canyone at Sika\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Degussa instead relied largely on the theory of \u201cinevitable disclosure\u201d \u2014 that Burnett\u2019s new employment inevitably would lead him to rely on or disclose De-gussa\u2019s trade secrets. <em>See </em>JA 607 (Degus-sa\u2019s attorney stating that \u201c[i]t ain\u2019t no secret that our case is, in large measure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>built upon the Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine\u201d); <em>see also </em>JA 515 (same). Michigan, however, has not endorsed that theory and, making matters worse, has added that, \u201c[e]ven assuming that the concept of \u2018threatened misappropriation\u2019 of trade secrets encompasses a concept of inevitable disclosure, that concept must not compromise the right of employees to change jobs. Accordingly, ... for a party to make a [cognizable trade-secrets claim], the party must establish more than the existence of generalized trade secrets and a competitor\u2019s employment of the party\u2019s former employee who has knowledge of trade secrets.\u201d <em>CMI Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Intermet Int\u2019l Corp., </em>251 Mich.App. 125, 649 N.W.2d 808, 818 (2002); <em>see also United Rentals (N. Am.), Inc. v. Keizer, </em>355 F.3d 399, 412-13 (6th Cir.2004) (same); <em>cf. PepsiCo, </em>54 F.3d at 1269 (\u201c[T]he mere fact that a person assumed a similar position at a competitor does not, without more, make it inevitable that he will use or disclose trade secret information ....\u201d) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Even if we assumed that a Michigan court would recognize the inevitable-discovery doctrine, Degussa still needed to be able to establish \u201cmore than the existence of generalized trade secrets and [Sika\u2019s] employment of [Burnett] who has knowledge of trade secrets.\u201d <em>CMI Int\u2019l, </em>649 N.W.2d at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">All that Degussa could say, however, is that Burnett had knowledge of its alleged generalized trade secrets <em>(e.g., </em>its prices, margins, customers, mixtures and marketing strategies), that Burnett persuaded several of his former customers at Degus-sa to switch to Sika products because of cost savings and that Sika paid Burnett more than he made at Degussa. These allegations do not satisfy even the Michigan courts\u2019 contingent acknowledgment of the inevitable-discovery doctrine. Also problematic are these pre-com-plaint facts, which Degussa had every reason to know: Degussa had no sales representative in western Michigan for over a month after Burnett departed; Burnett\u2019s replacement at Degussa had no sales experience (and had not secured any new customers or called on many of the lost customers during his first several weeks or months with Degussa); the customers had been experiencing \u201c[q]uality problems with Degussa product,\u201d JA 736; Degussa had been losing employees in its sales ranks; Burnett approached Sika for employment over concerns about job security and De-gussa\u2019s new compensation structure and was not making more than other Sika sales representatives; Burnett\u2019s boss at Degus-sa believed Burnett was a \u201cgood admixture salesman\u201d who had \u201cintegrity\u201d and was \u201chonest,\u201d JA 723; and Degussa learned \u201ca few days before [Burnett] resigned\u201d that he \u201cdid not have a noncompete\u201d agreement, JA 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The picture that emerges, as the district court appreciated, is not that Degussa had an objectively supportable and good-faith claim that Burnett was using trade secrets to gain new customers and was getting paid extra to do so. Rather, it suggests that Degussa\u2019s own product-quality, employee-retention and marketing shortcomings led it to file this action in an attempt to slow the bleeding from those self-inflicted wounds \u2014 to avoid losing additional market share and salespeople to Sika and to convert Burnett\u2019s confidentiality agreement into a noncompete agreement. As Degussa\u2019s vice president (who attached an affidavit to Degussa\u2019s complaint) said in response to a question about what led the company to file this suit: \u201c[I]t was the factors of a couple people leaving \u2014 leaving to go to Sika, the impact that we thought that was going to have. And then, obviously, seeing that impact in the sales numbers.\u201d JA 622. Filing a trade-secret ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>tion to restrain legitimate competition and job mobility, needless to say, is not proper. On this record, we see no clear error or other abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees to Burnett and Sika.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In resisting this conclusion, Degussa contends that the district court should have, consistent with the summary-judgment standard, \u201cgive[n] Degussa the benefit of all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence presented.\u201d Reply Br. at 14. Yet questions of fact in the context of deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s fees (as opposed to deciding whether to grant summary judgment) are committed to the district court judge, even when decided before a trial. <em>Compare Bergman, </em>844 F.2d at 357, <em>with Kraus v. Sobel Corrugated Containers, Inc., </em>915 F.2d 227, 230 (6th Cir.1990). The judge, as the factfinder in the attorney-fee context, is not required to draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party but instead is permitted to make factual findings in accordance with his or her own view of the evidence. That is just what the judge did here. And given our conclusion that \u201cthe district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, [we] may not reverse it even [if we assume that we] would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Because Degussa\u2019s appeal was not frivolous or filed for an improper purpose, we deny Burnett and Sika\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
