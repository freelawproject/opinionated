Cattan and Eliotex, Sri. This Court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because it lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Therefore, we will transfer this case to that forum pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Innovative Designs and its co-plaintiff R.M.F. Global, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a complaint in the District Court naming Cattan and El-iotex as defendants and seeking (I) a declaration that the activities of R.M.F. Global, Innovative Designs, and them customers do not infringe a patent owned by Cattan; (II) a declaration that Cattan\u2019s patent is invalid; and (III) a declaration that the activities of R.M.F. Global, Innovative Designs, and them customers do not infringe on a trademark owned by Cattan. In Counts IV and V, the complaint also set forth state-law claims of tortious interference with business and contractual relations, as well as common law unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Eliotex and Cattan moved to dismiss or stay the proceedings pending arbitration in accordance with a contract between Elio-tex and R.M.F. Global dated June 11,1999. In a Memorandum and Order entered September 23, 2004, the District Court found that both R.M.F. Global and Innovative Designs were bound by the arbitration clause contained in the contract and that the plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims were \u201cwithin the scope of the arbitration clause.\u201d The court stayed the case pending arbitration pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">On December 16, 2005, Eliotex and Cat-tan moved for confirmation of an arbitration award handed down in their favor by an Italian Board of Arbitrators. The Board determined that R.M.F. Global, Innovative Designs, and Mr. Joseph Riccelli<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> breached the contract between R.M.F. Global and Eliotex. The award ordered R.M.F. Global to \u201ccease the employment of the Eliotex mark and patent,\u201d declared that the contract between R.M.F. Global and Eliotex terminated on June 11, 1999, and ordered R.M.F. Global, Innovative Designs, and Riccelli to pay damages in the amount of $4,176,000.00, plus interest and costs. App. 209-10. The District Court confirmed the award and entered judgment against plaintiffs in language that mirrored the arbitrators\u2019 language.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Innovative Designs filed a timely notice of <em>appeal</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>from the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">This is a complex commercial dispute beset by controversy over a patent and a trademark and accompanied by substantial allegations of fraud by both parties. We find no necessity for elaboration of the conflicts because the issue before us is whether we have appellate jurisdiction to hear this case. We conclude that we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1) grants the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \u201cexclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>sive jurisdiction ... of an appeal from a final decision of a district court of the United States ... if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1338.\u201d Section 1338 provides that, \u201c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents ... and trademarks.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800,108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988), clarified the respective jurisdictions of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the regional courts of appeals in cases that involve patent issues. The Supreme Court held that any case that \u201carises under\u201d a federal patent statute for purposes of \u00a7 1338 satisfies \u00a7 1295(a)(l)\u2019s requirement that the case be based \u201cin part\u201d on \u00a7 1338. <em>Id. </em>at 807, 108 S.Ct. 2166. A case \u201carises under\u201d federal patent law if \u201cthe plaintiff must set up some right, title or interest under the patent laws, or at least make it appear that some right or privilege will be defeated by one construction, or sustained by the opposite construction of these laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807-08, 108 S.Ct. 2166 (quoting <em>Pratt v. Paris Gas Light &amp; Coke Co., </em>168 U.S. 255, 259, 18 S.Ct. 62, 42 L.Ed. 458 (1897)).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The Court observed that the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit extends \u201conly to those cases in which a well-pleaded complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff\u2019s right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law, in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the well-pleaded claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808-09, 108 S.Ct. 2166.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Count I, which seeks a declaration that plaintiffs and them customers did not infringe the defendants\u2019 patent, and Count II, which seeks a declaration that the defendants\u2019 patent is invalid, obviously \u201cdepend on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law.\u201d This case, therefore, \u201carises under\u201d patent laws for purposes of \u00a7 1338 and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1295(a)(1) as long of the judgment of the District Court is a \u201cfinal decision.\u201d <em>See Medtronic AVE, Inc. v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., </em>247 F.3d 44, 52 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201c[Sjection 1295(a) does not vest jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit [in an] appeal [that] is not from a \u2018final decision.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\u201cSection 1295\u2019s final judgment rule mirrors that of its counterpart found at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d <em>Nystrom v. TREX Co., </em>339 F.3d 1347, 1350 (Fed.Cir.2003). Thus, the District Court\u2019s judgment is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d if it \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">When it is not clear from the face of a district court\u2019s order whether a ruling is a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d the inquiry is \u201cwhether the ... court intended its ruling to have final rather than a tentative effect.\u201d <em>Caver v. City of Trenton, </em>420 F.3d 243, 261 (3d Cir.2005); <em>see also, Witherspoon v. White, </em>111 F.3d 399, 401 (5th Cir.1997) (when \u201ca court order is ambiguous as to what parties and claims are being disposed of and the district court ... intend[ed] to effect a final dismissal of a claim,\u201d the order is final notwithstanding the ambiguous language (quoting <em>Picco v. Global Marine Drilling Co., </em>900 F.2d 846, 849 n. 4 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotation mark omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The judgment of May 9, 2006 did not specifically rule on each claim asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Nevertheless, the record demonstrates that the District Court intended the judgment to end the litigation on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">By assessing damages against plaintiffs, ordering R.M.F. Global to cease employment of Eliotex\u2019s trademark and patent, and terminating the contract between R.M.F. Global and Eliotex, the arbitrators implicitly rejected each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The District Court incorporated the arbitrators\u2019 decision on the merits when it confirmed the award and thus approved the finding in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiffs on all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The District Court believed that there was nothing further to be done to end litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Our conclusion that the judgment was intended to be a \u201cfinal decision\u201d on the merits is bolstered by the District Court\u2019s characterization of the May 9, 2006 judgment as a \u201cfinal judgment against plaintiffs\u201d in two later rulings. <em>See Eliotex, SRL v. Riccelli, </em>No. 06cv0582, 2007 WL 2119212, at * 1 (W.D.Pa. July 20, 2007) (stating in a Memorandum and Order with respect to summary judgment in a related proceeding that, \u201c[o]n May 9, 2006, <em>this Court entered final judgment against plaintiffs </em>RMF [Global] and [Innovative Designs], jointly and severally, in the amount of $4,176,000, plus legal interest thereon from May 6, 2005, confirming the award of the [Italian Board of Arbitrators]\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>R.M.F. Global, Inc. v. Cattan, </em>No. 04cv0593, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51511, at * 1 (W.D.Pa. July 27, 2006) (stating, \u201c[o]n May 9, 2006, <em>this Court entered final judgment against plaintiffs </em>R.M.F. Global, Inc. and Innovative Designs ... jointly and severally, in the amount of $4,176,000, plus legal interest thereon from May 6, 2005,\u201d in ruling on a the defendants\u2019 July 6, 2006 Motion to Withdraw Order of Reference Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(d) in this case (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We conclude that the District Court\u2019s May 9, 2006 judgment was a \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes of assessing which court of appeals has jurisdiction over this case. Accordingly, we will transfer this case to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">. R.M.F.
