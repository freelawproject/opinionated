TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">Martin Vasquez Arroyo appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his pro se civil rights action against his public defender. The public defender was assigned to defend Arroyo\u2019s pending state appellate case. Arroyo seeks damages and the removal of his public defender from that case. Because a state-appointed public defender is not a state officer for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we AFFIRM the lower court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b830-17\">Arroyo was sentenced in 2005 for various state charges and proceeded on direct appeal. For his appeal, the state appointed Korey Kaul as his public defender. Arroyo attempts to sue Kaul under \u00a7 1983 for ineffective assistance of counsel, seeking twenty million dollars from Kaul, fifteen million dollars in punitive damages, five million dollars in personal damages, and the dismissal of Kaul as his appointed counsel. The district court dismissed the complaint sua sponte for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-21\">Arroyo now appeals the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-22\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b830-23\">We review de novo the lower court\u2019s decision to dismiss Arroyo\u2019s complaint. <em>See Trujillo v. Williams, </em>465 F.3d 1210, 1215 (10th Cir.2006). Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), a district court may dismiss a prisoner\u2019s civil action sua sponte \u201cfor failure to state a claim if the allegations, taken as true, show the plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 920, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Pro se plaintiffs pleadings are construed liberally. <em>Gaines v. Stenseng, </em>292 F.3d 1222,1224 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-24\">After having thoroughly reviewed the record, we adopt the reasoning set forth in the district court\u2019s order. As the district court explained, it is well settled in this circuit that public defenders cannot be sued under \u00a7 1983 because they are not state officers. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. Champion, </em>51 F.3d 901, 909 (10th Cir.1995). Likewise, we agree with the district court that Arroyo cannot seek to have his state-appointed counsel removed in the state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>matter by filing a \u00a7 1988 claim in federal court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is incorporated by reference and AFFIRMED. While the district court granted Arroyo <em>in forma pauperis, </em>we remind him that he is required to continue making partial payments until all fees have been paid. We also DENY Arroyo\u2019s motion to file a declaration and memorandum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b830-25\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-23\">. Even if Arroyo's complaint were construed liberally as a complaint asserting a malpractice action under state law, the claim would be dismissed. A state legal malpractice action would not fall under the federal court\u2019s federal-question jurisdiction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and because both parties are from the same state, it would not fall under the federal court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
