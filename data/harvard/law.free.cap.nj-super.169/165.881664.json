J. 8. A. 2A. </em>:15-6, plaintiff herein filed a new complaint and notice of <em>Us pendens. </em>That complaint clearly and unequivocally demanded judgment imposing a constructive trust on certain real property and declaring plaintiff a one-third beneficial owner thereof. The action asserts a partnership of plaintiff and two individual defendants to develop real estate and asserts that defendants, through a controlled corporation, took title to the realty in question in violation of defendants\u2019 fiduciary duty to permit plaintiff to participate in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>On motion of defendants the trial judge again ordered the newly filed notice of <em>Ms pendens </em>to be discharged of record. On plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to appeal the latter action and for summary reversal, we are granting the motion and summarily reversing, the parties having fully briefed the meritorious issues. See <em>R. </em>2:8-3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">We find the question before us to be controlled by our recent decision in <em>Polk v. Schwartz, </em>166 <em>N. J. Super. </em>292 (App. Div. 1979). It was there held that when a complaint on its face at least arguably recites a cause of action coming within <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :15-6 and its accompanying authorization of the filing of a notice of <em>lis pendens, </em>it is not appropriate for a court to entertain a motion to discharge the notice of <em>Ms pendens. </em>Bather, the disaffected party should, if properly warranted, move to dismiss the complaint or pertinent counts thereof for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or for summary judgment, including a request to discharge the notice of <em>lis pendens. Id. </em>at 299-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">It was further pointed out in <em>Polk </em>that discharging the notice of <em>Ms pendens </em>without a prior determination of the merits of the claim could jeopardize plaintiff\u2019s realization of effective relief even if he ultimately succeeded on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We would add this footnote to <em>Polk. </em>The adversely affected party would be entitled to have the notice of <em>Ms pendens </em>discharged if on motion he could demonstrate and obtain a determination by partial summary judgment to the effect that plaintiff in fact and in law had no right to a lien or to a claim affecting the title to the realty in question but only, if at all, some different claim or right against the defendant, as for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In the present case defendants have not to this juncture established a right to discharge the notice of <em>Ms pendens. </em>The order under review must therefore be</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
