A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Acn\">Defendant Peoples National Bank in Lakewood (Peoples) appeals from a judgment against it for $1,100 plus interest in favor of plaintiff Western Union Telegraph Company, in an action based upon Peoples\u2019 mistake in cashing a Western Union money order in an amount corresponding to its numerals, $1,300, rather than its words reading \u201cone hundred dollars.\u201d Ultimately, Western Union\u2019s drawee bank charged Western Union\u2019s account $1,300, and that sum was paid to Peoples. The principal issue is whether in these circumstances Western Union can sue Peoples directly or is limited to its claim against its drawee. This issue has not been decided previously in this State, and no reported case on this precise issue has been found in any sister state.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The facts presented in the scant record are simple and undisputed. On November 15, 1974 a Western Union telegraphic money order was sent by someone named Anthony Palma of Eockville, Connecticut, to Katherine Plomatoes of Brick Town, New Jersey, payable to her order. The money order was signed and issued by Christine Lester, Western Union\u2019s agent at its Lakewood, New Jersey, office. It was drawn on The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., of New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Plainly, the money order called for the payment of \u201cONE HUNDEED ............. 00/100 DOLLAES,\u201d stated in words, but also \u201c$1300.00,\u201d stated in numerals. Since words in an instrument \u201ccontrol figures,\u201d except when the words are ambiguous, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>13A:3-118(c), only $100 should have been paid to a holder of the instrument. Instead on November 15, 1974, when presented with endorsements in the names of Katherine Plomatoes and, curiously, plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>agent Christine Lester, Peoples\u2019 teller paid the holder (allegedly Katherine Plomatoes <em>or </em>Christine Lester) $1,200. Peoples received $1,200, presumably through normal collection channels, and Western Union asserts that it ultimately \u201cpaid\u201d the money order in the amount of $1,200. Eor the purposes of this opinion we assume that the instrument or item, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4r-104(l) (g), passed through the normal collection process whereby defendant received $1,200 from the drawee, Chase Manhattan, who, in turn, charged plaintiff\u2019s account in the same amount. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:A-204; <em>Life Ins. Co. of Va. v. Snyder, </em>141 <em>N. J. Super. </em>539 (Cty. D. Ct. 1976); <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng\u2019g Corp. v. First Nal\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>345 <em>Mass. </em>1, 184 <em>N. E. </em>2d 358 (Sup. Jud. Ct. 1962); <em>Allied Concord Financial Corp. v. Bank of America Nat\u2019l Trust &amp; Savings Ass\u2019n, </em>275 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 1, 80 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>622 (D. Ct. App. 1969); Rosenthal, \u201cNegotiability\u2014Who Needs It?\u201d 71 <em>Colum. L. Rev. </em>375, n. 61 at 390 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">More than two years later, by letter dated December 2, 1976, Western Union demanded reimbursement from Peoples of its $1,100 loss. Peoples rejected the claim and this action was commenced. Peoples then filed a third-party complaint against Plomatoes and Lester but could not locate or serve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Both parties moved for summary judgment. We were advised that the trial judge treated the case as if it had been tried on stipulated facts. Einding Peoples negligent, see <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4r-103(l), in cashing the money order in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:3-118(c), he entered judgment in favor of plaintiff. The trial judge rejected Peoples\u2019 contention that Chase Manhattan\u2019s negligence in charging $1,200 against Western Union\u2019s account precluded Western Union\u2019s recovery against Peoples. He reasoned that it was Peoples\u2019 negligence \u201cwhich resulted in\u201d the $1,100 damage to Western Union. Since we find no express provision in the Uniform Commercial Code which controls the result, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>base our conclusions on general legal principles, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>13A:1-103, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Peoples reminds us that it was the negligence or misconduct of Western Union\u2019s own agent in issuing an instrument with conflicting words and figures that set into motion the errors that were later committed. Nevertheless, our disposition of this case mates it unnecessary for us to determine if plaintiff should be precluded on that count alone. <em>Of. N. J. 8. A. </em>13A:3-406, which bars recovery by one whose negligence substantially contributes to a material alteration of an instrument or the making of an unauthorized signature as against a drawee, providing the drawee acts in good faith \u201cin accordance with the reasonable commercial standards\u201d of its business. See <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. v. United States Nat\u2019l Bank of Oregon, </em>376 <em>Or. </em>945, 558 <em>P. </em>2d 338 (Sup. Ct. 1976); <em>Bank of S. Md. v. Robertson\u2019s Crab House, Inc., </em>39 <em>Md. App. </em>707, 389 <em>A. </em>3d 388 (Ct. Spec. App. 1978). We will determine the outcome of this case on the assumption that Peoples and Chase Manhattan were negligent in paying out more than $100 on the instrument without regard to plaintiff\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">It does not follow, however, that Peoples\u2019 negligence was the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s loss. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>13A :1-103 provides that \u201cprinciples of law and equity\u201d supplement the provisions of the Code unless displaced by particular provisions. See <em>Salsman v. National Community Bank of Rutherford, </em>103 <em>N. J. Super. </em>482, 492-494 (Law Div. 1968), aff\u2019d <em>per curiam </em>105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>164 (App. Div. 1969). To the extent that plaintiff relies on <em>negligence </em>law as the source of defendant\u2019s obligation, plaintiff must establish a causal relationship between Peoples\u2019 conduct and its loss. See <em>Hoke v. Pioneer State Bank, </em>167 <em>N. J. Super. </em>410 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The direct cause of plaintiff\u2019s loss was Chase Manhattan\u2019s improper charging of plaintiff\u2019s account. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng\u2019g Corp. v. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>345 <em>Mass, </em>at 11, 184 <em>N. E. </em>2d at 364; <em>Allied Concord Financial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Corp. v. Bank of America Nat'l Trust &amp; Savings Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>275 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d at <em>5, 80 Cal. Rptr. </em>at 625. Peoples had no direct dealing with plaintiff and breached no warranty on which plaintiff can rely. <em>Cf. N. J. S. A. </em>12A:3-417; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4-207; <em>Life Ins. Co. of Va. v. Snyder, supra. </em>Chase Manhattan, as drawee, was obliged to' \u201cproperly\u201d pay the item and was authorized to charge the proper amount against plaintiff\u2019s account. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4-401. When paid, the instrument was discharged, see <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4-213 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:3-603; <em>Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code </em>(2d ed. 1971), \u00a7 4-213 at 26A-276, and Chase Manhattan\u2019s act o\u00ed payment gave no contractual rights to plaintiff as against Peoples. Peoples simply had paid out more of its own money than it should have when it cashed the money order. It had no right to expect Chase Manhattan to honor the item for more than $100. Thus, in traditional negligence terms, it may be said that the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s loss was Chase Manhattan\u2019s act of charging plaintiff\u2019s account, since Chase Manhattan had the duty to its customer and the \u201clast clear chance\u201d to read and pay the item properly. <em>Cf. Latta v. Caulfield, </em>79 <em>N. J. </em>128, 133-135 (1979); <em>Pangborn v. Central R. Co. of N. J., </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>84, 100-103 (1955); Whaley, \u201cNegligence and Negotiable Instruments,\u201d 53 <em>N. Car. L. R. </em>1, 17 (1974), referring to TT.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3-406 and 4-406 as \u201clast clear chance\u201d statutes, in effect. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to show that Peoples\u2019 conduct was a substantial factor in causing Chase Manhattan to act as it did. See 2 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 431 at 428 (1965); <em>O\u2019Brien v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>114, 124 (1971). We have been told nothing about the collection process and cannot surmise that the mechanics utilized in the process induced Chase Manhattan to rely on Peoples\u2019 conduct in paying the item.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The importation of proximate cause concepts from the field of torts into the law of negotiable instruments has been justly criticized. Whaley, \u201cNegligence and Negotiable Instruments,\u201d <em>supra, </em>53 <em>N. Car. L. J. </em>at 42. We ought to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>why it may be desirable or undesirable in this banking transaction to allow plaintiff to sue Peoples directly for its negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">One reason offered in favor of a direct suit by the drawer against the depositary or collecting bank is the avoidance of circuity of action. Plaintiff could have sued Chase Manhattan, and Chase Manhattan, in turn, may have had a claim against Peoples on a contractual basis, see <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4r-103, or otherwise for having received $1,200 for the $100 item. See the <em>Allied Cmcord </em>case, <em>supra., </em>where the drawer was treated as the third-party beneficiary of endorsement warranties given by depositary and collecting banks, and a direct suit was allowed. <em>Contra, Life Ins. Co. of Va. v. Snyder, supra. </em>But the policy against circuity of action ought not be the source of a cause of action that may otherwise be lacking. Here it is not clear that Peoples owed a duty to plaintiff or that Peoples\u2019 breach of that alleged duty \"caused\u201d plaintiff\u2019s loss. Moreover, Chase Manhattan may have defenses against Western Union and Peoples may have defenses against a claim by Chase Manhattan. If plaintiff had sued Chase Manhattan, recovery might have been barred by laches or other time limitations created by statute or agreement of the parties, and those issues should be decided first. See <em>Life Ins. Co. of Va. v. Snyder </em>and <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng\u2019g Corp. v. First Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>both <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">A customer owes the duty to his bank to examine cancelled checks and statements received from the bank and to give timely notice of any irregularities. <em>Arrow Builders Supply Corp. v. Royal Nat'l Bank of N. Y., </em>21 <em>N. Y. </em>2d 428, 431, 235 <em>N. E. </em>2d 756, 758, 288 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 609, 612 (Ct. App. 1968); <em>Forbes v. First Camden Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>25 <em>N. J. Super. </em>17, 23 (App. Div. 1953). This duty has been recognized by statute, U.C.C. \u00a7 4-406(1); <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4-406(1); <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17:9A-229.1 to 229.5; and time limitations <em>for </em>bringing suit may be imposed by statute, U.C.C. \u00a7 4-406(4); <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4-406(4); <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17:9A-229.2 and 229.3; <em>Duralite Co., Inc. v. New Jersey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>97 <em>N. J. Super. </em>48 (App. Div. 1967); <em>Billings v. East River Savings Bank, </em>33 <em>A. D. </em>2d 997, 307 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 606 (App. Div. 1970), or by agreement between the bank and its customer. See <em>New York Credit Men\u2019s Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., </em>41 <em>A. D. </em>2d 912, 343 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 538 (App. Div. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Thus, had plaintiff sued Chase Manhattan, plaintiff\u2019s claim may have been defeated. In that case Chase Manhattan would have suffered no loss and would have no claim against Peoples.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Denying plaintiff the right to sue Peoples directly produces a result which is consonant with the Uniform Commercial Code. U.C.C. \u00a7 4-406 <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4-406) establishes rules affecting the liability of a bank to its customer for items paid in good faith and returned to the customer with a statement of account. Subsection (4) precludes a customer from asserting a claim if the customer has not discovered and reported an unauthorized signature or alteration within one year from the time the statement and item are received or within three years from that time if the claim is based upon an unauthorized endorsement. Subsection (5) provides that a payor bank that fails to assert a valid defense against the claim of a customer resulting from payment of an item governed by \u00a7 4-406 is barred from asserting a claim against any collecting bank or other prior party presenting the item. Thus, this subsection contemplates that a drawer will sue its own drawee who, in turn, will sue a collecting or depositary bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Peoples breached no warranty in cashing the money order, see <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:3-417 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:4-307; and plaintiff cannot sue Peoples directly for breach of a contractual duty. Plaintiff did have a contractual relationship with Chase Manhattan and clearly could have sued Chase Manhattan for its improper charging of plaintiff\u2019s account. However, that claim may be barred by defenses arising out of plaintiff\u2019s own conduct. To allow a direct action against Peoples would make it difficult to resolve issues that should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>be decided first and may allow plaintiff to escape responsibility for its own conduct in this transaction. Because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that Peoples\u2019 conduct caused its loss, and because Chase Manhattan\u2019s defenses against its claim should be preserved and resolved, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s direct claim against Peoples should be disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Accordingly, the judgment in favor of plaintiff is reversed and judgment is entered in favor of defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
