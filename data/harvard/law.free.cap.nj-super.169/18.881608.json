J. S. A. </em>13 :9A-1 <em>et seq. </em>and preventing plaintiff from filling the property with dredge spoils. The DEP Commissioner granted a Type \u201cB\u201d Wet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>lands Permit as to part of the designated area, leaving approximately 80 acres subject to the prohibition against any \u201cregulated activity\u201d without a permit. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>13 :9A-4. On this appeal plaintiff contends that the \u201cwetlands order of August 13, 1973 as applied to [plaintiff\u2019s] tract of land deprives [plaintiff] of the practical use of the lands subject to the wetlands order and is an unreasonable exercise of the police power.\u201d Plaintiff seeks to declare the order void as applied to the 80-acre section of its property pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>13:9A-6 and constitutional prohibitions against the taking of property without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"> Plaintiff\u2019s 3500-acre tract of land fronts on the Delaware River in Logan Township. The property is described in some detail in <em>American Dredging Co. v. Selleck, </em>556 <em>F. </em>2d 180 (3 Cir. 1977). As stated in the trial judge\u2019s thoughtful opinion in this case, 161 <em>N. J. Super. </em>504, 514 (Ch. Div. 1978), the restricted area comprises only <em>3% </em>of plaintiff\u2019s entire tract, and that tract must be viewed as a whole in determining the impact and validity of the governmental regulation in question. See <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. City of New York, </em>438 <em>U. S. </em>104, 130, 98 <em>S. Ct. </em>2646, 2663, 57 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 631, 652 (1978). Thus, plaintiff has failed to prove that the regulation has prevented all practical use of the property as a whole. Limitations on the use of portions of private property, such as area coverage and buffer zone requirements, are commonly accepted zoning restrictions even though they diminish the usable area of a given piece of property. <em>Quinton v. Edison Park Develop. Corp., </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>571, 580-581 (1971); <em>Anderson, American Law of Zoning </em>(3 ed. 1976), \u00a7 9.65 at 350. In the case at hand the evidence shows that plaintiff\u2019s property is zoned \u201criverfront industrial\u201d and is subject to a limitation of development to 50% of its area. Thus, even if the wetlands portion could serve no other practical purpose \u2014 which the record does not demonstrate \u2014 it could serve as the open area segment of the remainder of plaintiff\u2019s property when the latter is de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>veloped for industrial use. Moreover, by special permit plaintiff may be authorized in the future to utilize a portion of the restricted wetland area in a manner that would serve the ultimate development of the upland sections of its tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Accordingly, we concur in the trial court\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s requested relief and the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
