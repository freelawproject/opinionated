A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ATO\">This appeal raises the problem of the so-called recanting witness. The precise question before us is indistinguishable from that addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Ross, 80 N. J. </em>239 (1979) (decided June 4, 1979), namely, whether the trial judge, by calling such a witness as his own on the State\u2019s case can relieve the prosecution of the burden of <em>Evid. R. </em>20 and <em>Evid. R. </em>63(1) (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>and thereby transform the witness\u2019 prior inconsistent and inculpatory statement from a neutralization device alone into substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Boss </em>holds that he may not since such a technique constitutes an impermissible circumvention of the expressed intent of our evidence rules and the underlying policies upon which they are based, as well as an unwarranted assault on the integrity of the criminal trial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Our review of this record persuades us that the conviction here appealed from rested exclusively on the type of evidence now interdicted by <em>Boss. </em>Defendant James Reddick was tried by a jury and convicted, together with three oodefendants, of multiple charges arising out of the armed robbery of a neighborhood grocery store in Jersey City on November 21, 1975. The State\u2019s case against the three co-defendants was based on their actual armed entry into the store and commission of the robbery. The case against Red-dick was predicated on the allegation that he was the driver of the getaway ear parked near the store during the robbery. The sole occupant of the store when the three armed men entered was its owner, Alberta Wheeler. While the robbery was in progress, a customer entered, Glen Harris, a young man who lived across the street and was performing a shopping errand for his mother. After the intruders had taken the cash in the register and the money Harris had on his person, they fled from the store, entered a car parked at the curb and were driven away from the scene. Neither Wheeler nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Harris was harmed. Two of the intruders were previously known to Wheeler and she was able to make positive out-of-court identifications of all three. The investigative problem of the police was to ascertain the identity of the fourth man, the driver of the getaway car. The only potential eye witness who might have been able to make such an identification proved to be Harris, who apparently had told the police that he had noticed the getaway car on his way to the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Four days after the robbery Wheeler and Harris were taken to the Jersey City police identification center where they were given photographs to view by an Officer Jackson, who was conducting the photographic identification procedure. Harris was encouraged to make an identification, if he could, of the driver of the getaway car. According to Jackson, Harris identified a photograph of defendant as the driver. According to Harris, he did not make that .identification and, in any event, his glimpse of the car was too brief and the street lighting too poor to have enabled him to make any identification at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">This testimonial dispute between Harris and Jackson was first developed during their respective <em>voir dire </em>examinations conducted at the prosecutor\u2019s request. The prosecutor was aware before trial that Harris would testify that he had not identified defendant and was unable to make an identification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Harris\u2019 alleged out-of-court identification, however, was the only available evidence linking Eeddick with the crime. It was essential, therefore, to the State\u2019s case that Jackson\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged Harris identification be admitted as substantive evidence. Thus the prosecutor\u2019s dilemma, the same as in <em>Boss, </em>was that while a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement is, by reason of <em>Evid R. </em>63(1) (a), ordinarily excepted from the category of inadmissible hearsay, nevertheless, <em>Evid. R. 20, </em>expressly incorporated therein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>precludes a party from making any use of Ms own witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement other than for neutralization purposes. The prosecutor, as in Boss, sought to resolve this dilemma by requesting the trial judge to call Harris as a court\u2019s witness. The rationale was that if Harris were not a State\u2019s witness, the State could avoid the <em>Bule </em>20 stricture regarding his prior inconsistent statement and thus use Jackson\u2019s testimony regarding Harris\u2019 alleged prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence. The trial judge acceded to this request, the two witnesses were called \u2014 Harris by the court and Jackson by the prosecutor \u2014 and each testified essentially in the same manner as he had on <em>voir dire. </em>Reddick\u2019s conviction thus rested exclusively on Jackson\u2019s testimony that Harris, the court\u2019s witness, had told him that he recognized Reddick\u2019s photograph as depicting the man sitting in the getaway car during the robbery. Clearly, the conviction must, under Boss, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Although not raised below, the State argues on appeal that Jackson\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged Harris identification was admissible pursuant to <em>Evid. B. </em>63(1) (c) even if not pursuant to <em>Evid B. </em>63(1) (a). The former, not expressly subject to <em>Evid B. </em>20, provides that a prior extrajudicial statement of a witness is admissible if it \u201cis a prior identification of a party where identity is in issue, if made under circumstances precluding unfairness or unreliability.\u201d We are constrained, however, to reject the State\u2019s argument. First, there was no preliminary finding below that the alleged identification was made under circumstances precluding unfairness or unreliability and we are not satisfied that the facts here are either so undisputable or unequivocal as to warrant us in making that finding ourselves by an exercise of original jurisdiction. The State\u2019s reliance on subsection (c) of the rule does not, moreover, avoid the prejudice inherent in Harris having been called as a court\u2019s witness in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Most significantly, however, paragraph (e) of <em>Evid. B. </em>63(1) has never been held to apply to an identification which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>in context actually constitutes a prior inconsistent statement within the intendment of paragraph (a). We are firmly of the view that that provision was not intended and is not construable as an exception to paragraph (a) but rather applies only to those hearsay identification statements which are not also within the category of prior inconsistent statements encompassed by paragraph (a). See <em>State v. Matlack, </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>491, 498-499 (1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 389 <em>U. S. </em>1009, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>573, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>3d 606 (1967), holding that a trial witness may testify as to a previous out-of-court identification to corroborate an in-court identification, and <em>State v. Draughn, </em>131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>64 (App. Div. 1973), aff\u2019d <em>o. </em>b. 61 <em>N. J. </em>515 (1973), holding admissible evidence of the out-of-court identification by the victim of the crime who, although unable to make an in-court identification, did not dispute having made the earlier out-of-court one. <em>Evid. B. </em>63(1) (a) rests upon strong policy reasons for refusing to accord substantive evidential status to the prior oral inconsistent statement of a declarant who at trial denies having made it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In our view those reasons compel the conclusion that paragraph (c) does not extend to statements whose admissibility is proscribed by paragraph (a) and may not be resorted to as a vehicle for circumventing its prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-11\"> <em>Evid.
