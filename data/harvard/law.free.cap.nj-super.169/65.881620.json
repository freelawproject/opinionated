By an earlier order Nationwide was required \u201cto defend and indemnify\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Laino \u201cfrom and against any and all claims\u201d (of plaintiffs in the negligence suit) that they (Mr. and Mrs. Laino) \u201cfailed to supervise Douglas Braun, as a result of which\u201d the accident occurred. It is undisputed that the accident occurred about one-quarter of a mile away from the Laino property.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The issue here is whether a mini-bike was a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of an exclusion clause contained in the homeowners policy. The trial judge found that Nationwide was not obligated to defend Douglas on the count of the complaint which alleged his own negligence because of a provision in the policy excluding coverage for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the use of a \u201crecreational motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The exclusion clause with which we are here concerned reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">This policy does not apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">1. Under Coverage E \u2022\u2014\u2022 Personal Liability and Coverage F \u2014 Medical Payments to Others:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">a. to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">(1) any aircraft; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">(2) any motor vehicle owned or .operated by, or rented or loaned to any Insured ; but this subdivision (2) does not apply to bodily injury or property damage occurring on the residence premises if the motor vehicle is not subject to motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>vehicle registration because it is used exclusively 'on' the residence premises or kept in dead storage on the residence premises; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">(3) any recreational motor vehicle owned by any Insured, if the bodily injury or property damage occurs away from the residence premises; but this subdivision (3) does not apply to golf carts while used for golfing purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">\u201cMotor Yehicle\u201d is defined in the policy \u00e1s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">*\u2019 * * a land motor vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer designed for travel on public roads (including any machinery or apparatus attached thereto), but does not include, except while being' towed by or carried on a motor vehicle, any of the following: utility, boat, camp u or home trailer, recreational motor vehicle, crawler or farm type tractor, farm implement or, if not subject to motor vehicle registration, \u2019 any equipment which is designed for use principally off public roads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The trial judge determined that the mini-bike was not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d because (\u00cd) it was not subject to motor vehicle, registration, and (2) it was designed for use primarily off public roads. He concluded, therefore, that the mini-bike was a \u201crecreational motor vehicle,\u201d which is defined in the policy as: \u201c(1) a golf cart or snowmobile or (2) if not subject to motor vehicle registration, any other land, motor vehicle designed for recreational use off public roads.\u201d Having decided that the mini-bike was a \u201crecreational motor vehicle\u201d rather than a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d the trial judge held that Exclusion l.a.(3) applied to bar coverage, since the accident occurred away from the residence premises.</p>\n<p id=\"AeT\"> In our view the trial judge applied the wrong policy exclusion. We are satisfied that the mini-bike was a \u201cmotor yehicle\u201d under Exclusion l.a.(2), and not a \u201crecreational motor vehicle\u201d under Exclusion l.a.(3). Accordingly, although we affirm the order for summary judgment under review, we do so -for reasons other than those given by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-4 requires, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">* * * every resident of this State and every nonresident whose automobile or motorcycle shall be driven in this State shall before using such vehicles on the public highways, register the same, and no automobile or motorcycle shall be driven unless so registered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The term \u201cMotorcycle\u201d as defined in <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39:1-1 includes \u201cmotorcycles, \u2022 motor bikes, bicycles with motor attached and all motor operated vehicles of the bicycle or tricycle type, except motorized bicycles as defined in this section * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">It is, accordingly, clear to us that the mini-bike in question was a \u201cmotorcycle\u201d within the above-quoted definition of the term, and as such was a motor vehicle \u201cdesigned for travel on public roads\u201d and \u201csubject to motor vehicle registration.\u201d The fact that it was not registered or that at the time of the accident was not on a public road or highway, would not result in policy coverage where none was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-12\">Referred to by the trial judge as \u201ca 1972 Honda Mini-trail Motorcycle.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
