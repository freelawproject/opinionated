J. Super. </em>91. Before us defendant argues six points in addition to the one determined there. He complains that</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">POINT I \u2014Prejudicial references regarding defendant\u2019s picture at police headquarters denied defendant a fair trial. POINT II \u25a0\u2014\u25a0 The trial court erred in permitting victim to partially disrobe and display his wounds to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">POINT III \u2014The trial court erred in failing to conduct a hearing as to whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given to defendant prior to making statement to police officer at the scene of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">POINT IV \u2014It was error to admit defendant\u2019s statement into evidence as the surrounding circumstances rendered it involuntary and inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">POINT V \u2014Nondisclosure of witness\u2019 previous indictment by prosecutor\u2019s office denied defendant due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">POINT VI \u2014The aggregate of the errors below was so prejudicial as to entitle defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">POINT VII \u2014 The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and constituted an abuse of the trial court\u2019s expression [sic].</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">None of the several issues raised causes us any concern, let alone suggests a reason for reversal. While we have come to this conclusion wholly apart from any thought of defendant\u2019s guilt, it does occur to us that this guilt is so manifest that considerable error might be tolerated before it raised a question as to whether it had a tendency to produce an unjust result. The thought is an idle one: we perceive no error and are satisfied that all the issues are clearly without merit. <em>B. </em>2:ll-3(e) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">We would only add that, anent Point Y above, we concur with Judge Arnone in the articulate expressions of his written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
