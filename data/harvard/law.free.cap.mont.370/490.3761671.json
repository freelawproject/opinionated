Greene appeals from the District Court\u2019s Order filed December 5, 2012, denying as untimely his motion for substitution of judge. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court properly denied the motion for substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u00b63 Lilliane Greene died testate on June 22,2012. Her will named her daughter Dawn Bare as Personal Representative of the Estate. On June 28, 2012, Dawn filed an application for informal probate and for appointment of personal representative. The Clerk of Court accepted the application for informal probate and appointed Dawn the personal representative. Also on June 28 Dawn issued by mail a Notice and Information to Heirs and Devisees pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-603, MCA. The Notice specified that the Estate was \u201cbeing administered by the Personal Representative under the Uniform Probate Code without supervision of the Court.\u201d Appellant William is the decedent\u2019s son and a devisee under her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u00b64 On November 19, 2012, William\u2019s attorney filed a notice of appearance in the informal probate, and also filed a Motion for Substitution of Judge pursuant to \u00a7 3-l-804(l)(a), MCA. Subsequently, on November 28,2012, William\u2019s attorney filed several other pleadings in the probate, including a Petition for Supervised Administration pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-402, MCA. On December 4,2012, the District Court denied the motion for substitution as untimely, finding that William had 30 days from the date of the Notice and Information to Heirs and Devisees in which to file the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\u00b65 A district court\u2019s decision on whether a motion for substitution of judge is timely is a conclusion of law that this Court reviews to determine whether it is correct. <em>In Re Marriage of Archibald, </em>1999 MT 258, \u00b6 4, 297 Mont. 20, 993 P.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">\u00b66 William sought to substitute the District Court judge under \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, which provides that \u201c[e]ach adverse party is entitled to one substitution of a district judge.\u201d The right of substitution applies to all \u201cjudges presiding in district courts,\u201d with the narrow exceptions of a judge sitting as a Water Court judge, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court judge, or a judge supervising the distribution of water under \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>85-2-406, MCA. Section 3-1-804, MCA; <em>Patrick v. State, </em>2011 MT 169, \u00b6 15, 361 Mont. 204, 257 P.3d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b67 Section 3-1-804, MCA, further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">In a civil action ... a motion for substitution by the party filing the action must be filed within 30 calendar days after the first summons is served or an adverse party has appeared. A motion for substitution by the party served must be filed within 30 calendar days after service has been completed in compliance with M. R. Civ. P. 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Section 3-l-804(l)(a), MCA. A motion for substitution that is not timely is void, and the judge whose substitution is sought has jurisdiction to determine whether the motion is timely. Section 3-1-804(4), MCA. The District Court in the present case held that mailing the Notice and Information to Heirs and Devisees pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-603, MCA, is equivalent to service of summons referred to in \u00a7 3-l-804(l)(a), MCA. Since William received that Notice on or about June 28, 2012, the District Court determined that he had 30 days in which to file his motion for substitution. Therefore, the District Court held that William\u2019s November 19, 2012, motion was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b68 When William filed his motion for substitution of judge on November 19, 2012, the proceeding was an informal probate of his mother\u2019s estate. An application for informal probate is directed to the clerk of the district court, and not to the district judge. Section 72-3-201, MCA. The clerk of the court determines whether the application for informal probate is complete and timely, \u00a7 72-3-212, MCA, and may deny the application if the statutory requirements are not met, \u00a7 72-3-214, MCA. The clerk of court makes the appointment of the personal representative when the statutory requirements are satisfied, \u00a7 72-3-225, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b69 The right of substitution provided in \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, applies in a \u201ccivil action\u201d in which a \u201csummons is served\u201d and in which there is an \u201cadverse party.\u201d <em>Pinnow v. State Fund, </em>2007 MT 332, \u00b6 18, 340 Mont. 217, 172 P.3d 1273. None of these are present in an informal probate, which is not a contested proceeding and which does not take place under the supervision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u00b610 In the present case William petitioned for supervised administration pursuant to the provisions of Title 72, Chapter 3, Part 4, MCA, citing \u00a7 72-3-402, MCA. Supervised administration \u201cis a single in rem proceeding to secure complete administration and settlement of a decedent\u2019s estate under the continuing authority of the court....\u201d Section 72-3-401(1), MCA. When a petition for supervised administration is filed in an informal probate, the proceeding comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>under the supervision of the district court and sufficiently partakes the elements of a civil action to trigger application of \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA. The District Court was not involved in this probate until William filed his petition for supervised administration. At that point, \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, became applicable in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b611 A probate may come under the supervision of the district court by filing a petition for formal testacy pursuant to Title 72, Chapter 3, Part 3, MCA, or by filing a petition for supervised administration pursuant to Title 72, Chapter 3, Part 4, MCA. Both proceedings require notice to be served on interested persons. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-3-111(2), MCA. The timelines provided in \u00a7 3-1-804(1)(a), MCA, are triggered when that notice is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b612 All of the attributes of an ordinary civil action referred to in \u00a7 3-1-804(1), MCA, may not be present in a supervised administration of an estate. At the same time, a supervised administration is not one of the three specified exclusions from coverage of the substitution statute. <em>Patrick, </em>\u00b6 15. The function of this Court is to ascertain the meaning and intent of the statute and to arrive at a construction that gives effect to the words used. <em>Mattson v. Montana Power, </em>2002 MT 113, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13, 309 Mont. 506, 48 P.3d 34. We give effect to the words of \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, under the facts of this case by construing it to apply in an informal probate only after a party\u2019s petition to convert the proceeding to a court-supervised administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b613  When William filed his motion for substitution of judge under \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, the matter was an informal probate. The matter was not under the supervision of the district court, and therefore not a \u201ccivil action\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA. Consequently, the substitution statute did not apply. Section 3-1-804(4), MCA, provides that any motion for substitution that is not timely filed is void. Because William\u2019s motion for substitution was filed prematurely, it was not timely and was void. He could have filed another motion for substitution after filing the petition for supervised administration, but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u00b614 The District Court reached the proper conclusion, that the motion for substitution was not effective. We will affirm a district court when it reaches the correct result, even if it is for the wrong reason. <em>In re B.A.M., </em>2008 MT 311, \u00b6 24, 346 Mont. 49, 192 P.3d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u00b615  William did not file a timely motion for substitution of judge under \u00a7 3-1-804(1), MCA, and the District Court\u2019s decision denying his motion is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b517-9\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER, McKINNON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
