Did the District Court incorrectly conclude that, because the arresting officer did not follow \u00a7 46-6-312, MCA, all evidence gathered </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>after Kelm\u2019s arrest should be suppressed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court incorrectly conclude that the officer\u2019s failure to advise Kelm of her </em>Miranda <em>rights at the time of her arrest required suppression of all evidence obtained after her arrest?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b65 <em>3. Did the District Court incorrectly conclude that evidence seized from Kelm\u2019s vehicle must be suppressed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b66 In the early-morning hours of February 19, 2011, Sheridan County Sheriffs Deputy Robert Krause (Krause) observed a blue pickup truck driven by Kristen Kelm cross the center line of a Plentywood, Montana street and drive onto the local highway. Krause followed Kelm for several miles and \u201cobserved [her] vehicle weaving within its lane touching both the fog line and the center line and then actually crossing the center line two or three times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u00b67 Krause initiated a traffic stop on Kelm\u2019s vehicle and she pulled over to the side of the road. When Krause approached the driver\u2019s-side window, Kelm immediately provided her driver\u2019s license. Krause informed Kelm that he had stopped her for crossing the center line of the highway. He then remarked to Kelm that her eyes looked \u201cbloodshot and glassy\u201d and asked if she had been drinking. Kelm denied that she had consumed alcohol that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u00b68 Without having Kelm get out of the car, Krause proceeded to administer a horizontal gaze nystagmus test (HGN) to help determine whether Kelm was intoxicated. He observed a \u201clack of smooth pursuit in both eyes as well as distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes\u201d and gave her a score of four out of a possible six points, which indicated intoxication. Krause again asked Kelm if she had been drinking alcohol, and she admitted to consuming one drink.</p>\n<p id=\"A41\">\u00b69 After Krause had finished administering the HGN test, he determined that Kelm needed to pass standardized field sobriety tests before she could resume driving. Because the temperature was minus-one degree Fahrenheit and ice and snow covered the highway, Krause asked Kelm if she would agree to perform sobriety tests at the Sheridan County Jail, where the climate-controlled conditions would give her the best chance of passing the tests. Kelm agreed, turned off her truck, and gave her keys to Krause. In accordance with department policy, Krause put Kelm in handcuffs before placing her in the backseat of his patrol vehicle. Krause did not inform Kelm that she was under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">\u00b610 As Krause was helping Kelm buckle her seatbelt, he smelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>alcohol on Kelm\u2019s breath. Krause asked Kelm to confirm that she had only had one drink that evening. He then informed her that he could smell alcohol, and asked if she was certain that she had only had one drink; Kelm said yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b611 Krause then noticed that Kelm had not turned off her truck\u2019s lights. Kelm gave him permission to turn off the lights before they drove away so that the truck\u2019s battery would not die. Krause unlocked the pickup, reached in from the driver\u2019s side, and turned off the lights. As he was walking back to his patrol car, he noticed that the truck\u2019s dome lights still were illuminated. He opened the driver\u2019s-side door a second time and immediately noticed a half-full beer bottle on the floor as well as a plastic cup filled with a green liquid that smelled like alcohol in the passenger cup holder. After emptying the beer bottle and plastic cup in front of his cruiser, Krause asked Kelm about the green liquid. Kelm could not identify the liquid and denied that she had been drinking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b612 Krause drove Kelm to the booking room at the Sheridan County Jail, where she performed three field sobriety tests under the direction of Sheriff Deputy Darren Ginn (Ginn): a second HGN test, a \u201cwalk and turn\u201d test, and a \u201cone-leg stand\u201d test. Kelm failed each test. Like Krause, Ginn observed a \u201clack of smooth pursuit\u201d and \u201cdistinct nystagmus at maximum deviation\u201d during the HGN test. During the walk and turn test, Kelm failed to follow directions by walking too soon, raising her arms while walking, and making an improper turn. She also was unable to walk in a straight line in a heel-toe fashion. During the one-leg stand, she swayed back and forth, raised her arms, and put her foot down too soon. Ginn and Krause did not ask Kelm any potentially incriminating questions while administering the sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b613 Following the sobriety tests, Ginn read to Kelm an implied consent advisory form. Ginn informed Kelm that she was under arrest for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and that, under Montana law, she was deemed to have given her implied consent to either a blood or breath test for alcohol. This was the first time a law enforcement officer told Kelm that she was under arrest. Ginn also explained that Kelm\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>right to an attorney did not apply during the testing procedure and advised her of the consequences if she refused to take the test. Kelm signed the form and agreed to take a breath test. The test showed that her blood alcohol content was 0.198-over twice the legal limit. Krause then read Kelm her <em>Miranda </em>rights for the first time. Kelm signed a form indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>that she understood her rights and stated she did not wish to further speak with law enforcement. Krause then formally booked Kelm into the Sheridan County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b614 Later that day, Kelm appeared before the Sheridan County Justice Court and was charged with three separate counts: (1) unlawful possession of an open alcoholic beverage container in a motor vehicle, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-460, MCA; (2) failure to drive on the right side of a roadway, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA; and (3) driving under the influence of alcohol, first offense, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. After the Justice Court denied Kelm\u2019s motion to suppress all evidence collected after her arrest, Kelm pleaded guilty to all three charges, but gave notice of her intention to appeal the denial of her motion to the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b615 On October 17, 2011, Kelm filed motions requesting the District Court to order the evidence against her suppressed. Kelm asserted that the State should not be allowed to introduce evidence obtained during the HGN test Krause administered, evidence of the half-full beer bottle and plastic cup that Krause took from Kelm\u2019s car as he was trying to turn off her lights, and \u201call evidence gathered prior to [her] <em>Miranda </em>warning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b616 The District Court held a hearing on the matter, and entered an order on March 28, 2012. The court denied Kelm\u2019s motion regarding the HGN test and concluded that the State could introduce evidence of Krause\u2019s HGN test after laying a proper foundation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court disagreed with the State\u2019s contention that Krause\u2019s seizure of the beer bottle and plastic cup fell within the plain view doctrine because Krause was not \u201clawfully present\u201d in Kelm\u2019s vehicle; consequently, the court granted Kelm\u2019s motion to suppress that evidence. The court also granted Kelm\u2019s motion to suppress \u201call evidence the State gathered between her arrest and [when the] <em>Miranda </em>warnings finally [were] articulated\u201d at the Sheridan County Jail. The District Court agreed with Kelm\u2019s argument that, because Deputy Krause did not satisfy \u00a7 46-6-312, MCA, and did not apprise Kelm of her <em>Miranda </em>rights immediately after arresting her, her arrest was unlawful and all evidence subsequently obtained must be suppressed. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b617 The State may appeal from any court order or judgment in a criminal case \u201cthe substantive effect of which results in... suppressing evidence.\u201d Section 46-20-103(2)(e), MCA. When reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we determine \u201cwhether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly interpreted the law and applied it to those facts.\u201d <em>State v. Nixon, </em>2013 MT 81, \u00b6 15, 369 Mont. 359, 298 P.3d 408 (quoting <em>State v. Haldane, </em>2013 MT 32, \u00b6 15, 368 Mont. 396, 300 P.3d 657). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record leaves us with a definite or firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Nixon, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6 14, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b618 Our review of constitutional questions is plenary, <em>State v. Dugan, </em>2013 MT 38, \u00b6 14, 369 Mont. 39, 303 P.3d 755, and we \u201creview for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation of constitutional law.\u201d <em>Nichols v. Dept. of Just., </em>2011 MT 33, \u00b6 8, 359 Mont. 251, 248 P.3d 813. Likewise, to the extent a district court\u2019s ruling is based on interpretation of a statute, our review is <em>de novo. State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b619 <em>1. Did the District Court incorrectly conclude that, because the arresting officer did not follow \u00a7 46-6-312, MCA, all evidence gathered after Kelm\u2019s arrest should be suppressed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b620 The District Court concluded that even though Krause had probable cause to arrest Kelm, he failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 46-6-312, MCA, when arresting her. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">A peace officer making an arrest without a warrant shall inform the person to be arrested of the officer\u2019s authority, of the intention to arrest that person, and of the cause of the arrest, except when the person to be arrested is actually engaged in the commission of or in an attempt to commit an offense or is pursued immediately after its commission, after an escape, or when the giving of the information will imperil the arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Section 46-6-312, MCA. Because Krause did not satisfy those requirements, the District Court concluded that his arrest of Kelm was unlawful and, consequently, the court suppressed \u201call evidence the State gathered after Deputy Krause arrested [Kelm].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">\u00b621 For purposes of our analysis of this case, we begin with the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>concession that \u201cat the moment Kelm was placed in handcuffs in the back of the patrol car, she was \u2018for all intents and purposes ... arrested.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State argues that Kelm\u2019s arrest was lawful because Krause had probable cause to arrest her and that Krause satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 46-6-312, MCA, because \u201cthe circumstances of the stop and arrest evident in the record are more than sufficient to establish that Kelm was informed of the necessary statutory requirements!].]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b622 When interpreting a statute, \u201cwe look first to the plain meaning of the words it contains.\u201d <em>Kluver v. PPL Mont., LLC, </em>2012 MT 321, \u00b6 55, 368 Mont. 101, 293 P.3d 817. Wfiien the language of a statute \u201cis clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation.\u201d <em>Kluver, </em>\u00b6 55. The language of \u00a7 46-6-312, MCA, makes plain that, unless certain exceptions apply, a law enforcement officer making a warrantless arrest \u201cshall inform\u201d the person being arrested of: (1) the officer\u2019s authority to arrest her; (2) the officer\u2019s intention to arrest her; and (3) the reason why she is being arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b623 During the suppression hearing, Krause agreed that \u201cat no point in time did [he] tell Ms. Kelm out at the scene of the stop that she was under arrest.\u201d We are unconvinced by the State\u2019s argument that, based on the facts and circumstances of the traffic stop, Kelm \u201cwas informed\u201d that she was under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b624  Whether or not Krause met the technical requirements of the statute, however, the District Court erred in concluding that his failure rendered Kelm\u2019s arrest unlawful. The court determined that an officer\u2019s failure to inform the arrestee of the arrest \u201cis a structural defect to the arrest itself rendering it unlawful.\u201d We have held, however, that the exclusionary rule will not apply to violations of statutory requirements unless the violation affects the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. West, </em>1998 MT 282, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 291 Mont. 435, 968 P.2d 289 (citing <em>State v. Pipkin, </em>1998 MT 143, \u00b6 27, 289 Mont. 240, 961 P.2d 733); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-5-103(1)(b), (c), MCA. The purpose of statutes like \u00a7 46-6-312, MCA, is to ensure that an officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>communicates adequately his authority and actions when there is no written warrant authorizing the arrest. <em>State v. Bradshaw, </em>53 Mont. 96, 99, 161 P. 710, 711 (1916) (holding that the officer must \u201cmake known his official character, <em>or it must be known to the </em>offender; else there is no obligation upon the latter to submit\u201d) (emphasis added). Kelm does not allege that she lacked actual knowledge of Krause\u2019s authority to arrest her, his intention to arrest her, or the reasons why he was taking her into custody. Consequently, we conclude that Krause\u2019s failure to use the words, \u201cyou are under arrest,\u201d when he placed her in the patrol car, did not impair Kelm\u2019s substantial rights. \u00b625 The lawfulness of a warrantless arrest turns on the existence of probable cause. An officer \u201cmust have probable cause to justify a warrantless <em>arrest.\u201d State v. Williamson, </em>1998 MT 199, \u00b6 12, 290 Mont. 321, 965 P.2d 231 (citing \u00a7 46-6-311(1), MCA). Thus, probable cause is the \u201cstandard set by the Constitution\u201d by which the reasonableness of a seizure is measured to determine whether the arrestee\u2019s constitutional rights have been protected. <em>Henry v. U.S., </em>361 U.S. 98, 102, 80 S. Ct. 168, 171 (1959); <em>see also Carroll v. U.S., </em>267 U.S. 132, 161, 45 S. Ct. 280, 288 (1925). Probable cause exists \u201cwhere the facts and circumstances within an officer\u2019s personal knowledge prove sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that someone is committing or has committed an offense.\u201d <em>State v. Ellington, </em>2006 MT 219, \u00b6 16, 333 Mont. 411, 143 P.3d 119 (citing <em>Williamson, </em>\u00b6 12). If supported by facts demonstrating probable cause, a warrantless arrest will be held lawful. <em>Virginia v. Moore, </em>553 U.S. 164, 171, 128 S. Ct. 1598, 1604 (2008). Krause lawfully arrested Kelm because he had probable cause to believe that Kelm was driving under the influence of alcohol. He observed Kelm driving her truck erratically across the center and fog lines of the highway, her eyes were \u201cbloodshot and glassy,\u201d and the HGN test he administered indicated Kelm was intoxicated. Kelm did not dispute that these facts were sufficient to establish probable cause for her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b626  With no indication that Kelm\u2019s substantial rights were impaired, probable cause for the arrest protects her constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures, despite any noncompliance with the arrest statute. Applying that standard, Krause\u2019s arrest of Kelm was lawful. Because the arrest was lawful, Krause\u2019s failure to satisfy all of the requirements prescribed in \u00a7 46-6-312, MCA, did not require the suppression of evidence obtained after the arrest. The District Court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b627 <em>2. Did the District Court incorrectly conclude that the officer\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>failure to advise Kelm of her </em>Miranda <em>rights at the time of her arrest required suppression of all evidence obtained after her arrest ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b628 The District Court concluded that \u201c[a]t the point of arrest, [Kelm] was entitled to a <em>Miranda </em>warning.\u201d Because Krause did not read Kelm her <em>Miranda </em>rights immediately after arresting her, the court concluded that Kelm\u2019s arrest was unlawful and it suppressed all evidence collected by the State after the arrest. The State concedes that the answers to two questions posed by Krause to Kelm while Kelm was in the patrol car should be suppressed. Nevertheless, the State contends that the court \u201cerred when it suppressed evidence obtained from Kelm that was not derived from custodial interrogation.\u201d Kelm was not entitled to a <em>Miranda </em>warning prior to the second HGN test, the field sobriety tests that she completed at the jail, or the Intoxilyzer breath test, according to the State, because the results of those tests were not self-incriminating statements that must be suppressed in the absence of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver. We agree with the State that Kelm\u2019s responses to Krause\u2019s two questions comprise the only evidence that must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b629 The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution both provide that no person shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself. <em>State v. Larson, </em>2010 MT 236, \u00b6 28, 358 Mont. 156, 243 P.3d 1130 (citing <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 13, 314 Mont. 402, 66 P.3d 297). When an individual \u201cis taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way <em>and is subjected to questioning,\u201d </em>he \u201c \u2018must be adequately and effectively apprised of his [Miranda] rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 28 (quoting <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 467, 478, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1624, 1630 (1966)) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-6-107, MCA. Failure by law enforcement officers to provide a <em>Miranda </em>warning and obtain a waiver of rights prior to a custodial interrogation \u201cgenerally requires exclusion <em>of any statements obtained.\u201d Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b630  Although the constitutional protections under <em>Miranda </em>are afforded during a custodial interrogation, those protections generally do not attach during field sobriety tests or breath tests because \u201cthe privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to real or objective evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735; <em>see also Schmerber v. Cal., </em>384 U.S. 757, 764, 86 S. Ct. 1826, 1832 (1966). The Fifth Amendment \u201coffers no protection against compulsion ... to assume a stance, to walk, or to make a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>gesture.\u201d <em>State v. Armfield, </em>214 Mont. 229, 235, 693 P.2d 1226, 1229-30 (1984) <em>(overruled on other grounds, State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6 41, 318 Mont. 150, 79 P.3d 270). Consequently, a \u201cmere request that the suspect perform a series of sobriety tests, done without any interrogation of the suspect, does not constitute a custodial interrogation\u201d and does not require law enforcement officers to read a suspect his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to administering those tests. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>see also State v. Thompson, </em>237 Mont. 384, 386-88, 773 P.2d 722, 723-24 (1989). Similarly, the Fifth Amendment offers no protection against compulsion to submit to a breath test because \u201c[t]he results of a breath test are not self-incriminating communications,\u201d but instead are \u201cunprotected \u2018physical or real\u2019 evidence.\u201d <em>Armfield, </em>214 Mont. at 235, 693 P.2d at 1229-30; <em>see also State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 61, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636. Because a compulsory breath test is not a custodial interrogation, a law enforcement officer is not required to read a suspect his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to administering the test. <em>Missoula v. Forest, </em>236 Mont. 129, 133-34, 769 P.2d 699, 701-02 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b631  The District Court erred in concluding that Krause\u2019s failure to give Kelm a <em>Miranda </em>warning immediately following her arrest required suppression of all evidence subsequently obtained. A <em>Miranda </em>warning is required only prior to a custodial interrogation. The State concedes that the District Court properly suppressed the two self-incriminating statements Kelm made in response to Krause\u2019s questions after he placed her in the patrol vehicle. The results of the second HGN test, the field sobriety tests, the Intoxilyzer test and other non-testimonial evidence gathered at the jail should not have been suppressed, however, because those results are real or objective evidence not protected by the right against self-incrimination. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s suppression of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b632 3. <em>Did the District Court incorrectly conclude that evidence seized from Kelm\u2019s vehicle must be suppressed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b633 The State argued that Krause lawfully seized the beer bottle and plastic cup containing alcohol from Kelm\u2019s truck without a warrant under the plain view doctrine, which \u201cpermits the seizure of evidence that otherwise could not be seized without a warrant^]\u201d <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 24, 340 Mont. 10, 171 P.3d 731. The District Court rejected the State\u2019s argument that the seizure fell within the plain view doctrine because it concluded that Krause was not \u201clawfully present\u201d in Kelm\u2019s truck when he seized the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u00b634 We use three criteria for determining whether a police officer\u2019s seizure of evidence was valid under the plain view doctrine: (1) \u201cthe officer must be lawfully at the place from which he could plainly view the evidence\u201d; (2) \u201cthe item must be in plain view and its incriminating character be immediately apparent\u201d; and (3) the officer \u201cmust also have a lawful right of access to the object itself.\u201d <em>State v. Doyle, </em>1998 MT 195, \u00b6 11, 290 Mont. 287, 963 P.2d 1255. We addressed an issue similar to that raised by Kelm in <em>State v. Delao, </em>2006 MT 179, 333 Mont. 68, 140 P.3d 1065. A highway patrol officer arrested Delao and placed him in the backseat of his cruiser while Delao\u2019s vehicle, which was parked on the side of the road, remained unsecured with the doors unlocked and the windows opened. <em>Delao, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. As the officer attempted to secure the vehicle, he seized a bottle of vodka in plain view in the vehicle. <em>Delao, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8. We concluded that the officer \u201chad an obligation to secure Delao\u2019s vehicle\u201d so as to prevent damage to or theft of the vehicle because doing so \u201cfell within the ambit of the slight duty of care that [the officer] owed to Delao\u201d as a gratuitous bailee. <em>Delao, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-20 (citing <em>State v. Sawyer, </em>174 Mont. 512, 517-18, 571 P.2d 1131, 1134 (1977)). For that reason, we concluded that the officer \u201cwas lawfully present inside Delao\u2019s vehicle\u201d when he seized the bottle of vodka. <em>Delao, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b635 Kelm argues that the District Court properly distinguished <em>Delao </em>because the windows of Kelm\u2019s truck were rolled up and the doors were locked. The court determined that \u201c[t]here was no better chance that the contents of [Kelm\u2019s] vehicle itself would be damaged or taken if Deputy Krause left the lights on than if he did not.\u201d Although Kelm also contends that Krause exceeded his duty under <em>Delao </em>because he stood \u201cat the open door of Ms. Kelm\u2019s pickup for more than a minute talking on the phone\u201d prior to seizing the evidence, she did not raise this argument before the District Court and we refuse to consider it for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 38, 330 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b636 Consistent with precedent, we conclude that Krause\u2019s decision to turn off the lights in Kelm\u2019s truck prior to driving her to the jail fell within the slight duty of care that he owed Kelm as her gratuitous bailee. <em>Delao, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-20 (citing <em>Sawyer, </em>174 Mont, at 517-18, 571 P.2d at 1134). Kelm\u2019s truck was parked on the side of an icy highway in subzero temperatures. It was reasonable for Krause to believe that, if he did not turn off the truck\u2019s lights, the truck\u2019s battery would go dead while Kelm was performing her sobriety tests. If she passed those tests, Krause would then have to return Kelm to a vehicle parked on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the side of the road in sub-zero temperatures that could not start. In such an event, Krause would be slightly responsible for Kelm\u2019s safety and the condition of her truck. Given these circumstances, Krause made a reasonable effort to perform the duty of care set forth in <em>Sawyer </em>and <em>Delao. Delao, </em>\u00b6 20. In light of this conclusion, we need not consider Kelm\u2019s argument that her consent to have Krause turn off the headlights in her truck was not freely given.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b637  We hold that Krause was lawfully present in Kelm\u2019s vehicle when he seized the beer bottle and plastic cup. <em>Delao, </em>\u00b6 31. Krause had lawful access to the beer bottle and plastic cup. Those items were in plain view and the incriminating nature of those items immediately was apparent. Accordingly, the District Court erred in granting Kelm\u2019s motion to suppress those items. <em>See Delao, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b638  The District Court erred in suppressing all of the evidence gathered after Kelm was taken into custody, except for Kelm\u2019s answers to two questions asked by Krause while Kelm was handcuffed and in the backseat of Krause\u2019s patrol car. Because we affirm the District Court\u2019s suppression of those statements, Kelm \u201cprevails on appeal\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, and, pursuant to that statute, she must be allowed to withdraw the guilty plea she entered in Justice Court. Section 46-12-204(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b639 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the Sheridan County Justice Court to provide Kelm the opportunity to withdraw her guilty plea and proceed to trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\"> Kelm has not cross-appealed this finding and it is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> The State suggests on appeal that \u201c[i]t was arguable on the facts presented that Kelm was not \u2018under arrest\u2019 during the short trip to the station to complete field sobriety tests, but only reasonably and temporarily detained for appropriate investigative purposes made necessary under the circumstances.\u201d It agrees, however, that it is bound by its concession before the District Court. We therefore assume without deciding that Kelm was under arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
