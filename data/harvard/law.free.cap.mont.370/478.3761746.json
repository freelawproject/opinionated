We affirm, and address the issue:</p>\n<p id=\"A3Aa\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Prindle\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea as involuntarily entered?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">\u00b63 On the evening of May 1, 2008, Prindle, the driver of a Honda SUV carrying Katie Grant (Grant) and Brianna Coe (Coe) as passengers, inexplicably pulled out in front James Archer (Archer), the driver and sole occupant of a Buick sedan, on a road just outside Billings city limits. Archer\u2019s vehicle had the right of way. The front of Archer\u2019s sedan struck the side of Prindle\u2019s SUV, causing a \u201cT-Bone\u201d style collision. At 7:45 p.m., Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Brian Sampson (Trooper Sampson) was dispatched to the accident. All four individuals involved in the accident were injured and were receiving medical treatment when Trooper Sampson arrived. Archer\u2019s injuries required a number of surgeries, and he suffered loss of physical and mental abilities. Grant suffered several injuries including facial scarring, and Coe sustained a traumatic head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">\u00b64 Trooper Sampson\u2019s investigation pointed to marijuana use by Prindle as a contributing cause to the collision. Trooper Sampson was unable to speak to Archer and Coe at the scene because they were being transported for surgery, but was able to talk to Grant. Grant had previously told medical responders that she and Prindle had ingested marijuana a couple hours before the accident. Grant confirmed this statement to Trooper Sampson and added the detail that she and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Prindle had smoked \u201ca couple bowls\u201d of marijuana. Grant was then taken to the hospital where Trooper Sampson resumed his questioning. Grant said she and Prindle smoked marijuana \u201cright after [she] got out of school.\u201d Grant\u2019s parents were present, and Grant\u2019s father received Trooper Sampson\u2019s permission to retrieve Grant\u2019s cell phone and purse from Prindle\u2019s car, which had been towed from the scene. When looking for these items, Grant\u2019s father discovered a marijuana pipe and scale on the floorboards of Prindle\u2019s SUV. The pipe and scale were taken as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b65 The State charged Prindle with three counts of negligent vehicular assault, one count of criminal endangerment, and one count of driving while suspended. Matthew Claus (Claus) was appointed as Prindle\u2019s public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b66 Claus investigated the State\u2019s case against Prindle. Through discovery, he received police reports and diagrams, medical records and other documents. He made copies of these documents for Prindle, and mailed him additional discovery as it was received from the State. Claus met with Prindle on numerous occasions in his office to discuss the case and communicated with Prindle by telephone. During these conversations, Prindle repeatedly voiced interest in pleading guilty if he could receive a suspended or deferred sentence rather than taking the case to trial whereafter, if convicted, he could face prison time. Prindle told Claus his sole memory of the evening of the accident was that he was the driver, and said he only knew what had happened from talking to Grant and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b67 Claus interviewed Grant and Prindle\u2019s mother. Grant explained that she had met up with Prindle after school at a grocery store. From there, they picked up Prindle\u2019s mother from work and dropped her off at home. Then they picked up marijuana, and drove around smoking a \u201cblunt\u201d for roughly a half hour before heading to Coe\u2019s house, where she and Coe \u201csplit a beer.\u201d The accident occurred shortly after they left Coe\u2019s house. Grant said that she did not think Prindle was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the accident. Prindle\u2019s mother said she did not think Prindle appeared under the influence of marijuana when he picked her up at approximately 5:00 p.m. However, unlike Grant\u2019s account, Prindle\u2019s mother said Prindle was alone when he picked her up.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b68 Claus discussed this information with Prindle. Prindle asked Claus to find out how long the impairing effects of marijuana lasted. Claus found an article published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA Article) explaining that marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>users\u2019 motor skills, behavior, perception and cognition were typically impaired for three to five hours after ingesting the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b69 Claus and Prindle met again to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the State\u2019s case and assess a plea offer from the State. Claus explained the State\u2019s case was not the strongest, but there was still sufficient evidence for a jury to find him guilty based on Grant\u2019s testimony of his marijuana use in the hours preceding the accident. The State\u2019s plea offer was for a suspended sentence recommendation, so Prindle asked Claus to see if the State would agree to recommend a deferred sentence. Claus made the counter offer to the State, and the State agreed. Prindle would plead guilty to one count of negligent vehicular assault and driving while suspended; in return, the State would dismiss the other charges and recommend a six-year deferred sentence on the remaining negligent vehicular assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b610 During the summer of 2010, Prindle moved to Oregon to pursue a career in snowboarding. On August 24,2010, Prindle signed the plea agreement and appeared for a change-of-plea hearing. He hand-wrote on the plea agreement that he was pleading guilty because: \u201cOn May 1st, 2008,1 drove my vehicle o[n] marijuana and negligently caused serious bodily injury to James Archer, Brianna Coe, and Kati[e] Grant in Yellowstone County.\u201d Prindle also acknowledged in the agreement that the court was not obligated to accept the agreement and could instead sentence him to different terms. At the change-of-plea hearing, the judge asked if Prindle understood that the court did not have to accept the plea agreement\u2019s recommended sentence and that Prindle could receive the maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Prindle said he understood, and stated he was satisfied with Claus\u2019s work. Prindle then pled guilty, and his sentencing hearing was set for a later date. In the meantime, Prindle returned to Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b611 In January 2011, Prindle returned to Montana for his sentencing hearing. The District Court sentenced Prindle in accordance with the plea agreement. Prindle expected to immediately return to Oregon, but when he reported to his probation officer, he was informed that protocol required Prindle to complete 90 days on supervision \u201cwithout issues\u201d before he was permitted to leave Montana. Prindle filed a notice of appeal on May 19,2011, but then moved the District Court for leave to withdraw his plea. Prindle filed an unopposed motion with this Court to remand the matter to the District Court to adjudicate his motion to withdraw. This Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b612 The District Court held a hearing on Prindle\u2019s motion and took testimony from several witnesses. Prindle\u2019s mother testified but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>provided no new relevant information. Prindle testified that he would have gone to trial if he had known just how weak the State\u2019s case was or had Claus not incorrectly assured him there was \u201cno reason\u201d why he would not be able to immediately return to Oregon. Prindle further alleged that during the August 24, 2010 change-of-plea hearing, he had informed the judge that Claus had told him he would be able to return to Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b613 Prindle also called Dr. Jennifer Souders (Dr. Souders), an expert on impairment due to marijuana use, to opine that Claus should have hired an expert to determine whether Prindle was still under the influence of marijuana at the time of the accident. While Dr. Souders criticized the NHTSA Article used by Claus for academic shortcomings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she agreed with its conclusion that, for driving purposes, impairment from marijuana generally lasts around three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b614 Claus testified about his representation of Prindle. Claus stated that the critical issue in the case was the timing of Prindle\u2019s marijuana use. He said he recognized the conflict between Grant\u2019s statement that she and Prindle had smoked marijuana after taking Prindle\u2019s mother home <em>together </em>and Prindle\u2019s mother\u2019s statement that Prindle was <em>alone </em>when he took her home. He also recognized that Grant\u2019s recollection of when she and Prindle smoked had changed from \u201cright after school\u201d to after taking Prindle\u2019s mother home. Claus believed, however, that a jury would most likely resolve this conflict by concluding that Grant had smoked marijuana with Prindle after Prindle left his mother\u2019s house. This placed Prindle within the three-hour window of impairment discussed in the NHTSA Article. Claus explained that he had not conducted further interviews primarily because Prindle did not want to go to trial and a deferred sentence was therefore his best option.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b615 The District Court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and denied Prindle\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea on May 30, 2012. The court concluded that Prindle\u2019s plea was entered voluntarily because Claus never promised that Prindle would be allowed to reside in Oregon and Claus had conducted adequate research to advise his client concerning marijuana impairment. Prindle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b616 The ultimate question of whether a plea is voluntarily made is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>State v. Brinson, </em>2009 MT 200, \u00b6 3, 351 Mont. 136, 210 P.3d 164. Consequently, we review a district court\u2019s ultimate denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea de novo. <em>Brinson, </em>\u00b6 10. However, we review the district court\u2019s underlying factual findings regarding the voluntariness of the plea to determine if they are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b617 Montana law permits a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea within one year of final judgment for \u201cgood cause.\u201d Section 46-16-105(2), MCA. Good cause exists when the defendant\u2019s plea was involuntarily entered. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 16.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A plea must be voluntary because the defendant is waiving his constitutional rights to not incriminate himself and to a trial by jury. <em>Brady v. U.S., </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1468-69 (1970). We utilize the <em>Brady </em>standard to determine if a plea was voluntarily made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">\u201cA plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel, must stand unless induced by threats (or promises to discontinue improper harassment), misrepresentation (including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises), or perhaps by promises that are by their nature improper to the prosecutor\u2019s business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 755, 90 S. Ct. at 1472). \u201c \u2018Where a defendant is represented by counsel during the plea process and enters his plea upon the advice of counsel, the voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel\u2019s advice was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. McFarlane, </em>2008 MT 18, \u00b6 11, 341 Mont. 166, 176 P.3d 1057 (quoting <em>Hans v. State, </em>283 Mont. 379, 411, 942 P.2d 674, 693 (1997) (citing <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 56, 106 S. Ct. 366, 369 (1985)). Thus, applying the test articulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Ct. 2052 (1984), a defendant seeking to withdraw his guilty plea because he received ineffective assistance must show: \u201c(1) that his counsel\u2019s advice fell outside the range of competence demanded of a criminal attorney, and (2) but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he would not have entered a guilty plea.\u201d <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 410-11, 942 P.2d at 693); <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 57-59, 106 S. Ct. at 369-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Prindle\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea as involuntarily entered?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b619 Prindle argues that his guilty plea was involuntary for three reasons. First, he asserts that Claus provided ineffective assistance when investigating his case because he failed to retain an expert on marijuana impairment and failed to interview certain witnesses. These omissions, Prindle asserts, led Claus to overestimate the strength of the State\u2019s case, which, in turn, caused Prindle to plead guilty instead of going to trial. Second, Prindle claims that Claus failed to inform him that Negligent Endangerment was a lesser-included offense of Negligent Vehicular Assault. Third, Prindle asserts that Claus improperly told him that he would be permitted to immediately return to Oregon if he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"AQ0\">\u00b620 In <em>State v. Thomas, </em>285 Mont. 112, 117-18, 946 P.2d 140, 143 (1997), we adopted the <em>Strickland </em>standard for analyzing a criminal counsel\u2019s duty to investigate. <em>Strickland </em>held that \u201ccounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2066; <em>Thomas, </em>285 Mont. at 119, 946 P.2d at 144. In turn, whether an investigation is \u201creasonable\u201d will depend in part on the client\u2019s goals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cThe reasonableness of counsel\u2019s actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant\u2019s own statements or actions. Counsel\u2019s actions are usually based, quite properly, on informed strategic choices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant. In particular, what investigation decisions are reasonable depends critically on such information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\"><em>Thomas, </em>285 Mont. at 117-18, 946 P.2d at 143 <em>(quoting Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2066). Thus, a defendant\u2019s intent to plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>guilty narrows the scope of investigation necessary to be \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Smith v. Mahoney, </em>611 F.3d 978, 987 (9th Cir. 2010) (\u201cSmith\u2019s intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not eliminate, his attorney\u2019s duty to reasonably investigate.\u201d). The pertinent question is, based on the defendant\u2019s particular goals, did counsel \u201cfamiliarize him- or herself sufficiently with the facts of the defendant\u2019s case to make an informed recommendation regarding a plea bargain.\u201d John M. Burkoff &amp; Nancy M. Burkoff, <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel, </em>\u00a7 6.5 at 238 (West Publ. Co. 2011 ed.); <em>cf. Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 23 (reasoning that \u201ccase-specific considerations\u201d determine whether a plea is voluntary); <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 19 (same); <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 17 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b621 <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Strickland </em>direct that the reasonableness of Claus\u2019s investigation is judged in light of Prindle\u2019s desire to avoid trial. The record demonstrates that from the outset Prindle was definite about avoiding the risk of prison time by obtaining a plea agreement with a suspended or deferred sentence. Claus followed Prindle\u2019s directive, and undertook plea negotiations with the State. He was successful in obtaining a deal by which Prindle ultimately received a deferred sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b622 Given Prindle\u2019s goals, Claus became sufficiently familiar with the facts of the case to make an informed recommendation that Prindle should plead guilty. Claus reviewed Trooper Sampson\u2019s investigative reports, which memorialized Grant\u2019s statement at the accident scene that she had smoked \u201ca couple bowls\u201d of marijuana with Prindle before the accident. Claus listened to Trooper Sampson\u2019s recorded interview of Grant at the hospital, where she again admitted to smoking marijuana with Prindle. Claus independently interviewed Grant, who again confirmed she smoked marijuana with Prindle during the hours leading up to the accident. There was other objective evidence of Prindle\u2019s marijuana use: the marijuana pipe and scale found on the floorboards of his SUV. Claus prudently advised Prindle that based on this evidence, a jury could find him guilty of all four counts of negligent vehicular assault and he could face prison time for the convictions. Claus\u2019s advice to Prindle to plead guilty in exchange for a deferred sentence was very reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b623 Prindle alleges that Claus was required to interview the other victims, Archer and Coe, and Coe\u2019s family members \u201cwho were present in their home with Mr. Prindle for at least an hour before the accident.\u201d However, the record does not indicate what these witnesses would have said. Contrary to Prindle\u2019s assertion, there is nothing in the record to show that Coe\u2019s family members were even at home when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Prindle and Grant were there. Neither Coe nor any member of her family testified at the plea withdrawal hearing. \u201cIn cases where counsel fails to conduct adequate pretrial investigation we focus our inquiry as to what information would have been obtained from such investigation and whether such information would have produced a different result.\u201d <em>Weaver v. State, </em>2005 MT 158, \u00b6 21, 327 Mont. 441, 114 P.3d 1039 (citing <em>State v. Denny, </em>262 Mont. 248, 255, 865 P.2d 226, 230 (1993)). Without knowing what testimony Prindle\u2019s witnesses would have provided, Prindle cannot demonstrate that Claus\u2019s failure to interview them prejudiced his decision to plead guilty. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 16, 21-23 (Weaver failed to \u201ccarry his burden\u201d of establishing his counsel\u2019s failure to interview \u201cpotential alibi witnesses, other suspects, and persons who allegedly heard confessions by persons other than Weaver\u201d prejudiced his murder trial when he did not have those witnesses testify at hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b624  Prindle\u2019s assertion that Claus should have hired an expert on marijuana impairment has a similar defect. The NHTSA Article used by Claus concluded that, for driving purposes, a person is impaired for three to five hours after ingesting marijuana. Prindle\u2019s expert, Dr. Souders, agreed that a marijuana user is generally impaired for three hours. Grant said she and Prindle drove around smoking for roughly a half hour after taking Prindle\u2019s mother home from work. Prindle\u2019s mother\u2019s work shift ended at 5:00 p.m., and Trooper Sampson was dispatched to the accident at 7:45 p.m. Thus, there was evidence to establish that Prindle\u2019s marijuana use was within the three hour window of impairment, a point on which the NHTSA Article and Dr. Souders agreed. Prindle has failed to demonstrate how hiring an expert who offered such a similar conclusion would have prompted him to reject the plea offer and proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b625  Prindle\u2019s assertions that Claus should have interviewed certain witnesses and retained an expert on marijuana impairment fail to satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong. Even if we were to determine that a competent defense attorney would have performed these tasks, Prindle has failed to demonstrate how interviewing the witnesses or hiring a marijuana expert would have changed his mind about pleading guilty. <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u00b626 Next, Prindle argues that Claus provided ineffective assistance because he failed to tell him that Negligent Endangerment is a lesser-included offense of Negligent Vehicular Assault. He correctly points out that a plea may be involuntary if the defendant is not informed of a lesser-included offense. <em>See State v. Sanders, </em>1999 MT 136, \u00b6 22, 294 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Mont. 539, 982 P.2d 1015 (overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Deserly, </em>2008 MT 242, \u00b6 12 n. 1, 344 Mont. 468, 188 P.3d 1057). However, the record leaves no doubt that Prindle was informed that Negligent Endangerment was a possible lesser-included offense to his charges. On the first page of Prindle\u2019s plea agreement, he acknowledged that Claus explained to him and advised him that Negligent Endangerment was a lesser-included offense of his charges. During the August 24,2010 change-of-plea hearing, the District Court asked Prindle if he was still willing to plead guilty after being informed that a jury could find him guilty of the lesser-included offense of Negligent Endangerment. Prindle responded, \u2018Yes, sir.\u201d Prindle\u2019s argument on this point has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b627  The District Court correctly concluded that Prindle failed to demonstrate Claus rendered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">B. Prindle\u2019s Expectation He Could Immediately Return to</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Oregon Following Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b628 The District Court ruled that Prindle\u2019s plea was not involuntary on this ground because no \u201cpromise\u201d was made to Prindle that he would be allowed to return to Oregon following his sentencing, noting that \u201cthe possibility always existed that the Court could impose a sentence of incarceration.\u201d Prindle argues that the District Court\u2019s conclusion misses the \u201csalient point\u201d that Prindle\u2019s plea was involuntary because he was led to \u201creasonably believe\u201d he would be allowed to return to Oregon. In other words, Prindle argues that his plea was involuntary because Claus wrongly predicted a consequence of pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\u00b629 \u201cA guilty plea is not voluntary if induced by misrepresentation, including an unfulfilled promise.\u201d <em>Lepera v. U.S., </em>587 F.2d 433, 436 n. 4 (9th Cir. 1978) (citing <em>Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 755, 90 S. Ct. at 1472); <em>accord State v. Valdez-Mendoza, </em>2011 MT 214, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 503, 260 P.3d 151 (defense counsel\u2019s statements that defendant could not receive a fair trial based on race or ethnicity was a misrepresentation that rendered guilty plea involuntary). An erroneous prediction by defense counsel can rise to the level of a misrepresentation. <em>See e.g. Iaea v. Sunn, </em>800 F.2d 861 (9th Cir. 1986). However, not all erroneous predictions by defense counsel rise to the level of misrepresentation contemplated by <em>Brady </em>or <em>Strickland, </em>as explained by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Iaea. Iaea, </em>800 F.2d at 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">\u00b630 In <em>Iaea, </em>the defendant was charged with eleven felonies and one misdemeanor. <em>Iaea, </em>800 F.2d at 862. Defense counsel urged Iaea to plead guilty because \u201chis chances of acquittal were slight and that if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>was convicted, he would be subject to Hawaii\u2019s minimum, sentencing law,\u201d \u201cthere was a good chance of his getting probation if he accepted the plea bargain,\u201d and \u201cthe chance of his getting an extended sentence was \u2018almost zero.\u2019 \u201d <em>Iaea, </em>800 F.2d at 863. Relying on this advice, Iaea pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to life in prison. <em>Iaea, </em>800 F.2d at 863. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that Iaea\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because his erroneous predictions were numerous and serious: counsel seriously erred in informing Iaea that he could avoid Hawaii\u2019s minimum sentencing statute only if he pled guilty because the relevant version of Hawaii\u2019s minimum-sentencing statute did not apply to Iaea; counsel\u2019s advice that the likelihood of Iaea\u2019s receiving an extended or a life sentence was \u201cpractically non-existent\u201d and that he might receive probation was flawed; and counsel was aware that the prosecutor was seeking an extended sentence. <em>Iaea, </em>800 F.2d at 864-65. The court held \u201c[tjhough a mere inaccurate prediction, standing alone, would not constitute ineffective assistance, the gross mischaracterization of the likely outcome presented in this case, combined with the erroneous advice on the possible effects of going to trial, falls below the level of competence required of defense attorneys.\u201d <em>Iaea, </em>800 F.2d at 865 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b631 In <em>Womack v. Del Papa, </em>497 F.3d 998, 1003-1004 (9th Cir. 2007), Womack was charged with two counts of attempted murder with a deadly weapon, three counts of first degree kidnapping of a minor with use of a deadly weapon, and one count each of burglary, forgery, and possession of a credit or debit card without cardholder consent. <em>Womack, </em>497 F.3d at 1000. Relying on defense counsel\u2019s advice that the judge would impose the minimum sentence for each count-meaning he would receive 30 to 40 years in prison-the defendant pled guilty. <em>Womack, </em>497 F.3d at 999. Womack was sentenced to eight life terms without the possibility of parole. <em>Womack, </em>497 F.3d at 999. Womack moved to withdraw his guilty plea, asserting his attorney\u2019s advice was a \u201c \u2018gross mischaracterization of the likely outcome\u2019 that fell below the level of competence required of defense attorneys.\u201d <em>Womack, </em>497 F.3d at 1002 (quoting <em>Iaea, </em>800 F.2d at 865). The Ninth Circuit disagreed, reasoning the case was distinguishable because, unlike the defendant in <em>Iaea, </em>Womack was not reluctant to plead guilty, and Womack\u2019s attorney\u2019s incorrect advice did not rise to the level of grossly erroneous as in <em>Iaea. Womack, </em>497 F.3d at 1003 (\u201cthere is no other evidence in the record that would elevate Womack\u2019s attorney\u2019s prediction to the level of Iaea\u2019s counsel\u2019s patently erroneous advice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u00b632  Here, Prindle\u2019s claim falls comfortably on the <em>Womack </em>end of the spectrum. Prindle points us to statements in the record that demonstrate that Claus predicted Prindle would be able to serve probation in Oregon. <em>See Brinson, </em>\u00b6 12 (a defendant\u2019s allegation that his plea was based on a misrepresentation \u201cmust be supported by objective proof in the record.\u201d). However, even assuming that Claus\u2019s statement that he saw \u201cno reason\u201d why Prindle could not immediately commence serving his probation in Oregon was incorrect, that error constitutes a \u201cmere inaccurate prediction,\u201d and not a \u201cgross mischaracterization of the likely outcome.\u201d Unlike <em>Iaea, </em>and even <em>Womack, </em>where the defendant\u2019s lawyer predicted leniency but the court imposed life sentences, Prindle received the sentence agreed upon in the plea agreement. A failure to accurately predict that Prindle would have to complete 90 days in Montana on good behavior before returning to Oregon does not rise to the level of gross mischaracterizations present in <em>Iaea. </em>And, unlike <em>Iaea, </em>Prindle was not reluctant to plead guilty-he affirmatively directed Claus to pursue a favorable plea agreement so he could avoid the risk of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"AFm\">\u00b633 The District Court correctly concluded that Prindle\u2019s plea was not involuntarily entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> Dr. Souders took issue with the Article because it was not peer-reviewed and she felt that its conclusion that some \u201cpsychological impairment\u201d lasts up to 24 hours after ingesting marijuana was \u201coverstated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\"> In <em>State v.
