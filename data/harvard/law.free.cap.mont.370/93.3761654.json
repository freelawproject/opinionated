A jury found that John Bradford (John) was not liable in negligence for the death of Margaret Howard (Margaret). Howards appeal from the judgment entered in favor of the Bradfords. We affirm and address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err by permitting the defense expert to offer opinions, including video simulations, without a sufficient evidentiary foundation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did Bradfords violate the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure by failing to supplement the disclosure of the defense expert?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">\u00b64 3. <em>Did the District Court err by denying Howards\u2019 motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">\u00b65 On June 12, 2010, Margaret was driving south and John was driving north on U.S. Highway 212, a two-lane highway, south of Red Lodge. The two vehicles collided, coming to rest along the fog line in Margaret\u2019s southbound lane. Neither Margaret nor John survived, and there were no witnesses who could testify to the events leading up to the crash.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Local resident Julia Higgins (Higgins) arrived at the scene shortly after the accident and provided a witness statement to Montana Highway Patrol (MHP). MHP troopers investigated the accident and ultimately prepared a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u00b66 At her deposition, Higgins stated that she was traveling south on Highway 212. She said she saw John\u2019s truck approaching in the northbound lane but did not see Margaret\u2019s vehicle until she after she had arrived at the scene of the accident. Higgins said the crash occurred on a section of Highway 212 that was obscured by a small rise when traveling southbound. Howards\u2019 counsel asked: \u201cDo you have any memory of seeing [Margaret\u2019s] car before the accident at all?\u201d to which Julia responded, \u201cNo. Never saw it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b67 Both parties sought to reconstruct the accident. Howards retained two accident reconstructionists, but did not present the testimony of either at trial. Instead, they presented a partial accident reconstruction prepared by Trooper Hensley, who testified that, based on the final resting position of the vehicles, his opinion was that John\u2019s vehicle crossed the center line and hit Margaret\u2019s vehicle in the southbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b68 Dr. Harry Townes (Townes), an engineer, was retained by Bradfords to reconstruct the accident. Townes visited the accident scene to take measurements and make observations. Townes used a computer program called the Engineering Dynamics Simulation Model of Automobile Collisions Version 4 (EDSMAC4) to simulate events leading up to the accident. The computer program pairs known variables with unknown pre-collision variables and runs trial scenarios to identify vehicle conditions before the accident. When a simulation of combined known and unknown variables results in a match of the known final resting positions of the vehicles, that combination of pre-collision conditions is considered, in Townes\u2019 opinion, tobe a viable explanation of the vehicle trajectory leading to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b69 Townes\u2019 expert witness disclosure statement included his opinion that Margaret \u201cmade an excursion into the northbound lane\u201d and John \u201cmade an evasive maneuver\u201d to avoid Margaret\u2019s oncoming vehicle. Townes\u2019 disclosure stated that he formed his opinion based upon the computer simulation results that incorporated MHP measurements and his measurements taken from the accident scene, the physical dimensions and weights of the vehicles, and data from the airbag control module in Margaret\u2019s vehicle. Townes\u2019 disclosure did not reference witness Higgins or her statement. During Townes\u2019 subsequent deposition, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">[Howards\u2019 counsel]: Is there any physical evidence at the scene ... to support my client being in your client\u2019s lane of travel. [Townes]: Yes, there\u2019s a witness. Physical evidence, no; there is a witness, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>[Howards\u2019 counsel]: And I\u2019m asking you about physical evidence. [Townes]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">[Howards\u2019 counsel]: Okay. And the witness you\u2019re referring to is Julia Higgins?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">[Townes]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">[Howards\u2019 counsel]: Okay. And that\u2019s the only evidence that supports my client being in your client\u2019s lane of travel prior to this accident, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">[Townes]: No, the simulation is also evidence that supports it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">Townes was asked about Higgins again later in the deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">[Howards\u2019 counsel]: Would you agree with me that we don\u2019t know-Julia Higgins\u2019 statement, and I understand that you\u2019re relying on that-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Art\">[Townes]: No, I\u2019m not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">[Howards\u2019 counsel]: You\u2019re not, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">[Townes]: No. It\u2019s not anywhere in my disclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">[Howards\u2019 counsel]: Well, then, setting aside Julia Higgins\u2019 statement...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">\u00b610 Howards filed a motion in limine prior to trial seeking exclusion of Townes\u2019 opinions and the computer model simulations on the grounds they were \u201cspeculative, unscientific or not proper subjects for expert opinion.\u201d The District Court did not rule on Howards\u2019 motion in limine before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">\u00b611 At trial, Townes testified, \u201cI reviewed the information that was available to me. And that would include the Montana Highway Patrol report, the witness-one witness statement that Montana Highway Patrol took.\u201d He further stated that he used known physical information as input variables in the computer simulations, including the MHP measurements of the final resting positions of the vehicles, his measurements from the accident scene, the physical properties of the vehicles, and the data from the control module sensor in Margaret\u2019s vehicle. Townes testified that the computer program was \u201ca well-recognized program, widely used, tested extensively.\u201d Townes explained that his computer simulations led him to conclude that Margaret \u201cmade an excursion into the northbound lane\u201d and John \u201cmade an evasive maneuver\u201d to avoid Margaret\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">\u00b612 The jury returned a verdict for Bradfords, finding John not negligent. Howards filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied by the District Court. Howards appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b613 Admissibility of evidence is a question for the district court, which we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cottrell v. Burlington N. </em>R.R., 261 Mont. 296, 301, 863 P.2d 381, 384 (1993). A district court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible. <em>McCormack v. Andres, </em>2008 MT 182, \u00b6 22, 343 Mont. 424, 185 P.3d 973. \u201cThe trial court is vested with <em>great </em>latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony.\u201d <em>Cottrell, </em>261 Mont. at 301, 863 P.2d at 384 (emphasis in original). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion of a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>Perdue v. Gagnon Farms, Inc., </em>2003 MT 47, \u00b6 8, 314 Mont. 303, 65 P.3d 570. \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice.\u201d <em>McCormack, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court err by permitting the defense expert to offer opinions, including video simulations, without a sufficient evidentiary foundation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b615 Howards do not dispute that Townes was qualified to testify as an expert but argue that he laid insufficient factual information for his opinion testimony and that his methods of reconstruction were not reliable. They argue that Townes\u2019 offered \u201cnothing more than a <em>mere possibility\u201d </em>and that his opinion was \u201cso utterly lacking in foundation that it should never have seen the light of day in the courtroom.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Bradfords respond that Townes premised his expert opinion upon a sufficient foundation, and that the accident simulation program and the methods employed by Townes are widely accepted in the accident reconstruction field.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b616 M. R. Evid. 702 provides the criteria for admission of expert opinions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Before a district court may allow an expert to express an opinion, an evidentiary foundation must be laid to demonstrate that the expert has adequate knowledge, by training or education, and sufficient factual information on which to base an opinion. <em>Cottrell, </em>261 Mont. at 301, 863 P.2d at 384-85; <em>Hulse v. State, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 48, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75. We have stated that \u201cit is better to admit relevant scientific evidence in the same manner as other expert testimony and allow its weight to be attacked by cross-examination and refutation.\u201d <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 53 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b617 Generally, accident reconstruction is not a novel science and has been commonly recognized and used in the courts. <em>See Horn v. Bull River Country Store Props., </em>2012 MT 245, \u00b6 48, 366 Mont. 491, 288 P.3d 218; <em>Peterson v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>2010 MT 187, \u00b6 3, 357 Mont. 293, 239 P.3d 904; <em>State v. Shauf, </em>2009 MT 281, \u00b6 4, 352 Mont. 186, 216 P.3d 740. Accident reconstruction evidence involving computer simulations has been admitted after inquiry \u201cregarding whether the reasoning or methodology behind the testimony is scientifically valid and whether the reasoning or methodology can be applied to the facts in issue.\u201d <em>Livingston v. Isuzu Motors, </em>910 F. Supp. 1473, 1494-95 (D. Mont. 1995); <em>see also </em>David L. Faigman et al., <em>Modern Scientific Evidence: The Law and Science of Expert Testimony </em>vol. 5, \u00a7 44:12, 816-17 (2012-2013 ed., West 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b618 During trial, Townes testified he used factual information and physical evidence in his computer simulations, including measurements of the final resting positions of the vehicles taken by MHP, his own measurements and observations from the accident scene, the physical properties of the vehicles, and data from the control module sensor located in Margaret\u2019s vehicle. Townes offered that his computer simulation models were based on scientific and mathematic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>principles that are accepted in the accident reconstruction field. Townes testified that the computer program is widely used and is tested extensively.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b619  Based on this record, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by ruling that Townes\u2019 testimony was supported by an adequate factual foundation and by determining that the scientific method used by Townes to reconstruct the accident was reliable and admissible. Bradfords satisfied the requirements under M. R. Evid. 702 to present Townes\u2019 expert opinion and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b620 <em>2. Did Bradfords violate the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure by failing to supplement the disclosure of the defense expert ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b621 Howards assert that \u201c[a]fter Townes was deposed on July 22, 2011, he changed the foundational basis of his \u2018excursion\u2019 theory\u201d and that Bradfords\u2019 \u201cfailure to supplement Townes\u2019 opinions is a clear violation of Rule 26(e)(2) which mislead[s] the court and counsel.\u201d Howards argue that Townes failed to disclose he was no longer relying upon the testimony of Higgins. Bradfords reply that, though he mentioned that Higgins was a witness, Townes never relied on her statement and did not alter his opinion. Thus, there was no reason for his expert disclosure to be supplemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b622 Expert witnesses disclosure statements, required by M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4), must \u201cstate the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(A)(i) (2011). The duty to supplement or correct discovery is described in M. R. Civ. P. 26(e), which states, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">(e) Supplementing Responses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">(1) In General. A party who has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission must supplement or correct its response: (A) in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing; or (B) as ordered by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">(2) Expert Witness. For an expert whose opinion must be disclosed under Rule 26(b)(4), the party\u2019s duty to supplement extends both to information included in the disclosure and to information given during the expert\u2019s deposition. Any additions or changes to this information must be disclosed by the time of the preparation and submission of the pretrial order to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">M. R. Civ. P. 26(e). As revised in 2011, M. R. Civ. P. 26(e) is nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>identical to F. R. Civ. P. 26(e). The Committee Notes to F. R. Civ. P. 26(e) provide the following guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">The obligation to supplement disclosures and discovery responses applies whenever a party learns that its prior disclosures or responses are in some material respect incomplete or incorrect. <em>There is, however, no obligation to provide supplemental or corrective information that has been otherwise made known to the parties in writing or during the discovery process, </em>as when a witness not previously disclosed is identified during the taking of a deposition or <em>when an expert during a deposition corrects information contained in an earlier report.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Forms, 146 F.R.D. 535, 641 (1993). (Emphasis added.) A party must supplement or correct the expert disclosure statement when the party learns that \u201cin some material respect\u201d the information given in the expert\u2019s statement \u201cis incomplete or incorrect\u201d and the updated information has not otherwise been disclosed to the other party during the discovery process. M. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)-(2); <em>see also </em>Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Richard L. Marcus, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 8A, \u00a7 2049.1, 319 (3d ed., West 2010). \u201cInformation is \u2018incomplete or incorrect\u2019 in \u2018some material respect\u2019 if there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that the additional or corrective information could substantially affect or alter the opposing party\u2019s discovery plan or trial preparation.\u201d <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. v. J.M. Huber Corp., </em>274 F.R.D. 63, 77 (W.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting F. R. Civ. P. 26(e); <em>Sender v. Mann, </em>225 F.R.D. 645, 653-54 (D. Colo. 2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b623 Townes\u2019 expert disclosure statement did not mention Higgins\u2019 statement. During his deposition, Townes acknowledged that Higgins had provided a witness statement to MHP, but answered \u201cNo, I am not\u201d when asked if he was relying on Higgins\u2019 statement. If there was any uncertainty about whether Townes was relying on Higgins, rather than simply acknowledging the existence of her statement, it was dispelled during this latter part of his deposition. Howards\u2019 counsel then acknowledged that Townes was not relying on Higgins as the deposition continued, stating, in a question, \u201cWell, then, setting aside Julia Higgins\u2019 statement...\u201d At trial, Townes testified that, during the course of his investigation, he had reviewed the information that had been given to him from MHP, including \u201cone witness statement,\u201d but did not testify that his opinions were based on the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b624 Consistent with his disclosure, Townes clarified during his deposition that his opinion did not rely upon Higgins\u2019 statement. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>position did not change at trial. Thus, his disclosure did not contain information that was \u201cincomplete or incorrect\u201d \u201cin some material respect\u201d that required correction or updating under M. R. Civ. P. 26(e).</p>\n<p id=\"A8y4\">\u00b625 <em>3. Did the District Court err by denying Howards\u2019 motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b626 Howards\u2019 argument in favor of a new trial is premised upon the issues discussed above. Howards claim that Townes\u2019 opinion lacked foundation and was admitted erroneously, which constitutes a \u201cprejudicial irregularity\u2019 under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA. They argue that the substantial changes in Townes\u2019 reliance on witness testimony and Bradfords\u2019 corresponding failure to revise his expert disclosure constituted unfair surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b627 A new trial may be granted for a reason listed in \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, which materially affects the substantial rights of the aggrieved party, including, \u201cirregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial\u201d or \u201caccident or surprise that ordinary prudence could not have guarded against.\u201d Section 25-11-102(1), (3), MCA. A party seeking a new trial because of a surprise under \u00a7 25-11-102(3), MCA, must demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">(1) the moving party was actually surprised; (2) the facts causing the surprise had a material bearing on the case; (3) the verdict or decision resulted mainly from these facts; (4) the surprise did not result from the moving party\u2019s inattention or negligence; (5) the moving party acted promptly and claimed relief at the earliest opportunity; (6) the moving party used every means reasonably available at the time of the surprise to remedy it; and (7) the result of a new trial without the surprise would probably be different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\"><em>Clark v. Bell, </em>2009 MT 390, \u00b6 30, 353 Mont. 331, 220 P.3d 650 (citations omitted). A district court\u2019s abuse of discretion in denying a new trial must be \u201cso significant as to materially affect the substantial right of the complaining party\u201d to be reversible. <em>Perdue, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b628  In denying Howards\u2019 motion for a new trial, the District Court concluded that \u201cthere was no impermissible surprise occasioned by Townes\u2019 testimony.\u201d We agree. As discussed above, Townes clearly articulated the basis for his opinion and there was not a reasonable basis for Howards to believe otherwise. Therefore, Howards have not established an \u201cactual surprise\u201d under \u00a7 25-11-102(3), MCA. Further, because Bradfords were not required to supplement Townes\u2019 expert disclosure, there was no irregularity in the proceedings that warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the granting of a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA. Townes\u2019 testimony was properly admitted and did not unfairly prejudice the Howards.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, MORRIS and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-14\"> John\u2019s wife, Lavetta, was a passenger in the Bradford vehicle, but she could not recall how the accident happened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-11\"> Bradfords also argue that \u201cHowards repeatedly waived any objections to the admission of Dr. Townes\u2019 simulations and opinions\u201d by failing to object to them during trial. However, Howards filed a motion in limine prior to trial to exclude Townes\u2019 testimony and the District Court did not expressly rule on the motion, leaving it unclear to what extent the District Court would permit Townes to testify as trial began. Under these circumstances we deem it appropriate to address the merits of Howards\u2019 evidentiary claims preserved by the motion in limine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> Expert testimony regarding novel scientific evidence must be reliable. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 52 (citing <em>Daubert v.

Howards\u2019 motion in limine made a <em>Daubert </em>challenge to Townes\u2019 proffered testimony.
