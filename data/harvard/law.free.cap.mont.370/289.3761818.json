S.C. alleges that the State failed to comply with the timeliness requirements necessary to extend the plan as provided in \u00a7 53-21-198, MCA. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court properly granted the State\u2019s third request to extend S.C.\u2019s involuntary treatment plan?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b64 Local police officers brought S.C. to the Kalispell Regional Medical Center\u2019s emergency room on September 20, 2011. S.C. appeared to be suffering from significant depression and disorganization of thought activity. Katie Henley (Henley), a psychiatric nurse practitioner for the Western Montana Mental Health Center, met with S.C. to observe S.C.\u2019s behavior. Henley observed that S.C.\u2019s mental condition had deteriorated from a point that Henley had determined to be S.C.\u2019s \u201cbaseline.\u201d The Kalispell Regional Medical Center transferred S.C. to the Pathways Treatment Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b65 Dr. James Rougle (Dr. Rougle), a psychiatrist at the Pathways Treatment Center, evaluated S.C. Among other things, Dr. Rougle interviewed S.C.\u2019s father (Father). Father reported that S.C. had become increasingly paranoid. Father reported that S.C. heard voices. Father increasingly feared S.C. Father felt unsafe with S.C. living at home. Dr. Rougle diagnosed S.C. as bipolar. Dr. Rougle also determined that S.C was suffering from an episode of depression. Dr. Rougle concluded that S.C.\u2019s depression was making it extremely difficult for S.C. to maintain his baseline mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u00b66 The District Court conducted a hearing on October 6, 2011. Dr. Rougle testified that S.C. was incapable of meeting his own needs. Dr. Rougle recommended that S.C. be committed to the Montana State Hospital (MSH) so that S.C. could receive proper medical care to allow him to return to his baseline. Dr. Rougle further testified that MSH provided the least restrictive environment where someone could look after S.C.\u2019s daily needs. Father testified that he locked his bedroom door at night because he feared what S.C. might do. Father reiterated that he was unwilling to allow S.C. to return home until S.C.\u2019s mental state improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\u00b67 The District Court determined that S.C. should be committed involuntarily to MSH. The court ordered that S.C.\u2019s period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>commitment was \u201cnot to exceed ninety days, unless extended as provided by law.\u201d S.C.\u2019s commitment was to expire on January 6,2012.</p>\n<p id=\"A4LE\">\u00b68 The State conditionally released S.C. from MSH on December 9, 2011. The conditions of S.C.\u2019s release included that he attend sessions three days a week at the Western Montana Mental Health Center in Kalispell. The State further required that S.C. continue to take his prescribed medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b69 The State filed the first petition to extend S.C.\u2019s conditional release on January 11, 2012. S.C.\u2019s commitment period had expired five days earlier on January 6, 2012. S.C. did not request a hearing or challenge the State\u2019s petition. The District Court granted the petition to extend S.C.\u2019s release conditions for a period of 90 days through April 6, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b610 The State filed a second untimely petition to extend S.C.\u2019s conditional release on March 29, 2012. Section 53-21-198(2), MCA, requires that any petition to extend must be filed \u201c[n]ot less than 2 calendar weeks\u201d before the expiration of a person\u2019s detention or extension period. The State\u2019s petition should have been filed no later than March 23,2012. S.C. again did not request a hearing or challenge the State\u2019s petition. The District Court granted the State\u2019s petition to extend S.C.\u2019s release conditions for 90 additional days through July 6, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b611 The State filed a third untimely petition to extend S.C.\u2019s conditional release on June 27, 2012. Section 53-21-198(2), MCA, required that the State file its motion to extend no later than June 22, 2012. This time S.C. requested a hearing to challenge the State\u2019s petition. The Office of Public Defender represented S.C. at the July 6, 2012, hearing. S.C. argued that the State\u2019s third petition to extend S.C.\u2019s commitment period failed to comply with the timeliness requirements set forth in \u00a7 53-21-198, MCA. The District Court granted the State\u2019s petition after the hearing. The court extended S.C.\u2019s release conditions through October 6, 2012. S.C. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">\u00b612 <em>Whether the District Court properly granted the State\u2019s third request to extend S.C.\u2019s involuntary treatment plan?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">\u00b613 The State concedes that it failed to comply with the time requirements provided in \u00a7 53-21-198, MCA. The State argues, however, that S.C. should be required to show that the State\u2019s failure to comply with the time requirements caused prejudice to S.C. S.C. contends that the State\u2019s failure to comply with the time requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>set forth in \u00a7 53-21-198, MCA, represents the lesser of the State\u2019s omissions. S.C. argues that the State\u2019s failure to file its first motion to extend S.C.\u2019s conditional release until <em>after </em>the expiration of S.C.\u2019s commitment period deprived the District Court of the authority to extend the conditions of S.C\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b614 Section 53-21-198(2), MCA, clearly sets forth that any petition to extend must be filed \u201c[n]ot less than 2 calendar weeks\u201d before the expiration of a person\u2019s detention or extension period. We evaluated the mandates of the statute in <em>In re Morlock, </em>261 Mont. 499, 862 P.2d 415 (1993). Morlock had been committed to the Montana Development Center (MDC). The district court granted an untimely petition to extend Morlock\u2019s commitment after the expiration of Morlock\u2019s original commitment period. Morlock filed a motion to dismiss the petition as untimely under \u00a7 53-20-128, MCA (1993). Neither party disputed that the recommitment petition had been filed untimely. <em>Morlock, </em>261 Mont. at 500, 862 P.2d at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b615 The Court determined that Montana\u2019s civil commitment laws are to be \u201cstrictly followed.\u201d <em>Morlock, </em>261 Mont. at 501, 862 P.2d at 416. The legislature provided that a petition for recommitment could be granted \u201conly if renewal of the commitment order is requested at least 15 days before the expiration of the commitment order.\u201d <em>Morlock, </em>261 Mont. at 501, 862 P.2d at 416 [internal citations omitted]. The Court interpreted the time period attached to the filing requirement as \u201cmandatory.\u201d <em>Morlock, </em>261 Mont. at 501, 862 P.2d at 416. The Court further provided that the State\u2019s failure to comply with the time requirements left the District Court \u201cwithout authority to recommit Morlock.\u201d <em>Morlock, </em>261 Mont. at 501, 862 P.2d at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b616 The State likens the \u201c[n]ot less than 2 calendar weeks\u201d requirement of \u00a7 53-21-198(2), MCA, to the numerous filing or notice deadlines of the type addressed in <em>BNSF Ry. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, \u00b6 13, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706. We determined that \u201cnone of the judicially or statutorily created procedural deadlines deprive a district court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>BNSF Ry., </em>\u00b6 17. This argument fails to address, however, the State\u2019s failure to file its first petition to extend S.C. conditions of release until after S.C.\u2019s period of commitment had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b617 The period for S.C.\u2019s commitment expired on January 6, 2012. The State waited until January 11, 2012, to file its first petition to extend S.C.\u2019s conditional release. The State argues that S.C. waived this defect due to his failure to object to the State\u2019s first untimely petition. The expiration of S.C.\u2019s commitment period ended the case. Nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>remained for S.C. to waive. The State remained free at that point to file a new petition for involuntary commitment. The expiration of S.C.\u2019s commitment period, however, left the District Court with no proceeding over which it could exercise continuing jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b618  Consequently, the District Court was \u201cwithout authority\u201d to extend the period of S.C.\u2019s conditions of release when the State filed the second and third petitions. <em>Morlock, </em>261 Mont. at 501, 862 P.2d at 416. The \u201c[n]ot less than two calendar weeks\u201d filing deadline could be construed in the nature of a categorical time bar that would be subject to forfeiture and waiver. The 90-day statutory commitment period could not. The expiration of the 90-day statutory commitment period leaves a court without power to take further action. <em>See State v. Tison, </em>2003 MT 342, \u00b6 15, 318 Mont. 465, 81 P.3d 471 (determining that expiration of the 90-day commitment period prescribed by \u00a7 46-14-221, MCA, left the district court without authority to take further action).</p>\n<p id=\"Aub\">\u00b619  The District Court\u2019s lack of authority to extend the period of S.C.\u2019s conditions of release applies, in turn, to the State\u2019s second petition of March 29, 2012, and the State\u2019s third petition of June 27, 2012. As a result, we must vacate the District Court\u2019s orders of April 4, 2012, and July 6, 2012, that granted the State\u2019s second and third petitions. We emphasize that the State remains free to file a new petition to seek S.C.\u2019s involuntary commitment. Any attempts by the State to extend or modify a future voluntary commitment must be filed within the time periods set forth in \u00a7 53-21-198, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b620 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
