We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b62 Taxpayers raise the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying Taxpayers\u2019 petition for judicial review and affirming the disallowance of Taxpayers\u2019 educational expense deduction?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">\u00b64 Paula sought tax deductions for educational expenses incurred in pursuit of a doctoral degree in psychology. The Montana Department of Revenue (DOR) disallowed the deductions sought by Paula individually in 2007, and jointly with Randy in 2008 and 2009. DOR disallowed the deductions because the expenses did not meet the requirements of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.162-5. Taxpayers appealed the DOR\u2019s decision to the Office of Dispute Resolution (ODR). ODR affirmed the disallowance on September 21, 2011. Taxpayers appealed the ODR\u2019s decision to the State Tax Appeal Board (STAB). After holding a hearing on March 7,2012, STAB issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and opportunity for judicial review order upholding the disallowance on March 23, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">\u00b65 Taxpayers sought judicial review of STAB\u2019s decision in Montana\u2019s Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Court denied Taxpayers\u2019 petition for judicial review in an order dated September 11, 2012. Taxpayers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b66 A district court reviews a STAB decision to determine whether STAB\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether STAB correctly interpreted the law. <em>Robison v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2012 MT 145, \u00b6 10, 365 Mont. 336, 281 P.3d 218; <em>Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. State, </em>2011 MT 141, \u00b6 14, 361 Mont. 39, 255 P.3d 171. This Court applies the same standards of review when reviewing a district court\u2019s order affirming or reversing a STAB decision. <em>Robison, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Puget Sound Energy, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Taxpayers\u2019 petition for judicial review and affirming the disallowance of Taxpayers\u2019 educational expense deduction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b68 Educational expenses are deductible as ordinary and necessary expenses if the education pursued: (1) maintains or improves skills the taxpayer requires in her employment or other trade or business; or (2) meets the requirements imposed by the taxpayer\u2019s employer or other applicable laws or regulations as a condition to the taxpayer\u2019s employment, status, or compensation. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.162-5(a). Educational expenses are not deductible if: (1) the expenses incurred meet the minimum educational requirements for qualification in the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business; or (2) the expenses qualify the taxpayer for a new trade or business. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.162-5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u00b69 Paula worked as a licensed counselor while pursuing her education. The educational expenses Taxpayers sought to deduct relate to Paula\u2019s enrollment in the licensure track of a doctoral program in psychology through Walden University. The evidence in the record supports three independent grounds for disallowing deduction of Taxpayers\u2019 claimed educational expenses: (1) the education met the minimum educational requirements for qualification as a licensed psychologist; (2) the education would lead to qualifying Paula for a new trade or business; and (3) Paula did not undertake the education primarily to maintain or improve skills required in her current employment. Taxpayers argue that Paula\u2019s completed course of education at Walden University will not qualify her as a licensed psychologist in Montana because she fails to meet all of Montana\u2019s licensing requirements. Taxpayers maintain that Paula undertook the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>education to improve her skills in her current occupation. Taxpayers\u2019 arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"A8qQ\">\u00b610  Educational expenses will be deemed nondeductible as qualification for a new trade or business if the education is a step towards obtaining a certification that once obtained, would qualify the taxpayer to perform tasks significantly different from those the taxpayer performed before receiving the education. <em>See Glenn v. Comm\u2019r, </em>62 T.C. 270, 276-77 (1974). This holds true even when the education is to obtain different licensing in the same field. <em>See e.g. Glenn, </em>62 T.C. at 276-77. \u201cAn educational expense is deductible only if the primary purpose is to improve one\u2019s skills at his present job.\u201d <em>Lee v. Comm\u2019r, </em>723 F.2d 1424, 1427 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b611  The findings of STAB and the District Court that Paula pursued her education in an effort to become a clinical psychologist, rather than simply to improve her skills as a counselor, are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Taxpayers failed to demonstrate that the educational expenses were deductible under either 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.162-5(a)(l) or (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b612 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"A7N\">JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
