Stewart cross-appeals the WCC\u2019s determination that she is not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees or the statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\u00b62 We have consolidated the appeal and cross-appeal issues into the following three issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the WCC erred when it determined that Stewart was entitled to continued payment for the pain patches prescribed by her treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the WCC erred when it determined that Stewart was not entitled to reimbursement for her attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">\u00b65 3. Whether the WCC erred when it failed to impose the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>penalty on Liberty, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b66 On August 26, 2002, Stewart suffered an injury in the course and scope of her employment with Gallatin Laundry Company, Inc. (Gallatin). Liberty, which insured Gallatin, accepted liability for Stewart\u2019s injury and paid wage loss and medical benefits with an 18% whole person impairment rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b67 Stewart\u2019s initial treating physician, Dr. John Campbell, diagnosed her injury as a \u201cprobable medial meniscal tear\u201d of the right knee. Stewart underwent two arthroscopic surgeries over the next few months, but she continued to have issues with pain and range of motion in her knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b68 In 2003, Dr. Lowell Anderson examined Stewart. He noted that she continued to have right knee pain with an \u201cunknown etiology.\u201d Dr. Anderson listed several possible causes for her pain including a \u201cpossible saphenous nerve neuroma.\u201d Dr. Anderson assigned Stewart a 35% impairment rating based on his opinion that Stewart\u2019s physical findings \u201cmost closely resemble the diagnostic findings in reflex sympathetic dystrophy.\u201d Based on Dr. Anderson\u2019s diagnosis, Stewart filed a petition with the WCC for an increased impairment rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b69 An evidentiary hearing on Stewart\u2019s petition was held on August 9, 2006. Despite his earlier statements, Dr. Anderson testified in his deposition in preparation for the hearing, that he did not know how Stewart\u2019s saphenous nerve could have been injured during her surgeries, and that, while there was a good chance that Stewart suffered from a pain complex, he could not point to any medical evidence supporting the conclusion that there was a relationship between Stewart\u2019s surgeries and her pain symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b610 The WCC, in a decision entered September 14, 2007, determined that Stewart failed to carry her burden of proving causation, thus the court denied her request for an increased impairment rating. Stewart did not appeal the WCC\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">\u00b611 On March 12,2008, Stewart was informed by her pharmacist that Liberty would no longer approve or cover the expense of the pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>patches that she had been using for the past several years. This determination was initiated without any advance notice or warning to Stewart or her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b612 On March 26, 2008, Stewart filed her Petition for Emergency or Expedited Declaratory Relief to Reinstate Medical Benefits. In her petition, Stewart sought reinstatement of medical benefits for the Lidoderm pain patches for her knee as well as for attorneys\u2019 fees and penalties for Liberty\u2019s failure to provide benefits to cover the patches.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of her request for reinstatement of these benefits, Stewart had her medical records reviewed by Dr. Clifford Wheeless, an orthopedic surgeon licensed in North Carolina. Dr. Wheeless opined that more probably than not, either Stewart\u2019s original knee injury or her resulting surgery were \u201cabsolutely\u201d the cause of the chronic pain condition from which Stewart now suffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b613 After the WCC denied Liberty\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or Alternatively Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss as well as Liberty\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, the parties submitted the case to the WCC on a stipulated record. The WCC issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment on April 11, 2012, wherein the court determined that Stewart had met her burden of showing that her knee pain and her need for medication for that pain, was causally related to her industrial injury and subsequent knee surgery, and that she was entitled to payment for her pain medication. The WCC also determined that Stewart was not entitled to her attorneys\u2019 fees or to the statutory 20% penalty pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b614 In addition, the WCC noted in its judgment that in Stewart\u2019s original proceeding, although Dr. Anderson believed there was a causal connection between the knee surgery and the pain, he could not provide a definite opinion as to how that connection existed. In contrast, Dr. Wheeless testified in the current proceeding that in his medical opinion either Stewart\u2019s original knee injury or her resulting surgery were \u201cabsolutely\u201d the cause of the chronic pain condition from which she now suffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b615 Liberty appeals the WCC\u2019s determination that Stewart is entitled to continued payment of benefits for the pain patches. Stewart cross-appeals the WCC\u2019s decision denying Stewart\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees and for payment of the statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b616 We review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Keller v. Liberty Northwest, Inc., </em>2010 MT 279, \u00b6 20, 358 Mont. 448, 246 P.3d 434 (citing <em>Schmill v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2009 MT 430, \u00b6 8, 354 Mont. 88, 223 P.3d 842; <em>Lanes v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2008 MT 306, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 10, 192 P.3d 1145). In addition, we review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Keller, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Schmill, </em>\u00b6 <em>S; Lanes, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Van Vleet v. Mont. Ass\u2019n of Counties Workers\u2019 Comp. Trust, </em>2004 MT 367, \u00b6 9, 324 Mont. 517, 103 P.3d 544).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the WCC erred when it determined that Stewart was entitled to continued payment for the pain patches prescribed by her treating physician.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b618 Liberty maintains that Stewart\u2019s petition in this case focused on whether her knee pain was causally connected to her industrial injury. Liberty contends that the issue of causation of Stewart\u2019s knee pain was already litigated and decided in a prior proceeding, thus Stewart is collaterally estopped from challenging the WCC\u2019s prior conclusion on causation. Conversely, Stewart argues that Liberty\u2019s collateral estoppel defense fails because, contrary to Liberty\u2019s contentions, the identical issue was not litigated in the prior proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b619 The doctrine of collateral estoppel, \u201cwhich embodies the concept of \u2018issue preclusion,\u2019 \u201d bars a party from re-litigating an issue where that issue has been litigated and determined in a prior suit. <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 65, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186 (citing <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267; <em>State v. Ditton, </em>2006 MT 235, \u00b6 40, 333 Mont. 483, 144 P.3d 783). Collateral estoppel \u201cfavors a definite end to litigation\u201d and prevents parties \u201cfrom incessantly waging piecemeal, collateral attacks against judgments.\u201d <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Kullick v. Skyline Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>2003 MT 137, \u00b6 17, 316 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 225; <em>Olympic Coast Inv., Inc. v. Wright, </em>2005 MT 4, \u00b6 26, 325 Mont. 307, 105 P.3d 743). Moreover, collateral estoppel \u201cdeter[s] plaintiffs from splitting a single cause of action into more than one lawsuit, thereby conserving judicial resources and encouraging reliance on adjudication by preventing inconsistent judgments.\u201d <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Smith v. Schweigert, </em>241 Mont. 54, 59, 785 P.2d 195, 198 (1990); <em>Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S. Ct. 411, 415 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b620 We apply the following four-part test to determine whether collateral estoppel bars relitigation of an issue: (1) the identical issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>raised was previously decided in a prior adjudication; (2) a final judgment on the merits was issued in the prior adjudication; (3) the party against whom collateral estoppel is now asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication; and (4) the party against whom preclusion is asserted must have been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate any issues which may be barred. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b621  We have held that the most crucial element of collateral estoppel is the identity of issues. <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 28, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620 (citing <em>Fadness v. Cody, </em>287 Mont. 89, 96-97, 951 P.2d 584, 588-89 (1997)). In order to satisfy this element, the identical issue or \u201cprecise question\u201d must have been litigated in the prior action. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 28 (citing <em>Fadness, </em>287 Mont. at 96-97, 951 P.2d at 588-89). The mere fact that each action arises from the same transaction does not necessarily mean that they each involve the same issues. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 28 <em>(citing Fadness, </em>287 Mont. at 96-97, 951 P.2d at 588-89).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b622 To determine whether the issues decided in the prior adjudication are identical to those presented in the present case, \u201cwe compare the pleadings, evidence and circumstances surrounding the two actions.\u201d <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Holtman v. 4-G\u2019s Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>264 Mont. 432, 439, 872 P.2d 318, 322 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b623 In <em>Lund v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>263 Mont. 346, 868 P.2d 611 (1994), we held that because the question of petitioner\u2019s entitlement to indemnity benefits in the current proceeding was based on different statutory criteria than his entitlement to permanent partial disability benefits decided in a prior proceeding, the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply. In <em>Lund, </em>both actions arose from Lund\u2019s July 8,1986 workplace injury. The parties engaged in litigation in 1990 ending with a determination by the WCC that the petitioner was entitled to receive 500 weeks of permanent partial disability benefits pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA (1985), at a weekly rate of $13.34. In September 1992, the petitioner withdrew his election to proceed under \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA (1985), and filed a petition to seek indemnity benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-705 through -708, MCA (1985), at a rate of $149.50 per week. <em>Lund, </em>263 Mont. at 347-49, 868 P.2d at 612-13. We determined in <em>Lund </em>that because the benefits sought in each action were based on two different statutes, the issues in each action were not identical, thus collateral estoppel did not apply. <em>Lund, </em>263 Mont. at 351, 868 P.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b624 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the fact that the 2007 action and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>current action both involved questions regarding causation does not mean the issues were identical. The issue in the prior proceeding specifically dealt with Stewart\u2019s potential entitlement to an increased impairment rating given the overall deterioration in her condition, including increased pain symptoms. Unlike the prior proceeding, the issue in the current proceeding involves whether Stewart is still suffering from acute pain as a result of her initial work-related injury and whether Liberty continues to be liable for Stewart\u2019s pain medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b625  In addition, contrary to Liberty\u2019s contention that the statutory criteria for Stewart\u2019s original claim and Stewart\u2019s current claim are the same, we conclude that each of Stewart\u2019s claims was brought under a different statutory basis. Stewart\u2019s original claim was based on \u00a7 39-71-711, MCA, regarding impairment ratings, while Stewart\u2019s current claim is based on \u00a7 39-71-704, MCA, regarding the payment of medical benefits, specifically the pain patches.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b626  Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the question of Stewart\u2019s entitlement to payment for her pain patches is a different question than her entitlement to an increased impairment rating, thus the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply. Accordingly, we hold that the WCC did not err when it determined that Stewart was entitled to continued payment for the pain patches prescribed by her treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Issue <em>2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b627 <em>Whether the WCC erred when it determined that Stewart was not entitled to reimbursement for her attorneys\u2019 fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u00b628 In its April 11, 2012 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment, the WCC determined that \u201cLiberty had a legitimate defense to liability for Stewart\u2019s pain medication, based upon the earlier holding of this Court, but continued to pay the disputed medical benefits under a reservation of rights pending a resolution of the dispute.\u201d Because the WCC determined that Liberty\u2019s actions in this case were reasonable, the court determined that Stewart was not entitled to reimbursement for her attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\u00b629 Stewart argues by way of cross-appeal that the WCC erred, and that she is entitled to an award of her attorneys\u2019 fees because Liberty s \u201csudden, unexpected and unilateral\u201d cancellation of Stewart\u2019s ongoing pain prescription was \u201cinherently unreasonable\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA. Liberty contends on the other hand that Stewart is not entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees because Liberty reasonably relied on the WCC\u2019s prior determination that Stewart\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>chronic knee pain was not causally connected to her industrial injury. \u00b630 Section 39-71-611, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">Costs and attorneys\u2019 fees payable on denial of claim or termination of benefits later found compensable. (1) The insurer shall pay reasonable costs and attorney fees as established by the workers\u2019 compensation court if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">(a) the insurer denies liability for a claim for compensation or terminates compensation benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">(b) the claim is later adjudged compensable by the workers\u2019 compensation court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">(c) in the case of attorneys\u2019 fees, the workers\u2019 compensation court determines that the insurer\u2019s actions in denying liability or terminating benefits were <em>unreasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">(2) A finding of unreasonableness against an insurer made under this section does not constitute a finding that the insurer acted in bad faith or violated the unfair trade practices provisions of Title 33, chapter 18. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Thus, a request for attorneys\u2019 fees requires the WCC to find that the insurer acted unreasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">\u00b631 \u201cReasonableness is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Marcott v. Louisiana Pacific Corp., </em>275 Mont. 197, 202, 911 P.2d 1129, 1133 (1996) (citing <em>Stordalen v. Ricci\u2019s Food Farm, </em>261 Mont. 256, 258, 862 P.2d 393, 394 (1993)). As we indicated earlier in this Opinion, we review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Keller v. Liberty Northwest, Inc., </em>2010 MT 279, \u00b6 20, 358 Mont. 448, 246 P.3d 434. Substantial credible evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Keller, </em>\u00b6 20. \u201cIndicating the high level of deference this Court accords to the WCC\u2019s factual findings, we have stated that evidence will be considered substantial even if it is contradicted by other evidence, even if it is somewhat less than a preponderance, and even if it is inherently weak.\u201d <em>Gamble v. Sears, </em>2007 MT 131, \u00b6 20, 337 Mont. 354, 160 P.3d 537 (citing <em>EBI/Orion Group v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>249 Mont. 449, 453, 816 P.2d 1070, 1073 (1991); <em>Simms v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 175, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 511, 116 P.3d 773; <em>Wolfe v. Webb, </em>251 Mont. 217, 230, 824 P.2d 240, 248 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">\u00b632 Stewart argues that this case is analogous to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Narum v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2009 MT 127, 350 Mont. 252, 206 P.3d 964, wherein we upheld both the statutory penalty and the attorneys\u2019 fees awards granted by the WCC. We disagree, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>and conclude that <em>Narum, </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. \u00b633 Narum worked in the beer and wine industry for 37 years. The last 17 of those years he spent driving a small semi-truck delivering beer. His job duties included heavy lifting and loading. In March 2003, Narum stepped out of his truck and either slipped and fell to the pavement or missed the last step and fell to the pavement, landing on his left side. At the time, Narum experienced only a slight pain in his left hip. When the pain did not subside within a few weeks, Narum filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6 2. Narum underwent numerous medical examinations and treatments with several doctors. Those medical examinations indicated that Narum would eventually need a hip replacement. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b634 Liberty was also the insurer in <em>Narum. </em>Liberty accepted liability for Narum\u2019s claim and paid benefits through December 2003. At that time, Liberty informed Narum that it would no longer pay benefits, so Narum hired an attorney to negotiate a settlement with Liberty. The parties reached a settlement agreement in February 2004 wherein Liberty agreed to pay Narum $25,000, and to allow Narum to reserve his medical benefits. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b635 In January 2006, Liberty sent a letter to one of Narum\u2019s doctors asking questions about the cause of Narum\u2019s hip condition. Based on the doctor\u2019s response to the letter, Liberty refused to make further payments of medical benefits related to the treatment for Narum\u2019s left hip. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6 13. Narum was receiving cortisone shots for his hip pain. Narum later testified that Liberty did not inform him that it would no longer pay for the cortisone shots. Instead, Narum received word of Liberty\u2019s refusal to pay from his medical provider. In addition, Narum underwent hip replacement surgery in September 2007, but Liberty refused to pay for the surgery and related treatment. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b636 Narum filed a claim before the WCC. After reviewing all of Narum\u2019s medical records, the WCC found that Liberty was liable for medical and hospital benefits related to treatment of Narum\u2019s hip. And, because the WCC determined that Liberty acted unreasonably in denying payment for Narum\u2019s medical benefits, the court awarded Narum a 20% penalty and his attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6 15. The WCC based part of its determination that Liberty\u2019s actions were unreasonable on the fact that Liberty denied payment for Narum\u2019s hip replacement surgery even though hip replacement surgery was specifically identified as a possibility in the settlement agreement between the parties. The WCC also determined that Liberty had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>provided no persuasive explanation as to how it justified stopping payment for Narum\u2019s ongoing treatment. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6 34. This Court agreed with the WCC and affirmed the WCC\u2019s decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees and the statutory penalty. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35, 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b637 The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Narum </em>because here Liberty did not breach a settlement agreement and, although it did stop payment for the pain patches without notice to Stewart, it did so in reliance on the previous factual and legal findings of the WCC. Liberty\u2019s case manager, Sandy Scholl, testified that she only terminated payment for the pain patches after she reviewed the WCC\u2019s 2007 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment wherein the WCC denied Stewart\u2019s request for an increased impairment rating because it did not see any causal relationship between the pain issues and Stewart\u2019s injury. In addition, after a short break in the payments, Liberty resumed paying for the pain patches under a reservation of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b638  We conclude here that reliance on a prior order from the WCC creates a reasonable basis for denying liability, thus Liberty\u2019s actions were not unreasonable. Accordingly, we hold that the WCC did not err when it determined that Stewart was not entitled to reimbursement for her attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b639 <em>Whether the WCC erred when it failed to impose the statutory penalty on Liberty, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u00b640 The WCC determined that Liberty had \u201ca legitimate defense to liability\u201d for Stewart\u2019s pain medication based upon the earlier holding of the WCC, thus Liberty\u2019s actions were reasonable and \u201cthe application of a penalty under these facts is inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\u00b641 Stewart argues in her cross-appeal that this was error on the WCC\u2019s part because Liberty\u2019s failure to provide a reasonable explanation for how it could justify the sudden and unilateral cessation of payment for her pain prescriptions warrants the imposition of the 20% penalty provided for in \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA. Conversely, Liberty argues that Stewart is not entitled to an award of the statutory penalty because Liberty reasonably relied on the WCC\u2019s prior determination that Stewart\u2019s chronic knee pain was not causally connected to her industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">\u00b642 Under \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA, the WCC may increase by 20% the full amount of benefits due to a claimant during the period of delay or refusal to pay if the insurer\u2019s delay or failure to pay is deemed to be unreasonable. However, the penalty set forth in \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>was not intended to eliminate an insurer\u2019s assertion of a legitimate defense to liability. <em>Marcott, </em>275 Mont. at 202, 911 P.2d at 1132 (citing <em>Paulson v. Bozeman Deaconess Foundation </em>Hosp., 207 Mont. 440, 444, 673 P.2d 1281, 1283 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b643  As we stated in the previous issue, reliance on a prior order from the WCC creates a reasonable basis for denying liability, thus Liberty\u2019s actions were not unreasonable. Accordingly, we hold that the WCC did not err when it failed to impose the statutory penalty on Liberty pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b644 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b53-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-11\"> The statutes in effect on the date of Stewart\u2019s work-related injury govern Stewart\u2019s claim. <em>Ford v.
