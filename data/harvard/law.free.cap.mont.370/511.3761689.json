The Criswells appeal, raising two issues: (1) whether the State presented sufficient evidence to convict and (2) whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying the Criswells\u2019 motion for a mistrial. We affirm as to both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">\u00b62 On January 5, 2011, the State charged Cheryl and Edwin each with one count of aggravated cruelty to animals, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-217(2), MCA. In the Amended Information, the State alleged that on or about December 17 through December 25, 2010, the Criswells knowingly, and without justification, subjected ten or more animals (specifically, cats) to mistreatment or neglect by confining the animals in a cruel manner and/or by failing to provide the animals with food and water of sufficient quantity and quality to sustain the animals\u2019 normal health. The two cases were consolidated for trial. Cheryl and Edwin were represented by separate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">\u00b63 Prior to trial, the Criswells filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts-in particular, \u201cany allegations, charges or bad acts regarding mistreatment of animals at the hands of the Defendants\u2019-pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Montana Rules of Evidence. The Criswells were concerned specifically about evidence of their alleged mistreatment of several hundred cats in Idaho some years earlier. They opined that the State intended to use the events in Idaho for \u201cimproper propensity\u201d purposes. <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, \u00b6 61, 367 Mont. 503, 291 P.3d 1187. In response, the prosecution explained that it sought to use the Idaho evidence to show knowledge (i.e., that the Criswells knew that keeping their cats in the manner they did would harm or injure the cats) and absence of mistake (i.e., that the Criswells\u2019 alleged mistreatment of the cats in Montana was not inadvertent or accidental). The District Court held a hearing pursuant to <em>State v. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2010 MT 263, \u00b6 49, 358 Mont. 325, 246 P.3d 415, and thereafter ruled that the State could offer the evidence for the two limited uses proffered by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b64 A three-day jury trial was held in September 2011. In their opening statements, the Criswells told the jury that they had operated an \u201canimal rescue\u201d in Idaho for several years, handling \u201chundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cats.\u201d Eventually, however, the operation was shut down. The Criswells kept a number of their cats and relocated to northwest Montana. They initially moved around, living for awhile on Plum Creek land until the company asked them to leave, and thereafter staying at various campgrounds. Finally, they moved onto some land near Marion (west of Kalispell).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b65 The Criswells acknowledged to the jury in their opening statements that their situation in December 2010 was desperate. \u201cThey got snowed in, they had no vehicle, they had no fuel, they had no food, they had no money, they got really desperate, things got really bad.\u201d At that point, they had 116 cats. The Criswells told the jury that they loved their cats and did not set out to harm them. Rather, \u201ctragedy\u201d struck: \u201clack of funds, lack of assistance, a huge cold snap and storm, turned into a perfect storm for disaster.\u201d The Criswells suggested that the evidence would show that their situation was not the result of criminal behavior, but was due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b66 Deputy Flathead County Attorneys Kenneth R. Park and Lori Adams presented the State\u2019s evidence, which is detailed below under Issue One. At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the Criswells moved to dismiss for insufficient evidence. The District Court heard arguments and denied the motions as to both defendants. The Criswells then presented testimony from five defense witnesses, including the Criswells themselves, and the prosecution thereafter presented two rebuttal witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u00b67 In closing arguments, prosecutor Park referred to the Criswells\u2019 living situation as a \u201csquatters camp\u201d and characterized the Criswells as \u201cprofessional freeloaders.\u201d Park also asserted that the Criswells had been \u201crun out\u201d of Idaho for abusing animals, and he implied that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Criswells had spent money on medical marijuana in lieu of providing food for their cats. The Criswells jointly moved for a mistrial based on these remarks. While finding that Park\u2019s remarks had been improper, the District Court also found that the remarks, considered within the context of the entire three-day trial, did not prejudice the Criswells\u2019 right to a fair trial. The court thus denied their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b68 The jury found Cheryl and Edwin guilty. The District Court deferred imposition of sentence on Cheryl for a period of six years, and committed Edwin (who had a prior felony conviction) to the Department of Corrections for two years, with those two years suspended. Cheryl\u2019s and Edwin\u2019s sentences were made subject to various conditions, including that they each complete 200 hours of community service and that they pay restitution jointly and severally in the amount of $14,684.47 to the Flathead County Animal Shelter. The District Court also limited Cheryl and Edwin to possessing only one companion animal each, provided the animal is spayed or neutered.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b69 The Criswells now appeal, raising the same two issues. This Court has consolidated their appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u00b610 <em>Issue One. Did the State present sufficient evidence to convict?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">\u00b6 11 Although the Criswells approach their sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument under two distinct theories, the governing legal standards are essentially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">\u00b612 On one hand, the Criswells contend that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to send the case to the jury and, thus, the District Court should have granted their mid-trial motion to dismiss. A motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence may be made at the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence or at the close of all the evidence. Section 46-16-403, MCA. The motion should be granted only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there is not sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 35, 342 Mont. 1, 180 P.3d 1102. We review de novo a district court\u2019s conclusion as to whether sufficient evidence exists to convict. <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 326, 160 P.3d 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">\u00b613 On the other hand, the Criswells contend that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s ultimate finding of guilt and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>thus, this Court should reverse their convictions. A claim of insufficiency of the evidence to support a verdict may be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Granby, </em>283 Mont. 193, 198-99, 939 P.2d 1006, 1009 (1997). In assessing whether sufficient evidence supports a conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Torres, </em>2013 MT 101, \u00b6 16, 369 Mont. 516, 299 P.3d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b614 The District Court instructed the jury that to convict a person of aggravated animal cruelty, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">1. The Defendant inflicted cruelty to animals on a collection, kennel, or herd of ten or more animals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">2. The Defendant acted knowingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\"><em>See </em>\u00a7 45-8-217(2), MCA. The District Court defined \u201ccruelty to animals\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">Cruelty to animals means that without justification, a person knowingly subjects an animal to mistreatment or neglect by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">1. confining the animals in a cruel manner, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">2. failing to provide the animals in the person\u2019s custody with food and water of sufficient quantity and quality to sustain the animal\u2019s normal health.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-12\"><em>See </em>\u00a7 45-8-211(l)(b), (l)(c)(i), MCA. Finally, the District Court instructed the jurors that they had to determine Cheryl\u2019s guilt separately from Edwin\u2019s guilt and that, \u201cin order to find a Defendant guilty, you must unanimously agree upon the commission of the same specific act constituting the crime within the period alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">\u00b615 On appeal, the Criswells challenge only the \u201cwithout justification\u201d element. They argue that the State failed to present sufficient evidence that the manner in which their cats were confined and nourished from December 17 to 25, 2010, was unjustified. The State, on the other hand, argues that the prosecution presented sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find that there was no justification for the cruelty the Criswells inflicted. Given these arguments, we must review the trial record de novo, and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, to determine whether the State presented sufficient evidence on the \u201cwithout justification\u201d element.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">\u00b616 According to the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses, the Criswells relocated from Idaho to Montana in July 2010. At that time, they had three travel trailers and roughly 100 cats. The Criswells initially moved around, staying at various campgrounds, but in early November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>2010 they set up a campsite near Marion, about a half mile off Pleasant Valley Road, in a clearing where the forest had been cut back for power lines. Their campsite included an old Winnebago motor home, a yellow camper, and a green camper.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b617 Upon arriving in Montana, the Criswells contacted Kate Borton, who operated a nonprofit livestock rescue near Marion. The Criswells told Borton that they were a nonprofit cat rescue, and they asked her about sources of funding and places where they could set up a mobile home. Borton referred them to several local organizations that had assisted Borton when she first started her rescue operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u00b618 The Criswells had further communications with Borton over the next few months. She provided them with cat food when Edwin indicated they were running out. They continued to ask her about sources of funding for their \u201calready active\u201d nonprofit rescue and about a place to put their mobile home. Borton sensed, however, that the Criswells were \u201cnot forthcoming\u201d and, in fact, were \u201cevasive\u201d with her about their living situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u00b619 The Criswells also had contact with the Flathead Spay andNeuter Task Force in the summer and fall of 2010. They represented to Task Force personnel that they were an animal rescue group and that they had no money. The Criswells made appointments to have a number of their cats altered at the Task Force\u2019s spay-and-neuter clinics, which were held once a month. The Criswells were not always able to transport the cats to the Task Force facility, however, so Task Force volunteers drove out to pick the cats up. The Task Force also donated pet food to the Criswells. Notably, the Criswells always met Task Force personnel away from their campsite, and Task Force Director Mimi Beadles testified at trial (like Borton) that she felt the Criswells had been \u201cevasive\u201d about where they were living. She found it unusual that a \u201crescue group\u201d would not have a website or a permanent facility where people could see the animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u00b620 Task Force personnel observed medical issues in several of the Criswells\u2019 cats. For example, the two pregnant females that were brought into the July clinic had upper respiratory infections, and three of the ten males brought into the September clinic had issues relating to their eyes. Beadles spoke with Edwin in October and expressed concerns about the welfare of the Criswells\u2019 cats. Thereafter, the Criswells declined to have any of their cats spayed or neutered at the November clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">\u00b621 Sometime in the first half of December 2010, the Criswells contacted Beadles and admitted that they no longer could care for their cats. Beadles advised them to contact the Humane Society of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>United States in Billings because that organization would be able to take in a large group of cats. Edwin expressly refused to follow through with this suggestion, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\u00b622 On December 16, Borton received a call from Edwin, who was at a gas station in Marion. He told her that his truck had broken down and that he and Cheryl were totally out of food, out of heating fuel, and out of money. He told Borton that \u201che was going to walk back to the campsite where his wife was and his animals were, and he was done.\u201d Borton immediately grabbed some bags of food and drove to the gas station. She bought some diesel fuel for the Criswells\u2019 heater and helped Edwin get back to the campsite.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b623 The next day, another individual who was camped near the Criswells gave them a ride to Borton\u2019s ranch. As Borton later testified, Cheryl and Edwin appeared \u201cin very bad shape.\u201d They were \u201chungry, very thin, very dirty,\u201d and \u201cobviously cold to the core.\u201d Borton noted that one of Cheryl\u2019s feet was frostbitten. The Criswells\u2019 demeanors \u201cwere very quiet, and they couldn\u2019t look you in the eye\u201d-except when Borton asked about the cats, at which point the Criswells became \u201cvery very defensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b624 Borton and a volunteer with the Spay and Neuter Task Force alerted Officer Paul Charbonneau of Flathead County Animal Control to the Criswells\u2019 situation-i.e., that they were living near Marion with over 100 cats and were \u201cin dire straits.\u201d Charbonneau decided to conduct a welfare check that afternoon (Friday, December 17). He first drove to the Criswells\u2019 campsite. Due to the amount of snow on the ground, he had to park on Pleasant Valley Road and walk to the campsite. Upon arriving, he knocked on the Winnebago and the green and yellow camper trailers, but no one answered. He could see through the windows that there were cats in both trailers. Charbonneau noted that he did not have a cell phone signal at the campsite. Even when he got back to Pleasant Valley Road, the coverage was \u201cspotty\u201d at best.</p>\n<p id=\"A0V\">\u00b625 Charbonneau proceeded to Borton\u2019s home after ascertaining that the Criswells were there. The Criswells admitted to him that they needed help and could not take care of themselves and the cats on their own. Yet, when Charbonneau suggested transporting the cats to the Task Force facility, the Criswells indicated that they instead wanted to take the cats with them and find a shelter. Charbonneau tried to explain that they were not going to find a shelter able to take two people and a hundred cats. Borton offered to let the Criswells stay with her, but the Criswells elected to return to their campsite that evening. Charbonneau provided them with a bag of cat food.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u00b626 Borton visited the Criswells\u2019 campsite the next day (December 18). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>With \u201ca lot of hesitancy,\u201d they allowed her to enter the green and yellow trailers. Borton was surprised by the setup. Edwin had previously told her that the camper trailers were retrofitted with kennels for the cats, but Borton did not see any kennels. Rather, \u201cthere was a free-for-all. I walked in there ... and I was jumped on by probably 15 or 20 cats. Had them on my head, my shoulders.\u201d The trailers were \u201cvery small\u201d and \u201ccramped,\u201d and there were \u201ccats everywhere.\u201d Borton even heard cats moving around in the ceilings. \u00b627 At trial, Borton characterized the trailers as \u201cuninhabitable\u201d for both people and animals. \u201cThere was feces everywhere, and the smell of ammonia from the urine was so strong it burnt my eyes, made me cough.\u201d In the yellow trailer, there was also a smell of diesel fuel that Borton found \u201cso strong and vivid that I was afraid I was going to pass out.\u201d Borton noted that many of the cats in the two trailers were emaciated, dehydrated, and visibly sick. She saw no water pans in either trailer, nor did she see any cat food in the yellow trailer, but she did note some dry cat food on the floor in the green trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b628 Charbonneau arrived at the campsite as Borton was leaving. He brought fuel and water, plus additional pet food. Charbonneau advised the Criswells that he had started making arrangements to have the road into the campsite plowed and the trailers towed to the Task Force facility. As events ultimately unfolded, however, the process of removing the trailers was delayed for several days due to a number of logistical issues-most significantly, mechanical problems with the road grader. In the meantime, the trailers and the cats remained under the Criswells\u2019 control.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b629 Finally, on Wednesday, December 22, the road to the campsite was cleared and the trailers were towed (with the cats still inside) to the Task Force facility. Charbonneau testified that the Criswells did not exactly \u201crelinquish\u201d custody to him; rather, they \u201callowed\u201d him to remove the trailers and the cats. The next day, he and Beadles made arrangements to transfer the cats into the clinic. Charbonneau entered the trailers to provide the cats with food and fresh water. At trial, he described the scene inside as a \u201cfree-for-all.\u201d On the morning of December 24, Charbonneau began removing the cats.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b630 Charbonneau and Beadles testified at trial about the conditions they had observed when they entered the trailers on December 23 and December 25, respectively. Their descriptions were similar to what Borton had seen on December 18. The trailers were still highly unsanitary. \u201c[E]verything\u201d was \u201centirely covered\u201d with feces and urine. The cats themselves were also covered, to some extent, in feces, and some also had \u201csome type of fuel oil\u201d on them. Even with breathing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>apparatus, Charbonneau found the smell \u201coverwhelming.\u201d Due to the cold weather and the threat of predators (such as coyotes) in the vicinity of the Criswells\u2019 campsite, the cats had been confined continually in this \u201cfifthly]\u201d environment. Other than what Charbonneau had provided on the 23rd, there was no actual cat food, no bowls of water, and no clean litter pans.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b631 Nearly all of the Criswells\u2019 116 cats had a medical issue of some kind. Dr. Terrance R. Yunker, the veterinarian who examined the cats following their removal from the trailers, summarized their conditions at trial. Twenty-one cats had eye issues, such as conjunctivitis, ruptured eye, sunken eye, corneal scarring, and ocular discharge. Nine of these cats had to have their eyes removed, and Dr. Yunker noted that one of the cats had been in \u201cvery severe pain.\u201d Five cats had problems relating to their mouths, which required removal of their teeth. Twenty-five cats had respiratory conditions attributable to viral and bacterial causes. Forty-three cats suffered from dehydration. Three quarters of the cats were underweight, nine being severely emaciated. Fifty cats had ear mites. Two or three cats had skin lesions. An untold number had diarrhea.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b632 Charbonneau, Beadles, and Dr. Yunker each testified that, in their professional opinions, the cats\u2019 medical conditions were attributable to the manner in which they had been confined in the Criswells\u2019 trailers. Dr. Yunker explained that \u201cdensity\u201d was one of the main problems. Cats, he explained, are not pack animals, and confining so many together in a small area not only put substantial stress on the animals, but also facilitated the transmission of diseases among them. The unsanitary conditions and lack of proper food and water only compounded the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b633 Eleven of the Criswells\u2019 cats were less than six months old; roughly eighty-five of them were between six and eighteen months old; and the remainder were over three years old. Three of the cats were pregnant and two were nursing. Dr. Yunker testified that he believed most of these cats were genetically related to each other. He opined that the Criswells had rescued no more than half a dozen cats and had bred the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b634 Dr. Yunker estimated that the cats\u2019 medical conditions had been ongoing for several months before their rescue. Likewise, Charbonneau and Beadles indicated that the unsanitary conditions inside the trailers existed before the trailers were towed from the Criswells\u2019 campsite. In this regard, Beadles testified that it required 20 volunteer hours per day to maintain sanitary living conditions for the Criswells\u2019 cats following their transfer to the Task Force facility. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>cats consumed 25 pounds of cat food per day and 210 pounds of cat litter per week-at a weekly cost of $175, not to mention overhead expenses such as electricity. The Criswells had not been equipped to provide this minimal level of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b635 Borton was questioned (on cross-examination and again on redirect examination) on the issue of funding. While acknowledging that it is not always easy for a nonprofit to obtain funds, she emphasized that a rescue organization must arrange proper funding <em>before </em>taking in the animals. She opined that \u201cyou don\u2019t get the animal and go, oh, well, maybe in six months somebody will donate me a bag of dog food. You\u2019ve got to have something in place, you\u2019ve got to have a facility for them to live, you\u2019ve got to have food, water, and shelter appropriate to that animal, you\u2019ve got to have light, and veterinary care in place, absolutely.\u201d The Criswells had not made such preparations.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b636 The State\u2019s final witness was Dr. Jeff Rosenthal, a veterinarian and the Executive Director of the Idaho Humane Society. The prosecution called Dr. Rosenthal to discuss events involving the Criswells several years earlier.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He testified that in October 2005, he conducted an inspection of Voice of the Animals, a cat \u201crescue\u201d that the Criswells were running on a fairly remote property in a rural area of northern Idaho. The operation consisted of eight trailers housing hundreds of cats. The trailers were \u201cfilled with feces and urine\u201d and were \u201cin poor repair.\u201d Many of the cats showed signs of medical issues.</p>\n<p id=\"AEf\">\u00b637 Dr. Rosenthal informed the Criswells during the October 2005 inspection that the conditions inside their trailers were unsanitary and were leading to illnesses among the cats. He told them that the animals needed to be segregated and that the Criswells should \u201cdivest themselves of as many of the cats as soon as they could, because the facility was unsuitable for the use it was being used for.\u201d Nevertheless, when Dr. Rosenthal made an unannounced visit to the property eleven months later (in September 2006), conditions were even worse. There was \u201csignificantly more\u201d fecal contamination and urine. While food and water were present, \u201cmuch of the food was scattered among the feces, and much of the water wasn\u2019t clean water.\u201d With hundreds of cats confined together, Dr. Rosenthal testified that there would have been fights and competition for food, with the weak and sick cats not getting the nutrition they needed. The cats suffered \u201ca great deal of stress\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>this situation. Dr. Rosenthal diagnosed various medical problems, including upper respiratory disease, conjunctivitis, flea and ear mite infestation, and emaciation due to malnutrition or illness. He attributed these problems to the extreme number of cats, the extreme density of the cats, and the lack of proper food, water, and sanitation. In the end, 264 of the 400-plus cats removed from the trailers had to be euthanized.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b638 Given the foregoing testimony from the State\u2019s witnesses, we disagree with the Criswells\u2019 contention that the State failed to present sufficient evidence that they acted without justification. Again, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the Criswells knew of the problems that can (and ultimately did) result from attempting to house and care for a large number of cats without adequate funding and facilities. The Criswells knew that confining multiple cats together in cramped quarters, and failing to provide them with proper food, water, and sanitation, stresses the cats and leads to medical issues. Yet, despite this knowledge, and despite their lack of money and food, the Criswells chose to confine over 100 cats together in two camper trailers, which were wholly inadequate to house this number of cats. Moreover, they chose to situate themselves and their cats in a relatively remote location, a half mile off the county road, where there was no cell phone coverage and where vehicle access during winter months would be problematic. The unsanitary conditions of the trailers and the illnesses of the cats inside existed for weeks, perhaps even months, before the cats were rescued. Throughout this period, resources were available to help the Criswells and their cats, yet the Criswells maintained an intransigent attitude and persisted in concealing the true conditions of their facilities and their cats from those who could provide assistance. This included Borton, Beadles, and Charbonneau-who, upon learning of the severity of the Criswells\u2019 situation, promptly rallied members of the community to effect a rescue.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b639  Focusing on the specific dates charged in the Amended Information (December 17 to December 25), the Criswells contend that natural forces beyond their control-severe winter weather-dictated the manner in which the cats were confined and nourished from the 17th to the 21st, and that the cats were in the care and possession of the County from the 22nd to the 25th. Thus, they maintain that they could not have done anything to improve the cats\u2019 situation during this period. This argument, however, misses the mark. The issue before the jury was whether the Criswells, without justification, knowingly subjected animals to mistreatment or neglect. <em>See </em>\u00b6 14, <em>supra. </em>Based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>on the testimony, a rational trier of fact could find: that the Criswells decided to keep a large number of cats, knowing that their finances and facilities were insufficient to sustain the animals; that the lack of proper food, water, sanitation, and medical care existed for several weeks, if not months; that the Criswells decided not to obtain meaningful assistance until December 16, at which point access to the campsite was hindered by snow; that the Criswells had no justification for their decisions to keep an unmanageable number of cats and to delay in obtaining assistance; and that the Criswells thereby subjected their animals to mistreatment or neglect, in the form of cruel confinement and/or inadequate nourishment, from December 17 to December 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b640 For these reasons, we hold that the State presented sufficient evidence to support a \u201cwithout justification\u201d finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b641 <em>Issue Two. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying the Criswells\u2019 motion for a mistrial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b642 We review a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for a mistrial to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 1, 972 P.2d 827. A court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employing conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Bollman, </em>2012 MT 49, \u00b6 23, 364 Mont. 265, 272 P.3d 650. The burden to demonstrate an abuse of discretion is on the party seeking reversal of an unfavorable ruling. <em>State v. Price, </em>2006 MT 79, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 502, 134 P.3d 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">II. Background and the District Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"ANN\">\u00b643 As noted, the Criswells jointly moved for a mistrial based on remarks prosecutor Park made during closing arguments. The challenged remarks occurred in two portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument. First, in discussing whether the animals were confined in a cruel manner and whether the confinement was justified, Park stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>they were trespassing. Well, it is northwest Montana, it snows, it started snowing a couple months before this happened.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Now, let\u2019s talk about the confining portion of this. You heard from Dr. Yunker, Dr. Rosenthal, and Paul Charbonneau about the way these cats were confined. You\u2019ve seen the pictures. Any more than one or two cats in those confined trailers is cruel, especially if they are subjected to the diseases and viral infections that the confinement caused. What kind of animal deserves to be locked in its own filth for weeks to months at a time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">The Defendants want you to believe that this was caused by a freak snowstorm that locked them in their squatters camp where</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Further along in his argument, referring to the Criswells\u2019 testimony that they had solicited and relied on donations to support their Idaho and Montana operations, Park asserted:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The beauty of being a juror in this country is that you get to go back to that room and ask yourself what really makes sense in this case, what really happened here. The scenario that fits this is easy. The Criswells were run out of Idaho because they were claiming to be a no-kill cat rescue, yet their actions killed more cats than a kill shelter and they refused to listen to anybody there. The truth of the matter is that the Criswells, Edwin and Cheryl Criswell, are freeloaders, professional freeloaders at that. They even stepped up here and questioned Paul Charbonneau as to why he didn\u2019t bring them cleaning supplies courtesy of the taxpayers of this county. The Criswells have taken freeloading to a whole new level. How many times in the past words [sic] have we heard the word \u201cdonate\u201d or \u201cgive\u201d? The Criswells have figured out that if they have a 501(c)(3) nonprofit animal rescue they can ask everyone else to give them stuff and they don\u2019t have to go do the one thing that they need to do to survive, and that is work.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Dr. Ladanye even testified that Edwin has a medical marijuana card, yet he can cut wood and do yard work. We can afford marijuana but we can\u2019t afford cat food.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u00b644 The Criswells did not contemporaneously object to the \u201csquatters camp,\u201d \u201crun out of Idaho,\u201d and \u201cfreeloaders\u201d remarks. Edwin did object, however, to the \u201cmarijuana\u201d references. He argued that the prosecutor was \u201casking the jury to make a decision based on the nature of what [Edwin] is doing, not the facts of the charge.\u201d The District Court sustained the objection and reiterated to the jurors that they were to disregard anything that was not in evidence and were to rely on their \u201cown individual and collective recollection of what the evidence is in this case and not the argument of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b645 In his closing argument, Edwin\u2019s counsel identified some of Park\u2019s \u201cinflammatory comments\u201d and attempted to refute them. Then, after the jury had retired to deliberate, the Criswells made their motion for a mistrial. They argued that the prosecutor had tainted the jury by offering inadmissible character evidence and improper personal opinions regarding their credibility and culpability. They posited that the District Court\u2019s curative instruction was insufficient to remedy the taint. In response, Park argued that the Criswells themselves had opened the door to his remarks and that their conduct met the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>definitions of \u201cfreeloader\u201d and \u201csquatter.\u201d He maintained that his remarks had not been intended to inflame the jury or to comment on the Criswells\u2019 characters.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b646 The District Court recessed to research whether the challenged remarks warranted a mistrial. The court applied this Court\u2019s two-step analysis for determining whether improper comments have prejudiced a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. The first step is to determine whether the prosecutor made improper comments. If improper comments were made, the second step is to assess whether those comments prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Lindberg, </em>2008 MT 389, \u00b6 25, 347 Mont. 76, 196 P.3d 1252; <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Prejudice resulting from improper comments is not presumed; the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments prejudiced his or her right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>Lindberg, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 27. In determining whether prejudice resulted, the improper comments must be viewed in the context of the case in its entirety. <em>Lindberg, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b647 Applying this test, the District Court first found that Park\u2019s remarks were improper in that they were inflammatory, unprofessional, or without any basis in the record. The District Court then determined, however, that the Criswells had not met their burden of demonstrating that the remarks, viewed in the context of the entire three-day trial, had prejudiced their right to a fair and impartial trial. The court noted that Edwin himself had been \u201cloose with his speech\u201d and often \u201cspoke in a vernacular\u201d during his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u00b648 As noted, we review for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for a mistrial. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 11. We apply this deferential standard because the trial judge is in the best position to gauge the effect that the event at issue-whether the introduction of inadmissible evidence, the presentation of questionable testimony, or the making of improper comments during closing argument-will have on the jury. <em>State v. Seaman, </em>236 Mont. 466, 475-76, 771 P.2d 950, 956 (1989); <em>State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 27, 327 Mont. 238, 113 P.3d 290; <em>State v. Dubois, </em>2006 MT 89, \u00b6 61, 332 Mont. 44, 134 P.3d 82. Here, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\u00b649 As to the first prong of the analysis, we agree with the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Court that Park\u2019s remarks were improper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no evidence in the record supporting the assertion that the Criswells had been \u201crun out\u201d of Idaho, and although there was evidence that Edwin had a medical marijuana card, there was no evidence that Edwin had actually purchased marijuana in lieu of providing cat food. It is improper for a prosecutor to comment on evidence not of record during closing argument. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 26, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224. Furthermore, whether the Criswells met the definitions of \u201csquatters\u201d and \u201cfreeloaders\u201d is beside the point. The Criswells\u2019 financial situation was a legitimate issue to argue in relation to the \u201cwithout justification\u201d element, but labeling them as \u201csquatters\u201d and \u201cfreeloaders\u201d-which are generally understood to be disparaging terms-was not necessary to achieve that end. We have \u201cdisapprove^] of a prosecuting attorney using any derogatory epithets to refer to any defendant during the trial,\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>151 Mont. 151, 161, 440 P.2d 269, 275 (1968); <em>see also e.g. State v. Kingman, </em>2011 MT 269, \u00b6 58, 362 Mont. 330, 264 P.3d 1104, and we reaffirm that view here. A defendant must be tried for what he did, not for who he is. <em>U.S. v. Foskey, </em>636 F.2d 517, 523 (D.C. Cir. 1980); M. R. Evid. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b650 That said, we are not persuaded by the Criswells\u2019 argument under the \u201cprejudice\u201d prong of the analysis. They opine that because the Flathead Valley community took \u201ca special interest\u201d in the case, the jury was \u201calready feeling pressure from the audience,\u201d and Park\u2019s remarks \u201cserved only to bias the jury\u2019s feelings heading into deliberations.\u201d The trial judge considered this possibility and rejected it, and we do not believe the judge, in so doing, failed to employ conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason. First, after Edwin objected to Park\u2019s marijuana references, the judge reminded the jurors that they were to rely on their own memories of the evidence and were to disregard any assertions by counsel of matters not in evidence. \u201cThe potential prejudicial effect of improper arguments may be cured when the jury has been admonished not to regard those statements as evidence.\u201d <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 31. Second, the judge gave careful consideration to the Criswells\u2019 motion, recessing for over an hour to study the relevant legal standards under this Court\u2019s cases. Third, in denying the motion, the judge noted that the jury had already been exposed to \u201cloose\u201d language and \u201cvernacular\u201d during Edwin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>testimony. While this does not excuse Park\u2019s improper remarks in closing, it does tend to mitigate their prejudicial effect. Fourth, in asking us to find that Park\u2019s remarks served \u201conly\u201d to bias the jury against them, the Criswells ignore the possibility that the remarks instead served to impugn Park\u2019s credibility. After three days of testimony, the jurors already were well aware of the Criswells\u2019 living situation and the fact that they had relied on donations. Rather than being biased against the Criswells by Park\u2019s remarks, it is more plausible that the jurors saw those remarks for what they were: unprofessional and unnecessary disparagements of the defendants having no bearing on the question of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b651  \u201cBecause the trial court is in the best position to observe the jurors and determine the effect of questionable statements made in closing argument, it is given a latitude of discretion in its rulings on motions for mistrial based on such statements.\"Dubois, \u00b6 61. Here, the trial judge determined that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks-considered in the context of the entire trial-were not so egregious as to render the jurors incapable of judging the evidence fairly. The Criswells have not shown an abuse of discretion in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b652  The State presented sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Criswells, without justification, knowingly subjected their animals to mistreatment or neglect from December 17 to December 25, 2010. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Criswells\u2019 motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b653 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, RICE, COTTER, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\"> The District Court instructed the jury that this testimony was to be considered only for purposes of knowledge and absence of mistake, and not character or propensity</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-5\"> In its answer brief on appeal, the State notes that it \u201cdoes not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that the comments were \u2018unprofessional, unnecessary, and inflammatory.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b550-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH</author>\n<p id=\"ADF\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\u00b654 While I concur with the decision of the Court, I write separately only to emphasize the serious nature of what I believe to be the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. I concur that, given the overwhelming evidence in this case, the comments did not prejudice the Criswells\u2019 rights to a fair and impartial trial. Jurors, in my experience, tend to come to court grounded in common sense and good judgment and can generally overlook the attorneys\u2019 peculiarities or illogical missteps. Considering the District Court\u2019s careful review of the prosecutor\u2019s comments and the instructions that the court gave to the jury, there is little question that the proceedings were conducted fairly. The fact that we affirm the Criswells\u2019 convictions, however, does not mean that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>we condone or tolerate the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b655 WTiile not designed to be used as criteria for judicial evaluation of misconduct, the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice do provide an appropriate benchmark for professional conduct. Regarding the prosecution, Standard 3-5.8(c) provides that \u201c[t]he prosecutor should not make arguments calculated to appeal to the prejudices of the jury.\u201d ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function, Standard 3-5.8(c), 106 (3d ed. 1993). The comments further explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">Unfortunately, some prosecutors have permitted an excess of zeal for conviction or a fancy for exaggerated rhetoric to carry them beyond the permissible limits of argument. [See <em>e.g. Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78 (1935).] Of course, a prosecutor must be free to present arguments with logical force and vigor. Nonetheless, as the Supreme Court has remarked, \u201cwhile he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.\u201d <em>[Berger, </em>295 U.S. at 88.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">Remarks calculated to evoke bias or prejudice should never be made in a court by anyone, especially the prosecutor. Where the jury\u2019s predisposition against some particular segment of society is exploited to stigmatize the accused or the accused\u2019s witnesses, such argument clearly trespasses the bounds of reasonable inference or fair comment on the evidence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">ABA Standards at 107-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\u00b656 The United States Supreme Court recently rejected a petition for certiorari in a case where the prosecutor made similar appeals to prejudices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the Court denied the petition, Justice Sotomayor issued a statement that was joined by Justice Breyer to ensure that the Court\u2019s denial of the petition did not signal tolerance of the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks. In the statement, Justice Sotomayor quoted Judge Frank of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals: \u201cIf government counsel in a criminal suit is allowed to inflame the jurors by irrelevantly arousing their deepest prejudices, the jury may become in his hands a lethal weapon directed against defendants who may be innocent. He should not be permitted to summon that thirteenth juror, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>prejudice.\u201d <em>Calhoun, </em>133 S. Ct. at 1137 (quoting <em>United States v. Antonelli Fireworks Co., </em>155 F.2d 631, 659 (2d Cir. 1946) (J. Frank dissenting) (footnote omitted)). Justice Sotomayor, a former prosecutor, further remarked, \u201c[s]uch conduct diminishes the dignity of our criminal justice system and undermines respect for the rule of law. We expect the Government to seek justice, not to fan the flames of fear and prejudice.\u201d <em>Calhoun, </em>133 S. Ct. at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b657 In his explanation to the District Court, the prosecutor maintained that his remarks had not been intended to inflame the jury or to comment on the Criswells\u2019 characters. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 45. Personally, I find that hard to believe. If not intended to inflame the jury or comment on the Criswells\u2019 characters, then what were they intended to do? A prosecutor is an officer of the court. Prosecutors must strive to promote justice and the rule of law. By making these improper comments to the jury, the prosecutor undermined the respect for the criminal justice system. Although the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not grounds for a mistrial in this case, it must be emphasized that this type of conduct is not to be tolerated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\"> While questioning the defendant, who is African-American, the prosecutor asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve got African-Americans, you\u2019ve got Hispanics, you\u2019ve got a bag full of money.
