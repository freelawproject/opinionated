We restate the issue on appeal as follows: <em>Whether the termination proceedings complied with statutory requirements for proceedings involving Indian children.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-22\">\u00b62 We reverse the District Court\u2019s termination order and remand the case for the purpose of curing statutory deficiencies and holding a new termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AvV\">\u00b63 C.B. (Mother) is an enrolled member of the Chippewa Cree Tribe (Tribe). Each of her two children-two-year-old K.B. and five-year-old T.B.-qualifies as an \u201cIndian child\u201d under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4). ICWA\u2019s procedural requirements for involuntary proceedings involving Indian children and its criteria for termination of parental rights thus govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b64 On January 21, 2011, Mother, while extremely intoxicated, took the children outside for a walk in cold weather conditions. Proceeding down a busy street, Mother tipped the stroller over, causing the children to fall into snow and sleet. The children were transported to the emergency room to be treated for hypothermia and then were placed in a youth protective facility. Mother was arrested for two counts of felony criminal endangerment. After communicating with Mother, Kami Moore, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) child protection specialist assigned to the case, placed the children with their maternal grandmother in Box Elder, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b65 On January 28, 2011, the Department filed a Petition for Emergency Protective Services, Adjudication as Youth in Need of Care and Temporary Legal Custody. The District Court set a show cause hearing on the petition for March 7, 2011. On February 2, 2011, the court issued a citation to Mother, directing her to appear at the hearing. The Cascade County Attorney\u2019s Office sent notice of the hearing to the Tribe by certified mail, return receipt requested, on February 3, 2011. At the March 7, 2011 show cause hearing, Mother appeared with her attorney and stipulated that her children were youths in need of care. The court adjudicated the children as youths in need of care and granted temporary legal custody to the Department, pending a dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b66 A dispositional hearing was held on April 11, 2011, at which the Department presented a proposed treatment plan for Mother, who did not appear but was represented by counsel. Mother\u2019s counsel did not object to the treatment plan and stated that he had not had contact with Mother. Among other provisions, the plan required Mother to maintain sobriety, complete a chemical dependency evaluation, submit to random drug and alcohol screenings, acquire a stable residence, maintain employment, demonstrate that she could financially support the children, and maintain contact with Moore and with the children. Following the hearing, the court entered an order adopting the State\u2019s proposed treatment plan for Mother, approving the children\u2019s current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>placement with their maternal grandmother and granting temporary legal custody of the youths to the Department for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b67 The Tribe filed a Notice of Appearance and Intervention on June 29, 2011. The notice stated that \u201cthe Tribe\u2019s social service and other personnel will be available to assist the Court in its deliberations\u201d and that the Tribe was reserving the right \u201cto move for a transfer of jurisdiction in this cause should that become necessary.\u201d The District Court held a status hearing on July 11, 2011, at which Mother appeared and agreed to follow the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b68 The court granted the Department several extensions of temporary legal custody of the children between September 2011 and July 2012, as Mother attempted to complete the treatment plan but made limited progress. The court also held numerous status hearings, at which Mother\u2019s counsel often appeared without Mother and reported that he had had no contact with her. Moore\u2019s reports also indicated that Mother, in contravention of the treatment plan, failed to keep in contact with Moore and with the children. Those events, detailed below, led the Department to develop a plan for permanent placement of the children and eventually seek termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b69 On October 3, 2011, the District Court held a hearing on the State\u2019s petition to extend legal custody, at which Mother was present with counsel and the Tribe appeared telephonically. The court granted the State\u2019s petition to extend temporary legal custody for an additional six months \u201cto allow the Mother to complete her treatment plan and to allow the child[ren] to be reunified with the Mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b610 On January 23, 2012, the court held a status hearing, at which Mother was not present but was represented by counsel. The Department informed the court that it intended to seek termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights. According to the court, Mother\u2019s attorney \u201ctook no position because he had not had any contact with his client in quite some time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b611 On April 13, 2012, the county attorney filed a Petition to Extend Temporary Legal Custody. The attached affidavit of Moore stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0C\">[Mother]... has not had any contact with me for four months. The numbers that she has provided me with have either been disconnected or are wrong numbers. [Mother] is not engaged with any of her services providers or me. [Mother] does not visit with her children so she is losing any connection she may have had with them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">A few days later, the county attorney filed a Motion for Permanency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Plan Hearing and Notice of Permanency Plan Report. The attached report and plan, prepared by Moore, stated that the Department\u2019s \u201cprimary goal\u201d was \u201creunification with the birthmother [sic], dependent on the completion of the treatment plan,\u201d but \u201cif reunification does not occur[,] the concurrent plan is adoption with family.\u201d The report noted that the children\u2019s maternal grandmother expressed desire to serve as the children\u2019s permanent placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b612 On April 16, 2012, the court held a hearing on the proposed permanency plan, at which Mother was present with her counsel and, according to the court, \u201ctook no position\u201d on the plan. The court\u2019s April 24, 2012 order adopting the permanency plan stated that \u201cMother stipulated to the extension of Temporary Legal Custody for a period of 3 months and to the permanency plan. The Mother stated that she is currently in chemical dependency treatment and is attempting to demonstrate that she is committed to completing the treatment plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aghn\">\u00b613 On June 20, 2012, the county attorney filed another petition to extend temporary legal custody so that Mother would have \u201ctime to work towards the successful completion of her respective court-ordered treatment plan.\u201d Moore\u2019s attached affidavit stated once again that Mother had not been in contact with her and the Department would \u201cstart the termination process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b614 On September 17, 2012, the county attorney filed a Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and Termination of Parental Rights. The petition requested termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, due to failure to comply with the court-ordered treatment plan. The District Court set a termination hearing for October 22, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b615 Mother appeared with counsel at the termination hearing and contested the termination of her parental rights, suggesting instead that the State be granted a long-term guardianship of the children. The Tribe did not appear. Mother\u2019s attorney informed the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">I don\u2019t think alcoholism is a reason to terminate under the Indian Child Welfare Act. My client has been making visits. My client is employed. And my client has been going to group care, in regard to an alcohol issue. The Indian Child Welfare Act does not encourage termination regarding alcoholism....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Because counsel could not support his client\u2019s position with a specific citation to ICWA, the court responded that it could not consider counsel\u2019s objection: \u201cI\u2019m saying, for the record, to the Montana Supreme Court and to you, frankly, I can\u2019t consider an objection on legal authority that\u2019s not cited to the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u00b616 The court heard testimony from Anna Fisher, the State\u2019s ICWA expert, who opined that the children would be \u201cat risk\u201d if returned to Mother\u2019s custody and that termination was \u201cin the best interest of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b617 At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights. The court\u2019s November 1, 2012 order stated that, \u201cexcept for a period of time between February and July of 2011, where mother was living with her mother, the maternal grandmother, in Box Elder with the children] and grandmother under a safety plan, mother has not completed any requirement of her treatment plan.\u201d The court noted that Mother had been given numerous opportunities to comply with the treatment plan, but had on every occasion failed to follow through. The court also relied on Fisher\u2019s hearing testimony, which it summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">A qualified Indian Child Welfare Act expert testified at this hearing and testified essentially that continued or resumed custody of the children with the mother was likely to result in immediate risk of harm to the children, due to the mother\u2019s failure to obtain and maintain a stable home as required by her treatment plan, and the immediate danger of alcohol relapse, due to her continued untreated Chemical Dependency problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The court found that \u201ctermination is not contrary to the customs of the Chippewa Cree Tribe,\u201d and that \u201ccircumstancefs] of abject failure or refusal of a parent to engage and endeavor in any positive manner, to address manifest parental problems\u201d supported its decision to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights. Mother appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u00b618 We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights. <em>In the Matter of T.W.F. and A.R.M., 2009 </em>MT 207, \u00b6 17, 351 Mont. 233, 210 P.3d 174. In a case governed by ICWA, we will uphold the district court\u2019s termination of parental rights if a reasonable fact-finder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. <em>T.W.F., </em>\u00b6 18 <em>(citing In the Matter of A.N., </em>2005 MT 19, \u00b6 19, 325 Mont. 379, 106 P.3d 556). \u201cA district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts of a case is a legal conclusion which we review to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>In re J.W.C., </em>2011 MT 312, \u00b6 15, 363 Mont. 85, 265 P.3d 1265 (quoting <em>In re C.H., </em>2000 MT 64, \u00b6 9, 299 Mont. 62, 997 P.2d 776).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u00b619 ICWA provides that \u201cany parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such [Indian] child was removed, and the Indian child\u2019s tribe may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that such action violated any provision of section 1911, 1912, and 1913 of this title.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b620 <em>Whether the termination proceedings complied with statutory requirements for proceedings involving Indian children.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b621 Congress enacted ICWA in 1978 to address the \u201calarmingly high\u201d percentage of Indian families \u201cbroken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies\u201d and the \u201calarmingly high\u201d percentage of placement of those children \u201cin non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901(4). Thus, in order to \u201cprotect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families,\u201d ICWA provides minimum federal standards, which must be followed strictly by state courts, to ensure that placement \u201cwill reflect the unique values of Indian culture.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902; <em>see </em>Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings (ICWA Guidelines), 44 Fed. Reg. 67584,67586, \u00a7 A.1 (Nov. 26,1979) (\u201cProceedings in state courts involving the custody of Indian children shall follow strict procedures and meet stringent requirements to justify any result in an individual case contrary to these preferences.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b622 Mother argues that notice of the termination proceedings was insufficient under ICWA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">In any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.... No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). As a preliminary matter, we disagree with the State that Mother\u2019s failure to object before the District Court waives our review of this issue. A \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914 has been held to include an appeals court; thus, failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>to comply with ICWA notice requirements may be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See In re Gabriel G., </em>206 Cal. App. 4th 1160, 1166 (Cal. App. 2012) (recognizing that \u201c[t]he issue of ICWA notice is not waived by the parent\u2019s failure to first raise it in the trial court\u201d) (internal citation omitted). We are in agreement with numerous other jurisdictions that 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914 \u201cspecifically confers standing on a parent to petition a court to invalidate a termination proceeding upon showing that notice requirements have not been satisfied.\u201d <em>In the Interest of W.D.H., </em>43 S.W.3d 30, 38 (Tex. App. 2001); <em>see also In re L.A.M., </em>727 P.2d 1057, 1059 (Alaska 1986); <em>In re S.M.H., </em>103 P.3d 976, 981-82 (Kan. App. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b623 Mother concedes that \u201c[w]hen the proceedings first began, the State filed notice in compliance with the Act,\u201d but argues that the State did not provide sufficient notice of the termination proceedings. Mother points out that no certificate of service was filed with the court or attached to the petition for termination-even if there was, she argues that the Tribe should have received notice of the termination proceeding by registered mail with return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b624 As noted, the Tribe received notice of the initial dependency proceedings by registered mail, in accordance with 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a), and filed a notice of intervention in the case. The State\u2019s September 17, 2012 Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and Termination of Parental Rights, as well as the court\u2019s order setting the termination hearing, indicate by notation that copies were \u201ccc\u2019d\u201d to Mother, Mother\u2019s counsel and the Tribe, but the Petition includes no accompanying certificate of service and the record contains no documentation to demonstrate that timely service was accomplished.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Tribe did not appear at the termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b625 This Court has found persuasive the ICWA Guidelines adopted by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and applies them in Indian child custody cases. <em>J.W.C., </em>\u00b6 21. The Guidelines state that \u201c[t]he time limits are minimum ones required by the Act.\u201d ICWA Guidelines, 44 Fed. Reg. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>67589, \u00a7 B.5. The ICWA Guidelines further provide that \"[t]he original or a copy of each notice sent pursuant to this section shall be filed with the court together with any return receipts or other proof of service\u201d so that \u201cthere will be a complete record of efforts to comply with the Act.\u201d ICWA Guidelines, 44 Fed. Reg. at 67588-89, \u00a7\u00a7 B.4(d)-B.5. Since the record does not reflect that both Mother and the Tribe received notice ten days in advance of the hearing, we conclude that notice was insufficient under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). <em>See People ex rel. S.R.M., </em>153 P.3d 438, 442 (Colo. App. 2006) (failure to provide notice of termination proceedings \u201cviolates the plain meaning of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a),\u201d even where the state provided proper notice of the dispositional hearing); <em>S.H. v. Calhoun Co. Dept. of Human Res., </em>798 So. 2d 684, 692 (Ala. Civ. App. 2001) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b626 Mother argues next that the State failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that her continued custody was \u201clikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage [to] her children\u201d and \u201cthat the Department utilized \u2018active efforts\u2019 to reunite [Mother] with her children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b627 We agree with Mother that the State\u2019s case lacked the required expert testimony that Mother\u2019s conduct would likely cause serious emotional or physical harm to the children. ICWA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">No termination of parental rights may be ordered ... in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). Additionally, Montana\u2019s statute governing the termination of parental rights was amended in 2005 to include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">(5) If a proceeding under this chapter involves an Indian child and is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, a <em>qualified expert witness is required to testify </em>that the continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Section 41-3-609(5), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u00b628 Though \u201ca district court need not conform its decision to the expert\u2019s testimony,\u201d the language of both ICWA and \u00a7 41-3-609(5), MCA, makes clear that expert testimony on the issue is necessary in making a termination decision. <em>See In re D.S.B., </em>2013 MT 112, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 37, 300 P.3d 702; <em>A.N., </em>\u00b6 32; <em>T.W.F., </em>\u00b6 26. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>failure to elicit expert testimony regarding whether continued custody will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the children requires reversal of the termination order.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b629 Here, as noted, the ICWA expert was questioned regarding whether the children would be \u201cat risk\u201d if placed in Mother\u2019s custody and whether termination was \u201cin the best interest of the children\u201d-not whether Mother\u2019s continued custody would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage. Fisher testified in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">Q. Okay. Based on this case, do you believe that the children would be at risk if they were to be returned to their mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">A. With the mother not having a stable home of her own, yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">Q. What about mother\u2019s chemical dependency issues and the fact that she hasn\u2019t had to complete any treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">A. I just briefly spoke with the mother and she said that she\u2019d been clean for a while, but I don\u2019t know that. So-Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">A. -but with chemical dependency, no, I would not return them. Q. Okay. And do you believe that termination is in the best interest of the children at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">A. At this point, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-11\">THE COURT: What\u2019s the risk that you\u2019re concerned about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-12\">THE WITNESS: Of them being returned to their mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-13\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-14\">THE WITNESS: Not a stable home environment and relapsing, for the mother. Right now they\u2019re in a safe environment with their grandmother. And like I said, she has brothers and sisters that are able to help out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-15\">[CROSS-EXAMINATION]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-16\">Q. Good morning. Do you think, if, given additional time or more of an opportunity, that [Mother] could follow through with the chemical dependency and become a functioning parent of these children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-17\">A. I believe it could happen, yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-18\">In the absence of expert testimony that continued custody with Mother would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to the children, the evidentiary record does not meet the statutory standard to support the required finding beyond a reasonable doubt. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Fisher\u2019s testimony, the District Court found that placement with Mother was \u201clikely to result in immediate risk of harm to the children\u201d-an insufficient finding under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f) and \u00a7 41-3-609(5), MCA, to support the court\u2019s termination order.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b630 The ICWA Guidelines indicate that evidence of alcohol abuse alone is insufficient to determine \u201cthat continued custody is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d ICWA Guidelines, 44 Fed. Reg. at 67593, \u00a7 D.3.c. While the court properly may consider all evidence presented during the hearing in determining the sufficiency of the evidence for termination, the Montana statute was amended after this Court decided <em>A.N. </em>and leaves no doubt that the evidence must include the expert\u2019s opinion that serious emotional or physical damage to the children will result if they are left in the parent\u2019s custody. Section 41-3-609(5), MCA. \u201cThe evidence must show the causal relationship between the conditions that exist and the damage that is likely to result.\u201d ICWA Guidelines, 44 Fed. Reg. at 67593, \u00a7 D.3.c. Fisher\u2019s testimony fell short of this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b631 Finally, Mother argues that the State failed to demonstrate that it made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">Any party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We have clarified that the State must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that active efforts were made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. <em>In the Matter of </em>G.S., 2002 MT 245, \u00b6 33, 312 Mont. 108, 59 P.3d 1063; <em>D.S.B., </em>\u00b6 15. We observed in <em>G.S. </em>that a \u201c[cjommon sense construction of the meaning of\u2018active efforts\u2019 requires only that \u2018timely affirmative steps be taken to accomplish the goal which Congress has set: to avoid the breakup of Indian families whenever possible by providing services [designed] to remedy problems which might lead to severance of the parent-child relationship.\u2019 \u201d G.S., \u00b6 36 (quoting <em>Letitia v. Super. Ct., </em>81 Cal. App. 4th 1009, 1016 (Cal. App. 2000)). In meeting this \u201cheightened responsibility,\u201d the State \u201ccannot simply wait for a parent to complete a treatment plan.\u201d <em>T. </em>W.F., \u00b6 27. Nor does placement with a family member automatically satisfy the standard. Courts have held that \u201cplacement is a separate issue from active efforts, and that the two issues must be analyzed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>separately. The exception to that rule-under which a placement decision may be relevant to an active efforts analysis-applies when a child\u2019s placement directly impacts a parent\u2019s ability to participate in remedial efforts.\u201d <em>Thea G. v. State, </em>291 P.3d 957, 963 (Alaska 2013); <em>see also David S. v. State, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., Office of Children\u2019s Servs., </em>270 P.3d 767, 780 (Alaska 2012) (\u201c[PJlacement decisions present a separate analytical question from termination decisions.\u201d); <em>In re A.A., </em>167 Cal. App. 4th 1292, 1318 (Cal. App. 2008) (\u201cICWA and... California\u2019s statutory law address the issue of an Indian child\u2019s placement separately from the issue of active efforts. Following their lead, we distinguish the issue of placement from that of active efforts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b632 In this case, the State\u2019s implementation of a safety plan to maintain a trial home visit at the maternal grandmother\u2019s house demonstrated an effort to prevent breakup of the Indian family. Its presentation at the termination hearing, however, focused on the standards for termination under Montana law; neither the State nor the court in its findings of fact and conclusions of law expressly addressed whether ICWA\u2019s heightened standard for active efforts was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b633 Because we are reversing for a new termination hearing, the State will have the opportunity to further develop the record regarding \u201cactive efforts\u201d that were made and the court\u2019s findings of fact should address those efforts. As we have held, the court also may consider \u201ca parent\u2019s demonstrated apathy and indifference to participating in the treatment.\u201d <em>A.N., </em>\u00b6 23. Here, while the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law properly contain detailed information about Mother\u2019s repeated failures, the court did not address the Department\u2019s active efforts to provide services and programs aside from finding that the State developed a treatment plan tailored to address Mother\u2019s chemical dependency problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b634  In conclusion, our review of the record reveals that the termination proceedings did not comply with the mandates of ICWA and its parallel state provisions. Mother and the Tribe should have received notice of the petition for termination at least ten days in advance of the termination hearing, but the record does not substantiate that they did. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). At the termination hearing, the ICWA expert was required to testify as to whether Mother\u2019s continued custody was \u201clikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the children],\u201d but she did not. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f); \u00a7 41-3-609(5), MCA. The State was required to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>District Court that \u201cactive efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful,\u201d but the District Court\u2019s termination order does not discuss which, if any, \u201cactive efforts\u201d were made. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d). ICWA sets minimum federal standards for proceedings involving Indian children, and we are compelled to make sure its requirements are followed. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b635 Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s termination order and remand the case for the purpose of holding a new termination hearing. Because we reverse, we do not reach Mother\u2019s argument that she received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<judges id=\"b289-5\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> A certificate of service executed by the Cascade County Sheriff indicates that Mother may have been served on October 14, 2012 \u2014 only eight days prior to the termination hearing \u2014 with copies of the Citation, Order to Show Cause, Notice of Show Cause and Adjudicatory Hearing, and Temporary Legal Custody, and Affidavit of Child Protection Specialist for Emergency Protective Services and Temporary Legal Custody. The document thus does not verify that Mother was served with notice of the termination proceedings. It does not even include Mother\u2019s correct name.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
