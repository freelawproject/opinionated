We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court properly interpreted the \u201ceffectively prohibit\u201d language in \u00a7 15-7-202(5), MCA, with respect to the restrictive covenants attached to Heidecker\u2019s property </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b64 Heidecker purchased a 240-acre parcel of land in Gallatin County, Montana in 1980. The property had served as a dairy farm and gravel pit before the purchase. Heidecker has lived in one of the two houses on the property since the purchase. Heidecker\u2019s uncle originally lived in the other house. Heidecker sold the other house to Linda and Jerry Crisp (Crisps) in 1995 after the uncle\u2019s death. Heidecker shut down the dairy operation shortly after the purchase, but has rented out the land continuously for grain and hay production since about 1980. Heidecker subdivided a 30-acre parcel of this property into one-acre parcels in 1995. The subdivision is known as Bridger Lake Meadows (BLM). Heidecker adopted covenants for BLM at the time that he subdivided the property. The covenants reflect Heidecker\u2019s intent \u201cto create thereon a residential community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b65 In particular, Article XI, Section 2, of the covenants provides that \u201c[e]ach and every one of the Lots shall be used for private residential purposes only.\u201d The covenants enforce this intent by limiting construction to \u201cone single family residence structure\u201d and an attached garage. With respect to agriculture, the covenants prohibit the landowners from engaging in activities that would result in noise or vibration, light, odor, dust, smoke, or other air pollution. The covenants further prohibit landowners from owning and keeping livestock or other animals used for commercial purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">\u00b66 Heidecker discussed the covenants with Ty Typolt, Area Manager for DOR, at the time that he created the covenants. Heidecker had concerns that adoption of the covenants could trigger a property tax reclassification of the BLM property. Typolt apparently agreed that adoption of the covenants would not change immediately the agricultural classification of BLM to a residential classification. Typolt further agreed that lots at BLM would be reclassified as residential once they were sold for residential purposes. Heidecker also met with the Gallatin County planning staff and the City of Belgrade Planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Director to ensure that he could continue to use the property for agriculture. The Planning Director assured Heidecker that no provisions of the Gallatin County Subdivision Regulations barred the continued agricultural use of BLM. Heidecker has sold no lots in BLM. BLM remains in hay and grain production.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b67 DOR reviewed BLM\u2019s covenants as part of its 2009 reappraisal. DOR reclassified BLM from agricultural land to residential tract land. Heidecker filed a request for informal review with DOR on the grounds that \u201c[njothing has changed on the land or its usage.\u201d DOR denied Heidecker\u2019s request due to the restrictions imposed by the covenants. Heidecker appealed to the Gallatin County Tax Appeal Board (GCTAB).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b68 GCTAB held a hearing on Heidecker\u2019s appeal after which it upheld DOR\u2019s reclassification. GCTAB did not rely on the prohibition in the covenants. GCTAB instead determined that BLM \u201cmeets at least 3 of the criteria for a subdivision\u201d contained in ARM 42.20.156(1)(d), and, therefore, \u201ccannot be considered agricultural land.\u201d Heidecker appealed the GCTAB\u2019s decision to the State Tax Appeal Board (STAB).</p>\n<p id=\"A5e\">\u00b69 DOR argued before STAB that two factors supported reclassification of BLM. DOR first argued that the covenants limited the land to residential use. DOR also argued that BLM had been platted and that BLM met four of the infrastructure criteria contained in ARM 42.20.156(1)(d): paved road, utilities, a fire hydrant, and landscaping. STAB disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b610 STAB determined that Heidecker\u2019s property satisfies the statutory test for agricultural classification \u201cbecause, in the aggregate, it totals 240 acres, less a few acres for the two residences on the property, and it is actively devoted to agricultural use.\u201d STAB rejected application of the improvements criteria contained in ARM 42.20.156(1)(d) due to the fact that \u201cthe evidence demonstrated that the land does not meet any three of the criteria.\u201d STAB also concluded that the covenants did not \u201ceffectively prohibit\u201d agricultural use of BLM. STAB reasoned that covenants simply represent \u201cagreements between neighbors\u201d that can be enforced \u201conly by those neighbors.\u201d No neighbors, including Crisps, ever have objected to the agricultural use of the land. More importantly, Heidecker continuously has \u201craised agricultural crops on the land.\u201d STAB deemed this continuous agricultural use \u201cclear proof\u2019 that the covenants have not effectively prohibited agricultural use.</p>\n<p id=\"APP\">\u00b611 DOR petitioned for judicial review on the sole issue of whether STAB properly interpreted the phrase \u201ceffectively prohibit\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 15-7-202(5), MCA, and the attendant implications for the term \u201cprohibit\u201d as used in ARM 42.20.156. The District Court interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the \u201ceffectively prohibit\u201d language to mean to \u201cforbid and action in a way that accomplishes the purpose and brings about the expected result.\u201d The District Court determined that evidence in the record established that the covenants had failed to accomplish effectively \u201cany prohibition on the agricultural use of the land.\u201d DOR appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding an administrative order issued by STAB to determine whether the district court correctly interpreted the law. <em>Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2011 MT 141, \u00b6 14, 361 Mont. 39, 255 P.3d 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the District Court properly interpreted the \u201ceffectively prohibit\u201d language in \u00a7 15-7-202(5), MCA, with respect to the restrictive covenants attached to Heidecker\u2019s property?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">\u00b614 Section 15-7-202(5), MCA, provides that land may not be classified or valued as agricultural land \u201cif it has stated covenants or other restrictions that effectively prohibit its use for agricultural purposes.\u201d DOR argues that the District Court improperly looked beyond the statute\u2019s plain language to analyze the actual purpose to which the land has been put. DOR further argues that the District Court improperly looked beyond the plain language of the covenants in an attempt to glean the landowner\u2019s intent. DOR urges the Court to constrain its analysis to whether the written provisions of the covenants prove legally sufficient to \u201ceffectively prohibit\u201d agricultural use.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u00b615 The District Court interpreted the phrase \u201ceffectively prohibit\u201d \u201cto forbid an action in a way that accomplishes the purpose and brings about the expected result.\u201d Article XI, Section 2, of the covenants requires that all lots in BLM \u201cshall be used for residential purposes only.\u201d This straightforward language makes clear that no purposes other than residential will be tolerated for lots in BLM. The covenants further discourage non-residential purposes through prohibitions on commercial livestock operations and on conduct that produces \u201codor, dust, smoke, or other air pollution.\u201d A BLM lot owner who seeks to engage in agricultural activities would be hard pressed to evade these clear restrictions in any action brought by another BLM lot owner who would seek to enforce the covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u00b616 We face a situation, however, in which no lot owner seeks to enforce the covenants. The only two lot owners in BLM, whose ownerships predate the subdivision, have acquiesced to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>continuation of agricultural operations on the property for many years. STAB specifically determined that Heidecker and Crisps agreed to permit continued agricultural use of the land, Crisps never have objected to the agricultural use of the land, and most importantly, the land has been used continuously to grow crops. We agree with the District Court that nothing in \u00a7 15-7-202(5), MCA, requires us to ignore these facts when we apply the statute to the covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b617 It remains difficult to argue that the covenants forbid agricultural activities \u201cin a way that accomplishes the purpose and brings about the expected result\u201d when agriculture has continued on the BLM lots since the adoption of the covenants. Restrictive covenants provide contractual rights to the beneficiaries of the covenants. <em>McKay v. Wilderness </em>Dev., <em>LLC, </em>2009 MT 410, \u00b6 58, 353 Mont. 471, 221 P.3d 1184. No current beneficiary of the covenants-neither Heidecker nor Crisps-has chosen to exercise these contractual rights. We decline to allow DOR, in effect, to enforce the contractual rights provided by the covenants in this case when the land continues, without opposition, to be used for agricultural purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b618 This outcome also comports with the principle of Montana\u2019s property tax system that \u201c[a]ll lands must be classified according to their use or uses.\u201d Section 15-7-103(2), MCA. The statutes specifically recognize that the market value of many agricultural properties derives from \u201cspeculative purchases that do not reflect the productive capability of agricultural land.\u201d Section 15-7-201(1), MCA. This concern with speculation drives the legislative intent that \u201cbona fide agricultural properties be classified and assessed at a value that is exclusive of values attributed to urban influences or speculative purposes.\u201d Section 15-7-201(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b619  DOR retains the ability to evaluate in the future whether BLM continues to be used for \u201cbona fide\u201d agricultural purposes. STAB determined that no doubt currently exists on this point. Once Heidecker begins to sell or market lots at BLM, or once Heidecker stops using the property for agricultural purposes, DOR may evaluate anew whether the covenants \u201ceffectively prohibit\u201d agriculture as contemplated by the amendment to subsection (5). Until that time, however, we agree with the District Court that Heidecker\u2019s continued use of the land for agricultural purposes belies any claim that the covenants \u201ceffectively prohibit\u201d agricultural purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-8\">JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
