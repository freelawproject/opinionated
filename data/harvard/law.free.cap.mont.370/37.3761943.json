We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b63 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court properly concluded that J.H.\u2019s treatment plans were appropriate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b64 <em>Issue Two: Whether the State presented sufficient evidence to terminate J.H.\u2019s parental rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u00b65 Through the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), the State petitioned for Emergency Protective Services, Adjudication as Youths in Need of Care, and Temporary Legal Custody for the children on February 24,2010. The State\u2019s petition alleged that J.H. had sexually abused the children, medically neglected the children, physically neglected the children, and exposed the children to unreasonable risks. J.H. stipulated on June 11, 2010, that the children should be adjudicated as Youths in Need of Care. At a hearing on July 7, 2010, the District Court held that the children are Indian Children, and the ICWA applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">\u00b66 The DPHHS prepared Phase I and Phase II treatment plans for J.H. The District Court approved the treatment plans on January 28, 2011. The treatment plans included a variety of tasks that J.H. had to complete that were intended to address the issues that led to the children being removed from the parents\u2019 care. When the court approved the treatment plans, J.H. was in the Department of Correction\u2019s custody for failing to register as a violent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">\u00b67 The State petitioned for permanent legal custody and termination of J.H.\u2019s parental rights on February 7, 2012. The District Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>hearings on February 24, 2012, May 2, 2012, May 29, 2012, and May 31, 2012. At the hearings, the court heard testimony from an ICWA expert, the State\u2019s Child Protection Specialist (CPS), the children\u2019s therapist, and J.H. The District Court issued an order on August 2, 2012, that terminated J.H.\u2019s parental rights to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re A.N., </em>2005 MT 19, \u00b6 17, 325 Mont. 379, 106 P.3d 556. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>In re </em>A.N., \u00b6 17. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>In re I.B., </em>2011 MT 82, \u00b6 18, 360 Mont. 132, 255 P.3d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b69 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court properly concluded that J.H.\u2019s treatment plans were appropriate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5V\">\u00b610  J.H. argues that the District Court erroneously concluded that his treatment plans were appropriate because they were not narrowly tailored to fit his needs and circumstances. J.H. failed, however, to object to either of the treatment plans or any of their specific tasks. \u201cA parent who does not object to a treatment plan\u2019s goals or tasks waives the right to argue on appeal that the plan was not appropriate.\u201d <em>In re H.R., </em>2012 MT 290, \u00b6 10, 367 Mont. 338, 291 P.3d 583. We therefore refuse to consider J.H.\u2019s argument that his treatment plans were not appropriate. We nevertheless note that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that the treatment plans were appropriate because they sought to address J.H.\u2019s reported sexual abuse of the children and his chemical dependency issues, the issues that caused the children to be adjudicated as youths in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u00b611 <em>Issue Two: Whether the State presented sufficient evidence to terminate J.H.\u2019s parental rights under the ICWA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">\u00b612 Under Montana law, a district court may terminate parental rights if the child is adjudicated as a youth in need of care; an appropriate treatment plan has been approved by the court; the parent has not complied with the treatment plan or the treatment plan has not been successful; and the conduct or condition of the parent rendering him unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. The parent must completely comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the treatment plan. <em>In re H.R., </em>\u00b6 12. Partial or even substantial compliance is insufficient. <em>In re I.B., </em>\u00b6 27. A court must consider the best interests of the child as the paramount factor when determining whether the conduct or condition rendering the parent unfit is likely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA; <em>In re B.S., </em>2009 MT 98, \u00b6 32, 350 Mont. 86, 206 P.3d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b613 When the ICWA applies, the State additionally has to satisfy the court that it made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that those efforts were unsuccessful. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d). Because the State was seeking termination of J.H.\u2019s parental rights, the State had to prove that it had made \u201cactive efforts\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re G.S., </em>2002 MT 245, \u00b6 33, 312 Mont. 108, 59 P.3d 1063. The ICWA also requires a state seeking termination of parental rights of an Indian child to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the child would likely suffer serious emotional or physical damage if the parent was to maintain custody. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). The evidence that supports such a finding must include the testimony of a qualified expert. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b614 Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s termination of J.H.\u2019s parental rights if the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that termination was warranted under \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, a rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the State had made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to provide J.H. with remedial services and rehabilitative programs, and a rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the children would have likely suffered serious emotional or physical damage if J.H. was to maintain custody. <em>See In re I.B., </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">A. Active Efforts</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b615 J.H. argues that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it had made \u201cactive efforts\u201d as required by the ICWA. \u201cActive efforts\u201d implies a heightened responsibility compared to passive efforts. <em>In re T.W.F., </em>2009 MT 207, \u00b6 27, 351 Mont. 233, 210 P.3d 174. Although the State cannot simply wait for the parent to complete a treatment plan under the ICWA, a court may consider the parent\u2019s failure to participate when determining whether the State had made \u201cactive efforts.\u201d <em>In re T.W.F., </em>\u00b6 27. Additionally, a parent\u2019s incarceration may limit the remedial and rehabilitative services that the State can make available to the parent to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. That is not to say that the State\u2019s obligation to make \u201cactive efforts\u201d is excused if a parent is incarcerated, but we will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>fault the State if its efforts are curtailed by the parent\u2019s own criminal behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b616 Here, the State provided J.H. with two court-ordered treatment plans, assistance of a CPS, supervised visitation, drug testing, chemical dependency treatment, counseling, referrals to treatment providers, in-home services, and parenting coaching. J.H. refused to avail himself of those services even before he was incarcerated. After J.H. was incarcerated, the CPS attempted to help him keep in contact with the children, one of his Phase II treatment plan tasks. The CPS testified, however, that J.H. had only sent one letter to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">\u00b617  The \u201cactive efforts\u201d that the State made to provide services for the birth mother and the children are also relevant to our review because the purpose of the ICWA is to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. The State provided the children with individual counseling, implemented a trial home visit with the birth mother, and attempted to place the children with Indian family members. Based on all of the evidence presented at the hearings, a rational trier of fact could have concluded that the State had made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that those efforts were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">B. Serious Emotional or Physical Damage</p>\n<p id=\"Atv\">\u00b618 J.H. argues that the ICWA expert\u2019s testimony at the termination hearings failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the children would likely suffer severe emotional or physical harm if he was to maintain custody. Under the ICWA, the evidence supporting termination of parental rights must include expert testimony. 25 U.S.C. 1912(f). Though expert testimony is required on the issue, a court\u2019s finding that a child will likely suffer serious emotional or physical harm if the parent continues custody does not have to be based on that testimony alone. <em>In re </em>A.N., \u00b6 32 (\u201ca district court need not conform its decision to a particular piece of evidence or a particular expert\u2019s report or testimony ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b619  The record contains more than sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the children would likely suffer serious emotional or physical harm if J.H. retained custody. The State\u2019s ICWA expert testified that she believed that the children would suffer both emotional and physical harm if J.H. was to retain custody. The children\u2019s therapist also testified that she would have concerns if J.H. was to retain custody. The therapist explained the children\u2019s significant emotional needs, and testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>she did not think that those needs would be met if the children were placed in J.H.\u2019s care. Moreover, the CPS testified that J.H. had failed to complete a single task on either of his treatment plans in twenty-five months and had failed to address the conduct or condition that had rendered him unfit to parent. Based on all of the evidence presented at the hearings, the District Court did not err when it concluded that the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the children would likely suffer serious emotional or physical harm if J.H. was to retain custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b620 For the reasons stated above, the order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-5\">JUSTICES RICE, WHEAT, MORRIS and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
