The District Court entered a default judgment in favor of WLF. Defendants and Appellants Valery Ann and Daniel O\u2019Connell (the O\u2019Connells) moved to vacate the entry of default judgment some nine months later. The District Court denied the motion, and the O\u2019Connells appealed this denial pro se. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court slightly abuse its discretion by denying the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion to vacate its entry of default judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err by awarding attorney fees and costs to the Wittich Law Firm, P.C.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">\u00b65 3. <em>Did the District Court err by denying the O\u2019Connells\u2019 M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) and M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motions seeking to either alter or set aside the court\u2019s January 6, 2012 denial of the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion to vacate the entry of default judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">\u00b66 Plaintiff WLF filed a complaint on October 27, 2010 alleging that the O\u2019Connells and WLF had previously entered into a contract for legal services and that the O\u2019Connells had breached this contract by failing to fully pay for the legal services performed by WLF. The complaint requested a judgment in the amount of $2,892.26, interest, attorney fees, and costs. The O\u2019Connells were each personally served with the complaint and a summons on November 1, 2010. The summonses notified the O\u2019Connells that their answer was due within 20 days after the completion of service of the summons and complaint. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 12(a) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">\u00b67 The O\u2019Connells failed to file an answer or otherwise appear within the required time period. WLF and the O\u2019Connells did communicate about the alleged owed payments, however. WLF sent the O\u2019Connells a letter on November 17, 2010, advising them that the account in question showed an outstanding balance of $2,232.56. This lower balance reflected a June 10, 2010 transfer of $662.25 from another of the O\u2019Connells\u2019 trust accounts with WLF. The letter requested that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>O\u2019Connells \u201cpay the remaining $2,232.56 immediately so we can close out your account.\u201d The O\u2019Connells thereafter paid $2,138.57 on December 2, 2010. Immediately after receiving this payment, WLF sent the O\u2019Connells another letter stating that they still owed the firm $93.99 and asking the O\u2019Connells to remit this remaining payment by December 10, 2010. On December 1, 2010, while this correspondence was occurring, WLF requested an entry of default from the Clerk of the District Court, and the clerk ordered entry of a default on December 3, 2010. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 55(a) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b68 The O\u2019Connells did not send the requested $93.99 by December 10, and WLF filed an Application for Default Judgment on December 16,2010. The attached brief and affidavit claimed that the O\u2019Connells had last submitted a payment to WLF for outstanding legal fees on December 2, 2010, and claimed that the O\u2019Connells still owed $93.99. An affidavit from Arthur Wittich attached a copy of the legal services contract between the O\u2019Connells and WLF. This contract provided that the failure to pay costs and fees incurred in the course of WLF\u2019s representation would subject the O\u2019Connells to \u201call collection costs, including attorney fees, for any action necessary\u201d and that overdue balances would accrue interest at 12% per year. An attached accounting of the costs and fees WLF had incurred while pursuing the action showed a balance of $808.80. The District Court subsequently entered an order of default judgment against the O\u2019Connells for $902.79 on March 9, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b69 The O\u2019Connells filed a \u201cMotion to Vacate Default/Order\u201d on December 5, 2011, roughly nine months after the entry of default judgment. Their motion sought to vacate the default judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the O\u2019Connells did not state which Rule 60(b) reason their motion was based on, their motion largely contested WLF\u2019s accounting of the owed legal fees, alleged various newly discovered \u201cerrors and hidden deceits,\u201d and alleged that a WLF bookkeeper had committed fraud by leading them to believe that WLF\u2019s complaint would be dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b610 The O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion also assumed that it was operating under the 2011 version of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, which provide that motions made under Rule 60(b)(1)-(3) must be made no more than a year after the entry of judgment or order or the date of the proceeding. The 2009 version of Rule 60(b) required that motions made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>for reasons (l)-(3) under Rule 60(b) must be made within 60 days of the judgment or order or service of the entry of judgment. The 2011 amendments to the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure became effective October 1, 2011. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. Ord. No. AF 07-0157, April 26, 2011, eff. Oct. 1, 2011; M. R. Civ. P. 86 (2011). Because the O\u2019Connells\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion was made roughly nine months after the court\u2019s order of default judgment, determining which version of Rule 60(b) applied to their motion would determine its initial validity if it alleged reasons (1)-(3) as a basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b611 The District Court denied the O\u2019Connells\u2019 December 5, 2011 motion to vacate the default judgment in a January 6,2012 order. The court construed the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion as</p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">most clearly alleging reason (3) as a basis for relief. The court also determined that the 2009 version of Rule 60(b) governed the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion, rendering the motion untimely. The court also considered M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) (2009) as a possible basis for the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion. Rule 60(b)(6) (2009) allowed relief from a judgment pursuant to \u201cany other reason\u201d if filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d <em>See </em>also, <em>Bartell v. Zabawa, </em>2009 MT 204, \u00b6 30, 351 Mont. 211, 214 P.3d 735 (\u201cA successful M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) motion requires that (1) the movant demonstrate extraordinary circumstances, (2) the movant acted to set aside the judgment within a reasonable time, and (3) the movant was blameless.\u201d). The court denied the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion under Rule 60(b)(6), finding that they failed to meet any of the standards that we set in <em>Bartell. </em>The court also ordered the O\u2019Connells to pay WLF\u2019s attorney fees and costs incurred in responding to the December 5, 2011 motion to set aside the default judgment. WLF submitted a request for an award of $2,860.00 in attorney fees and costs on January 12, 2012. The O\u2019Connells failed to object to or otherwise contest the WLF\u2019s accounting and the court ordered the O\u2019Connells to pay the $2,860.00 in a February 3, 2012 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b612 The O\u2019Connells subsequently filed two conglomerated motions, one on January, 31, 2012 (the January motion), and another on February 24, 2012 (the February motion). The January motion specifically asked for relief from the court\u2019s January 6 order and alleged M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) and M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) as bases for relief. The February motion sought to alter or amend the court\u2019s February 3 judgment awarding attorney fees and costs pursuant to Rule 59(e) and requested a stay of that judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 62. The District Court denied both motions in a March 20, 2012 order, finding that the O\u2019Connells did not timely object to the award of attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>and that they provided insufficient justification for either an amendment or stay of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b613 The O\u2019Connells filed a notice of appeal to this Court on March 23, 2012 indicating that they intended to appeal the January 6,2012 order denying their motion to vacate the default judgment, the February 3 judgment awarding attorney fees and costs, and the March 9, 2011 order of default judgment. Their brief on appeal, however, claims they are appealing the January 6, 2012 order, February 3 judgment, and March 20, 2012 order denying the O\u2019Connells\u2019 January and February motions. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the decisions of the District Court on all counts and decline to address the O\u2019Connells\u2019 appeal of the March 20, 2012 order. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 4(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b614 Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) depends upon the nature of the final judgment, order, or proceeding from which relief is sought and the specific basis of the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451. Here, because we do not favor default judgments, we will review the denial of the motion to set aside the default judgment for only a slight abuse of discretion. <em>Nikolaisen v. Adv. Transformer Co., </em>2007 MT 352, \u00b6 14, 340 Mont. 332, 174 P.3d 940. The party who seeks to set aside a default judgment bears the burden of persuasion. <em>Nikolaisen, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b615 A decision on a request for an award of attorney fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion unless a contract requires an award of fees, in which case a district court lacks the discretion to deny the request. <em>Gibson v. Paramount Homes, </em>2011 MT 112, \u00b6 10, 360 Mont. 421, 253 P.3d 903. An abuse of discretion occurs when a court acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Boyne USA, Inc. v. Spanish Peaks Dev., LLC, </em>2013 MT 1, \u00b6 30, 368 Mont. 143, 292 P.3d 432. Last, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Estate of Donald v. Kalispell Reg\u2019l Med. Cntr., </em>2011 MT 166, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 179, 258 P.3d 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\u00b616 <em>1. Did the District Court slightly abuse its discretion by denying the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion to vacate the default judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">\u00b617 Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) provides that the court may set aside a default judgment in accordance with the reasons contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>in Mont. R. Civ. P. 60(b). The 2009 version of Rule 60(b) provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. <em>The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) when a defendant has been personally served, whether in lieu of publication or not, not more than 60 days after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken, </em>or, in a case where notice of entry of judgment is required by Rule 77(d), not more than 60 days after service of notice of entry of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (2009) (emphasis added). The 2011 version of Rule 60(b) differs in form and is also subject to the new timing requirements of Rule 60(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">(b) Grounds for Relief from a Final Judgment, Order, or Proceeding. On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">(2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">(3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">(4) the judgment is void;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">(6) any other reason that justifies relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">(c) Timing and Effect of the Motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>(1) Timing. <em>A motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time-and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding. </em>Motions provided by Rule 60(b) must be determined within the times provided by Rule 59 in the case of motions for new trials and amendment of judgment and if the court shall fail to rule on the motion within the 60-day period, the motion must be deemed denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) &amp; (c) (2011) (emphasis added). Thus, the reasons that may justify granting relief from a default judgment remain the same, but the time limit for a motion based on reasons (1), (2), and (3) has been increased from 60 days to one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b618 The O\u2019Connells\u2019 December 5, 2011, Rule 60(b) motion did not clearly state which subsections provided the basis of their motion. Indeed, the O\u2019Connells\u2019 December 5 motion largely advanced arguments, like the accounting and handling of their payments or the language of the legal services contract, that are irrelevant to the reasons listed under Rule 60(b). However, the District Court construed the motion as most clearly advancing subsection (3) due to their various assertions of fraud on the part of WLF. The court denied the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion pursuant to reason (3) by applying the 2009 version of the rule, which required motions based on Rule 60(b)(l)-(3) to be filed not more than 60 days after the default judgment. Because the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion was filed nine months after the default judgment, the court concluded that it was untimely insofar as it alleged a basis for relief under reasons (l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b619 The court also considered the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion under Rule 60(b)(6). A movant cannot prevail under Rule 60(b)(6) unless they meet the higher burden of proving extraordinary circumstances while showing that they were blameless and acted within a reasonable amount of time. <em>See Bahm v. Southworth, </em>2000 MT 244, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 434, 10 P.3d 99. The court concluded that the O\u2019Connells could not establish any of the elements of a Rule 60(b)(6) claim and denied their motion under this alternative theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b620 Initially, while the court considered the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion under Rule 60(b)(6) and the O\u2019Connells continue to advance it as a basis for relief on appeal, we have recently reiterated the general rule that \u201cwhere the circumstances underlying a default judgment raise grounds that are covered by Rule 60(b)(1)-(5), Rule 60(b)(6) is not available for application.\u201d <em>Green v. Gerber, </em>2013 MT 35, \u00b6 35, 369 Mont. 20; <em>Mont. Prof'l Sports, LLC v. Nat\u2019l Indoor Football League, LLC, </em>2008 MT 98, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u00b6 54, 342 Mont. 292, 180 P.3d 1142 (\u201cRelief is available under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) \u2018for situations other than those enumerated in the first five subsections of the rule.\u2019 \u201d). <em>Green\u2019s </em>reiteration of our interpretation of Rule 60(b) follows over twenty years of similar precedent. <em>See In re Marriage of Waters, </em>223 Mont. 183, 187, 724 P.2d 726 (1986); <em>Koch v. Billings Sch. Dist. No. </em>2, 253 Mont. 261, 265, 833 P.2d 181 (1992) (\u2018\u201c[I]t is generally held that if a party seeks relief under any other subsection of Rule 60(b), it cannot also claim relief under 60(b)(6).\u201d); <em>Essex Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 21. Our <em>Waters </em>opinion adopted the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cany other reason\u201d qualification in Rule 60(b)(6), stating \u201c \u2018[i]n simple English, the language of the \u2018other reason\u2019 clause, <em>for all reasons except the five particularly specified, </em>vests power in court adequate to enable them to vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waters, </em>223 Mont. at 187 (quoting <em>Klaprott v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 601, 614-15, 69 S. Ct. 384 (1949)) (emphasis added). We further required that \u201cbefore a party will be allowed to modify a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), he must first show that none of the other five reasons in Rule 60(b) apply, and he must also demonstrate extraordinary circumstances in his case which justify relief.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>223 Mont. at 187. This interpretation of the rule was echoed by our opinion in <em>Essex </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Green. Essex, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Green, </em>\u00b6 35. <em>In re Marriage of Hopper, </em>1999 MT 310, \u00b6 21, 297 Mont. 225, 991 P.2d 960.</p>\n<p id=\"AAI\">\u00b621 The O\u2019Connells therefore may not obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6) if their claim arises under one of the first five subsections of the Rule. <em>In re Marriage of Hopper, </em>1999 MT 310, \u00b6 21, 297 Mont. 225, 991 P.2d 960. As in <em>Hopper, </em>because we treat the O\u2019Connells\u2019 claim as arising under Rule 60(b)(3), we will not consider their claim under Rule 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b622 As Rule 60(b)(6) is not available to the O\u2019Connells if the circumstances underlying the default judgment are covered by subsection (l)-(5), we must initially determine whether the District Court slightly abused its discretion by construing the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion as most clearly advancing subsection (3). The O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion never cited a specific subsection of Rule 60(b) as a basis for relief. Instead, the O\u2019Connells largely focused on what they alleged were errors in the WLF\u2019s accounting and handling of their legal fees. The O\u2019Connells also repeatedly referenced an alleged promise by a WLF bookkeeper that WLF would \u201cdrop the complaint\u201d if the O\u2019Connells paid in full. The O\u2019Connells claimed that because they believed this alleged promise, WLF\u2019s continuation of the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>constituted fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b623 As noted, the court determined that this argument most clearly raised subsection (3) as a basis for relief. We conclude that this was not an abuse of discretion, however slight. The O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion was utterly devoid of legal analysis or argument. The only reference to Rule 60(b) consisted of block quotations of the rule. The O\u2019Connells never applied any subsection of the rule to the circumstances of the default judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the O\u2019Connells did advance various allegations of fraud, misconduct, and misrepresentation by WLF to explain why they did not respond to WLF\u2019s complaint and to support granting relief from the default judgment. These allegations most clearly align with subsection (3) of Rule 60(b), and it was not a slight abuse of discretion for the court to so construe the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b624 After identifying subsection (3) as the most likely basis for the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion, the District Court denied the availability of subsection (3) by concluding that the motion was untimely under the 2009 version of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">As noted, we review such conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Estate of Donald, </em>\u00b6 17. The District Court applied the 2009 version of Rule 60(b) by looking to the language of M. R. Civ. P. 86 (2011). The 2011 version of Rule 86 provides the effective date of the new rules and amendments, and in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">(a) In General. These rules and any amendments take effect at the time specified by the supreme cburt. They govern:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">(1) proceedings in an action commenced after their effective date; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">(2) proceedings after that date in an action then pending unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">(A) the supreme court specifies otherwise; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">(B) the court determines that applying them in a particular action would be unfeasible or work an injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">The court determined that this language indicated that the 2011 version of Rule 60(b) would apply only to proceedings in new or pending actions. The court then determined that because the default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>judgment had been entered against the O\u2019Connells on March 9, 2011, the action was neither new nor pending when the motion was filed on December 5, 2011. The court accordingly determined that the O\u2019Connells\u2019 December 5 motion remained subject to the 2009 version of Rule 60(b) and was consequently untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b625 We conclude that the court\u2019s application of the 2009 version of Rule 60(b) was correct. A default judgment is a final decision of a court of law. <em>See Green, </em>\u00b6 41. Once the default judgment was entered, there were no remaining or pending proceedings concerning WLF\u2019s claim against the O\u2019Connells. While the O\u2019Connells could, and did, file a Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from the default judgment, this did not render the judgment any less final or cause the judgment to become pending. Rule 60(b) allows a party relief from a final judgment if the movant shows that one of the six subsections applies. This does not mean that the filing of a Rule 60(b) motion by itself converts a final judgment into a pending proceeding. Rule 60(b) is an exception to the doctrine of finality of judgments only insofar as it allows relief from an otherwise final judgment \u201cwhere a party was wronged through no fault of its own.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Hopper, </em>\u00b6 29. Because the default judgment became a final decision of the court when it was ordered on March 9, 2011, it was neither new nor pending when the 2011 version of Rule 60(b) came into effect on October 1, 2011. The court therefore correctly applied the language of Rule 86 (2011) to determine that Rule 60(b) (2009) applied to the O\u2019Connells\u2019 motion. Further, because the O\u2019Connells\u2019 apparent Rule 60(b)(3) motion was filed well after the 60 day time limit of the 2009 version of the rule, it was not a slight abuse of discretion for the court to deny the motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b626  We recognize that the O\u2019Connells represented themselves before both this Court and the District Court, and we generally seek to afford pro se litigants a certain amount of latitude. <em>Greenup v. Russell, </em>2000 MT 154, \u00b6 15, 300 Mont. 136, 3 P.3d 124. This latitude, however, cannot be so wide as to prejudice the other party, \u201cand it is reasonable to expect all litigants, including those acting pro se, to adhere to procedural rules.\u201d <em>Greenup, </em>\u00b6 15. The O\u2019Connells did not file anything with the court for over a year after WLF filed the complaint. In doing so, the O\u2019Connells ignored several deadlines and gave up opportunities to respond to WLF\u2019s allegations, and they did so at their own peril. It was not a slight abuse of discretion to hold the O\u2019Connells, self-represented or not, to basic procedural deadlines. <em>See Greenup, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b627 <em>2. Did the District Court err by awarding attorney fees and costs </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>to the Wittich Law Firm, P.C. ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b628 The O\u2019Connells claim the court erred by awarding attorney fees \u201cwithout a motion AND absent any damages, and granted solely due to alleged breech [sic] of the written contract by refusal of payment.\u201d The O\u2019Connells further claim that because the contract allows attorney fees for only \u201cnecessary\u201d actions, the award should be reversed because the WLF\u2019s complaint wasn\u2019t necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b629  Montana generally follows the American rule that a party may not recover attorney fees in a civil action absent statutory or contractual authority. <em>Hughes v. Ahlgren, </em>2011 MT 189, \u00b6 13, 361 Mont. 319, 258 P.3d 439. Following this, we review a court\u2019s decision that legal authority exists to award attorney fees for correctness. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 10. Section 7 of the legal services contract clearly provided that \u201c[fjailure to pay [fees and costs incurred in the course of representation] will also subject you [the O\u2019Connells] to all collection costs, including attorney fees, for any action necessary.\u201d Contractual authority for attorney fees undoubtedly existed. WLF therefore validly requested $808.80 in attorney fees incurred in pursuing the default judgment. This sum was correctly included in the March 3,2011 order of default judgment. Whether or not the underlying action was \u201cnecessary\u201d is not relevant to our review of the award. Similarly, the court properly awarded an additional $2,860.00 in attorney fees to WLF in its January 6 order, as these fees were likewise incurred in the course of pursuing the claim. Both awards came at the request of WLF and were based on sworn affidavits and accountings provided by WLF. Recognizing the clear language of the legal services contract, and the O\u2019Connells\u2019 failure to contest the calculation of either award, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by granting attorney fees to WLF in either instance. Indeed, because the contract expressly allowed the award of attorney fees if WLF brought a claim to recover legal fees, the court lacked the discretion to deny the requests. <em>See Gibson, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Emmerson v. Walker, </em>2010 MT 167, \u00b6 20, 357 Mont. 166, 236 P.3d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b630 3. <em>Did the District Court err by denying the O\u2019Connells\u2019 M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) and M. R.

The O\u2019Connells did not include this order in their notice of appeal. Rule 4(4)(a), M. R. App. P., requires that a notice of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>designate the final \u201cjudgment or order or part thereof from which appeal is taken.\u201d Following this, we will not consider an appeal from an order not designated in the notice of appeal. <em>See In re </em>K.C.H., 2003 MT 125, \u00b6 29, 316 Mont. 13, 68 P.3d 788; <em>Lewis v. Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co., </em>2001 MT 145, \u00b6 27, 306 Mont. 37, 29 P.3d 1028. The O\u2019Connells\u2019 appeal from the District Court\u2019s March 20, 2012 order denying their January and February motions is accordingly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b632 The O\u2019Connell\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from the default judgment was untimely, their legal services contract with WLF clearly provided for attorney fees and costs, and consideration of the O\u2019Connells\u2019 appeal of the court\u2019s March 20, 2012 order is barred by operation of Rule 4(4)(a), M.

I regret, however, that what appears to be a dispute over less than a $100 balance on the O\u2019Connells\u2019 attorney\u2019s fee bill mushroomed into years of litigation, a judgment of nearly $3,000 against the O\u2019Connells, and consumption of considerable time and resources of the parties, the District Court, and now this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u00b634 \u201cIt is the policy of the Supreme Court of Montana to encourage the informal resolution of fee disputes between attorneys who practice law in Montana and their clients.\u201d Rule 1,1.1, Rules on Arbitration of Fee Disputes (2009) (R. Arb. F. D.). To that end, we have adopted rules on arbitration of fee disputes in those cases \u201cwhere such informal resolution cannot be achieved.\u201d Rule I, 1.1, R. Arb. F. D. The Rules provide for arbitration of disputed amounts of $500.00 or more (Rule IV, R. Arb. F. D.). At the time the Wittich Law Firm filed suit against the O\u2019Connells, the disputed amount exceeded this threshold. After O\u2019Connells paid most of the charges within a month of being served with the complaint, the remaining fees in dispute did not amount to $500.00. However, the threshold should not be read to suggest that lesser disputes ought to be litigated in court, but appears to imply that informal resolution of lower amounts should be feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">\u00b635 Here, though the Wittich Law Firm was within its contractual and legal rights to pursue its claim for unpaid fees, members of the Bar should keep in mind that their own interests, the interests of their clients, the administration of the court system, and the general public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>would be well-served by adhering to the Court\u2019s policy to resolve fee disputes without litigation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-4\">JUSTICE COTTER dissents.</judges>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b636 TOTAL BALANCE CLAIMED UNDER FEE CONTRACT: $93.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">TOTAL SUM OF JUDGMENTS FOR WLF: $5,019.79.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">TOTAL ADDITIONAL FEES INCURRED ON APPEAL: ???</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u00b637 After O\u2019Connells paid WLF over $2,100 against their outstanding attorney fee account, O\u2019Connells disputed the claimed final balance of $93.99, alleging billing errors. WLF advised O\u2019Connells to pay the disputed balance by December 10, 2010. However, unbeknownst to O\u2019Connells, and while they were corresponding with WLF in an attempt to resolve this minor dispute, WLF secured a default against their clients on December 3, 2010. WLF then secured a default judgment for the disputed balance of $93.99, plus its costs and attorney fees in the sum of $808.80. Then, when O\u2019Connells later moved to vacate the judgment, WLF charged-and the court entered judgment for-$2,860 in fees, representing a claimed 22 hours of attorney time expended in responding to the motion to vacate. Although not mentioned in the Court\u2019s Opinion, the District Court entered yet another judgment in favor of WLF on April 20,2012, in the sum of $1,257, in payment of additional charges claimed by WLF for time expended in responding to plaintiffs\u2019 motions for relief from court orders. Finally, though the Court again does not address this in its Opinion, WLF is seeking attorney fees and costs incurred in the appeal. I have little doubt that the firm will seek an assessment of these fees on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">\u00b638 In its brief to this Court, WLF faults O\u2019Connells for their \u201crefusal/inability to understand why a balance remained.\u201d It assails \u201cO\u2019Connells\u2019 continued ignorance of the law and misplaced sense of entitlement.\u201d In light of the financial carnage wreaked upon O\u2019Connells for their refusal to pay a disputed $93, these affronts are incongruous.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\u00b639 The Court and the Concurrence are careful to note that WLF was within its contractual rights to exact the sums the District Court has ordered O\u2019Connells to pay. Perhaps so. Nonetheless, I simply cannot join the Court in affirming this unconscionable result. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
