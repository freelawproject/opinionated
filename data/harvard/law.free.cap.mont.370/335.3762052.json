We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Pallister\u2019s motion for substitution of judge following remand?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">\u00b64 This appeal arises in an ongoing class action that we remanded for further proceedings in <em>Pallister v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Mont., Inc., </em>2012 MT 198, 366 Mont. 175, 285 P.3d 562 <em>{Pallister </em>7). The case has complex facts and a long procedural history, much of which is not necessary to address for the purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">\u00b65 Tyson Pallister, Kevin Budd, and Jessica Normandeau (collectively \u201cPallister\u201d) are unnamed members in a class action suit against insurers Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana, Inc. (BCBSMT) and Montana Comprehensive Health Association (MCHA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The suit generally seeks damages from BCBSMT and MCHA for the companies\u2019 delayed payments of benefits and for benefits improperly withheld. The class members allege that while they were insured by BCBSMT or MCHA, the insurers denied claims based on invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>exclusions set forth in the health insurance policies. <em>Pallister I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-7; <em>see also Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Mont., Inc. v. Mont. State Auditor, </em>2009 MT 318, \u00b6 19, 352 Mont. 423, 218 P.3d 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">\u00b66 The District Court certified the class and appointed class counsel for the named class members (Class Representatives). Pallister filed a motion to intervene, which the District Court denied. BCBSMT, MCELA, and Class Representatives participated in mediation and entered into a proposed class settlement. The District Court scheduled a fairness hearing for the proposed settlement and sent notice of the hearing and settlement to class members, who were given the choice to opt out. No class member, including Pallister, opted out. Pallister objected to the settlement agreement and filed a motion to conduct discovery into the fairness of the proposed settlement. The District Court denied Pallister\u2019s motion to conduct discovery, giving rise to the appeal in <em>Pallister I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b67 This Court reversed the District Court\u2019s denial of Pallister\u2019s motion \u201con the discrete issue of discovery,\u201d and vacated the District Court\u2019s approval of the settlement agreement. <em>Pallister I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1,43. We remanded to the District Court \u201cwith instruction to allow discovery to be conducted into the settlement negotiations and the billing records of the class counsel, to hold another fairness hearing, and to issue new findings of facts and conclusions of law based upon the entirety of evidence received in the original proceeding and during remand proceedings.\u201d <em>Pallister I, </em>\u00b6 22. Remittitur was issued from this Court and filed with the District Court on September 25, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b68 On October 4, 2012, Pallister filed a motion for substitution of District Judge Bradley Newman, who has presided over the proceedings since 2008. Class Representatives objected, and BCBSMT and MCHA filed a joint objection to the motion. Judge Newman denied Pallister\u2019s motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">The statutory right to seek a substitution of the trial judge is granted to \u201ceach adverse party.\u201d Section 3-1-804(1) and (12).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">The statute requires actual adversity, rather than hostility, between the parties at issue. <em>(Ratliff v. Pearson, </em>2011 MT 241, \u00b6\u00b6 14-17, 362 Mont. 163, 261 P.3d 1037.] Pallister is not an adverse party. Rather, he is a class member. While Pallister objects to the manner in which class counsel and the class representatives worked to resolve this action, he still stands to benefit from the prosecution and ultimate resolution of the litigation. In other words, Pallister shares a commonality of interest with the original class representatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Section 3-1-804(12) governs the right to seek substitution where a judgment is reversed on appeal. As noted above, such right is granted only to \u201cadverse parties.\u201d The Court already has addressed the issue of adversity. Additionally, the Supreme Court remanded this action for the purpose of \u201climited discovery\u201d to be conducted by the objecting class members. The Supreme Court recognized that this Court should set and oversee the parameters of such discovery. At no point in its opinion and order did the Supreme Court change Pallister\u2019s procedural position in this action. He remains a class member, not a separate party to the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Pallister appeals the denial of his motion for substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b69 \u201cA district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute is a conclusion of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness.\u201d <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 403, \u00b6 6, 353 Mont. 467, 221 P.3d 127 (citing <em>Williams v. Schwager, </em>2002 MT 107, \u00b6 36, 309 Mont. 455, 47 P.3d 839). \u201cThis Court reviews for correctness a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to substitute a district court judge.\u201d <em>Ratliff, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing <em>Patrick v. State, </em>2011 MT 169, \u00b6 12, 361 Mont. 204, 257 P.3d 365).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Pallister\u2019s motion for substitution of judge following remand?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">\u00b611 The parties\u2019 arguments frame the issue as whether Pallister is a \u201cparty\u201d who has a right to substitute the district court judge pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804(12), MCA. Pallister argues he is an \u201cadverse party\u201d within the meaning of the statute because it is \u201cthe relationship between BCBSMT and Pallister that determines adversity.\u201d Citing <em>Devlin v. Scardelletti et al., </em>536 U.S. 1, 122 S. Ct. 2005 (2002), Pallister posits that \u201can unnamed class member who objects to a settlement is a \u2018party\u2019 \u201d and \u201cPallister became a party to the action when he objected to the settlement and appealed it to the Montana Supreme Court.\u201d BCBSMT and MCHA maintain that Pallister did not successfully intervene and \u201cdoes not occupy the status of a \u2018party\u2019 for the remaining aspects of the lawsuit, including for purposes of section 3-1-804(12), MCA.\u201d Class Representatives argue that \u201c[a]lthough individual class members may be accorded some of the rights absent intervention such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>as the right to object to a proposed settlement and the right to appeal the approval of a class settlement over those objections raised at the fairness hearing!,] they are not parties for all purposes.\u201d Class Representatives also contend that nothing in <em>Pallister I </em>considered or granted Pallister the status of a party in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b612 Section 3-1-804, MCA, provides the rules governing substitution of district court judges. Subsection (12) addresses a party\u2019s right to substitution upon remand, and reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">(12) When a judgment or order is reversed or modified on appeal and the cause is remanded to the district court for a new trial, or when a summary judgment or judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause remanded, each adverse party is entitled to one motion for substitution of district judge. The motion must be filed, with the required filing fee, within 20 calendar days after the remittitur from the supreme court has been filed with the district court. There is no other right of substitution in cases remanded by the supreme court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">In criminal cases, there is no right of substitution when the cause is remanded for resentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Section 3-1-804(12), MCA (2011).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute thus affords \u201ceach adverse party\u201d one motion to substitute a district court judge. Section 3-1-804(12), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b613 Implicit in the status of an \u201cadverse party\u201d is the requirement that the movant under \u00a7 3-1-804(12), MCA, be a \u201cparty\u201d to the action. Generally, \u201c[i]n a civil action, the party complaining is known as the plaintiff and the adverse party as the defendant.\u201d Section 25-5-101, MCA. The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure also recognize that one who is joined, M. R. Civ. P. 19 and 20, or one who intervenes, M. R. Civ. P. 24, becomes a party to the action. The U.S. Supreme Court recently summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">In general, \u201c[a] \u2018part/ to litigation is \u00a3[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought,\u201d\u2019 <em>United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, </em>556 U.S. 928, [933], 129 S. Ct. 2230, 2234 [] (2009), or one who \u00a3\u00a3become[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third-party practice,\u201d <em>Karcher v. May, </em>484 U.S. 72, 77, 108 S. Ct. 388 [] (1987).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-10\"><em>Smith et al. v. Bayer </em>Corp.,_U.S._,_, 131 S. Ct. 2368, 2379 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>(2011). Section 3-1-804(9), MCA, contemplates joined and intervening parties, providing \u201c[n]o party who is joined or intervenes has any right of substitution after the time has run as to the original parties to the proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b614 In contrast to these provisions governing parties to litigation, members of a class action are generally absent and unnamed, and are not typical adversarial parties before the court. M. R. Civ. P. 23; <em>see also </em>William B. Rubenstein, <em>Newberg on Class Actions </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 1:5,12-16 (5th ed., West 2011) (\u201cThe position that absent class members occupy in class action litigation is <em>sui generis, </em>and attempts to analogize to conventional \u2018party\u2019 status are likely to fail.\u201d). Absent class members occupy a unique position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">[AJbsent plaintiff class members are not subject to other burdens imposed upon defendants. They need not hire counsel or appear. They are almost never subject to counterclaims or cross-claims, or liability for fees or costs. Absent plaintiff class members are not subject to coercive or punitive remedies. Nor will an adverse judgment typically bind an absent plaintiff for any damages, although a valid adverse judgment may extinguish any of the plaintiffs claims which were litigated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\"><em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts et al., </em>472 U.S. 797, 810, 105 S. Ct. 2965, 2973-74 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b615 Pallister correctly points out that an unnamed class member may be considered a \u201cparty\u201d for the purposes of appealing the approval of a settlement. <em>See Devlin v. Scardelletti et al., </em>536 U.S. 1, 14, 122 S. Ct. 2005, 2013 (2002). In <em>Devlin, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court held that nonnamed class members who have objected in a timely manner to approval of a settlement at the fairness hearing may be considered a \u201cparty\u201d for the purposes of appealing the approval of the settlement without first intervening. <em>Devlin, </em>536 U.S. at 14, 122 S. Ct. at 2013. However, the <em>Devlin </em>Court was careful to explain that \u201c[njonnamed class members, however, may be parties for some purposes and not for others. The label \u2018party does not indicate an absolute characteristic, but rather a conclusion about the applicability of various procedural rules that may differ based on context.\u201d <em>Devlin, </em>536 U.S. at 9-10, 122 S. Ct. at 2010. The holding in <em>Devlin </em>is specific to appeals of class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>action <em>settlements </em>and does not address the party status of nonnamed class members for purposes of post-appeal procedural questions following remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">\u00b616 We discussed the meaning of \u201cadverse parties\u201d within \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, in <em>Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. v. Mont. Second Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2002 MT 83, 309 Mont. 289, 46 P.3d 606, where we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">[I]n order to invoke the right of substitution in cases involving multiple parties under \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, the moving party must demonstrate adversity with a co-party to the action .... The determination of adversity is based solely on the allegations set forth in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><em>Goldman Sachs, </em>\u00b6 17. More recently, in <em>Ratliff, </em>we summarized the holding of <em>Goldman Sachs, </em>stating \u201c[t]he statute requires the subsequently joined party to establish that <em>adversity, </em>rather than hostility, existed between it and other defendants in order to exercise an independent right to substitute.\u201d <em>Ratliff, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Goldman Sachs, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-17) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b617  Pallister did not successfully intervene and he remains an unnamed class member. Despite his earlier successful appeal of the settlement approval in <em>Pallister I, </em>he has not become a party for all purposes and is not a party for purposes of substitution. As an unnamed class member, Pallister does not enjoy the same rights, and is not burdened by the same responsibilities, as a named class representative. The District Court appropriately determined that Pallister is \u201ca class member, not a separate party to the litigation.\u201d Lacking party status for this purpose, Pallister cannot establish that he is an \u201cadverse party\u201d under \u00a7 3-1-804(12), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b618 Further, this Court remanded in <em>Pallister I </em>\u201con the discrete issue of discovery,\u201d vacating the District Court\u2019s approval of the settlement. <em>Pallister I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 43. Section 3-1-804(12), MCA, provides for substitution on remand when a \u201ccause is remanded to the district court for a new trial, or when a summary judgment or judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause remanded,\u201d and further provides that \u201c[tjhere is no other right of substitution in cases remanded by the supreme court.\u201d Our decision in <em>Pallister I </em>was not a remand for a new trial or a reversal of summary judgment or judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"AYG\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-8\">JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT, MORRIS and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-14\"> Pallister, Budd, and Normandeau all objected to the class settlement, but only Pallister moved for substitution of the District Court judge following remand, and only Pallister appeals here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\"> Unless otherwise specified, all references to the Montana Code Annotated are to the 2011 version. <em>See </em>Or., <em>In Re: Revised Rules on Substitution of District Judges, </em>(Mont.
