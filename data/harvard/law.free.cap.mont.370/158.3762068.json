We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\u00b62 Phillip presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether the District Court erred by requiring Phillip to pay child support beyond the 18 th birthday of the parties\u2019 child.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether the District Court should have applied the doctrine of equitable estoppel to preclude Susan\u2019s claim for back child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">\u00b65 The parties were married in 1988 and the marriage was terminated in a Decree of Dissolution entered in December, 1995.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They had one child, a daughter born in 1988. Pursuant to the Decree, Phillip paid child support of $6,977 per month for over ten years, until their daughter\u2019s eighteenth birthday in November, 2006. The Decree required that support payments would \u201ccontinue until the child reaches majority, graduates from high school or is otherwise emancipated.\u201d In June, 2012, Susan filed a petition seeking additional child support payments for the period between their daughter\u2019s eighteenth birthday in November 2006, and her graduation from high school in July 2007. The District Court applied \u00a7 40-4-208(5), MCA, to determine that Phillip\u2019s child support obligation did not terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>until their daughter graduated from high school. The District Court granted the petition, awarding Susan a judgment of $55,816.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b66 Phillip appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b67 The construction of the Decree of Dissolution and the application of \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, involve conclusions of law, which we review to determine whether they are correct. <em>In re Marriage of Pfeifer, </em>1998 MT 228, \u00b6 9, 291 Mont. 23, 965 P.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u00b68 Issue One: Whether the District Court erred by requiring Phillip to pay child support beyond the 18 th birthday of the parties\u2019 child.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u00b69 The District Court determined that the Decree of Dissolution was ambiguous in providing that the obligation of child support continued until the child reaches majority, graduates from high school or is otherwise emancipated. That provision does not state whether the support obligation continues until the earlier or the later of those three dates and we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it is ambiguous. Section 40-4-208(5), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">Provisions for the support of a child are terminated by emancipation of the child or the child\u2019s graduation from high school if the child is enrolled in high school, <em>whichever occurs later, </em>but in no event later than the child\u2019s 19th birthday, unless the termination date is extended or knowingly waived by written agreement or by an express provision of the decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">(Emphasis added.) Under this statute, the obligation to pay child support in this case extended to the parties\u2019 daughter\u2019s graduation from high school, as the District Court concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">\u00b610 Phillip contends that the statutory provisions have been waived by express provision of the decree. The statute allows the parties by written agreement or by an express provision included in the dissolution decree, to establish a specific termination date for child support payments. <em>In re the Marriage of Gingerich, </em>269 Mont. 161, 166, 887 P.2d 714, 717 (1994). In that case this Court upheld enforcement of the decree, which provided that support continued \u201cuntil the child reached majority or was earlier emancipated.\u201d There is no applicable written agreement concerning the termination of child support in this case, and we find nothing in the 1995 Decree of Dissolution that expressly establishes the date for termination of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u00b611  Since the Decree of Dissolution did not expressly provide the termination date for child support payments, \u00a7 40-4-208(5), MCA, controls and provides for a termination date upon the daughter\u2019s graduation from high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b612 Issue Two: Whether the District Court should have applied the doctrine of equitable estoppel to preclude Susan\u2019s claim for back child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b613 Phillip contends that he ceased child support payments when his daughter turned 18 in 2006 and that Susan never made any demand for additional payments until she filed a motion with the District Court in 2012. Phillip further contends that after he ceased child support payments he made substantial payments for his daughter\u2019s needs, including college tuition. He contends that had he known Susan\u2019s position on child support, he would have requested that she pay a share of those needs. This, he argues, calls for the application of estoppel to bar the claim for additional child support. The District Court did not expressly rule on the estoppel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b614  It is \u201cestablished law in Montana that neither laches nor equitable estoppel applies to recovery of child support arrears.\u201d <em>Schmitz v. Engstrom, </em>2000 MT 275, \u00b6 14, 302 Mont. 121, 13 P.3d 38, citing <em>Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald, </em>190 Mont. 66, 69-71, 618 P.2d 867, 869 (1980). The only exception is when the parties have agreed to modify the amount of child support provided for in a decree, and that agreement \u201cis observed over a period of years.\u201d <em>In re the Marriage of Hooper, </em>247 Mont. 322, 324, 806 P.2d 541, 543 (1991); <em>In re Marriage of Windhalm, </em>279 Mont. 97, 101, 926 P.2d 748, 751 (1996); <em>In re Marriage of Jensen, </em>223 Mont. 434, 727 P.2d 512 (1986). Additionally, there must be a substantial and continuing change in circumstances rendering the original support decree inequitable; there must be a mutual agreement between the parties made in good faith; and there must be conduct consistent with the agreement over a period of years, all established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Hooper, </em>247 Mont. at 324, 806 P.2d at 543. This policy serves and protects the rights of the children. <em>Schmitz, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b615 This Court upheld an exception to the general policy when the facts apparently demonstrated that the mother\u2019s conduct supported an implied agreement that the father not pay child support. <em>In re the Marriage of Shorten, </em>1998 MT 267, 291 Mont. 317, 967 P.2d 797. <em>Shorten </em>is overruled to the extent that it allows for application of general principles of estoppel to claims for unpaid child support in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>absence of an agreement between the parties to accept a modification of the child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b616  There is no evidence in this case of any agreement between the parties to modify the child support obligation provided in the Decree of Dissolution. Therefore estoppel does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b617 The District Court correctly applied the law. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-14\"> Appeals involving the parties\u2019 dissolution proceedings have been brought to this Court several times. <em>Pfeifer v. Pfeifer, </em>282 Mont. 461, 938 P.2d 684 (1997); <em>In re the Marriage of Pfeifer, </em>1998 MT 228, 291 Mont. 23, 965 P.2d 895; <em>In re the Marriage of Pfeifer, </em>2000 MT 100, 299 Mont. 268, 999 P.2d 340.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b186-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AcN\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b618 Curiously, the Court reasons that \u201cthe Decree of Dissolution did not expressly provide the termination date for child support payments,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 11, and, therefore, the statute controls and sets the support termination date as the child\u2019s graduation. The Decree provided that Phillip\u2019s support obligation would \u201ccontinue until the child reaches majority, graduates from high school or is otherwise emancipated.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 5 (emphasis added). I don\u2019t know how the Decree could have been clearer. The support obligation was to continue until the occurrence of any one of three events. The child reached majority in November 2006, and Phillip\u2019s support obligation ended at that time. I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
