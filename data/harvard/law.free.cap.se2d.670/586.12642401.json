Redden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8234535\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/179/113/\">\n    179 N.C.App. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12636399\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/632/794/\">\n    632 S.E.2d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006); however, for the convenience of the reader, a summary of the facts is set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Barbara Jean Redden (\"defendant\") was married to Monroe M. Redden, Jr. (\"decedent\"), who maintained various bank accounts at First Union National Bank, including money market account number 1010044300784 (\"Account 784\") that was held only in decedent's name. In June 2000, decedent executed a Power of Attorney in favor of defendant. On 16 May 2001, decedent designated defendant as the payable-on-death beneficiary (\"POD beneficiary\") of Account 784. Decedent never revoked or changed the POD beneficiary designation in favor of defendant on Account 784.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 21 September 2001, defendant established a bank account in her name only at First Union National Bank, account number 1010052958801 (\"Account 801\"). That same day, defendant used her Power of Attorney to transfer $237,778.71 from Account 784 to Account 801.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After decedent's death, E.K. Morley (\"the Administrator\") was named as the administrator of the Estate of Monroe M. Redden, Jr. (\"plaintiff\"). On 12 February 2004, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that defendant had committed conversion, constructive fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with certain banking transactions related to Accounts 784 and 801.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As to the issue for our consideration, defendant argued that the Dead Man's Statute was inapplicable because defendant's deposition was offered\n   <em>\n    by\n   </em>\n   the Estate, not\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the Estate. Defendant also argued that the Statute was waived by a failure to object to the deposition testimony either at the time of deposition or at the partial summary judgment hearing. This Court held that defendant had not established the admissibility of defendant's testimony regarding decedent's oral directions pursuant to Rule 601(c), thus she could not defeat plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Redden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8234535\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/179/113/\">\n    179 N.C.App. at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12636399\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/632/794/\">\n    632 S.E.2d at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon consideration, we hold that decedent's oral communications with defendant were offered\n   <em>\n    by defendant\n   </em>\n   in her deposition, not by the Estate, and that the Estate timely objected to these communications and moved to strike the incompetent portions, thus preserving\n   the protections of the Dead Man's Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Witness testimony is incompetent pursuant to Rule 601(c) if the witness is a party or is interested in the event; her testimony relates to an oral communication with the decedent; the testimony is against a personal representative of the decedent; or the witness is testifying in his own behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.

That is not the situation we confront in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, the Estate deposed defendant and offered the deposition testimony into evidence at the partial summary judgment hearing; however, at the time defendant was deposed, the Estate asked no questions soliciting evidence of oral communications between the decedent and defendant. In addition, answers by defendant relating to such oral communications were promptly objected to by the Estate, with appropriate motions to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Q.

It is not clear that \"doing what he directed\" refers to decedent's oral communications. \"What he directed\" could mean the directives included in the terms of the written Power of Attorney. Absent clear evidence of an oral communication, there is no need to object to this statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This Power of Attorney is not included in the Record on Appeal for our consideration. Pursuant to the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure, our review is limited to what appears in the record on appeal. N.C.

Defendant notes that counsel for the Estate quoted sections of this line of questioning in its argument on the motion. Defendant does not state specifically what was quoted from the deposition. No transcript of the hearing appears in the Record on Appeal. In fact, the parties stipulated to the fact that the hearing was neither transcribed nor recorded. We therefore have no way of knowing whether the Estate offered the transcript \"in its entirety\" or precisely what sections of the deposition were quoted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As this Court previously has held, \"[i]n a nonjury trial, in the absence of words or conduct indicating otherwise, the presumption is that the judge disregarded incompetent evidence in making his decision.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Statesville v.
