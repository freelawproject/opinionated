On appeal, Talley argues that the district court (1) erred in finding that he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, and (2) abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>discretion by requiring him to wear shackles and to be partially handcuffed at trial. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Ordinarily, a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant validly waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Kimball, </em>291 F.3d 726, 730 (11th Cir.2002). However, because Talley raises this issue for the first time on appeal, our review is only for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Under plain error review, a district court\u2019s decision is reversible only where (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>See, e.g. United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to address the trial court\u2019s error, but only \u201cif the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to require a criminal defendant to wear shackles at trial, subjecting the ruling to \u201cclose judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>United States v. Durham, </em>287 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted). Even where a district court abuses its discretion, however, we will not vacate a conviction if the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1246 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In 1998, Talley was convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida on controlled substance and firearm charges, and was sentenced to 295 months\u2019 imprisonment. While incarcerated, Talley and a coconspir-ator filed fraudulent creditors\u2019 liens, default notices, and a variety of other fraudulent commercial instruments in an attempt to damage the personal finances of the United States District Judge who presided over his trial, the Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted him, and the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">In October 2006, Talley was charged with thirty-eight counts of mail fraud and one count of obstructing justice. He was subsequently arraigned in the Northern District of Florida before a magistrate judge who informed Talley of his right to counsel, and asked whether Talley wished to have counsel appointed for him. Talley replied that he wished to represent himself. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">THE COURT: Mr. Talley, do you want to be represented by an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsY\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">THE COURT: You want to represent yourself in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: As a, like I said, as me being the third-party inter-venor and by special visitation and attorney in fact for Virgil Talley, Trust, I have wanted to go ahead and speak before you to let you know that during this arraignment I will go ahead, because I don\u2019t plan to dispute what\u2019s going on, as far as the facts alleged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">THE COURT: Well, Mr. Talley, I know that you have a lot of titles that you\u2019ve assumed, and those titles may or may not be valid. I don\u2019t know. But today, today, it is the United States of America against Virgil Talley, and I want to know if Virgil Talley wants to be represented by a lawyer. Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeZ\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>THE COURT: All right. Then I need to ask you some questions, and I want you to answer them straightforwardly. Don\u2019t hide behind or give me anything about your attorney in fact or any of that stuff. It\u2019s the United States against Virgil Talley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">As you know you have the right to an attorney, and I can appoint an attorney to represent you, if you don\u2019t have the money to hire one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">As you also know you have the constitutional right to represent yourself. And if you exercise that right to represent yourself, then you\u2019ll waive your right to be represented by an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">THE COURT: Have you ever studied the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: I\u2019ve studied commercial law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">THE COURT: Have you ever studied criminal law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Criminal and civil law, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">THE COURT: All right. Have you ever studied criminal law outside the prison system?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-14\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: As the attorney in fact for Virgil Talley, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">THE COURT: Have you ever represented yourself in a criminal action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acx\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: As a pro se litigant, yes, in several\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-16\">THE COURT: Civil cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AId_\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: In civil cases, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-18\">THE COURT: But not in criminal cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-19\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-20\">THE COURT: All right. You realize that \u2014 and you tell me you\u2019re not going to dispute the indictment, and that may be true and may not, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but you realize that, if you\u2019re convicted, either based on a trial or on your own plea, that you can be sentenced to additional time in prison based on these charges; that is, in addition to the time you\u2019re serving currently. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-22\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-23\">THE COURT: Ms. Adams, you\u2019re here representing the United States in this ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-24\">MS. ADAMS: Yes, Your Honor, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adt\">THE COURT: How many counts do we have against\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-25\">MS. ADAMS: There are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-26\">THE COURT: \u2014 this defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-27\">MS. ADAMS: \u2014 39 counts \u2014 38 counts of mail fraud and one count of obstruction of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-28\">THE COURT: And what are the maximum penalties for those counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-29\">MS. ADAMS: Your Honor, it will be, I believe, five years as to each mail fraud count, and I think five years on the obstruction of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-30\">THE COURT: So it\u2019s five years times 39 counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-31\">MS. ADAMS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-32\">THE COURT: Mr. Talley, I\u2019ll do the arithmetic for you, if you want me to; but, if you are convicted on these charges, you can be sentenced consecutively on each of those counts, which means that you can be sentenced, in addition to the prison term you\u2019re currently serving, to five years times 38. Do you understand that? That\u2019s a big number; and, if you insist, I\u2019ll try to do the math and tell you what that number is. But do you understand that that\u2019s the sentence you\u2019re looking at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac8\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes, I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>THE COURT: You understand what you\u2019re charged with. Now, in the federal system we have the federal rules of evidence, which will control in this case; and we have federal rules of criminal procedure, which control in this case. Are you at all familiar with the federal rules of evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: I would have to reference them, but I do know how to go to them. As far as the citations, I can find them in the statutes and reference them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">THE COURT: Okay. You understand that, as far as any evidentiary matters in this case, those rules apply?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARo\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">THE COURT: Have you any familiarity with the federal rules of criminal procedure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">THE COURT: You understand that as regards to any procedure that is carried out in this case that those rules apply?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7D\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">THE COURT: You are currently incarcerated, I believe, in a federal prison somewhere. But unless I\u2019m wrong, until this case is tried, you\u2019ll be kept here in one of the local jails.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">THE COURT: You understand that the local jails don\u2019t have law libraries, and you will not have access to any research materials before your trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyC\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes, I\u2019m fully aware of that. They already told me that at Santa Rosa County Jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">THE COURT: All right. I guess the bottom line here, Mr. Talley, is you understand that, if you represent yourself, it\u2019s you against the United States. You\u2019ve got no lawyer, you\u2019ve got no one standing beside me. Whatever name you may attach to yourself or whatever title you may attach to yourself, it\u2019s you against the United States. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-14\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes, I understand the defendant will be against the United States. As the plaintiff, the United States will be against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-15\">THE COURT: Well, we haven\u2019t gotten to the plaintiff part yet. There\u2019s an old saying in the law, Mr. Talley, that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client, because there have been occasions in cases when lawyers represented themselves. The corollary to that old saying is that a defendant who represents himself has a fool for a lawyer. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a fool. I\u2019m saying that it would be very unwise for you to represent yourself in this case. My opinion is that, in spite of your protestations about your legal titles, your legal entitlements, who you are or how you approach this thing, if you represent yourself, you are making a very grave error. That is my opinion. Do you understand that? Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-16\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes, that\u2019s your opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-17\">THE COURT: Now, I want to encourage you in the strongest possible terms to agree to let me appoint counsel for you, since presumably you\u2019re in prison and don\u2019t have the money to hire one. Do you want me to do that or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acy\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-18\">THE COURT: Do you understand that by refusing my offer to appoint counsel for you you are waiving your right to an attorney in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-19\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: Yes, that\u2019s fully understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-20\">THE COURT: And I take it, based on our conversation, that your waiver of an attorney in this case is entirely volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>tary on your part and it has not been forced on you by anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: No, it hasn\u2019t been forced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">THE COURT: Voluntary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJF\">DEFENDANT TALLEY: It hasn\u2019t been forced. I completely understand what you\u2019re saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">THE COURT: Okay. All right. Well, you have the right to represent yourself. That right will be afforded to you; and, from here on out, you\u2019re on your own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In concluding the hearing, the magistrate judge added that Talley could change his mind about representing himself at any point before the start of his trial. He also appointed a public defender to serve as Talley\u2019s stand-by counsel. Finally, when Talley failed to provide a clear answer as to how he wished to plead, the magistrate judge entered a not-guilty plea on Talley\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Talley\u2019s case was later transferred to the Middle District of Florida, but was quickly returned to the Northern District, where it was reassigned to another district judge, and where Talley was charged in a superseding indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the arraignment on the superseding indictment, the district judge revisited Talley\u2019s decision to represent himself:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC6\">THE COURT: Well, I know that previously you have elected to proceed without an attorney, and I just want to revisit that decision. You seem like an intelligent man. Why are you doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Why am I doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Because it\u2019s a private matter. This matter is a private matter. It\u2019s private nonnegotiable matter between the parties....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-14\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m not sure if I follow that. My question is why do you feel you don\u2019t need an attorney? You don\u2019t have any legal training, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH1\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, the matter at hand, I have accepted this case for value on \u2014 on\u2014on 11-9-06, and I have returned it for closure. I didn\u2019t intend to dispute the facts in the charging instrument. However, that day [the] Magistrate Judge ... elected to enter a \u2014 a plea not of my own consent. And I spoke with him about that that day. However, I wasn\u2019t able to continue to finish speaking. And I elect to do the same at this initial proceeding.... I accepted the case for value and I also placed a special appearance bond for and on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-15\">THE COURT: Well, let me just interrupt you. It\u2019s not a private matter. It\u2019s a criminal charge, and you are facing criminal penalties because of this, which may include a considerable amount of additional prison time for you. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-16\">THE DEFENDANT: I under\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-17\">THE COURT: It\u2019s serious. It\u2019s a serious matter. It\u2019s not just a \u2014 you know, a whim that you can play out here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: I understand all that. But the point \u2014 the case \u2014 the case in being is, it\u2019s a criminal matter and I have accepted \u2014 and I have accepted the matter for value, and I am, pursuant to Rule 8\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">THE COURT: Well, you don\u2019t accept it for value. This is a charge that the government is gonna prosecute you for. And you have the right to have an attorney in this matter and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, according\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlA\">THE COURT: \u2014 I strongly urge you to have an attorney. One will be appointed to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">THE DEFENDANT: According to the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, I have the right to have effective assistance of counsel, if I so choose. In this matter I do not choose. I\u2019m not gonna participate in this matter as far as allowing any jurisdiction, because it\u2019s a matter that\u2019s without the form and jurisdiction of this court....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">THE COURT: But my question is, are you sure you want to proceed without the benefit of the assistance of an attorney or a lawyer to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">THE DEFENDANT: I have a secured interest in the person named in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">THE COURT: That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a meaningless response, Mr. Talley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">THE DEFENDANT: I wouldn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">THE COURT: Do you understand the consequences to you of not having an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\">THE DEFENDANT: No, I don\u2019t. I wish \u2014 I don\u2019t wish to have \u2014 have that. I waive it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">When the court later turned to the superseding indictment and asked whether Talley understood the charges, Talley replied that he had read the document and that he understood \u201cthe nature of the charges as it applies to the person that\u2019s being charged in the charging instrument as the superseding indictment.\u201d He waived his right to have the charges read to him, and when he once again refused to enter a plea, the district court entered a plea of not-guilty on his behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court also ordered that Talley undergo a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">Talley was subsequently examined by a forensic psychologist. The report determined that Talley understood the nature and' consequences of the proceedings against him; it further concluded that Talley was mentally competent at the time of the alleged offenses, and that Talley was mentally competent to stand trial. Moreover, the psychologist opined that Talley\u2019s odd behavior was deliberate and calculated. Indeed, rather than betokening mental illness, the psychologist concluded that Talley\u2019s legal rambling was in fact part of a larger defense strategy being used with increasing frequency by criminal defendants in federal court. As the report explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-16\">[T]he tenets of this defense strategy are based on the following: an individual can copyright and/or claim his own name and/or person as property, that all crime is commercial crime, and that the Courts do not have legitimate jurisdiction ... to name a few.... In conclusion, the defendant\u2019s defense strategy is not based on confused or delusional thinking, or any symptoms of an active phase of mental illness. Instead, these ideas appear to be increasing in popularity among criminal defendants. The defendant further asserted that his defense strategy is a recourse in obtaining relief from his current federal sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-17\">The district court subsequently issued an order adopting and incorporating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>psychologist\u2019s report and finding that Talley was \u201ccompetent to proceed in the case.\u201d The order specifically made reference to the psychologist\u2019s opinion that Talley\u2019s \u201cbizarre and incoherent arguments ... are increasingly common among prisoners and \u2018demonstrate organized, deliberate, and calculated behaviors.\u2019 \u201d The order further reminded Talley that he would be required to follow applicable evidentia-ry and procedural rules while representing himself at trial. Talley does not challenge the district court\u2019s ruling that he was mentally competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On June 27, 2007, the government filed a second superseding indictment. Because it contained no substantive changes from the previous charging document, the district court did not immediately re-arraign Talley. Shortly before the start of his trial, however, the district court conducted an abbreviated arraignment at the government\u2019s request. The district court again asked whether Talley wished to represent himself and strongly admonished him against doing so. Talley refused to allow himself to be represented and indeed refused to participate in the proceedings at all.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">THE COURT: All right. And, let\u2019s see. Mr. Talley, are you ready?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Uh \u2014 I\u2019m not here to participate, but if that constitutes being ready.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">THE COURT: Well, you have to be present for the trial, so whether you participate is somewhat up to you. But I do need to tell you that my job is to ensure that you get a fair trial to the extent that I can possibly do so. And, you know, it\u2019s your life on the line. It\u2019s years of additional prison time that you are facing. So any \u2014 any lack of cooperation by you in the trial may prove to be detrimental to your own ease. I think you need to know that. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">THE DEFENDANT: No, I don\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">THE COURT: Well, failure to cooperate in your trial may be perceived by the jury, which is the trier of fact, as indicating, first of all, that you are guilty as charged, but also may create a feeling of animosity from the jury toward you. So I\u2019m not sure that failure to cooperate in the trial is going to be perceived by the jury as helpful to your case. Do you see what I\u2019m saying now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">THE DEFENDANT: For and on the record, I am appearing separately under the circumstances as third-party interve-nor....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">THE COURT: Mr. Keith, you have been appointed as stand-by ... counsel, and I do request that you sit at the table and be close to Mr. Talley to be available for consultation at anytime [sic] that he wants you to do it. Mr. Talley, are you gonna be representing yourself in this trial or are you gonna assist\u2014 have the assistance of Mr. Keith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-14\">THE DEFENDANT: I\u2019m not presenting my person nor myself at this trial, because I will not participate. And again, I am not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-15\">THE COURT: That\u2019s not my question. Listen to my question. The question\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2S\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-16\">THE COURT: \u2014 is are you gonna represent yourself or are you gonna have Mr. Keith assist you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-17\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-18\">THE COURT: You are not going to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-19\">THE DEFENDANT: Nor will he assist me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-20\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t want \u2014 you don\u2019t want any legal counsel at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-21\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>THE COURT: Are you waiving your right to any legal counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">THE DEFENDANT: I can\u2019t waive a right to trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">THE DEFENDANT: I cannot waive a right to trial when the matter is nonexistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m simply advising you that if you are not going to utilize Mr. Keith, and you are not gonna do anything, you are both de facto and essentially waiving any right to counsel which is guaranteed to yo\u00fa under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-G\">THE DEFENDANT: I have \u2014 for and on the record, I have the right to assistance of counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, but I\u2014 I choose not to partake in any justiciable controversy that\u2019s dealing with unproved being. And Mr. Keith shall not represent my person, because I have a secured interest in that property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t have a secured interest \u2014 there is no property issue in this trial. The issue really is your own liberty, whether you are gonna be convicted of these charges and sentenced to additional prison time. And I can \u2014 I can assure you with a great deal of confidence that failure to participate in this trial is going to be detrimental to your own interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">THE COURT: Do you understand the charges against you, the same charges as in the previous superseding indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">THE DEFENDANT: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">THE COURT: All right. Well, they have been previously explained to you and are exactly the same. And before I enter a plea of not guilty for you, how do you plead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">THE DEFENDANT: I object to you entering a plea on my behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">Finally, just before the start of the trial, the court made one last attempt to caution Talley about proceeding pro se:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">THE COURT: \u2014 again, Mr. Talley \u2014 Mr. Talley, everything you said is really a non sequitur. It has nothing to do with the criminal charges and the serious penalties that you are facing. And again, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Where is the complaining party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-16\">THE COURT: \u2014 need to make sure that you understand that it\u2019s in your own interest that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-17\">THE DEFENDANT: A legal description can\u2019t charge\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-18\">THE COURT: Wait a minute. Let me finish, Mr. Talley. It\u2019s in your own interest to participate actively or have your stand-by attorney represent you because trials are very complex. They are very involved. And everything that you have said is indicative of the total misunderstanding of the nature of the proceedings and the way the legal system operates. We have already had you examined. There is no question about your competency to stand trial. You are operating under a gross misconception of \u2014 of how the trial is going to operate. So, again, my advice to you is to call upon your attorney to represent you. If not, if you insist on representing yourself, my recommendation to you is that you actively participate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-19\">Talley again refused to let counsel represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">It was also during this final hearing that Talley\u2019s stand-by counsel noted for the record that Talley was in shackles, and that one of Talley\u2019s hands had been handcuffed. Talley\u2019s stand-by counsel stated that the court had given no reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ordering the restraints, and he expressed concern about their potential influence on the jury. The district court stated that, given the substantial sentence that Talley was serving, he should remain in shackles.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">After these events, the trial began. Talley remained silent throughout the proceedings. He made no opening or closing statements, put on no evidence, and refused to respond to questions from the court. The jury found Talley guilty on all counts, and he was sentenced to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the 295-month sentence he was already serving for his 1998 conviction on controlled substance and firearm charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">On appeal, Talley first contends that the district court erred in finding that he knowingly waived his right to trial counsel. Specifically, he claims that he was never adequately informed of the risks associated with representing himself. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">In <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), the Supreme Court held that before a defendant waives his right to counsel, he \u201cshould be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether this requirement has been met \u201cdepends upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d <em>United States v. Garey, </em>540 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir.2008) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201cultimate test for whether there has been a valid waiver of the right to counsel is not the trial court\u2019s express advice, but rather the defendant\u2019s understanding.\u201d <em>United States v. Cash, </em>47 F.3d 1083, 1088 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have identified several factors that are useful in determining whether a defendant has knowingly chosen to represent himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">1) the defendant\u2019s age, health, and education; 2) the defendant\u2019s contact with lawyers prior to trial; 3) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the nature of the charges and possible defenses and penalties; 4) the defendant\u2019s understanding of the rules of evidence, procedure and courtroom decorum; 5) the defendant\u2019s experience in criminal trials; 6) whether standby counsel was appointed and, if so, the extent to which standby counsel aided in the trial; 7) any mistreatment or coercion of the defendant; and 8) whether the defendant was attempting to manipulate the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-11\"><em>Kimball, </em>291 F.3d at 730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">Applying these factors to the present case, we conclude that Talley\u2019s decision to represent himself was indeed knowing. First, the record discloses no concern relating to Talley\u2019s age, health, or education. At the time in question, he was thirty-eight years old, had completed two years of college, and could read and write. Further, the record indicates that Talley had sufficient knowledge of the charges against him. The magistrate judge informed Talley of the offenses charged in the original indictment and told Talley that he faced a potential sentence of five years for each of the indictment\u2019s thirty-nine counts. Talley replied that he understood. Likewise, when Talley was arraigned on the superseding indictments, the district court informed him of the crimes he was charged with and the severity of the penal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ties attached to them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the district court told Talley that it was his \u201clife on the line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In addition, Talley possessed an adequate familiarity with the relevant procedural and evidentiary rules. Specifically, Talley stated that he knew the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure would apply at his trial. As we explained in <em>Kimball, </em>the purpose of the <em>Faretta </em>inquiry is \u201cnot to determine the extent of a defendant\u2019s legal knowledge or to determine how good of a trial advocate a defendant will be,\u201d but to ensure only that the defendant is aware that the rules exist and that he will be bound by them. <em>Kimball, </em>291 F.3d at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Talley also had previously been a defendant in a federal criminal trial, and he had represented himself in civil cases. Moreover, stand-by counsel was appointed to assist him. Additionally, Talley concedes that his decision to represent himself was voluntary and he raises no challenge to the district court\u2019s finding that he was mentally competent. Finally, the examining psychologist opined that Talley\u2019s seemingly nonsensical use of legal jargon was a tactic designed to manipulate the proceedings. Such posturing, we have observed, indicates \u201ca greater understanding of the proceedings and an understanding of the risks and complexities of a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick v. Wainwright, </em>800 F.2d 1057, 1067 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Talley nevertheless complains that he was not adequately warned about the risks of self-representation because the district eourt\u2019s inquiries into his decision were less thorough than the magistrate judge\u2019s. This, Talley claims, runs afoul of our statement in <em>Strozier v. Newsome, </em>926 F.2d 1100 (11th Cir.1991), that \u201cthe closer [a defendant\u2019s] waiver hearing is to trial, the more rigorous, searching, and formal the questioning of the trial judge should be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1105. But Talley\u2019s argument ignores the fact that, as noted above, the ultimate criterion for determining a waiver\u2019s validity is not the trial court\u2019s advice but the defendant\u2019s understanding. <em>Cash, </em>47 F.3d at 1088. As we have recounted, our review of the record satisfies us that Talley adequately understood the risks of representing himself: the magistrate judge\u2019s initial colloquy ensured that Talley was adequately apprised of the dangers when he was first indicted; and the district court\u2019s subsequent inquiries and warnings, when taken in concert with the magistrate judge\u2019s initial colloquy, were sufficient to establish that Talley continued fully to understand the risks of self-representation after the filing of the superseding indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Talley\u2019s argument also ignores the fact that his own uncooperativeness hampered the judges\u2019 attempts to discuss the risks of self-representation with him. As we recently observed in <em>Garey, </em>\u201can unwilling defendant can foil a district court\u2019s best efforts to engage in dialogue, thereby preventing the court from eliciting clear information regarding the defendant\u2019s understanding of the dangers of proceeding pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>se.\u201d <em>Garey, </em>540 F.3d at 1267. We further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">[Wlhen confronted with a defendant who has voluntarily waived counsel ... and who refuses to provide clear answers to questions regarding his Sixth Amendment rights, it is enough for the court to inform the defendant unambiguously of the penalties he faces if convicted and to provide him with a general sense of the challenges he is likely to confront as a pro se litigant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Like the defendant in <em>Garey, </em>Talley\u2019s uncooperativeness made it difficult for the court to explore with him as fully as possible the risks and dangers of his decision. Indeed, Talley\u2019s conduct appears to have been calculated to have just such an effect. Under the circumstances, the steps taken by the magistrate judge and the district judge were appropriate: they informed Talley of the offenses with which he had been charged; they explained the seriousness of the penalties he faced if convicted; they conveyed to him a sense of the difficulties he would encounter if he were to proceed pro se; and they assigned standby counsel to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In short, reviewing the record in this case, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in finding that Talley knowingly waived his right to trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Next, Talley claims that his conviction must be overturned because the district court required him to appear before the jury in shackles and handcuffs. While we agree that the district court erred on this point, we decline to overturn Talley\u2019s conviction because we conclude that the error ultimately was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">We have held that physical restraints \u201cshould be used as rarely as possible,\u201d given their potential to affect the jury\u2019s view of the defendant and to erode the defendant\u2019s presumed innocence. <em>Durham, </em>287 F.3d at 1304. We have also held, however, that there are circumstances under which shackles are appropriate to ensure a safe and orderly trial. <em>Id. </em>Before ordering that a defendant be shackled during a trial, the district court must make a case-specific and individualized assessment that takes account of: (1) the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the nature of the pending charges, with special attention to whether either involved violent acts; (2) whether the defendant has disrupted criminal proceedings in the past; and (3) whether the defendant has engaged in any threatening behavior. <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1244. The district court must state on the record its reasons for requiring the defendant to wear restraints. <em>Durham, </em>287 F.3d at 1304. In determining whether the district court abused its discretion, we consider (1) whether requiring the defendant to wear shackles furthered an essential state interest and (2) whether the trial court considered less restrictive methods of restraint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring Talley to wear shackles and to remain partially handcuffed during his trial. There is no indication from the record that the court made a case-specific and individualized decision that such measures were appropriate. Talley was not charged with a violent crime; he had never exhibited threatening behavior in any of his appearances before the court; and there was no particularized finding that Talley represented an escape risk. Nor, finally, did the district court consider less restrictive methods of addressing any risk Talley posed. Under these circumstances, Talley\u2019s right to due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>process was infringed. <em>Deck v. Missouri, </em>544 U.S. 622, 629, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953 (2005) (unjustified shackling is a violation of due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Having concluded that the district court erred in requiring Talley to be shackled, we must ask whether the error was harmless. Violation of a constitutional right will be found harmless if the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the resulting verdict. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1307 (11th Cir.2001). Here, Talley failed to present any defense whatsoever to the government\u2019s case. Indeed, although he refused to enter a plea, he repeatedly stated that he did not wish to contest the allegations in the indictment. It is simply implausible to think that the trial\u2019s outcome might have been different if Talley had not been shackled. <em>See, e.g., Boswell v. State of Alabama, </em>537 F.2d 100, 104 (5th Cir.1976) (defendant\u2019s appearance before venire in shackles and prison garb was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, although Talley was given the option of wearing civilian clothes during the trial, he elected to wear his prison uniform. In this case, the wearing of restraints presented no greater risk of juror prejudice to Talley than the wearing of prison garb. <em>Cf. United States ex rel. Stahl v. Henderson, </em>472 F.2d 556, 557 (5th Cir.1973) (defendant suffered no prejudice by being tried in prison garb since jury was already aware that he was incarcerated and \u201c[n]o prejudice can result from seeing that which is already known\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">We reiterate that defendants may be shackled only when necessary, and only after the district court has made a case-specific and individualized assessment of the nature of the danger posed by the defendant. In this case, however, we hold that while the district court failed to meet these requirements, its error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we affirm Talley\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-18\">. In the superseding indictment, the mail fraud and obstruction of justice charges were dropped and replaced by the charges on which Talley was ultimately tried and convicted: conspiracy to impede or injure an officer of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 372, and endeavoring to influence, intimidate, or impede an officer of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AqH\">. In this colloquy, as in his subsequent appearances before the district court, Talley's replies were often long, rambling, and obscure. For the sake of brevity, rather than providing a verbatim account of each of Talley\u2019s statements, we have reproduced only those parts of the transcript necessary to capture tjle bas\u00a1c gist and tenor of his responses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">. It does not appear from the record that the district court discussed with Talley the specific sentences possible under the superseding indictments. While informing defendants of the potential penalties they face is optimal, failure to do so does not make a waiver invalid. <em>See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Wainwright, </em>800 F.2d 1057, 1066 n. 6 (11th Cir.1986) (waiver was valid despite the fact that, while defendant understood the serious nature of the charges against him, the record did not show that he knew the possible penalties he might receive if convicted); <em>see also United States v. Kimball, </em>291 F.3d 726, 732 (11th Cir.2002) (waiver valid even though district court gave defendant an inaccurate estimate of probable sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b168-5\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit that were rendered prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">. At the conclusion of his opening brief, Talley half-heartedly asserts that requiring him to wear shackles constituted a structural error affecting his trial as a whole, and that the district court's decision therefore should not be subject to traditional harmless error analysis. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that structural errors are very rare. <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 8, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999). Talley makes no effort to explain why his case belongs in this category, nor attempts to distinguish his case from the many others in which we have subjected claims of wrongful shackling to harmless error analysis. <em>See, e.g., Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1246 (even assuming district court abused its discretion in shackling defendants, error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>Durham, </em>287 F.3d at 1308 (applying harmless error analysis to district court's requirement that defendant wear stun belt).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
