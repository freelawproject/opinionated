On appeal, Gonzalez argues that his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was violated because the district court improperly relied on the government\u2019s evidence regarding a pending state firearm possession charge to impose an upward variance at sentencing. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">We review questions of constitutional law <em>de novo. United States v. Brown, </em>364 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">The Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person shall ... be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. It \u201cnot only protects the individual against being involuntarily called as a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973). However, the privilege against self-incrimination guarantees \u201conly that the witness not be <em>compelled </em>to give self-incriminating testimony.\u201d <em>McKune v. Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 35-36, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002) (quotations omitted). A witness\u2019s answers \u201care not compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment unless the witness is required to answer over his valid claim of privilege.\u201d <em>United States v. Vangates, </em>287 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2002) (quotations omitted). Thus, while the strength of the government\u2019s case may push a defendant to testify, this pressure is not \u201ccompulsion\u201d for Fifth Amendment purposes. <em>Ohio Adult Parole Auth. v. Woodard, </em>523 U.S. 272, 287, 118 S.Ct. 1244, 140 L.Ed.2d 387 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">In <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>849 F.2d 568, 569 (11th Cir.1988), we held that the Fifth Amendment does not require a sentencing court to either refuse to consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in other criminal conduct, or grant the defendant immunity from prosecution regarding any statements made during sentencing. We relied on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning in a similar case, <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>719 F.2d 887 (7th Cir.1983), wherein the Seventh Circuit rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the Fifth Amendment prohibits a sentencing court from considering the government\u2019s unre-butted evidence of the defendant\u2019s other criminal wrongdoing. The Seventh Circuit explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-14\">[the defendant,] Marshall,] was not compelled to testify against himself, nor was he punished for not testifying on his own behalf. Marshall, like any defendant who chooses not to testify, took the chance that the uncontradicted [government testimony would be deemed credible. If we were to adopt Marshall\u2019s argument, the privilege against self-incrimination would be a way to completely rebut the Government\u2019s evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>without the defendant presenting any evidence of his own. The privilege against self-incrimination has never been so construed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-4\"><em>Marshall, </em>719 F.2d at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We find no merit in Gonzalez\u2019s Fifth Amendment challenge to the district court\u2019s consideration of his pending state law charges at sentencing. As an initial matter, the risk that the district court would be persuaded by the government\u2019s evidence regarding the pending state firearm possession charge in calculating an appropriate sentence did not create an unconstitutional burden on Gonzalez\u2019s right against compelled self-incrimination. Gonzalez himself conceded on appeal that the sentencing court \u201clikely did not draw any direct inference\u201d from his silence. (Emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Moreover, under our clear case law, the Fifth Amendment does not require a sentencing court to either refuse to consider evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s involvement in other criminal conduct, or grant the defendant immunity from prosecution regarding any statements made during sentencing. <em>Fleming, </em>849 F.2d at 569. Rather, by not testifying, Gonzalez simply took the chance that the uncontra-dicted government testimony would be deemed credible. <em>Marshall, </em>719 F.2d at 892. As a result, Gonzalez was not compelled to testify at sentencing \u2014 and, in fact, he did not testify \u2014 and any pressure that he may have felt to testify in response to the strength of the government\u2019s evidence regarding the state charge could not constitute \u201ccompulsion\u201d for Fifth Amendment purposes. <em>Woodard, </em>523 U.S. at 287, 118 S.Ct. 1244.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">. To die extent that Gonzalez argues that he was subject to \"duplicative punishment\" based on the district court's consideration of his pending state law charges, this Court need not consider this argument because it was raised for the first time in the reply brief, and thus, may be deemed waived. <em>See United States v. Dieter, </em>198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that a defendant waives a claim that he raises for the first time in his reply brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
