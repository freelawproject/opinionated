After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-26\">Under \u00a7 3582, a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) (Supp. May 1, 2008). Section 3582(c)(2) requires a sentence reduction to be consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy statements, which include U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section 1B1.10(b)(2) and its commentary preclude a district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence below the new, amended guidelines range if the defendant\u2019s original sentence fell within the then-applicable guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) &amp; cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Davila\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered most of the base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for crack-cocaine offenses. Davila\u2019s original guidelines range was 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the district court\u2019s original 324-month sentence was at the low end of that range. After Amendment 706, Davila\u2019s offense level was reduced by two levels, yielding a new guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court granted Davila\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and reduced Davila\u2019s sentence to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the low end of the new, amended guidelines range. The district court denied Davila\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) request to sentence him below that new, amended guidelines range pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">On appeal, Davila argues that the district court erred when it failed to apply <em>Booker </em>and treat the new guidelines range and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) as advisory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, as explained above, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) requires a sentence reduction to be consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy statements and in turn \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) and its commentary preclude the reduction in Davila\u2019s case. This Court recently held \u201cthat <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings\u201d and that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009). Because Davila\u2019s original sentence was within the then-applicable guidelines range, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) and its commentary precluded the district court from reducing Davila\u2019s sentence below the new, amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\">.
