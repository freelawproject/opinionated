Holland, a federal prisoner convicted of a crack cocaine offense, appeals the sentence imposed after the district court granted his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. The district court sentenced Holland to the high end of the amended guidelines range without otherwise explaining the ruling. The issue on appeal is whether, after granting Holland\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court abused its discretion by failing to address the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when sentencing Holland to the high end of the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">We review a district court\u2019s resolution of a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cA district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">Generally, a \u201ccourt may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). However, where a defendant has been sentenced pursuant to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-16\">a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ..., the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQq-\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements for reducing a term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are located in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. In determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment or the extent of such reduction, the application notes for \u00a7 1B1.10 instruct that the district court: (1) shall consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (2) shall consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by the reduction, and (3) may consider the post-sentencing conduct of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We have instructed the district court to engage in a two-part analysis when determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). The district court must: (1) recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, and (2) decide, in its discretion, whether it will choose to impose a new sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 780-81. The second part of the analysis \u201cshould be made in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781. We have held that while a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it \u201ccommits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Here, the district court granted Holland\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion but did not explain why it chose to sentence Holland to the high end of the amended guidelines range. Thus, the record does not demonstrate that the district court took the pertinent factors into account when sentencing Holland to that point. <em>See id. </em>at 1322. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further consideration and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
