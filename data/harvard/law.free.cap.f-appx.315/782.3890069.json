On appeal, Ribeiro argues that the BIA failed to correctly evaluate the educational, economic, and medical care consequences that his children will face upon his, and their possible, removal to Brazil, but the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to consider Ribeiro\u2019s claim. After thorough review, we dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-21\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) limits our jurisdiction over denials of discretionary relief in immigration proceedings, expressly providing that \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory) ... no court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). Under \u00a7 1229b, the Attorney General has discretion to cancel the removal order of a non-permanent resident if that alien has: (A) continuous physical presence in the United States for at least ten years, (B) good moral character, (C) a lack of certain criminal convictions, and (D) \u201cestablishes that removal would result in an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A)-(D). We have held that \u201cthe exceptional and extremely unusual hardship determination is a discretionary decision not subject to review.\u201d <em>Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-22\">As applied here, we lack jurisdiction to review any of Ribeiro\u2019s arguments chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>lenging the BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to establish that his removal would cause an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to his U.S. citizen children. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-31\">. We also lack jurisdiction to consider Ribei-ro's argument that the BIA\u2019s case law interpreting \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d is contrary to congressional intent because Ribeiro failed to raise this issue before the BIA. <em>See Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). Moreover, Ribeiro abandoned his challenges to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) and procedural due rights violation because he failed to provide arguments on the merits in his brief. <em>See United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1195 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
