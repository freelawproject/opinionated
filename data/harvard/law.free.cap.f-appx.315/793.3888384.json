The Board found that Navard failed to establish that he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Substantial evidence supports the finding by the Board and the immigration judge that Navard failed to establish that his persecution was on account of a protected ground. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). Navard argues that the immigration judge failed to consider his testimony about his persecution, but the immigration judge referred to Navard\u2019s testimony repeatedly in her decision to deny Navard\u2019s application. Navard testified that he and his family were victims of crimes by a man named Paulson, but Navard failed to explain how those crimes were related to a protected ground. The Board did not err when it dismissed Navard\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">We DENY Navard\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag_\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
