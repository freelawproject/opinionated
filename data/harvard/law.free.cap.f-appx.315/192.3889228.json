The government then filed a Rule 35(b) motion on his behalf requesting a reduced sentence based on his substantial assistance in prosecuting other defendants. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b). Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Dob-son now appeals the district court\u2019s order pursuant to the Rule 35(b) motion, in which the district court denied his motion for an evidentiary hearing and did not grant the sentence reduction to the full extent requested by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-23\">First, Dobson argues that the district court\u2019s failure to hear evidence concerning his substantial assistance caused a breach of the plea agreement. He argues that once the court accepted his plea agreement, it was obligated to accept the government\u2019s proffered information concerning his cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-24\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>a Rule 35 motion for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Yesil, </em>991 F.2d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In <em>Yesil, </em>we stated that a district court\u2019s discretion whether or not to grant an evi-dentiary hearing \u201cis severely curtailed once that court accepts a plea bargain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1531 (quotation omitted). Once the district court has accepted a plea bargain obligating the government to make known to the court the nature and extent of a defendant\u2019s cooperation, the court is also obligated to accept the government\u2019s proffered information. <em>Id. </em>at 1532. The Rule 35(b) motion in <em>Yesil </em>did not detail the full extent of the defendant\u2019s cooperation, but urged the court to hold an in <em>camera </em>hearing because of the confidentiality concerns of an ongoing investigation. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we reversed the district court\u2019s order denying the motion and remanded for an evidentiary hearing and consideration of the Rule 35(b) motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1533. In <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>we held that the district court, by denying an evidentiary hearing, had \u201ceffectively prevented the government from presenting its Rule 35 motion.\u201d 34 F.3d 998, 1001 (11th Cir.1994). In <em>Hernandez, </em>the Rule 35(b) motion did not detail the defendant\u2019s cooperation due to security reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In this case, the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing did not prevent the government from presenting its Rule 35(b) motion or operate to breach the plea agreement because the government explained Dobson\u2019s cooperation fully and completely in the motion itself. The Rule 35(b) motion did not indicate that it was leaving out any information based on security reasons or suggest the need for an <em>in camera </em>evidentiary review. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dobson\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Second, Dobson challenges the amount of the sentence reduction ordered by the district court. The government requested that Dobson\u2019s sentence be reduced from 262 months to 168 months, but the district court chose to reduce the sentence to 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">We have held that a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 35(b) motion is an \u201cotherwise final sentence,\u201d for which review is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>United States v. Manella, </em>86 F.3d 201, 202-03 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">A defendant may file a notice of appeal in the district court for review of an otherwise final sentence if the sentence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">(1) was imposed in violation of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">(3) is greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">(4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Under \u00a7 3742, our review of sentences is limited to the four enumerated circumstances, whereas a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a Rule 35(b) motion is a discretionary one from which an appeal generally will not lie under \u00a7 3742.\u201d <em>Manella, </em>86 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>With regards to Dobson\u2019s challenge to the extent of the district court\u2019s substantial assistance reduction, we do not have jurisdiction under \u00a7 3742 to review his claim, and we dismiss his appeal on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Finally, construing Dobson\u2019s brief liberally, we conclude that Dobson raises an argument that the district court imposed his reduced sentence in violation of Rule 35(b) because it failed to give thoughtful consideration of the extent of his assistance to the government. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d). Although we lack jurisdiction to review the extent of a sentence reduction, we do have jurisdiction to consider a claim that Dob-son\u2019s sentence was imposed in violation of law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1); <em>Manella, </em>86 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u201cThe application of law to sentencing issues is subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>Manella, </em>86 F.3d at 203. However, a district court has discretion to grant or deny a Rule 35(b) motion. <em>Id. </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Rule 35(b) provides that, after a sentence has been imposed, upon motion of the government made more than one year after sentencing, a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence based on substantial assistance if the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance involved information not known to the defendant, not useful to the government, or the usefulness of which was not reasonably anticipated by the defendant, until more than one year after sentencing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(2). A careful reading of Rule 35(b) reveals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">[T]he only factor that may militate <em>in favor of </em>a Rule 35(b) reduction is the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. Nothing in the text of the rule purports to limit what factors may militate <em>against </em>granting a Rule 35(b) reduction. Similarly, the rule does not limit the factors that may militate in favor of granting a smaller reduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\"><em>Manella, </em>86 F.3d at 204. \u201cRule 35(b) does not prohibit the consideration of [the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] factors in deciding to what extent a defendant\u2019s sentence should be reduced for substantial assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205. These factors include the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide punishment and deterrence, and protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">The record reflects that the district court properly considered the extent of Dobson\u2019s cooperation, as well as other permissible, relevant factors. The district court significantly reduced Dobson\u2019s sentence from 260 months to 210 months. The district court did not give the full reduction that the government requested because of Dobson\u2019s status as a career offender. Accordingly, to the extent Dob-son challenges his reduced sentence as imposed in violation of law, the district court did not abuse its discretion, and we affirm Dobson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Dobson\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing on the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dobson\u2019s motion. To the extent Dobson argues that his reduced sentence was imposed in violation of law, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the reduced sentence, and we affirm Dobson\u2019s sentence. To the extent Dobson challenges the amount of the reduction in his sentence in the district court\u2019s order, we dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">.
