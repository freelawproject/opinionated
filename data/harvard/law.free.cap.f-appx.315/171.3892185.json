Leavitt, Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, in an action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16, and Georgia state law. First, Dinkins argues that the court erred by concluding that her claims were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>and that, as a result of that error, Dinkins\u2019 due process and equal protection rights were violated. Second, Dinkins contends that the court erred in determining that equitable tolling, because of Dinkins\u2019 mental health and the ineffective assistance of counsel she received, did not prevent the operation of res <em>judicata </em>to Dinkins\u2019 claims. Third, Din-kins contends that the district court judge, by failing to recuse himself, violated Canon 2 of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct because the judge demonstrated \u201cimpropriety\u201d and was unable to conduct a proper and unbiased review of Dinkins\u2019 claims. The government contends that we should dismiss Dinkins\u2019 appeal of the district court decisions concerning Dinkins\u2019 first and second lawsuits (\u201cDinkins I\u201d and \u201cDin-kins II\u201d respectively) because Dinkins failed to timely appeal those decisions. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Dinkins, an African-American female, was employed as a GS-9 Health Communications Specialist in the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s (\u201cCDC\u201d) Health Communications Branch of the Office of Smoking and Health from February 1999 until February 2002, when she was granted a medical disability separation effective October 18, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">On April 10, 2003, Dinkins filed her first judicial complaint in Dinkins I alleging Title VII claims of disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and retaliation, on the ground of non-selection for eight different positions for which she had applied. On September 10, 2004, the district court dismissed Dinkins\u2019 complaint for defective service. On January 30, 2004, while Dinkins I was still pending, Dinkins filed the complaint in Dinkins II, in which she raised the same issues against the same defendant, including: (a) racial discrimination, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; (b) employment discrimination, in violation of Title VII; (c) conspiracy to deprive rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985; and (d) intentional infliction of emotional distress, in violation of Georgia law. The factual premise for the allegations in the Dinkins II complaint arose out of events that occurred from February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>1999 to February 2002. On March 11, 2005, the district court allowed Dinkins to cure the defective service issues in the complaint in Dinkins II, but dismissed Dinkins\u2019 state law claim and determined that Dinkins had abandoned her \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985 claims by failing to respond to the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On May 4, 2005, the government filed a motion for summary judgment on the remaining issues. On September 28, 2005, the district court determined that Dinkins failed to meet her burden of presenting evidence that would support her claim of discrimination due to a hostile work environment, retaliation, or disparate treatment, and the final judgment granting summary judgment to the government was rendered on September 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Then, on February 27, 2007, Dinkins filed the instant 78-page <em>pro se </em>complaint in which she alleged (1) racial discrimination, (2) hostile work environment, (8) disparate treatment, (4) malicious slander, (5) defamation of her character, (6) violations of her privacy, (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (8) retaliation. Dinkins argued in her complaint that she was entitled to equitable tolling with respect to her claims in light of the severity of her physical and mental incapacitation. She also claimed that her attorney\u2019s misconduct entitled her to equitable tolling. The government filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In his report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), the magistrate judge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion, which the magistrate construed as a motion for summary judgment. According to the magistrate, all of Dinkins\u2019 claims in her complaint were barred by <em>res judicata </em>because they had already been litigated or had arisen from the same factual predicate as those in Dinkins II. First, the magistrate concluded that Dinkins\u2019 current Title VII retaliation, hostile work environment, and disparate treatment claims were identical to the Title VII claims she raised in the earlier complaint. The magistrate concluded that the lawsuit in Dinkins II resulted in a final judgment on the merits entered by a court of competent jurisdiction for <em>res judicata </em>purposes. Further, the magistrate noted, the parties in both Dinkins\u2019 suits were identical, even though the name of the Secretary of the Department of Health had changed. Second, Dinkins had previously abandoned her \u00a7 1981 claims and the state law claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, and, therefore, the magistrate found that those claims were barred by <em>res judicata </em>because they were available in the prior suit and should have been raised then. Third, Dinkins\u2019 newly asserted miscellaneous Title VII claims arose out of the same nucleus of operative facts as Dinkins\u2019 previous Title VII claims. Fourth, the magistrate concluded that Dinkins should have raised her Privacy Act claim in her prior civil action, as the factual predicate for that claim existed at the time of her previous lawsuit. Fifth, Dinkins\u2019 state law claims for defamation and slander were barred by <em>res judicata </em>because they also arose from the same factual predicate as Dinkins\u2019 prior Title VII hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The magistrate determined that equitable tolling based on misconduct during the administrative proceeding and misconduct as a result of the actions by Dinkins\u2019 former attorney did not prevent a <em>res judica-ta </em>finding because the doctrines were used for different purposes. Further, the magistrate noted that, even if Dinkins had meant to argue that a different equitable principle applied, such an argument would still fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>In its January 11, 2008, order, the district court adopted the R &amp; R and granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court stated that, for the reasons set forth in the R &amp; R, all of Dinkins\u2019 claims were barred by <em>res judica-ta, </em>and Dinkins\u2019 mental incompetence did not authorize any exceptions. On February 14, 2008, 2008 WL 447503, the clerk entered judgment, and Dinkins filed a notice of appeal. In her 20-page notice of appeal, Dinkins stated that she was appealing under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) to obtain relief from the May 11, 2004, September 27, 2004, and January 11, 2008, judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">II. Law &amp; Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">A. Jurisdiction to Review Dinkins\u2019 First and Second Judicial Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We review questions regarding our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Brown v. Snow, </em>440 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u201cAn appeal permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4.\u201d Fed.RApp.P. 3(a)(1). Rule 4 provides that, \u201c[wjhen the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(B). \u201c[A] timely filed notice of appeal is prerequisite to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Dresdner Bank AG v. M/V Olympia Voyager, </em>465 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir.2006). Rule 60(b) provides for relief from a judgment, order, or proceeding on the basis, in pertinent part, for mistake, newly discovered evidence, or fraud. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Dinkins was required to file a notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s judgments of September 10, 2004 in Dinkins I and September 29, 2005 in Dinkins II no later than 60 days after entry of each judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.RApp.P. 4(a)(1)(B). Dinkins\u2019 instant notice of appeal, filed on February 25, 2008, references those two decisions, but it is timely only with respect to the judgment entered on February 14, 2008. <em>See id. </em>As such, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s earlier judgments. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(B); <em>See Dresdner Bank AG, </em>465 F.3d at 1271. Similarly, to the extent that Dinkins is appealing the district court\u2019s March 11, 2005, order in Dinkins II, her February 25, 2008, notice of appeal is untimely because it was filed more than 60 days after the order became final. <em>See </em>Fed.RApp.P. 4(a)(1)(B). Further, Dinkins\u2019 reliance upon Rule 60(b) is procedurally improper because she did not file a Rule 60(b) motion in the district court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Accordingly, we dismiss Dinkins\u2019 appeal of the court\u2019s September 10, 2004, and September 29, 2005, judgments and the March 11, 2005, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">B. Whether Dinkins\u2019 Claims Are Barred by <em>Res Judicata</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">We \u201creview the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>same legal standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Sierra Club, Inc. v. Leavitt, </em>488 F.3d 904, 911 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cSummary judgment is proper if, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of <em>res judica-ta. EEOC v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>383 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><em>\u201cRes judicata </em>bars the filing of claims which were raised or could have been raised in an earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cThe purpose behind the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is that the full and fair opportunity to litigate protects a party\u2019s adversaries from the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alteration omitted). Four elements are required for <em>res judicata </em>to bar a subsequent suit: \u201c(1) there must be a final judgment on the merits; (2) the decision must be rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, must be identical in both suits; and (4) the same cause of action must be involved in both cases.\u201d <em>I.A Durbin, Inc. v. Jefferson Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>793 F.2d 1541, 1549 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cA final decision is \u2018one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre, </em>701 F.2d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). A dismissal without prejudice is not an adjudication on the merits and thus does not have a <em>res judicata </em>effect. <em>See Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1161 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">As an initial matter, Dinkins does not contest that: (1) the previous decision in Dinkins II was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) the parties were identical in both Dinkins II and the instant case; and (3) the same cause of action is involved in both cases. Instead, she argues that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>was erroneously applied to the instant case because there was no previous \u201cfinal judgment on the merits.\u201d Thus, we do not discuss the other three <em>res jtidicata </em>elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The district court dismissed Dinkins\u2019 complaint in Dinkins I on September 10, 2004, because of defective service. In its September 29, 2005, decision in Dinkins II, the court acknowledged that the earlier decision in Dinkins I was not a \u201cfinal judgment on the merits\u201d for <em>res judicata </em>purposes when it rejected the government\u2019s argument that its motion for summary judgment should be granted on that ground. In the September 29, 2005, decision in Dinkins II, the court dismissed the action \u201con the merits\u201d when it found: (1) the circumstances were not so severe and pervasive to alter the nature of the work environment such to support a hostile work environment claim; (2) Dinkins failed to show a causal link between her EEO complaint and the government\u2019s failure to promote her such to support a retaliation claim; (3) Dinkins failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment for five of the eight job vacancies for which she was not selected; and (4) Dinkins failed to rebut any of the government\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its selection choices for the remaining three job vacancies. Thus, the September 29, 2005, judgment in Dinkins II was a \u201cfinal judgment on the merits\u201d for <em>res judicata </em>purposes. <em>See Pitney Bowes, Inc., </em>701 F.2d at 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Although Dinkins contends that the September 10, 2004, dismissal of her complaint in Dinkins I prevents the application of <em>res judicata </em>in the instant case, it is the September 29, 2005, judgment in Dinkins II that forms the basis for the \u201cfinal judgment on the merits\u201d for <em>res judicata </em>purposes in the instant action. Thus, the court did not err in applying the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>on this ground. <em>See I.A. Durbin, Inc., </em>793 F.2d at 1549. As a result, Dinkins\u2019 due process and equal protection rights were not violated. Accordingly, we affirm this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">C. Whether Equitable Tolling Prevents the Application of <em>Res Judicata</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u201cThe question of whether equitable tolling applies is a legal one subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Cabello v. Fernandez-Larios, </em>402 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.2005). As previously mentioned, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of <em>res judica-ta. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>383 F.3d at 1285. \u201cThe doctrine of equitable tolling permits courts to deem filings timely where a litigant can show that he has been pursuing his rights diligently and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Astrue, </em>506 F.3d 1349, 1353 (11th Cir.2007) (brackets, quotations, and citations omitted). \u201c[T]radi-tional equitable tolling principles require a claimant to justify her untimely filing by a showing of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">To the extent that Dinkins\u2019 asserts that equitable tolling principles exempt her claims from the application of <em>res judicata, </em>her argument is without merit. The district court dismissed Dinkins\u2019 claims on the basis of <em>res judicata </em>principles. Dinkins\u2019 claims were not dismissed because they were untimely. As such, equitable tolling principles are not applicable here, and, thus, Dinkins\u2019 mental health and ineffective assistance of counsel claims do not bar the application of <em>res judicata. See Jackson, </em>506 F.3d at 1353. Accordingly, we affirm this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">D. Whether Dinkins Waived her \u201cImpropriety\u201d Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Although she did argue that the district court judge made several legal errors, Dinkins failed to seek recusal of the district court judge in the proceedings below. Thus, Dinkins has waived this issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526-27 (11th Cir.1994). Nonetheless, Dinkins \u201cimpropriety\u201d argument fails even if the claim were properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\u201cCanon 2 [of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges] tells judges to \u2018avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities,\u2019 on the bench and off.\u201d <em>United States v. Microsoft Corp., </em>253 F.3d 34, 107 (D.C.Cir.2001). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), \u201cany justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d \u201cTo disqualify a judge under \u00a7 455(a), the bias \u2018must stem from extrajudicial sources, unless the judge\u2019s acts demonstrate such pervasive bias and prejudice that it unfairly prejudices one of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1223, 1227 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). An adverse ruling does \u201cnot provide a party with a basis for holding that the court\u2019s impartiality is in doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Here, Dinkins does not present any evidence of extrajudicial bias on the part of the court, which would provide a basis for recusal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a); <em>Berger, </em>375 F.3d at 1227. Instead, she continues to assert that the court acted improperly by acknowledging in its September 29, 2005, decision in Dinkins II that the earlier decision in Dinkins I was not a \u201cfinal judgment on the merits,\u201d but then applying the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>in the instant case. However, as discussed more thoroughly above, Dinkins fails to recognize that the September 29, 2005, decision was a final judgment on the merits, and it is this decision that forms the basis for barring her current claim on <em>res judicata </em>grounds. Accordingly, the district court judge did not err by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>recuse himself, and we affirm this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\">. We note that, although in their briefs, both parties refer to the district court's \"May 11, 2005,\" judgment, the district court actually dismissed Dinkins\u2019 complaint in Dinkins I on September 10, 2004. With respect to the action in Dinkins II, the court, on March 11, 2005, granted in part the government's motion to dismiss, and it dismissed Dinkins' state law claims. In the same order, the court determined that Dinkins had abandoned her \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985 claims. The March 11, 2005, order became final on September 29, 2005, when the clerk entered final judgment on Dinkins II. Thus, it is unclear to which order the parties actually refer. However, Dinkins failed to timely appeal either the September 10, 2004, judgment or the September 29, 2005, judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">. Although we recognize five exceptions to the rule that \"appellate courts generally will not consider an issue or theory that was not raised in the district court,\u201d none of those exceptions apply here. <em>See Narey, </em>32 F.3d at 1526-27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
