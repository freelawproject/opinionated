Burnside contends that he is entitled to a sentencing reduction based on Amendment 506 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which addressed the definition of \u201cOffense Statutory Maximum\u201d as used in \u00a7 4B1.1. He also contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the sentencing proceeding because he involuntarily waived his right to counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>82 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">Burnside first contends that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 506 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court\u2019s order denying Burnside\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence does not refer to Amendment 506. Instead, it appears to have considered only the effect of Amendment 706. Amendment 706 does not lower Burnside\u2019s sentence because his convictions involve powder cocaine and Amendment 706 applies only to crack cocaine convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, Amend. 706 (2007); <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984-85 (11th Cir.2008). Still, even assuming that the district court did not consider Burnside\u2019s argument regarding Amendment 506, we can affirm on any grounds supported by the record. <em>Mejia, </em>82 F.3d at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">Here we affirm because Amendment 506 does not operate to lower Burnside\u2019s sentence. Burnside contends that his guideline range was improperly enhanced under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the sentencing guidelines because his \u201cOffense Statutory Maximum\u201d was increased based on his prior criminal history in violation of Amendment 506. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, Amend. 506.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He is wrong. For one thing, Amendment 506 was effectively superceded by Amendment 567; the sentencing guidelines now define \u201cOffense Statutory Maximum\u201d as used in \u00a7 4B1.1 as including \u201cany increase in [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>statutory] maximum term under a sentencing enhancement provision that applies because of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n. 2; <em>see also id. </em>app. C, Amend 567. More fundamentally, Burnside was convicted of, among other things, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, which has a statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b)(1)(A). Therefore, Burnside\u2019s base offense level was increased to 37 pursuant \u00a7 4B1.1 regardless of his past criminal history. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). It follows that the district court used the proper base offense level in calculating Burnside\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Burnside\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim also fails. We do not have jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to correct an extraneous re-sentencing issue. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\">. Once it is established that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\">. Amendment 506, effective November 1, 1994, changed the definition of \"Offense Statutory Maximum\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1 to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa7\">[T]he maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense of conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense, not including any increase in that maximum term under a sentencing enhancement provision that applies because of the defendant's prior criminal record....
