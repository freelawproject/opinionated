She also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing on whether she was prejudiced by her trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance based on their mistaken belief that she was not charged with a capital offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The court applied the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and initially denied Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition. The court found that Ramirez did not establish that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Accordingly, it neither addressed whether counsel\u2019s performance was prejudicial nor granted an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">On Ramirez\u2019s first appeal, we found that counsel performed deficiently by mistakenly advising Ramirez at the time she was considering plea offers for five-and ten-year prison terms that she faced at most a ten-year prison term if convicted at trial when she actually faced a possible life sentence. <em>Ramirez v. United States, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 185, 188 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). We remanded the case to the district court to determine whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. On remand, the district court again denied Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and request for an evidentiary hearing, finding that she failed adequately to allege prejudice. We then granted a certificate of appealability on the issue whether Ramirez satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong with evidence that but for counsel\u2019s deficient advice regarding the possible statutory maximum sentence, she would have pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">In this appeal, Ramirez alleges that she was prejudiced because she would have pleaded guilty if counsel had advised her to do so. For the reasons below, we find that an evidentiary hearing is warranted here. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">Standard op Review</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo. Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). We review a district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>an abuse of discretion. <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Ramirez argues that she has shown prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>because had counsel known that the indictment charged first-degree murder, a capital offense, they would have advised her to take the plea offer, and she would have taken it. Alternatively, she argues that she has alleged sufficient facts to warrant an evidentiary hearing on the issue of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">To challenge the plea process based on ineffective assistance of counsel, a federal habeas petitioner must satisfy the two-part test articulated in <em>Strickland. </em>To succeed under <em>Strickland, </em>a petitioner must show \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,\u201d 466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. When challenging the plea process, the prejudice prong \u201cfocuses on whether counsel\u2019s constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). To establish prejudice, a petitioner \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, [s]he would ... have pleaded guilty and would [not] have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1504 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u201cA federal habeas corpus petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if [s]he alleges facts, which, if proven, would entitle h[er] to relief.\u201d <em>Diaz v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 832, 834 (11th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted). \u201c[A] petitioner need only allege-not prove-reasonably specific, non-conclusory facts____\u201d <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 715 n. 6. \u201cThe court on review must accept all of the petitioner\u2019s alleged facts as true and determine whether the petitioner has set forth a valid claim.... \u201d <em>Diaz, </em>930 F.2d at 834 (quotation omitted). \u201cIf the allegations are not affirmatively contradicted by the record and the claims are not patently frivolous, the district court is required to hold an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 715 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">Since we have already determined that Ramirez\u2019s trial counsel performed deficiently, <em>Ramirez, </em>260 Fed.Appx. at 188, we consider only the district court\u2019s prejudice analysis. <em>See United States v. White, </em>846 F.2d 678, 684 (11th Cir.1988) (quotation omitted) (\u201cThe doctrine of the law of the case mandates that an appellate court decision on an issue ... be followed in all subsequent trial court proceedings in the same case.\u201d). The district court erred in its prejudice analysis because it attempted to isolate counsel\u2019s assessment of the strength of the statute of limitations defense from counsel\u2019s advice regarding Ramirez\u2019s potential maximum punishment. The two, however, are directly related. Since counsel did not believe that the indictment charged first-degree murder, counsel did not contemplate that Ramirez possibly faced a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">Ramirez\u2019s statements and counsel\u2019s affidavit and interview suggest that Ramirez would have done whatever counsel advised, including pleading guilty. But counsel advised Ramirez under the mistaken belief that she would face no imprisonment if acquitted or at most ten years\u2019 imprisonment if convicted at trial. If counsel believed that the indictment charged first-degree murder, a capital offense not subject to a statute of limitations defense, then it stands to reason that counsel would not have believed so strongly that Ramirez\u2019s indictment was time barred. <em>Cf. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3281 (no statute of limitations for capital offenses) <em>and </em>18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u00a7 3282(a) (five-year statute of limitations for non-capital offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The government denies that an eviden-tiary hearing is warranted because Ramirez alleges no facts demonstrating that she would have accepted the plea offers had she known that she faced life imprisonment. Nor has she alleged, argues the government, that counsel would have advised her to plead guilty if they had known that she possibly faced life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">But since counsel\u2019s affidavit and interview are silent on the issue, the record does not \u201caffirmatively contradict[ ]\u201d Ramirez\u2019s non-frivolous allegation that she would have pleaded .guilty if properly advised. <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 715 n. 6. Thus, the district court abused its discretion by denying an evidentiary hearing on whether Ramirez was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">After carefully reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we conclude that the district court erred in its prejudice analysis and abused its discretion by not conducting an evidentiary hearing on whether Ramirez\u2019s counsel would have advised her to plead guilty absent their own deficient performance. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for an evidentiary hearing on (1) whether Ramirez would have pleaded guilty upon the advice of counsel, and (2) whether counsel would have advised her to plead guilty had they known that she faced possible life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
