Scott, a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner convicted of crack cocaine offenses, appeals from the district court\u2019s limited reduction of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the denial of various post-order motions for reconsideration. On appeal, Scott argues that: (1) the district court violated the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by failing to order a revised Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d); (2) the district court violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in imposing his sentence, and the Sentencing Commission violated <em>Booker </em>in rewriting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10; and (3) his sentence was unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. We </em>review <em>de novo </em>legal questions concerning the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">First, we reject Scott\u2019s claim that the district court erred by failing to order a revised PSI for his resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(d) set forth the requirements for the disclosure of PSIs. Rule 32 provides that for any disputed portion of the PSI, the sentencing court \u201cmust ... rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary....\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). However, sentencing adjustments under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, all \u201coriginal sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (observing that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d). Accordingly, a district court should leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>intact its previous factual decisions from the sentencing hearing when deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997) (holding the district court correctly declined to reexamine the number of marijuana plants involved in the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">In this case, Scott was not entitled to a new PSI or to lodge objections to his original PSI because all of the district court\u2019s original sentencing determinations were to remain unchanged except for the revised guidelines range. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Therefore, the district court was not required to follow the dictates of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding PSIs in reducing Scott\u2019s sentence, and did not err in failing to order a revised PSI nor in failing to consider Scott\u2019s contention that his original PSI contained inaccurate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Next, we find no merit in Scott\u2019s argument that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Booker. </em>The policy statements of the Guidelines provide that, generally, a district court considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment below the amended guideline range. In relevant part, \u00a7 1131.10(b)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">(2) <em>Limitations and Prohibition on Extent of </em>Reduction.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">(A) <em>In General. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">(B) <em>Exception. </em>\u2014 If the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">In <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>we held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. 556 F.3d 1190, 1191, 1193 (11th Cir.2009). We further held that even if <em>Booker </em>did apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, \u201cthere is no mandatory sentencing guideline that would run afoul of <em>Booker ... </em>since a court is not required [under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)] to reduce a movant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193. As a result, <em>Booker </em>does not prohibit \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)\u2019s limitation that a district court cannot reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment below the amended guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">In light of our recent decision in <em>Melvin, </em>the district court could not have committed a statutory or constitutional error pursuant to <em>Booker </em>in granting Scott\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because <em>Booker </em>does not apply to such proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 1191. Therefore, the district court was not permitted to reduce Scott\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range. <em>See id. </em>at 1193-94. Nor did <em>Booker </em>prohibit the Sentencing Commission from prohibiting the district court from sentencing Scott below the amended guideline range. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, to the extent that Scott argues that the district court erred in basing his sentence on its previous finding that he was accountable for a particular amount of cocaine base, Scott was not entitled to a full resentencing based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the district court properly left intact its previous factual decisions regarding the drug quantity. <em>See Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1563.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Scott\u2019s claim that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. A dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>trict court may reduce a sentence pursuant to a subsequently-lowered guideline range when the court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concludes that a \u201creduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To do so, \u201cthe district court must make two distinct determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). The district court must first substitute the amended guideline range and second, must decide whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence after considering the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>The record must demonstrate that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors were taken into account, but the district court is not required to articulate the applicability of each of the factors. <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Here, the district court correctly calculated Scott\u2019s amended guideline range at 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. Next, the district court noted that it was required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and it explicitly stated that sentencing Scott below 151 months\u2019 imprisonment would create an unwarranted sentencing disparity. Scott failed to show that the court abused its discretion in re-sentencing him because the district court followed the proper procedures for reducing a sentence in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-10\">. Scott was resentenced based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine cases calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by two levels. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Scott was able to seek the retroactive application of Amendment 706 through a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the Sentencing Commission added Amendment 706 to \u00a7 IB 1.10(c) on March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713; <em>see also United States v. Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. Although Scott seems to argue that his guideline range should have been lower because he did not possess crack cocaine, as noted above, the district court's initial findings regarding Scott's drug quantity and drug type could not be revisited during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1563. Indeed, the district court left Scott\u2019s range at a criminal history category of II and was careful in pointing out that it could not consider any erroneous information regarding Scott's criminal history category in reaching that conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
