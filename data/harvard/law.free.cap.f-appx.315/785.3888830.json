No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">The facts largely are undisputed. Old Republic is a title insurance underwriter. GMC Land Services of Florida, Inc. (\u201cGMC\u201d) operated as a policy issuing agent for Old Republic; GMC received and processed applications for title insurance and issued title insurance policies for Old Republic. Lloyd\u2019s issued a professional services liability policy to GMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">On 28 December 2004, GMC closed a real estate sale on a parcel of property in Pembroke Pines, Florida (the \u201cProperty\u201d); by warranty deed filed in the Broward County Recorder\u2019s Office, the Property was transferred from Jacquelyn Jones Thom to Shekinal Awofadeju. Awofadeju had obtained a mortgage loan of $456,000 from Aegis Funding Corporation (\u201cAegis\u201d); GMC issued a title insurance policy through Old Republic insuring title to the Property on behalf of Aegis in the amount of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">As of 28 December 2004, the Recorder\u2019s Office reflected that a quitclaim deed for the Property had been issued on 19 July 2004 and recorded on 28 September 2004; the quitclaim deed purported to transfer the Property from Steven E. Tovar to Jacquelyn Jones Thom. Tovar later filed an action to clear title. According to To-var, his signature on the 19 July 2004 quitclaim deed was forged, and Thom obtained no title from the purported transfer. Aegis made a claim against Old Republic on the title insurance policy; and Old Republic paid Aegis $456,000, the full amount of the title insurance policy. Old Republic then sought to recover this payment from GMC claiming that GMC had failed to follow applicable agent guidelines and procedures: specifically, GMC had failed to alert Old Republic to the existence of the quitclaim deed in the chain of title to the Property. GMC, in turn, reported the claim to Lloyd\u2019s, its professional services liability insurer. Lloyd\u2019s disclaimed coverage under the Policy; and Lloyd\u2019s initiated this declaratory judgment action to determine what obligation, if any, it had under the professional liability policy to indemnify GMC against claims made by Old Republic for GMC\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">Both parties moved for summary judgment below; each advanced the same provision of the professional liability policy in support of the motion. That provision' \u2014 \u25a0 entitled \u201cLand Flip Exclusion\u201d \u2014 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-15\">This Policy does not apply to Loss in connection with any Claim: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Based upon or directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from: (a) any transaction involving real property that occurs within six months after a sale, assignment, transfer or change in ownership involving such real property, or (b) any failure to comply with closing instructions relating to a prior sale, assignment, transfer or change in ownership involving the property that is the subject of closing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Applying Florida law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court determined that the plain language of the policy excluded coverage: the 28 December 2004 purported sale of the Property occurred within six months of the 19 July 2004 purported transfer from Tovar. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Old Republic argues on appeal \u2014 as it did before the district court \u2014 that the exclusion has no application because it is triggered only when a valid or legitimate or actual \u201csale, assignment, transfer or change in ownership\u201d occurs within the preceding six-month period. According to Old Republic, the claimed forgery of the Tovar quitclaim deed was void ab initio; it was a legal nullity and, as a matter of law, was no transaction for purposes of the Land Flip Exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Whatever may be the status of the To-var quitclaim deed under principles of Florida real estate law \u2014 and we assume arguendo that the quitclaim deed was void ab initio \u2014 the question at the heart of this appeal is one of insurance coverage and principles of Florida law applicable to the construction of an insurance policy. As the district court noted correctly, insurance policies must be read as a whole, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.419(1). \u201c[Ijnsurance contracts are construed according to their plain meaning,\u201d <em>Taurus Holdings Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guaranty Co., </em>913 So.2d 528, 532 (Fla.2005); and every term should be given \u201cits full meaning and operative effect.\u201d Aut<em>o-Owners Insurance Co. v. Anderson, </em>756 So.2d 29, 34 (Fla.2000). \u201cIf the relevant policy language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, one providing coverage and another limiting coverage, the insurance policy is considered ambiguous,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and ambiguities are construed in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer. <em>Swire Pacific Holdings, Inc. v. Zurich Insurance Co., </em>845 So.2d 161, 165 (Fla.2003). But the Florida Supreme Court has cautioned that this rule of construction only applies when a provision is actually ambiguous; \u201c \u2018if a policy provision is clear and unambiguous, it should be enforced according to its terms whether it is a basic policy provision or an exclusionary provision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garcia v. Federal Insurance Co., </em>969 So.2d 288, 291 (Fla.2007), <em>quoting Taurus Holdings, </em>913 So.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The insurance provision at issue is time-focused: only property transactions within a six-month-time-frame are addressed by the Land Flip Exclusion. Taken in context, we agree with the district court that the plain language of the exclusion is unambiguous; the policy excludes coverage of any claim directly or indirectly arising out of any transaction (here, the sale by Thom of the Property to Awofadeju) within six months after another \u201csale, assignment, transfer or change in ownership\u201d (here, the transfer of the Property from Tovar to Awofadeju by quitclaim deed as recorded in the County Recorder\u2019s Office). Under ordinary rules of construction \u2014 construing the plain language of the Policy as bargained for by the parties, <em>see Auto-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number><em>Owners, </em>756 So.2d at 33 \u2014 the Policy is susceptible to only one reasonable interpretation. We reject Plaintiffs efforts to engraft further limitations on the plain language of the Policy; the Policy excludes coverage of claims arising from a sale, assignment, transfer, or change in ownership within the six-month-time frame whether the sale, assignment, transfer, or change in ownership is determined later to have been illegitimate, fraudulent, forged or otherwise of no legal consequence. <em>See Excelsior Insurance Co. v. Pomona Park Bar &amp; Package Store, </em>369 So.2d 938, 942 (Fla.1979) (courts are not to \u201crewrite contracts, add meaning that is not present, or otherwise reach results contrary to the intentions of the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">. This matter is in federal court under diversity jurisdiction; the parties agreed that Florida <em>law </em>applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AYR\">. Because we conclude the district court granted summary judgment correctly under clause (a) of the Land Flip Exclusion, we do not consider Lloyd's argument that clause (b) also would support summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
