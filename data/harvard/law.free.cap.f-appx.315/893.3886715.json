Harris\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduces base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Harris argues that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when it refused to sentence him below the minimum of the amended guideline range. Harris asserts that, despite the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which purports to constrain the court\u2019s authority to vary from the amended range, that section, like all of the Guidelines, is merely advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-23\">In the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-24\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This authority is limited to those Guideline amendments listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) that \u201chave the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 706 is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 713. Effective November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 adjusted downward by two levels the base offense level assigned to each threshold quantity of crack cocaine listed in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. See U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 706. Therefore, a district court has discretion to reduce the sentence of a defendant whose sentencing range has been lowered by Amendment 706. Any sentencing reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Commission\u2019s policy statements direct that a defendant is not entitled to a full resen-tencing during \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Section IB 1.10(b)(2) also provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\">(2) <em>Limitations and Prohibition on Extent of </em>Reduction.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-7\">(A) <em>In General. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">(B) <em>Exception. </em>\u2014 If the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate. However, if the original term of imprisonment constituted a non-guideline sentence determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a further reduction generally would not be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALfu\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) (made effective on March 3, 2008, by Amendment 712).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">We recently held, in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and thus the court is bound by the limitations imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and does not have the authority to sentence below the amended guideline range. <em>Melvin, </em>manuscript op. at 2, 9. Because of our holding in <em>Melvin, supra, </em>Harris\u2019s argument that the district court should have sentenced him below the minimum guideline range due to its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm Harris\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
