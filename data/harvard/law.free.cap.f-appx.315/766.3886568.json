In this petition, Norouzi and Sardari-Amidabadi (collectively \u201cpetitioners\u201d) argue that they are entitled to withholding of removal and CAT relief because the IJ found their testimony credible, the Government failed to present any evidence that they did not possess a credible fear of persecution, and their persecution was based on their association with Abbas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-25\">\u201c[We] review! ] administrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cTo conclude the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007)). We only review the BIA\u2019s decision, unless the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review claims that were not raised before the BIA, even if the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>considered the claim. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Fernandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen. Of U.S., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001). We have jurisdiction, however, if a petitioner asserts his \u201ccore issue\u201d before the BIA. <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1228 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">\n<em>I. Withholding of removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">An applicant seeking withholding of removal must establish that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (quoted in <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006)). The burden of proof is on the alien to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that, upon return to her country, she will be persecuted. <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. An individual\u2019s testimony, \u201c\u2018if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)). An alien must demonstrate a nexus between her past persecution and one of the protected grounds. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">We conclude from the record that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the petitioners failed to establish past persecution, or a well-founded fear of future persecution, as their testimony established that there was not a nexus between their persecution and a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">\n<em>II. CAT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the petitioners\u2019 CAT claim, as they did not present it before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">PETITION DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-17\">. Norouzi did not oppose the Government\u2019s motion to pretermit his asylum application, and Sardari-Amidabadi abandoned her asylum claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
