Colley argues that the district court\u2019s order denying him a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction is too ambiguous to allow for meaningful appellate review. Specifically, Colley argues that the language of the district court\u2019s order could mean the court found that (1) it lacked discretion to reduce his sentence, because Colley was unqualified, or, alternatively, (2) it did have discretion to reduce his sentence, but chose not to do so. Colley notes these two interpretations are subject to different standards of review, and that we cannot meaningfully review the order, because the district court\u2019s reasoning is not clear. However, \u201cwe may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any grounds supported in the record,\u201d <em>Koziara v. City of Casselberry, </em>392 F.3d 1302, 1306 n. 2 (11th Cir.2004), and we do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). Once eligibility under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) has been established, we review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL \u00a7 1B1.10 (2008), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL \u00a7 1B1.10 (a)(1) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Amendment 706, which reduced by two levels the \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) offense levels in crack cocaine cases, became effective November 1, 2008, by incorporation into \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL app. C, amend. 713 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">We recently addressed the exact issue presented in this case in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). In <em>Williams, </em>we rejected the argument that the statutory mandatory minimum sentence becomes the \u201cguideline sentence\u201d but leaves the \u201cguideline range\u201d unaffected. <em>Id. </em>at 1341. We held that because \u201cthe statutorily required minimum sentence effectively displaces the shorter sentence and becomes the guideline sentence for that individual,\u201d Amendment 706 does not apply, because \u201cthe court\u2019s point of departure [for purposes of applying the \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure] [does] not shift as a result of the amendment\u2019s lowering of the crack offense levels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The facts of this case are almost identical to those of <em>Williams. </em>Like the petitioner in <em>Williams, </em>Colley pled guilty to a crack cocaine offense and received a statutorily required minimum sentence that was above the guideline range for his offense because he was a repeat offender. Colley received a sentence below the statutory minimum because he had provided substantial assistance to the government, as did the petitioner in <em>Williams. </em>Both Col-ley and the petitioner in <em>Williams </em>argued that the statutorily required minimum sentence was the \u201cguideline sentence\u201d and not the \u201cguideline range\u201d and therefore Amendment 706 reduced the \u201cguideline range.\u201d As we stated in <em>Williams, </em>however, \u201c[f]or those situations in which the mandatory minimum exceeds the range for the entire offense level, the \u2018guideline sentence\u2019 would thus be the same as the \u2018guideline range,\u2019 even if it involves a \u2018range\u2019 of only one number.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Because Colley\u2019s guideline range was the statutorily required minimum sentence, it was not reduced by Amendment 706, and he was therefore ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Consequently, the district court could not have found that Colley was statutorily qualified but unworthy of a reduction. Thus, regardless of how the district court\u2019s order is interpreted, the district court did not err when it denied Colley\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
