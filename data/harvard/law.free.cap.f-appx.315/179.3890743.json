We consider these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Section 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) provides that a sentencing court may increase the base offense level for bank fraud by two levels if \u201cthe offense otherwise involved sophisticated means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The term \u201cthe defendant\u201d applies to the defendant himself and not his co-conspirator. <em>United States v. Mating, </em>267 F.3d 1113, 1119 (11th Cir.2001). In contrast, the term \u201cthe offense\u201d focuses \u201con the offense, which includes the activities of co-conspirators for which the defendant is held responsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court properly increased appellant\u2019s base offense level based on the sophisticated means of the conspiracy as a whole, and not his individual actions within the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">Appellant argues that \u00a7 3B1.3 does not apply to ordinary bank tellers such as himself. Section 3B1.3 provides for a two-level enhancement of the base offense level \u201cif the defendant abused a position of public or private trust ... in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Guidelines application note one states that the \u201cadjustment does not apply in the ease of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3B1.3, comment, (n. 1). However, application note two states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">Notwithstanding Application Note 1, or any other provision of this guideline, an adjustment under this guideline shall apply to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">(B) A defendant who exceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position in order to obtain unlawfully, or use without authority, any means of identification. \u201cMeans of identification\u201d has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-16\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3B1.3, comment. (n.2(B)). \u201cMeans of identification\u201d is \u201cany name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual\u201d including, among other things, name, social security number, and date of birth. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-17\">Notwithstanding his job title, appellant was subject to application note two be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>cause he used his position as a bank employee to obtain, without authority, the names, birth dates, and social security numbers of several customers to facilitate bank fraud. In sum, the court properly applied the abuse-of-position-of-trust enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Appellant argues that, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, his low-end of the Guidelines\u2019 sentence is unreasonable because the sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We review the sentencing process for both procedural error and substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). A sentence is the product of procedural error if the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>A sentence is substantively unreasonable if the court abused is discretion in fashioning it.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Section \u00a7 3553(a) requires the sentencing court to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d namely, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">In this case, the district court committed no procedural error because it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors throughout the sentencing hearing. The court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence at the low-end of the Guidelines sentence range after noting the seriousness of the crime and the need for general deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-10\">. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1344. Appellant, a bank employee, had used his position to obtain names, birth dates, and social security numbers of several of the bank\u2019s customers in order to facilitate a bank fraud conspiracy that included a network of approximately 90 individuals and several financial institutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
