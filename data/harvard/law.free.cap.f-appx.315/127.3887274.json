After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">A four-count information charged Jackson, a former Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) agent, with willfully failing to make an income tax return for each of the four years from 2000 through 2003, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. Each count alleged Jackson had the obligation to make an income tax return \u201cas required by Title 26, United States Code, and by regulations made under the authority thereof.\u201d The information alleged Jackson had gross income in excess of (1) $12,950 in 2000 (Count 1); (2) $13,400 in 2001 (Count 2); (3) $13,850 in 2002 (Count 3); and (4) $15,600 in 2003 (Count 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">At trial, Jackson testified, <em>inter alia, </em>she did not file income tax returns for those four years because, based on her research of the revenue code and regulations, she did not believe she was required to do so. The jury convicted Jackson on all counts. Counsel represented Jackson at trial, but, prior to sentencing, Jackson discharged her attorney and elected to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-17\">Prior to sentencing, Jackson filed a series of <em>pro se </em>motions arguing that her information should have been dismissed because: (1) the IRS Form 1040 did not comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act (\u201cPRA\u201d); (2) the information violated her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; and (3) \u00a7 7203 was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. Jackson also argued that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4083 prohibited the district court from sentencing her to any facility that housed felons because she was convicted of misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-18\">The district court denied Jackson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motions and sentenced Jackson to four consecutive 12-month sentences, for a total of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by one year of supervised release on each count, to be served concurrently. Jackson timely filed this <em>pro se </em>appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-19\">As a threshold matter, we reject as wholly meritless Jackson\u2019s argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over her prosecution. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over all offenses against the laws of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231; <em>see also United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>States v. Evans, </em>717 F.2d 1334, 1334 (11th Cir.1983) (stating that it is frivolous to argue that a district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over \u00a7 7203 offenses). Also, we summarily reject Jackson\u2019s claim that there is no case or controversy presented here under Article III and that, because the United States is the named party, the United States Attorney lacked standing to file an information. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 547 (stating that the United States Attorney for each district is responsible for prosecuting crimes against the United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We also reject Jackson\u2019s argument that her information failed to allege a \u00a7 7203 offense because it alleged in the conjunctive that she was required to make a federal tax return under Title 26 \u201cand by regulations made under the authority thereof\u2019 and did not specifically reference \u00a7 6012, the section requiring her to file a tax return.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 7203 makes it a misdemeanor for an individual to not file a tax return when she is \u201crequired by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When a statute lists multiple ways in which it can be violated, the information may charge the acts conjunctively, but the government has to establish only that the defendant violated one of the proscribed acts. <em>United States v. Cornillie, </em>92 F.3d 1108, 1110 (11th Cir.1996). Furthermore, an information charging a defendant with willful failure to file an income tax return pursuant to \u00a7 7203 does not have to mention \u00a7 6012, as an information is sufficient when it alleges that the defendant earned enough to require her to file a return and she willfully failed to do so. <em>United States v. Kahl, </em>583 F.2d 1351, 1355 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">Jackson\u2019s argument that Counts 1 through 3 were barred by the three-year statute of limitations in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6531 is also unavailing. The six-year limitations period in \u00a7 6531(4), and not the general three-year limitations period, applies to the \u00a7 7203 offense of willful failure to file a tax return. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>843 F.2d 438, 443 (11th Cir.1988). In any event, Jackson waived her right to assert this defense when she failed to raise it in a pretrial motion. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>324 F.3d 1225, 1228-29 (11th Cir.2003); Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Likewise, the district court did not err in denying Jackson\u2019s motion to dismiss her information on Fifth Amendment grounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A defendant cannot defend a charge of willful failure to file a tax return by asserting that she was exercising her privilege against self-incrimination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Stubbs v. Comm\u2019r, </em>797 F.2d 936, 938 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also United States v. Sullivan, </em>274 U.S. 259, 263-64, 47 S.Ct. 607, 607-08, 71 L.Ed. 1037 (1927) (stating that an individual wishing to assert a Fifth Amendment privilege with regard to filing a tax return should do so on the return).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, charging Jackson by information did not violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s grand jury requirement even though the district court imposed four consecutive one-year terms of imprisonment. <em>See Kahl, </em>583 F.2d at 1355 (concluding that \u00a7 7203 can be charged in an information, even if the defendant is sentenced to multiple one-year terms of imprisonment, as \u00a7 7203 is not an \u201cinfamous crime\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Jackson also argues that the information against her should have been dismissed because the IRS Form 1040 does not comply with the PRA. The PRA provides that an individual shall not be punished for failing to collect information if the agency\u2019s eollection-of-information request did not have a valid OMB control number. 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3512(a)(1), (2). Jackson does not dispute that IRS Form 1040 contains a valid OMB control number. Instead, she argues that IRS Form 1040 fails to comply with the PRA because it does not contain the information listed in \u00a7 3506(c)(1)(B). In \u00a7 3506(c)(1)(B), the PRA requires every agency to establish a process to evaluate whether proposed requests for information includes, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) an expiration date, (2) information on why the questions were being asked or how the answers would be used, (3) a statement indicating whether the questions were voluntary or mandatory, and (4) a statement that the individual is not required to provide answers if the control number is not valid. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3506(c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">However, we need not address the requirements in \u00a7 3506(c)(1)(B) because the PRA did not prevent Jackson from being prosecuted for failing to file tax returns in any event. <em>See United States v. Neff, </em>954 F.2d 698, 699-700 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cCongress created [the taxpayer\u2019s] duty to file the Returns in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6012(a), and.... Congress did not enact the PRA\u2019s public protection provision to allow OMB to abrogate any duty imposed by Congress.\u201d) (addressing 1980 version of the PRA); <em>see also United States v. Patridge, </em>507 F.3d 1092, 1094-95 (7th Cir.2007) (addressing PRA after 1995 amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Jackson contends that the PRA barred her prosecution because the government elected to pursue a theory that she violated \u201cregulations,\u201d which she contends remain subject to the PRA, by pleading her offenses in the conjunctive in her information. As already discussed, the government had to prove only that Jackson violated \u00a7 7203, not any additional regulation, regardless of the government\u2019s use of conjunctive phrasing in the information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Jackson\u2019s motion to dismiss her information based on the PRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Finally, Jackson seeks to challenge her confinement at Federal Correctional Institution Coleman, arguing that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4083 prohibits her from being housed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>there. The Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d), not the district court, determines where a prisoner is housed once the sentence is imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b) (providing that the BOP designates the prisoner\u2019s place of imprisonment). Because Jackson\u2019s argument does not challenge her conviction or sentence, this claim is not properly before this Court on direct appeal of her criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">. Because Jackson raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gresham, </em>325 F.3d 1262, 1265 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">. Section 7203 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">Any person ... required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return ... who willfully fails to ... make such return ... at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be find not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-15\">. We have adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit decided on or before September 30, 1981. <em>See Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b151-16\">. We review the denial of a motion to dismiss an information for abuse of discretion and review <em>de novo </em>related questions of law. <em>United States v. Noriega, </em>117 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\">. The district court also did not err, plainly or otherwise, by not holding an <em>in camera </em>hearing on Jackson's Fifth Amendment claim. <em>See United States v. Vance, </em>730 F.2d 736, 737 (11th Cir.1984) (concluding that a defendant charged widi willful failure to file a tax return is not entitled to an <em>in camera </em>hearing to address a Fifth Amendment claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">. The cases cited by Jackson in support of her PRA argument are distinguishable because they do not involve \u00a7 7203 convictions. Furthermore, the language Jackson relies upon in these cases is dicta.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
