On appeal, Masters contends the district court erred by enhancing his offense level by three levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) because he never managed, supervised, or exercised control over anyone involved in the conspiracy. Masters also claims U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1 is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause because it treats United States citizens more harshly than aliens who commit the same offense, without justification. After a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">I. AGGRAVATING ROLE ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Njau, </em>386 F.3d 1039, 1041 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[T]he ultimate determination of role in the offense is ... a fundamentally factual determination entitled to due deference.... \u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc) (addressing a role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThe findings of fact of the sentencing court may be based on evidence heard during trial, facts admitted by a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, undisputed statements in the presentence report, or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Section 3Bl.l(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides, \u201cIf the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 3 levels.\u201d The commentary elaborates, \u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). A \u201cparticipant\u201d is \u201ca person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">The district court did not clearly err in enhancing Masters\u2019 base offense level based on his role as a manager or supervisor under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). Masters does not dispute the fact that the fraudulent marriage conspiracy involved five or more participants, and the record supports the conclusion he managed or supervised at least one participant. Masters concedes he recruited at least three individuals to join the conspiracy. He paid the individuals he brought into the conspiracy with money he received from Natalia Humm. Masters also drove participants to the courthouse, where they would obtain their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>marriage licenses, and back to Humm\u2019s office to get married. The record supports the finding that Masters informed those he recruited about the process of entering a fraudulent marriage and how to get paid for doing it, and Masters was paid for his recruitment activities. Because Masters recruited individuals into the conspiracy, described the process to them, paid them for their participation, helped facilitate their commission of the offense, and was paid for his role in the conspiracy, the district court could find he managed or supervised at least one participant in the conspiracy. Thus, the court did not clearly err in assessing a role enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">II. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a provision of the Sentencing Guidelines is constitutional. <em>United States v. Pressley, </em>345 F.3d 1205, 1209 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Under \u00a7 2L2.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, a United States citizen convicted of \u201cFraudulent Marriage to Assist Alien to Evade Immigration Law\u201d shall have a base offense level of 11. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(a). The base offense level is to be decreased by three \u201c[i]f the offense was committed other than for profit .... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(l). Section 2L2.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides an alien convicted of \u201cFraudulent Marriage by Alien to Evade Immigration Law\u201d shall have a base offense level of 8. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\u201c[Congressional classifications based on alienage are subject to rational basis review.\u201d <em>United States v. Ferreira, </em>275 F.3d 1020, 1025 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis omitted). \u201cCongress can pass laws regulating the conduct of non-citizens within the United States, and those laws do not violate equal protection so long as they are rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have applied the rational basis test to a challenge that a provision of the Sentencing Guidelines violated the Equal Protection Clause when it treated individuals differently based on their alien-age. <em>United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1160-61 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">We apply a two-step process to determine whether the rational basis standard is met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">The first step in determining whether legislation survives rational-basis scrutiny is identifying a legitimate government purpose \u2014 a goal \u2014 which the enacting government body <em>could </em>have been pursuing. The <em>actual </em>motivations of the enacting governmental body are entirely irrelevant.... The second step of rational-basis scrutiny asks whether a rational basis exists for the enacting governmental body to believe that the legislation would further the hypothesized purpose. The proper inquiry is concerned with the <em>existence </em>of a conceivably rational basis, not whether that basis was actually considered by the legislative body. As long as reasons for the legislative classification may have been considered to be true, and the relationship between the classification and the goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, the legislation survives rational-basis scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-12\"><em>Ferreira, </em>275 F.3d at 1026 (quotation omitted) (emphasis in original). Under rational basis review, \u201ca legislative choice is not subject to courtroom fact-finding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.\u201d <em>F.C.C. v. Beach Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 307, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 2102, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993). \u201c[T]hose attacking the rationality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>of the legislative classification have the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Masters has not shown U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1 to be unconstitutional. Instead of negating every potential reason the Sentencing Commission could have had for treating United States citizens and aliens differently in \u00a7\u00a7 2L2.1 and 2L2.2, Masters actually suggests a rational basis for the different treatment: the Commission could have concluded some United States citizens convicted of helping aliens evade immigration law by committing marriage fraud deserved harsher punishment than the aliens involved, since these citizens were seeking to make money by \u201ctaking advantage of someone\u2019s desperation.\u201d Indeed, this hypothetical justification is supported by the Guidelines themselves: U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(l) provides for a three-level reduction if the citizen\u2019s \u201coffense was committed other than for profit,\u201d which operates to equalize a citizen\u2019s offense level with that of an alien when the citizen lacks a profit motivation. Masters\u2019 hypothetical justification and the Guidelines themselves show the Sentencing Commission rationally could have concluded a United States citizen who engaged in immigration marriage fraud to make money was more culpable and deserving of greater punishment than an alien who was merely seeking to live and work in the United States. Thus, Masters has failed to meet his burden of showing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1 is unconstitutional, since he has not demonstrated it lacks a rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
