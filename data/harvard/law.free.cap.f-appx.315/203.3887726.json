For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Bateman pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, and the district court imposed the statutory mandatory minimum of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(iii). Bateman submitted a <em>pro se </em>motion for modification of sentence, arguing that Amendments 706 and 711 to the Sentencing Guidelines altered the calculation of his guideline imprisonment range for his crack-cocaine offense. The district court denied the motion, reasoning that Amendment 706 did not merit a reduction to Bateman\u2019s sentence because he was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On appeal, with the assistance of counsel, Bateman argues that the district court plainly erred in denying his motion because his sentence was unconstitutional for violating his due process and equal protection rights. Bateman asserts that the crack/powder ratio, and associated statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums, are not related to a legitimate state interest, as the Supreme Court recently recognized in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Bate-man also argues that the crack/powder ratio, and associated statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums, disproportionately affect African-Americans like himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to reduce a sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, when a defendant fails to raise an error in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Under plain error review, we may take action if there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce an already-incarcerated defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant\u2019s sentence was determined using a guideline imprisonment range that subsequent retroactive amendments to the Guidelines have reduced and if the district court has considered the applicable factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and determined that a reduction would be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 instructs that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized when \u201can amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>see also Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1328 (holding that, while Amendment 706 was applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ble to the defendants in question because it reduced their base offense levels, a reduction was not authorized because the amendment did not have the effect of lowering their applicable guideline ranges because of the application of the career offender guideline). In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in determining to what extent to vary from the guidelines based on a disagreement with the crack/powder ratio, the district court remains \u201cconstrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums Congress prescribed.\u201d 552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">We have held that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not permit the district to consider the defendant\u2019s sentence <em>de novo </em>and that \u201c[a]ll original sentencing determinations [must] remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 (quotation omitted). Indeed, we have held that constitutional challenges to a defendant\u2019s sentence are the sort of \u201cextraneous\u201d issues that are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and instead must be pursued by way of habeas petitions. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781-82 (upholding a district court\u2019s finding that it had no jurisdiction in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding to consider the defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The district court did not err, plain or otherwise, in denying Bateman\u2019s motion. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 759 n. 3; <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. When confronted with a motion for modification of sentence, the district court only may analyze whether the sentence was determined using a guideline imprisonment range that a subsequent retroactive amendment has reduced. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-81. Bateman does not argue on appeal that the district court erred in conducting this analysis, and the record otherwise does not reveal such an error. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); Moore, 541 F.3d at 1328. The district court is not permitted to analyze whether the sentence was unconstitutional. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220; <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781-82. Accordingly, the district court did not err in failing to do so, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. As a preliminary matter, the district court had, and we have, subject matter jurisdiction over Bateman\u2019s motion for modification of sentence. Although Bateman filed the motion before Amendment 706 became retroactively applicable on March 3, 2008, the district court ruled on the motion after this date. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the district court and this Court had subject matter jurisdiction over the defendant's motion for modification of sentence based on Amendment 706, even though the defendant filed the motion before March 3, 2008, because the district court ruled on the motion after that date).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
