Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 760.01-760.11, as well as her claims of retaliation in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), the FCRA, and the Florida Whistleblower Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 448.101 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After careful consideration of the entire record, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to Lockett. USCR employed Lockett at the Clarion Hotel in Tampa, Florida from August 2005 until 22 August 2006. Rl-2 at 2; Rl-24 at 113. Lockett first met Eric Watson when he began working at the hotel caf\u00e9 with her. Rl-24 at 27. Watson acted politely and cordially during this time, and they had a friendly relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28, 58. After Lockett transferred to the reservations department in April 2006, Watson began making sexual comments to her when she visited the caf\u00e9 during her breaks. <em>Id. </em>at 28-31, 66-67. For instance, Watson would talk about sexual positions, that he would lick her \u201cp-u-s-s-y\u201d, that \u201che would go down on [her] good,\u201d that her boyfriend \u201cain\u2019t F\u2019ing [her] right,\u201d and that she needed \u201cto get with a real guy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33-34. Watson also stuck out his tongue two or three times. <em>Id. </em>at 115. As a result, Lockett stopped going to the caf\u00e9 for about three weeks. <em>Id. </em>at 36. WTien she returned to the caf\u00e9, Watson wanted to hug her but she refused. <em>Id. </em>at 38. Lock-ett testified that on another occasion Watson touched her bottom quickly. <em>Id. </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-19\">Lockett initially complained to Flavian Gomez (\u201cGomez\u201d), the caf\u00e9 manager and Watson\u2019s supervisor. <em>Id. </em>at 34, 40. Gomez told Lockett that he spoke to Watson but Watson\u2019s behavior continued. <em>Id. </em>at 40. Sometime in August 2006, Lockett reported Watson to her supervisor\u2019s manager, Debbie Mangual (\u201cMangual\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 19, 41, 70. Mangual informed Gomez of Lock-ett\u2019s complaints and Gomez indicated he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>would speak with Watson. Rl-30, Exh. 2 at 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Several weeks later, Lockett told Man-gual that Watson was still acting inappropriately. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15,18; Rl-24 at 45-46. Mangual immediately notified the human resources liason, Jacqueline Gregory (\u201cGregory\u201d). Rl-25 at 4, 26, 31-32. That same day, Gregory met with Lockett to discuss Watson\u2019s behavior. Rl-24 at 46. Afterwards, a meeting occurred involving Gregory, Watson, Mangual and Lockett. <em>Id. </em>at 48. According to Lockett, Watson \u201cadmitted to everything\u201d and also attacked her character, calling her a \u201cho\u201d and a \u201cbitch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48 \u2014 19. At one point, Lock-ett said Watson \u201cjumped in my face and acted like he was going to hit me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. Lockett responded to Watson, \u201cI have a boyfriend for you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. The meeting ended shortly thereafter. <em>Id. </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Watson then returned to the front desk and made derogatory comments about Lockett as well as divulged personal information about her sex life. <em>Id. </em>at 54-55; Rl-30, Exh. 2 at 28-31. After Mangual informed Watson\u2019s supervisor, Gomez, about Watson\u2019s statements at the meeting and the front desk, Gomez terminated Watson. Rl-30, Exh. 2 at 31. Mangual also told Lockett that she was termin\u00e1ting her for threatening Watson. <em>Id. </em>at 10-12, 31; Rl-24 at 56; Rl-25 at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">USCR has a written policy forbidding sexual harassment in the workplace, which instructs employees to notify their supervisor promptly after any incident of sexual harassment. Rl-27 at 10-11. In addition, USCR\u2019s policy prohibits \u201cthreats of violence\u201d and \u201cdisorderly conduct and obscene and/or abusive language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. Similarly, an employee may be discharged for \u201coffensive or threatening conduct or language\u201d towards fellow employees. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. Lockett admitted that she read and understood this document before signing it. Rl-24 at 70,110-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of USCR on all counts of Lockett\u2019s complaint. Rl-32 at 12. With respect to Lockett\u2019s sexual harassment claims under Title VII and the FRCA, the district court found that Lock-ett failed to produce sufficient evidence of a hostile work environment because the only subjective evidence was her avoidance of the caf\u00e9 for three weeks, after which she resumed her visits. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. From an objective standpoint, the court found that Watson\u2019s comments, although offensive, were not severe, physically threatening, or humiliating. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Additionally, the court noted that Watson\u2019s conduct in the caf\u00e9 never interfered with Lockett\u2019s job performance in the reservations area. <em>Id. </em>The district court further concluded that USCR appropriately and promptly responded to Lockett\u2019s complaint, which precluded liability for Watson\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">As for Lockett\u2019s retaliation and whistle-blower claims, the court found that the undisputed evidence showed that USCR legitimately terminated Lockett based on its belief that Lockett had threatened Watson. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. Further, the court found no contrary evidence showing that USCR\u2019s proffered reason for termination was a pretext for a retaliatory decision. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment on Lockett\u2019s claims for retaliation and whistleblower act violations. <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">Lockett now appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to all of her claims. She contends that Watson\u2019s harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile working environment because it occurred almost daily for several months and was demeaning, offensive and humiliating. Lockett further ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>gues that USCR\u2019s response to her reports of sexual harassment were ineffective and inappropriate. With respect to her claims of retaliation, Lockett hypothesizes that Mangual\u2019s true reason for firing her was that Mangual\u2019s mishandling of her harassment claims made Mangual look like a poor manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all evidence in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor. <em>See Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., </em>525 F.3d 1139, 1143 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, discovery materials, and any affidavits \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">A. <em>Sexual Harassment Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Both Title VII and the FRCA prohibit employers from discriminating \u201cagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10(l)(a). Because the FCRA is patterned after Title VII, courts generally apply Title VII case law to discrimination claims brought under the FCRA. <em>See Wilbur v. Corr. Servs. Corp., </em>393 F.3d 1192, 1195 n. 1 (11th Cir.2004). Accordingly, like the district court, we will not independently analyze Lockett\u2019s FRCA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">An employer violates Title VII when it creates \u201ca hostile work environment caused by sexual harassment that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of work.\u201d <em>Reeves, </em>525 F.3d at 1143 (quotation marks and citation omitted). To establish sexual harassment under Title VII, Lockett must show that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-11\">(1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she has been subject to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her membership in a protected group; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment; and (5) a basis for holding the employer liable exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-13\"><em>Id. </em>Here, only the fourth and fifth elements are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">1. Severity or Pervasiveness</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">In relation to the fourth element, Title VII does not serve as a \u201cgeneral civility code.\u201d <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 2283-84, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[Sjimple teasing ... offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious)\u201d do not constitute a hostile work environment. <em>Id. </em>at 788, 118 S.Ct. at 2283 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Instead, this element is only satisfied \u201c \u2018[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reeves, </em>525 F.3d at 1145 (quoting <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-18\">A court must first consider whether the plaintiff subjectively perceived the harassment to be severe or pervasive. <em>See Id. </em>The court next determines whether that perception is objectively reasonable. <em>See Id. </em>This requires the court to view all the circumstances, not just isolated acts. <em>See Id. </em>Relevant factors for consideration include \u201c(1) the frequency of the [discriminatory] conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s job performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1145-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Watson\u2019s alleged harassment did not create a hostile working environment. With respect to Lockett\u2019s subjective beliefs, she admitted in her deposition that she and Watson had a friendly relationship. Rl-24 at 57-58. Lockett\u2019s direct supervisor, Geneva Williams, testified that Lockett never complained to her about Watson until the day she was fired. Rl-26 at 25. Furthermore, during the alleged period of harassment, Lockett only stopped using the caf\u00e9 for three weeks and she never sought medical treatment or counseling because of Watson\u2019s behavior. Rl-24 at 36, 71. It was only after her termination that Lock-ett talked with a counselor because she did not think she deserved to be fired, not because she was disturbed by Watson\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 71, 117-18. Although concrete psychological harm is not required, \u201c[t]he effect on the employee\u2019s psychological well-being is, of course, relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371. This evidence does not support a subjective belief that Watson\u2019s conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a hostile working-environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Even assuming Lockett believed the alleged harassment created an abusive workplace, this perception would not be objectively reasonable. As for the first <em>Harris </em>factor, frequency of the harassing conduct, Lockett testified that Watson harassed her every time she visited the caf\u00e9 from April through 19 August 2006, excluding a three-week period when she chose not to go there. Rl-24 at 31, 66-67. Lockett did not specify how many times she was at the caf\u00e9 although she stated she generally ate her lunch there and sometimes took her shorter breaks there as well. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27. Drawing all inferences in Lockett\u2019s favor, the alleged harassment occurred for approximately four months. This is far shorter than the three years of daily harassing conduct which we found to be frequent in <em>Reeves. See Reeves, </em>525 F.3d at 1146; but <em>see Lauderdale v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice Inst\u2019l Div., </em>512 F.3d 157, 164 (5th Cir.2007) (concluding that ten to fifteen nightly phone calls for nearly four months from the plaintiffs supervisor amounted to pervasive harassment).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">To the extent that Watson\u2019s conduct was frequent, this \u201cdoes not compensate for the absence of the other factors.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). We agree with the district court that Watson\u2019s alleged conduct was offensive but \u201c[did] not rise to the level of being severe, physically threatening, or humiliating.\u201d Rl-32 at 7. Lock-ett does not argue that Watson\u2019s conduct was physically threatening but she contends that his comments were severe and humiliating. However, the alleged sexual remarks and two incidents of brief touching fall below the minimum level of severity or humiliation needed to establish sexual harassment. <em>See Mendoza, </em>195 F.3d at 1246-47 (collecting cases setting standards for a Title VII sexual harassment violation). Thus, the second and third factors have not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">As for the fourth <em>Harris </em>factor, there is no evidence that Watson\u2019s conduct unreasonably interfered with Lockett\u2019s work performance. An abusive work environment can \u201cdetract from employees\u2019 job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 371. None of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>elements are present here. Lockett admitted that Watson\u2019s conduct did not affect her work, that she felt she should not have been fired because she was a good worker, and that she received at least one pay raise during the time the harassment allegedly occurred. Rl-24 at 106-107, 117-18. Lockett\u2019s direct supervisor, Geneva Williams, concurred that Lockett did a \u201cgood job.\u201d Rl-26 at 8. Although a Title VII violation does not require that Lock-ett\u2019s job performance be tangibly affected, there is no evidence that Lockett\u2019s work performance suffered in any way whatsoever. <em>Compare Reeves, </em>525 F.3d at 1147 (concluding that Reeves\u2019 job performance was affected because she had difficulty concentrating on her work and she often took time away from her work to deal with her co-workers\u2019 offensive conduct). The only change in Lockett\u2019s working conditions stemmed from her decision not to eat at the caf\u00e9 for three weeks. When viewed in context, this does not constitute unreasonable interference with Lockett\u2019s job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">In sum, we conclude that under the totality of the circumstances, there is no genuine factual issue that Watson\u2019s conduct was not severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile working environment. Accordingly, USCR was entitled to summary judgment on Lockett\u2019s claims of sexual harassment under Title VII and the FRCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">2. Employer Liability</p>\n<p id=\"As1\">Summary judgment was also warranted based on the absence of employer liability in this case, which is the fifth and final requirement of a Title VII violation. <em>See Reeves, </em>525 F.3d at 1143. Where the alleged sexual harassment is committed by a co-worker, as here, the employer is liable \u201cif it knew or should have known of the harassing conduct but failed to take prompt remedial action.\u201d <em>Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1278 (11th Cir.2002). Lockett submits that USCR\u2019s management did not take prompt remedial action but instead made the situation worse. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">First, Lockett contends that her complaint to Gomez, Watson\u2019s supervisor, brought no change. There is no evidence in the record as to how Gomez responded because Lockett did not file Gomez\u2019s deposition transcript with the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our review is limited to the evidence which the district court considered when it decided the motion for summary judgment. <em>See Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). We therefore have no basis upon which to judge Gomez\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Next, Lockett faults Mangual for not taking her complaint seriously or initially referring her to human resources. However, Jacqueline Gregory, the human resources officer, testified that she expected managers to try to resolve any problems before contacting her. Rl-25 at 40. This is exactly what Mangual did by informing Watson\u2019s supervisor of Lockett\u2019s complaint. Nevertheless, Lockett asserts that this worsened the situation because Watson became angry when he heard about Lockett\u2019s complaints and Gomez allegedly gave Watson permission to confront her. Again, we cannot review Gomez\u2019s alleged statements to Watson due to the absence of his deposition transcript. The record reflects that Lockett never testified that Watson appeared angry or confronted her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>after she reported him to Mangual. Additionally, Mangual stated that two days after Lockett reported the harassment to her, Mangual saw Lockett and Watson talking and laughing with each other in the caf\u00e9. Rl-30, Exh. 2 at 20-22. Mangual thus reasonably believed that the situation had been resolved. After Lockett reported to her several weeks later that Watson was still harassing her, Mangual immediately called the human resources officer to look into the matter. Accordingly, Lockett has failed to show that either Mangual or Gomez\u2019s actions were inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Finally, Lockett takes issue with the meeting in Gregory\u2019s office that included herself, Watson, Mangual, and Gregory. Lockett contends that Gregory was untrained and inexperienced in sexual harassment matters and should not have put her in the same room with Watson. Mangual testified that the purpose of the meeting was to \u201cfind out exactly what was going on\u201d because Lockett and Watson\u2019s behavior indicated they were friends. <em>Id. </em>at 41-42. The district court correctly concluded that the meeting was appropriate to investigate Lockett\u2019s allegations. Furthermore, USCR terminated Watson shortly after the meeting. \u201c[W]here the substantive measures taken by the employer are sufficient to address the harassing behavior, complaints about the process under which those measures are adopted ring hollow.\u201d <em>Walton v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Servs., Inc., </em>347 F.3d 1272, 1288 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Accordingly, we agree with the district court that there is no genuine issue of material fact that USCR took prompt remedial action and was therefore not liable for Watson\u2019s alleged harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on Lockett\u2019s claims for sexual harassment under Title VII and the FRCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">B. <em>Retaliation Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">We turn now to Lockett\u2019s retaliation claims under Title VII, the FRCA, and the Florida Whistleblower Act that she was fired because she complained about Watson\u2019s sexual harassment. The law governing Title VII retaliation claims applies to similar charges under the FCRA and Florida Whistleblower Act. <em>See Harper v. Blockbuster Entm\u2019t Corp., </em>139 F.3d 1385, 1389-90 (11th Cir.1998); <em>Sierminski v. Transouth Fin. Corp., </em>216 F.3d 945, 950 (11th Cir.2000) (Florida Whistleblower Act case). Under Title VII, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for opposing an unlawful practice or engaging in protected conduct, including complaining about gender discrimination. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Even though Lockett cannot prevail on her underlying discrimination claim, she may still establish a Title VII violation if she shows that her employer retaliated against her for complaining about Watson\u2019s putative sexual harassment. <em>See Sullivan v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>170 F.3d 1056, 1059 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Once a Title VII plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, the employer must proffer a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged action. <em>See Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2007). If the employer does so, the plaintiff must rebut that reason with evidence showing that it is a pretext for illegal discrimination. <em>See Id. </em>This requires \u201csignificant probative evidence\u201d of pretext, not mere conclusory allegations. <em>Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, the focus is on the employer\u2019s beliefs rather than the employee\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>perceptions. <em>See Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">USCR does not contest that Lockett established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation and we will assume, without deciding, that Lockett has met her initial burden. USCR\u2019s articulated reason for firing Lock-ett was that she had threatened Watson in violation of company policy. This was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason based on Lockett\u2019s admission that she told Watson, \u201cI have a boyfriend for you.\u201d Rl-24 at 52. The burden therefore shifted to Lockett to rebut this reason with substantive evidence of pretext. <em>See Crawford, </em>482 F.3d at 1308. In her deposition, Lockett explained this statement was not intended as a threat but merely to let Watson know that \u201cif you want to hit somebody, you could hit my boyfriend.\u201d Rl-24 at 117. However, \u201cwhat counts is not what [Lockett] believed about her stated intent but what the decision maker at [USCR] believed.\u201d <em>Baldwin v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ala., </em>480 F.3d 1287, 1308 (11th Cir.2007). Here, the uncontro-verted evidence is that Mangual believed Lockett had threatened Watson and fired her because of that threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">On appeal, Lockett\u2019s sole argument of pretext is that Mangual was somehow attempting to camouflage her own mismanagement of Lockett\u2019s harassment complaints by firing Lockett. This argument is raised for the first time on appeal and \u201c[a]s a general rule, we will not address claims or arguments not fairly presented to the district court.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1032 (quotation marks and citation omitted). More importantly, this argument is purely speculative and unsubstantiated by any evidence. As such, it is insufficient proof that USCR\u2019s reason for Lockett\u2019s termination was pretextual. <em>See Mayfield, </em>101 F.3d at 1376. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on Lockett\u2019s federal and state claims of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">USCR was entitled to summary judgment on Lockett\u2019s claims of sexual harassment and retaliation under Title VII, the FRCA, and the Florida Whistleblower Act. Summary judgment was warranted on Lockett\u2019s sexual harassment claims because there was no genuine factual issue that her co-worker\u2019s conduct did not create a hostile working environment and that USCR responded to her complaints with prompt, remedial action. Furthermore, Lockett did not present sufficient evidence of pretext to rebut USCR\u2019s legitimate reason for terminating her. Her claims for retaliation therefore fail. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the summary judgment for USCR on all grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-14\">. Two other defendants, Choice Hotels International, Inc., d/b/a Clarion Hotel, and Advantage Employer Solutions, Inc., were dismissed with prejudice during the district court proceedings. Rl-19, 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. After Lockett filed her notice of appeal, she filed an unopposed motion to correct the record on appeal to include Gomez\u2019s deposition transcript. Rl-41. The district court denied Lockett\u2019s motion on grounds that it would not accurately reflect what occurred in the district court. Rl-42.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
