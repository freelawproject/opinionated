He also asserts that the district court failed to follow the required two-step analysis, which involves substituting the amended guideline range for the original guideline range and considering the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Sanders also argues that <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and because his sentence was reduced pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court should have treated the Guidelines as advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). Once eligibility under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) has been established, we review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, after considering applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtvO\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). However, a reduction in the term of imprisonment is not consistent with the Guidelines policy statement, and therefore not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if \u201c[a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that only retroactively applicable amendments \u201cthat have the effect of lowering the sentencing range upon which a sentence was based, may be considered for reduction of a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">Amendment 706, which reduced the \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) offense levels in crack cocaine cases, became effective November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C. Amend. 706. The Sentencing Commission made the Amendment retroactive as of March 3, 2007, by incorporating it into \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713. Prior to the amendment, base offense level 38 applied to drug offenses involving 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>See e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(1)(2006). As a result of the amendment, base offense level 38 now applies to an offense involving 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine, whereas level 36 applies to an offense involving at least 1.5 but fewer than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1), (2). Thus, although Amendment 706 reduced the offense levels in certain crack cocaine cases by two levels, the base offense level for sentences based on 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine remained unchanged. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence does not provide the basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3). A district court should leave intact its previous factual decisions from the sentencing hearing when deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997) (upholding district court\u2019s refusal in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding to re-examine drug quantity). In addition, because <em>Booker </em>is not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment, it is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions as an independent basis to reduce a sentence. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369 (holding that defendant was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706, because more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine were attributed to him, and he could not otherwise rely on <em>Booker </em>for a reduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Because Amendment 706 in fact did not reduce Sanders\u2019s guideline range, we conclude that Sanders was not entitled to any further reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, he was also not entitled to the benefit of <em>Booker. See Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369 (holding that <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions as an independent basis to reduce a sentence). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order refusing to grant Sanders a full two-level sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-9\">. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A3y\">. Despite correctly concluding that the Amendment did not apply to Sanders, the district court granted Sanders\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence from 340 months to 324 months. When a guideline amendment does not change a particular defendant's offense level or sentencing range, there is no basis for a reduction. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009). However, the Government has not cross-appealed this issue, and this Court seems precluded by recent Supreme Court precedent to correct this unappealed error to the detriment of the defendant. <em>See Greenlaw v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2559, 2569, 171 L.Ed.2d 399 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
