Moore argues that the administrative law judge failed to account for all his past relevant work and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>erred by finding that he had the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We review the decision of the administrative law judge \u201c\u2018to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Social Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997)). Substantial evidence consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Moore argues that the administrative law judge based his finding of no disability on Moore\u2019s light work as a head cashier and excluded his more strenuous responsibilities, but we disagree. The administrative law judge posed to the vocational expert various hypothetical questions that included Moore\u2019s restrictions and his job duties. Those questions took into account that Moore was not required to perform tasks classified as medium work. The administrative law judge formulated his questions based on Moore\u2019s testimony that, as head cashier, he was required to operate the cash register but had authority to assign other tasks, such as stocking coolers and mopping the floor, to other employees. <em>See Jackson v. Bowen, </em>801 F.2d 1291, 1293 (11th Cir.1986) (per cu-riam) (To establish a prima facie case of disability, the claimant must prove that he can no longer \u201cperform his past <em>kind </em>of work, not that he merely [is] unable to perform a specific job he held in the past.\u201d) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Substantial evidence supports the finding by the administrative law judge that Moore was not disabled. Moore complained of back injuries, gout, and alcohol abuse, but none of those conditions is a listed impairment. Moore failed to present any evidence of alcoholism. Medical reports established that Moore\u2019s gout was cured in 2001 and his back injuries substantially improved with medication and physical therapy. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929(c); <em>Watson v. Heckler, </em>738 F.2d 1169, 1172-73 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam). An independent physical examination and residual functional capacity assessment established that Moore was capable of light work. Moore\u2019s complaints were also inconsistent with his testimony that he drove his car and performed household chores such as laundry, sweeping his room, and making his bed. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929(c)(3)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">The denial of Moore\u2019s application for benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
