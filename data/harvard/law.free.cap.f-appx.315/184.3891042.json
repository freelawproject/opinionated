Prado contends that the record compels a finding that he was persecuted on account of his homosexuality, that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution, and that he is likely to be tortured if he returns to Argentina.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In this ease, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s determinations using the substantial evidence test, which requires us to uphold the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992));. \u201cTo reverse the [BIA\u2019s] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. at 815 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">To qualify for potential asylum in the United States, an alien must be a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-18\">[A]ny person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish \u201crefugee\u201d status, an alien must, with specific and credible evidence, show (1) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>he is outside of his country of nationality, (2) that he is unable or unwilling to return to that country, (3) this inability or unwillingness is due to \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution,\u201d and (4) that such persecution is \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a)-(b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Here, Prado contends that he was persecuted in Argentina because he is gay. Prado testified that he was not openly gay in Argentina, but his involvement in the political Peronista party, the fact that he lived in a small town, and his appearance made his sexuality known. Prado testified to the following occurrences: a series of threatening, harassing, and insulting notes and phone calls; an arrest on a child custody issue, during which police officers made rude sexual comments to him; once he was called a faggot and punched in the face; another time a policeman called him a faggot and hit him in the back with a nightclub; and finally, two men attempted to steal his motorcycle after calling him a faggot. Prado testified that all of this occurred between 1992 and 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The government concedes that being homosexual gives Prado \u201cmembership in a particular social group\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Prado also obviously left his native Argentina, came to the United States, and desires not to return. The government\u2019s argument is that the treatment Prado received in Argentina was not egregious enough to compel a finding of past persecution under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Not all \u201cexceptional treatment\u201d constitutes persecution. <em>Zheng v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006). We have held that persecution is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">First, the threatening phone calls and notes that Prado received were harassment, not persecution. Though Prado received death threats, such threats alone do not compel a finding of past persecution. <em>See Silva v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that a Colombian applicant failed to establish \u2018persecution,\u2019 though she had received a \u201ccondolence note\u201d from the FARC regarding her own death); <em>Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that \u201cmenacing phone calls and threats\u201d to an applicant and her family, combined with a bombing at her workplace, were not \u2018persecution.\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Nor did Prado\u2019s experiences with the local police amount to persecution. Prado testified that he was arrested once on an issue unrelated to his sexuality, and while in custody he was insulted and threatened based on his sexuality, but not physically abused. Another time, he was insulted and struck by a police officer outside a nightclub. Though the officers\u2019 behavior was demeaning and frightening, it was not severe enough to be called persecution. <em>See Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1290 (holding that a Chinese applicant was not persecuted, though he had been arrested, detained for five days and forced to stand in the sun and watch reeducation videos); <em>Djonda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that an applicant who had been detained for 36 hours and suffered a beating by the police, but without serious injury, had not been persecuted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Finally, Prado has not shown that being punched once in the street and nearly having his motorcycle stolen amount to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>persecution either. Ordinary criminal activity and acts of private violence are generally not \u2018persecution\u2019 within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 494 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201crandom street violence ... arbitrary hostility, or ... a desire to reap financial rewards [are] ordinary criminal activity [that] does not rise to the level of persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Accordingly, Prado has not demonstrated that the record compels a finding that he was persecuted in Argentina.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. An asylum applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (quotation omitted). Alternatively, an applicant can establish a well-founded fear of persecution by showing that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of persons similarly situated on account of the statutorily listed factor. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Prado has not shown a well-founded fear of future persecution. Prado failed to show that his prior mistreatment rose to the level of persecution \u2014 he was insulted often, but only physically struck three times in eight years \u2014 and has not provided evidence that his treatment would be any worse on his return to Argentina. Though he asserts that all Argentinians hate gays, Prado did not submit any documentation of generalized persecution, and the Country Report for Argentina does not indicate human rights violations against gays. <em>See Reyes-Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that State Department reports are \u201cperhaps the best resource\u201d for information about political situations in foreign nations). Further, Prado testified that because he was not openly gay in Argentina, his sexuality must have been evident to his harassers because he lived in a small town and because of his appearance. This suggests that Prado could take steps to reduce the risk of harassment by relocating within Argentina. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2) (\u201cAn applicant does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution if the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country ... if under all circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d). Finally, Prado testified that during his entire final year in Argentina, while he was saving money to travel to the United States, he was not harmed or harassed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">On this record, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Prado failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution in Argentina. Therefore Prado is not eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">Prado also seeks withholding of removal under both the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), and the CAT, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). To avoid removal under the INA, \u201c[a]n alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Because the evi-dentiary burden for withholding of removal is greater than that imposed for asylum, if an alien has not met the well-founded fear standard for asylum, he generally can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>not meet the standard for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. (\u201cBecause the Al Najjars failed to demonstrate a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d sufficient to support an asylum claim, the BIA properly found that the A Najjars were unable to satisfy the greater burden attending a request for withholding of removal.\u201d); <em>Nkacoang v. INS, </em>83 F.3d 353, 355 (11th Cir.1996) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Prado failed to make any argument in his appellate brief that this general rule is inapplicable to him; in fact, he failed to make any argument at all that he is entitled to withholding of removal under the statute. He therefore waived this issue entirely. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2 (\u201c[W]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">To avoid removal under the Convention Against Torture, \u201c[t]he burden of proof is on the applicant ... to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). As under the INA, this burden of proof for the applicant is higher than the burden imposed on an applicant for asylum. Therefore, an applicant like Prado, who cannot show that he has a well-founded fear of persecution, also cannot show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303; <em>Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1292; <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that where a petitioner fails to establish a claim for asylum on the merits, his claims for withholding of removal under the INA and CAT also necessarily fail).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determinations that Prado did not establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal under the INA or the CAT. The record does not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
