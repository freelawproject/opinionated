Dutton for reimbursement of Attorney Fees pursuant to \u00a7 593(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as Amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 <em>et seq. </em>(1987), and it appearing to the Court for the reasons more fully set forth in the Opinion filed contemporaneously herewith, that the motion is well taken, in part, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that the United States reimburse Robert C. Dutton for attorneys\u2019 fees he incurred during the investigation of Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh in the amount of $39,946.14 this 30th day of November, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">Opinion for the Special Court filed PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">PER CURIAM:</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">Robert C. Dutton, a retired Air Force Colonel, seeks reimbursement under section 593(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 <em>et seq. </em>(1987) (the \u201cAct\u201d), for attorneys\u2019 fees expended by him which he alleges \u201cwould not have been incurred but for the requirements of [the Act].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">The Dutton application arises out of an investigation undertaken by the Independent Counsel appointed by this Court on December 19, 1986. In an application filed December 11,1992, Dutton claims that as a result of that investigation he incurred counsel fees in the total amount of $105,219.80, which he claims to be reimbursable under the Act. Because the Court expected the Final Report of the Independent Counsel in that matter to be beneficial to the Court\u2019s determination of the propriety of the claimed attorneys\u2019 fees, the Court has delayed action on this petition until a time when the Court has been better advised in those premises. In the meantime, the Court has enlisted, and is grateful for, the advice of the Department of Justice. Although the Department does not have any familiarity with the details of the investigation and the prosecutions arising from it, by reason of the independence of the Counsel as contemplated and compelled by the Act, it has been able to assist the Court with matters not requiring factual familiarity with the investigation. Now having in hand all that we deem necessary to make an educated determination as to the propriety of the petition, we have proceeded by order of even date herewith to allow the same in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-13\">I. The Statutory Elements of Reimbursable Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-14\">A. Subject</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-15\">By its terms, the statute permits the reimbursement of fees only to \u201can individual who is the <em>subject </em>of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1) (emphasis added). The statute does not define \u201csubject,\u201d nor have we in prior eases given that term a definitive interpretation. Comments by the Department of Justice on that topic and portions of the application of Dutton give us some pause in applying -that part of the statute to Dutton\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-17\">First, the Department of Justice, noting as have we that the statute does not define \u201csubject,\u201d makes reference to the United States AttoRneys\u2019 Manual, Title 9, Chapter 11, Section 9-11.150, which defines \u201csubject\u201d for general prosecutorial purposes in the federal courts as follows: \u201ca \u2018subject\u2019 of an investigation is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury\u2019s investigation.\u201d We find this Manual definition more helpful than anything available in general'or legal dictionaries, as the word \u201csubject\u201d is' susceptible of so many different definitions that we might quote one from any dictionary of our choice to include or exclude nearly anyone in the vicinity of an investigation. As the Manual was compiled by experts in the field of federal prosecution for the guidance of professionals in that field, we conclude that the Court should make use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>that expertise, and we do in fact conclude that the Department of Justice definition of \u201csubject\u201d is useful to our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-3\">Unfortunately, accepting the Department\u2019s definition of \u201csubject\u201d as useful does not approach a final answer to our question. The Manual definition itself is susceptible of a broad range of further redefinition. Taken broadly, the conduct of any fact witness could be said to be within the scope of the grand jury\u2019s investigation. Taken most narrowly, one might say that only the specific target of the investigation will fall within the definition. Neither of these extremes is satisfactory. As to the first, we have previously held that the fee provisions of the Act apply to fees charged that \u201cwere reasonably related to a defense to such investigation.\u201d <em>In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d 1415, 1427 (D.C.Cir.1989); <em>In re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d 982, 993 (D.C.Cir.1989). Therefore, a status <em>of \u201cmere </em>witness\u201d is insufficient to confer upon one the brand of \u201csubject\u201d for purposes of the Act. Our determination to this effect is supported by the legislative history of the amendment to the Ethics in Government Act allowing for the fee reimbursement. The report of one house of the adopting Congress admonished that \u201creimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees [is] warranted, if at all, ih only rare instances ... and ... reimbursement should not become a routine event.\u201d S.Rep. No. 496, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 19, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3537, 3555. While obviously not a part of the enactment and therefore not binding upon us, this language of the Senate Report is so consistent with the apparent scheme of the Act and with our prior decisions that it reassures us of the correctness of our holding. The Department of Justice, candidly noting that it is not advised as to the underlying facts of the investigation, suggests that at least an inquiry is appropriate into Dutton\u2019s status in this regard, as Dutton\u2019s fee petition asserted that he \u201cnever was considered by the independent counsel to be anything but a potential witness.\u201d The Department suggests that this statement by the petitioner may constitute a disqualifying admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">While the suggestion' by the Department is worthy of consideration, with our more fulsome access to the underlying investigation, we do not find it dispositive. It may seem evident today (although access to the sealed Report of the Independent Counsel assures us that it is by no means certain) that Dutton was never regarded as a potential defendant, but that is hindsight. At the time that Dutton retained counsel and incurred the fees in his application, he knew what his conduct was and what the potential scope of the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation was. He knew that his conduct was within that scope, not merely in the sense of a witness who might be called upon to testify at the trials of others, but also as a person toward whom the Independent Counsel might reasonably be expected to point the finger of accusation. It is as of the time of incurring the fees that we must determine Dutton\u2019s status as a \u201csubject,\u201d not at the time of the close of the Report. Therefore, we conclude that the ultimate status of Dut-ton as witness, not defendant, does not take him out of the category of \u201csubject\u201d entitled to counsel fees under the Act during such time as he remained a potential defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">We further note that the Independent Counsel obtained from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia an immunity order of March 6, 1987, granting use immunity for testimony Dutton was expected to give, and apparently did give, thereafter. The Department of Justice rightly suggests that we should examine this event to determine if it has bearing on Dut-ton\u2019s status as a \u201csubject\u201d under the Act, even if it is not necessarily determinative. The federal use immunity statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002, confers immunity only against the use of the testimony compelled under the immunizing order; \u201cit does not confer transactional immunity under which the witness could not be prosecuted at all for the transaction about which he testifies.\u201d <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>859 F.2d 216, 219 (D.C.Cir.1988) (citing <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 461, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 1665, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972)). We therefore conclude that an individual who would otherwise qualify as a \u201csubject\u201d of an independent counsel investigation does not automatically lose that status (and his right to seek reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees) merely because the indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>dent counsel exercises his discretion to obtain use immunity for that individual in order to secure his testimony against others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">Nonetheless, although the grant of use immunity is not dispositive, it does change the reasonable perception, even without the benefit of hindsight as to whether the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the purported \u201csubject\u201d after the grant of immunity \u201cwere reasonably related to a defense to\u201d the independent counsel\u2019s investigation. As a general proposition, such an immunized witness will no longer be a \u201csubject.\u201d We conclude that this is the case as to Dutton. True, the Independent Counsel in the present investigation did prosecute at least two persons previously afforded use immunity. <em>United States v. North, </em>910 F.2d 843 (D.C.Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>951 F.2d 369 (D.C.Cir.1991). But, in each of those cases the use immunity was conferred, not by the Independent Counsel but by a congressional investigating committee, without the connivance of and indeed over objections of the Independent Counsel. <em>See North, </em>910 F.2d at 863 (quoting the Independent Counsel\u2019s memorandum to congressional committees concerning use immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">In sum, we conclude that as a general proposition, the \u201csubject\u201d requirement of the Act means that an individual eligible for reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees must be one whose conduct was within the scope of the grand .jury investigation, in the sense that the grand jury was examining conduct of his in a way that would lead a reasonably counseled person at the time of incurring the fees to believe that there was a realistic possibility that he would become a defendant. While a review of the exact factual circumstances that cause us to conclude that Dutton was a potential defendant from the commencement of the investigation until the time that he received use immunity would require a more extensive restatement of the Independent Counsel\u2019s Report than we deem appropriate in a published opinion, we do so conclude. Shortly put, the Report itself describes Dutton as an employee of retired Air Force Major General Richard V. Secord in the very enterprise which generated for Se-cord the status of defendant in an Independent Counsel ease. While no indictment names Dutton, frequent indictment references to Secord acting in concert with others cover the activities and period of Dutton\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">We therefore conclude that a reasonable person situated as Dutton was would have defended against the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation. Therefore, he occupied the status of \u201csubject.\u201d We further conclude that, for purposes of the Act, he lost that status at such time as the attorneys he employed in that defense successfully negotiated for him the status of immunized witness as opposed to likely defendant. Thus, we will subtract from the award of counsel fees any incurred after the obtaining of the immunity order on March 6, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">B. \u201cDuring\u201d the Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">The statute provides reimbursement only for \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees incurred ... during [the independent counsel\u2019s] investigation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). Thus, as we have previously noted, \u201cCongress did not provide in section 593(f) for the payment of fees incurred prior to the appointment of independent counsel.\u201d <em>In re Nofziger, </em>938 F.2d 1397, 1403 (D.C.Cir.1991). Because the fee award is a consent to suit by the United States, a sovereign otherwise absolutely immune, \u201c[t]he limitations and conditions that Congress imposes on [such a waiver] must be strictly observed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Soriano v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 270, 77 S.Ct. 269, 1 L.Ed.2d 306 (1957)). In an amendment to his application, Dutton has candidly agreed that $12,543.67 of his attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses were incurred prior to the appointment of the Independent Counsel on December 19, 1986, and he concedes that these must be deducted from the fees prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">C. The \u201cBut for\u201d Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-11\">The statute requires that to be reimbursable, the attorneys\u2019 fees must be such as \u201cwould not have been incurred <em>but for </em>the requirements of [the Ethics in Government Act].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). Therefore, \u201c[a]ll requests for attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act must satisfy the \u2018but for\u2019 requirement of\u2019 the Act. <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d 451, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>452 (D.C.Cir.1989). The purpose in the award of reimbursement for fees that would not have been incurred \u201cbut for\u201d the Act is to ensure that \u201cofficials [and here derivative \u2018subjects\u2019] who are investigated by independent counsels will be subject only to paying those attorneys\u2019 fees that would normally be paid by private citizens being investigated for the same offense by\u201d federal executive components such as the United States Attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 452-53 (citing S.Rep. No. 496, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 18 (1982), <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3537, 3554 (referring to \u201cfees [that] would not have been incurred in the absence of the [independent counsel] law\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-3\">It is not always apparent from the face of an indictment or the recitation of the role of a subject in an investigation whether such a subject would have incurred the same fees had the ease been handled by the Department of Justice or other executive authorities rather than the Independent Counsel. In <em>Olson, </em>we found the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement to be met where the independent counsel duplicated ground previously covered in the preliminary investigation conducted by the Department of Justice, 884 F.2d at 1420; where the Independent Counsel sought an expansion of her prosecutorial authority, <em>id. </em>at 1420-21; where the subject incurred legal fees challenging the constitutionality of the Independent Counsel Act, <em>id. </em>at 1421; and where the subject incurred fees for the preparation of comments to the Independent Counsel\u2019s report pursuant to the Act which were reasonably related to the substantive defense, <em>id. </em>at 1422.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">In <em>Donovan, </em>we found the requirement met where it was apparent that if the Department of Justice had received the same allegations against an ordinary citizen, there might well have been only \u201ca non-public summary investigation\u201d instead of the extended investigation conducted because of strictures specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 592(a)(2). 877 F.2d at 989. In <em>Nofziger, </em>we held that a subject had not satisfied the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement where he had shown \u201cno unique special factual features that but for the requirement of the Act would have permitted a quick termination if the investigation were conducted outside the Act.\u201d 925 F.2d 428, 439. But in so doing, we recognized that in enacting the 1983 amendments creating the right to reimbursement, Congress was motivated by an intent \u201cto correct an unequal <em>application </em>of \u2018the criminal law,\u2019 when high public officials were investigated under the Act in circumstances where private citizens would not be investigated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">Dutton contends, and we agree, that his attorneys\u2019 fees during the period for which we allow them fall within this latter rationale. He argues convincingly that his position as a \u201csubject\u201d was created principally by the decision of the Independent Counsel to treat as a criminal conspiracy efforts to circumvent the <em>Boland </em>Amendments. The <em>Boland </em>Amendments were riders to the Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 1983, Pub.L. No. 97-377, 96 Stat. 1833, 1865 (1982), prohibiting the Central Intelligence Agency from spending money \u201cfor the purpose of overthrowing the government of Nicaragua.\u201d <em>Id. </em>From the record before us, specifically the Report of the Independent Counsel and the investigation conducted by Attorney General Meese on behalf of President Reagan reported therein, we determin\u00e9 that executive branch authorities never treated circumvention of the <em>Boland </em>Amendments as having criminal consequences. We therefore agree with Dut-ton\u2019s proposition that a politically appointed Attorney General as the representative of the Executive would never have subjected such attempts to criminal prosecution. Therefore, the investigation would never have occurred, nor the fees have been incurred, \u201cbut for\u201d the appointment of the Independent Counsel under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">Unsurprisingly, given the fact-specific nature of each independent counsel\u2019s undertakings, Dutton\u2019s facts do not fit neatly into any box created by a prior opinion. Perhaps the closest prior authority is <em>In re Sealed Case. </em>There we found the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement to be met where the \u201cIndependent Counsel conducted a thorough investigation and actually examined applicant\u2019s tax returns, and his financial dealings, for nine years from 1976 to 1984,\u201d but where in the. \u201copinion [of the Court] the ordinary examination of a taxpayer for a \u00a7 7203 violation would have been substantially less probing.\u201d 890 F.2d at 454. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>Similarly, we conclude that in this case no criminal investigation paralleling the present one would have occurred at all \u201cbut for\u201d the Act and, therefore, hold that Dutton has met all eligibility requirements for reimbursement under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">II. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">In addition to the statute\u2019s specific eligibility requirements discussed above, the Act, like other fee award statutes, permits awards only of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). Here, we have reviewed the portion of the fees and expenses remaining after deductions for the items discussed above and find that they generally meet the standards of reasonableness that we have applied in the cases we have previously decided under the Act. <em>See generally In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d 1415, 1427 (D.C.Cir.1989); <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d 451, 452 (D.C.Cir.1989); <em>In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d 1192 (D.C.Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">We do find certain expense items, albeit small ones, are either insufficiently explained or not justifiable. We will therefore make deductions for them. They consist of items shown on three statements from Dutton\u2019s attorneys for \u201cconferences\u201d and two for \u201cmiscellaneous.\u201d We do not disparage the possible reasonableness of these fees as between attorney and client per their agreement, but they do not have the specificity which demonstrates them to be reasonable items for the taxpayers to adopt. Obviously we have no way of knowing whether they have the causation element presupposed in the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement, nor can we assess the reasonableness <em>vel non </em>of something described as \u201cmiscellaneous.\u201d As to the conferences, we presume that those refer to food or refreshments served.at conferences as the time involved is always billed under some other item. Therefore, we will disallow the conference billings as we have previously held that \u201cbusiness meals\u201d are not allowable under the Act. <em>In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">There is one more complicating factor in determining the reasonableness of the fees requested. The billing statement of Dutton\u2019s attorneys, Heron, Burehette, Ru-bert <em>&amp; </em>Rothwell, dated March 5, 1987; would make plain precisely how much legal work came before the entry of the order for immunity if it were current through that date. However, with. the time lag necessary to professional service billing, that bill is a statement only for services rendered through February 28, 1987. The next statement for services, dated April 2, 1987, is sufficiently detailed to inform a client of precisely the services for which he is paying but is not sufficient as to advise this Court precisely which fees were incurred before the entry of the immunity order and which after. By extrapolation, we know that those incurred through the March 5 billing totalled $49,-681.76. Deducting the $12,543.67 disallowed as occurring before the appointment of the Independent Counsel, leaves as eligible for consideration for award $37,138.09. From that figure we subtract $11.36 shown for conferences on the January 8, 1987 bill; $22.72 shown as miscellaneous on that same bill; and $24.30 for conferences shown on the March 5 bill. This leaves $37,075.71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">To this we must add the eligible portion of the April 2 bill. That billing reflected $12,-037.50 in new services rendered and disbursements of $674.01 for a total new billing of $12,711.51. Crom this we deduct $33.48. for conferences; $32.96 for miscellaneous; leaving a possible total of $12,645.27. However, only a small portion of this is eligible as rendered before the entry of the immunity order on March 6. As noted above, we cannot ascertain precisely what part is incurred on what dates. The computer printout submitted with the statement is largely illegible and not helpful in this resolution. While it would be possible to say that petitioner bears the burden of establishing reasonableness and that he has done so as to none of the billing, this seems to us unduly harsh. We have therefore allocated eligible and ineligible amounts on a pro rata basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">During the month of March 1987, the period of the bill under discussion, there were 22 business days. Five of these are eligible days, that is March 2nd through March 6th, constituting 22.7 percent of the business month. We therefore allowed 22.7 percent of $12,645.07 or $2,870.43 for the April 2 billing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>Adding this sum to the $37,075.71 previously-determined, yields a total eligible reimbursement of $39,946.14.</p>\n<p id=\"A7d4\">By judgment of even date herewith, we award that amount to Robert C. Dutton.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
