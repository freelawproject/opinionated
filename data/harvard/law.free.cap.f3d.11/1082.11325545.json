As we have in the past, we obtained the benefit of the Department of Justice\u2019s advice in ruling on the request. The Department of Justice rightly points to several deficiencies in Teicher\u2019s application. Although Teicher filed a response, he has not adequately filled the gaps in his application.</p>\n<p id=\"A4a\">The Act is quite specific as to the requirements for reimbursement and provides relief only to \u201can individual who is the subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel pursuant to\u201d the Act where \u201cno indictment is brought against such individual pursuant to that investigation ... for ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred ... during that investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of\u2019 the Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 598(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">As we have recently noted, the applicant must first demonstrate that he is a \u201csubject\u201d of an independent counsel\u2019s investigation. <em>In re North (Dutton Fee Application), </em>11 F.3d 1075 (D.C.Cir.1993). There is no statutory definition of \u201csubject,\u201d and at the time that Teicher filed his application, we had not yet judicially defined the term for purposes of the Act. Since that time, we have established that a \u201csubject\u201d for purposes of the Act \u201cis one who, at the time of incurring the fees involved in the application, knew that his conduct was within\u201d the scope of the investigation \u201cin such a fashion that \u2018the independent counsel might reasonably be expected, to point the finger of accusation\u2019 at him.\u201d <em>In re North (Shultz Fee Application), </em>8 F.3d 847 (D.C.Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1078). We noted that the term \u201csubject\u201d is the approximate equivalent of \u201cpotential defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also made it plain in <em>Dutton </em>that it is not sufficient to show that one\u2019s conduct is within the scope of the investigation only in the sense that would be true of \u201cany fact witness.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">To date, Teicher has not established to the satisfaction of the Court that he falls within the category of \u201csubject\u201d as opposed to mere witness. In fairness, Teicher did not have the benefit of the <em>Dutton </em>and <em>Shultz </em>formulations at the time of his filing. Because as Teicher notes, the Report of the Independent Counsel includes allegations of conduct by him near the center of the Iran side of the events occasioning the Iran/Contra investigation, it may be that Teicher in fact occupied the role of subject rather than mere witness for some period of time. There is, however, no showing that he was objectively likely to have become a defendant at any time in the latter part of the investigation. As the burden of establishing entitlement to, counsel fees is his, <em>Shultz, </em>8 F.3d at 851, we could, of course, deny the application outright at this time. However, because of the intervention of the <em>Dutton </em>and <em>Shultz </em>formulations, by show.cause order of even day herewith, we provide him with a chance to make the showing. We note that this showing is to be an objective one, speaking as of the time of the occurrence of the fees, with neither the benefit nor detriment of hindsight. <em>See Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">The application has two other shortcomings that would probably be sufficient to deny the application, given that the burden of establishing entitlement is on the applicant. <em>Shultz, </em>8 F.3d at 851. However, as we are providing additional time for the showing of subject status, we will permit Teicher one more attempt at meeting the other requirements as well. The first of these is the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement of the Act, which mandates that the applicant show- that the fees for which reimbursement is sought \u201cwould not have been incurred but for the requirements of [the Act].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). This requirement \u201cis to ensure that \u2018officials [and here derivative \u2018subjects\u2019] who are investigated by the independent counsels will be subject only to paying those attorneys\u2019 fees that would normally be paid by private citizens being investigated for the same offense by\u2019 executive federal components such as the United States Attorney.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1079 (quoting <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d 451, 452 (D.C.Cir.1989)). As portions of the fees in Teicher\u2019s- underlying documentation were incurred for tasks outside the investigation, for example, congressional investigations, and perhaps outside the temporal duration of the investigation, he has not carried his burden as to causative elements. If he expects to make any recovery, he must do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">Similarly, the statute requires that the application show that the fees are \u201creasonable.\u201d '28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(2)(C). We have discussed this requirement recently in <em>Shultz </em>and <em>Dutton </em>and refer Teicher to those opinions for guidance in attempting to meet this element, as he has not yet done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we direct that Teicher show cause why his application should not be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
