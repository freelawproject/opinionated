Laws 1965, <em>c. 239,p. </em>354 and <em>c. 282,p. </em>521.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">The 1963 Legislature had appropriated an identical amount to provide special aid to twenty school districts for each of the fiscal years 1963-64 and 1964-65. However it labeled each appropriation \u201cSpecial aid to the twenty school districts having lowest equalized valuation per pupil\u201d and enumerated the twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>districts which were to receive this aid and the amount each district was to receive. Furthermore each of these appropriations included the following footnote: \u201cPayments authorized by this appropriation shall be made solely to the towns set forth herein.\u201d Laws 1963, <em>c. </em>198, <em>p. </em>253 and <em>c. </em>199, <em>pp. </em>346, 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The State Board of Education having presented for your approval a manifest distributing this special aid for the fiscal year 1965-66 to the same towns and in the same amounts as appear in Laws 1963, <em>cc. </em>198, 199, you have requested our advice as to the correctness of this manifest to aid you in the performance of your executive duties. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>102 N. H. 183, 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The financial ability of the various school districts in the state to provide an adequate education for its school children is dependent in large measure on the equalized valuation of the towns which compose the district. <em>Gilsum </em>v. <em>Monadnock School District, </em>105 N. H. 361, 364. \u201cThere exists grave inequality between the ability of the various school districts to support their schools on their respective local property tax bases.\u201d Report of Interim Commission on Education (1963) <em>p. </em>21, <em>par. </em>10. \u201cThe Legislature has declared the purpose of foundation aid to be \u2018to aid needy local school districts in meeting the costs of providing public elementary and high school education\u2019 (RSA 198:9 (supp)) and -to more nearly provide equal public school educational opportunity throughout the state. \u2019 RSA 198:10 (supp). \u2018The basic intent is to make poorer districts financially able to spend the state average in current expenses per pupil.\u2019 Report of Interim Commission on Education (1963) <em>p. </em>55.\u201d <em>Gilsum </em>v. <em>Monadnock School District, supra. </em>However, the amounts appropriated for foundation aid have been insufficient to realize that basic inteiit. Report, Interim Commission on Education (1963)/). 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Equalized valuation per resident pupil in average daily membership has been described as a practical measure of determining local ability to support schools. By appropriating in 1963 \u201c Special aid to the twenty school districts having lowest equalized valuation per pupil, \u201d the Legislature manifested a clear intent to grant additional financial aid to the twenty neediest districts in the state in order to enable them to provide an education to their pupils more nearly similar to the state average. We are of the opinion that this same legislative intent, although not so clearly expressed, motivated the appropriations of \u201c Special Aid to 20 school districts\u201d for the fiscal years 1965-66 and 1966-67 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Laws 1965, <em>c. </em>239, <em>p. </em>354 and <em>c. </em>282, <em>p. </em>521. <em>Monadnock School District </em>v. Fitzwilliam., 105 N. H. 487, 495. See Senate Journal for Monday June 28, 1965 (p. 1439): \u201cSenator Waterhouse inquired \u2018Is there enough money appropriated in the 2nd year of the biennium to provide for the needy school districts ? Senator Lamprey: \u2018It was decided to put that money in for the twenty most needy towns . . . \u2019 Senator Martin: \u2018Are the twenty most needy towns included ?\u2019 Senator Lamprey replied in the affirmative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">It is stated in your request for advice that the special aid provided in 1963 was apportioned for each year of the biennium according to a formula which was comprised of various factors including (1) 1963 equalized valuation per pupil; (2) 1961-62 resident average daily membership of pupils; (3) equalized school tax rate 1962-63. We see no intent manifested by the 1965 Legislature to add or detract from the factors which constituted the formula for distributing the 1963 aid. Since by the appropriating legislation in 1963 the same twenty towns were to receive the same individual amounts in each year of the biennium it was proper in that instance to use the same factors without change for each year\u2019s distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">However the 1965 Legislature did not allocate this aid to the same specified school districts in the same specified amounts for the biennium although its intent was that the twenty most needy school districts were to be its recipients. We conclude that the determination of the twenty districts to receive this aid is to be made in each year of the biennium on the basis of the need existing in each of those years. The selection of these recipients is to be made by the most reliable method of ascertaining school districts needs in each of those years, namely, the mostrecent equalized valuation per pupil figures available when the computation for each year is made. The distribution in each of those years is to be made in accordance with the formula used to distribute the aid authorized by the Legislature in 1963 but with each factor up-dated to the most recent figures available.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">This special aid being in the nature of foundation aid the amount of aid to be paid to eligible school districts in the year 1965-66 was to be computed by the State Board of Education before June 30, 1965. RSA 198:10-a. At that time the equalized valuations found in Laws 1963, <em>c. </em>228 were still in effect as those established by Laws 1965, <em>c. </em>312 did not become effective until July 8, 1965. Hence the 20 school districts to receive the 1965-66 aid are those which are most needy according to the most recent figures available before June 30, 1965 on equalized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>valuation per pupil for each school district. Distribution of this aid in the amount of $102,710 is to be made by the use of the same formula used to distribute the aid authorized in 1963 but with each factor up-dated to the most recendy available figures when the computation is made by the State Board of Education. Similarly the twenty recipients for the fiscal year 1966-67 are to be determined by the use of the most recent equalized valuation per pupil figures available when the computation is made before June 30, 1966 and distribution is to be made in accordance with the same formula previously used but with each factor up-dated to the latest figures available at the time of computation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-5\">Frank R.
