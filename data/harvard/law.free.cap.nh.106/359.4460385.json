By the same motion the defendants also sought to require production of a written agreement between the witness and the defendant Robert D. Bailey. The Presiding Justice <em>{Leahy, </em>C. J.) granted the motion for production of the written agreement and denied the motion to compel answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">The plaintiff seeks to recover a broker\u2019s commission allegedly due by reason of production by her of the purchaser of real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>estate in York, Maine, formerly owned by the defendants and conveyed by them on July 30, 1963 to George T. Kattar.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The witness, Leo B. Dowd, whose answers the motion sought to compel, is a resident of New Hampshire, engaged in the real estate business here. The plaintiff Woodward is a licensed real estate broker in the State of Maine. She testified on deposition that the purchaser was first brought to her in January 1963 by the witness Dowd, and was shown the premises by her, in company with Dowd. She testified that Dowd was a co-broker, and that she expected to share any commission with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The defense pleaded is that the action is a \u201csham\u201d to permit collection of a commission for Dowd, which he is unable to enforce under the laws of Maine because not licensed to sell real estate there; and that the plaintiff had \u201cno legitimate connection with [the] closing of this . . . sale.\u201d The witness Dowd testified that he had a \u201cblanket agreement\u201d with the plaintiff with respect to reciprocal \u201cco-brokering\u201d of properties in Maine and New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The first question which the defendants sought an order to compel Dowd to answer was as follows: \u201cNow if the sale . . . was actually initiated in 1962, as opposed to 1963, I understand you do not claim that you are entitled to a commission, is that right?\u201d Counsel for the plaintiff objected to use of the word \u201cinitiated\u201d as \u201ctoo ambiguous,\u201d and when defendants\u2019 counsel refused to change the question, instructed the witness not to answer. Defendants \u2019 counsel thereupon moved to certify the question to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">After commenting that he would \u201crephrase it further,\u201d he then asked the following question: \u201cIf Mr. Kattar was brought in contact with Mr. Bailey and was actually interested in, again, negotiating for the purchase ... in 1962, as opposed to 1963, now do you claim that you are entitled to a real estate commission?\u201d This question the witness answered by stating that the defendant Robert D. Bailey had met Kattar through him for the purpose of financing purchase by a third person, and concluded: \u201cI guess it is a matter of opinion.\u201d The witness went on to concede that \u201clegally\u201d he did not know if he would be entided to a commission, but \u201cmorally I should have, yes\u201d; and to state, \u201cI think I would claim a commission under those circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Shortly thereafter defendants\u2019 counsel asked the witness the second question to which an answer is sought to be. compelled: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201cI am asking you in the circumstances that Mr. . . . Kattar . . . may have negotiated for purchase option as early as May 1962, you would have no basis for claiming Hazel Woodward was a broker concerned with this sale, is that correct?\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel instructed the witness not to answer, stating, \u201cThat is another question. It is not admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The defendants also sought to compel answers to the following questions: \u201cAnd you would not make a legal claim for a cut of this commission?\u201d When opposing counsel objected, this question was changed to: \u201cDo you claim a commission Mr. Dowd in this matter, or any portion of one?\u201d The witness answered the last question by saying, \u201cI think I have answered the question,\u201d and counsel asked: \u201cThen you refuse to answer it, is that right?\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t say that ... he has answered you about five times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The witness had previously testified that he did not know if he \u201cexpected a cut of that commission\u201d \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t tell what she is going to do\u201d; and that he made \u201cno legal claim for it.\u201d He had previously testified that he believed that \u201cHazel Woodward was the broker\u201d; that he was \u201centitled to a co-broker\u2019s fee . . . [a]bsolutely, because of a private agreement I have had of long standing with Hazel Woodward,\u201d and that he \u201cwould suspect that she would be lady enough to want to live up to the agreement.\u201d Additionally he had answered, \u201cI think she should receive the commission in full ... If she wants to do anything for me, that is up to her. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">While the record contains no findings by the Trial Court, it is apparent that the Court could properly have concluded that in other parts of the deposition the witness had answered, in substance, the questions to which answers were sought to be compelled. The issue presented by the motion was one which \u201crests in the sound discretion of the Trial Court\u201d <em>(Staargaard </em>v. Company, 96 N. H. 17, 18), and no error is demonstrated by the record. To the extent, if any, that the answers sought were not in fact obtained, we cannot say as a matter of law that they were necessary for the proper preparation of the defendants \u2019 case. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>99 N. H. 158; <em>Staargaard </em>v. <em>Company, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b405-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
