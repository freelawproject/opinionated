The lots which have been conveyed lie on both sides of this road; the plaintiff still owns at least one lot on each side. There are a number of cottages along this road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cThe defendant owns at least a part interest in land situate in Acton, Maine, which is bounded northerly by the Acton Ridge Road and land of others, westerly by the above mentioned state line, which, as stated above, is the plaintiff\u2019s easterly bound, southerly by the Great East Lake and easterly by land of others. The defendant\u2019s mother acquired title to this property in 1918, and although there was no evidence as to what, if any, interest the defendant now has, it does appear from the plaintiff\u2019s petition and requests, and the defendant\u2019s argument, requests and his counsel\u2019s representations at the hearing, that the parties are in agreement that the defendant owns at least a part interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cThe defendant and his family and invitees have been using the camp road for a number of years to go from the Old Dear-born Road into Maine to a part of the defendant\u2019s property which is on the shore and is undeveloped. On August 5, 1963 the plaintiff notified the defendant to discontinue his use of this road; subsequently the plaintiff blocked the road near the state line on several occasions, and on each occasion the defendant removed the obstruction and continued to use the road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff claims that the defendant\u2019s use of the camp road was permissive, and that he had no right to use it after the permission was withdrawn on August 5th. The defendant claims that he is entitled to use the camp road to get to his property, or to cross the plaintiff\u2019s property at some other location for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff opened up the camp road in 1934. For many years prior thereto, there was a road across the property now owned by the plaintiff, which branched off from the Old Dear-born Road at a location northerly of where the camp road was later opened up, proceeded in a southeasterly direction to a location on the state line approximately where the easterly end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>of the camp road was subsequently located, and then went onto what is now the defendant\u2019s property. This road went over different land than does the camp road, except at or near the state line. For identification purposes, it was referred to at the hearing as the Combie road, since, prior to when the camp road was opened up, it served, in part, a camp owned by one Combie which was located on the shore loi, conveyed from what is now the plaintiff\u2019s property, that abuts the state line. There has been no other road across this property to the state line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cThe defendant and his parents used the Combie road to get to their shore property for many years prior to 1934. In that year, or a year or two prior thereto, the plaintiff plowed up a section of the Combie road for use as part of a pasture, and that section has since been a field. Thereafter this road was no longer used to go from the Old Dearborn road to the defendant\u2019s property, and other sections of it grew up with brush and trees. After the plaintiff plowed up a section of the Combie Road, the defendant\u2019s parents, the defendant, and their invitees used the camp road to get to the shore property now owned by the defendant, and he has continued to do so to the present time. The defendant\u2019s parents, the defendant, and their invitees have gone to that shore property to use it for recreational purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201cThe Combie road was a private wood road, and not a public highway. Likewise the camp road is, and always has been, a private road, and not a public highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cThe use of the Combie road by the defendant and his predecessors was a permissive, and not an adverse, use. Likewise, the use of the camp road by them has been permissive and not adverse, until August, 1963, when the defendant\u2019s use became adverse. Neither the defendant nor his predecessors ever acquired a right of way by adverse uses over tire Combie road or the camp road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cFurther, neither the defendant nor his predecessors ever acquired any right of way over die plaintiff\u2019s property by grant or agreement, express or implied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The principal contention of the defendant relates to his exception to the finding and ruling diat die \u201cuse of the Combie road by the defendant and his predecessors was a permissive, and not an adverse, use.\u201d The defendant testified that the Combie road was used \u201ccontinually and exclusively\u201d to get to the Maine property from 1910 to 1934. There was however, no evidence of use of die road by Clark, who was the immediate predecessor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>title of the MacCormacs, and the property was not acquired by the MacCormacs until December 9, 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The defendant testified that no one ever questioned their right to use \u201cthe Dearborn Road and the Combie Road\u201d to get to their property, and that no one ever gave permission for them to use \u201cthe Dearborn Road,\u201d which the Court found was a public highway running from the Wakefield-Acton highway to the shore of Great East Lake. The use of the Combie Road, to which the defendant testified, was to get to the lake \u201cfor beach purposes\u201d in the summer, and he stated \u201cthat\u2019s all\u201d they \u201cused the Combie Road for was to go down to the beach down there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony was that the defendant\u2019s father had owned the land across the state line, that he \u201cused to go in the way Combie\u2019s folks did for a little while \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long\u201d and that \u201che actually used that right of way with . . . permission. \u201d It appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s father and uncle had acquired the New Hampshire property in 1921 and that the first of five lots by the lake was sold to Combie in the same year. There was evidence that Combie also used the road in question to reach his camp. The plaintiff testified that when he closed off the Combie road in 1934, to use it as part of a pasture, the defendant \u201ccame to me . . . and wanted to buy a right of way over ... the proposed right of way [the camp road] and I told him I didn\u2019t care to sell but the MacCormac family would never be barred as long as everything went all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We are satisfied that the record as a whole warrants the Trial Court\u2019s finding and ruling that the defendant had no right of way by adverse user over either the Combie road or the camp road. The use made could properly be found to have been permissive, as was Combie\u2019s use of the Combie road. The evidence did not compel a finding that the use made of this road by the defendant and his predecessors was either adverse or for the prescriptive period of twenty years. <em>Goodwin </em>v. Johnston, 105 N. H. 294; <em>Ucietowski </em>v. <em>Novak, </em>102 N. H. 140, 145. See <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Arsenault, </em>85 N. H. 72; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Goodnow, </em>98 N. H. 110. Termination of the use could be found to have resulted from assertion of a paramount right by the plaintiff. See <em>Salminen </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>83 N. H. 219, 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The defendant\u2019s further argument that the plaintiff will be unjustly enriched by the relief granted is based upon the premise that the defendant relinquished a right of way by prescription when he ceased to use the Combie Road in 1934. This contention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>and his final argument that the injunction should be limited to prohibition of any enlargement of \u201chis prescriptive rights\u201d beyond use for \u201cresidential purposes,\u201d are afforded no basis in the record in view of the findings and rulings that he acquired no prescriptive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Our review of the record discloses no error, and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AmL\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
