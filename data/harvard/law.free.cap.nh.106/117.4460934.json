By their motion the plaintiffs raise the question whether their rights were prejudiced by the Trial Court\u2019s denial of their motion to strike the testimony of an expert witness and by the Trial Court\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>their motions to set aside the verdicts as procured and influenced by the testimony of such witness. By their exceptions in the Trial Court and by their motion the plaintiffs claim that the testimony of the expert witness \u201cwas false and fraudulent and [that] he is a witness unworthy of belief by reasonable men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFg\">The motion is denied without prejudice to the rights of any parties to this proceeding because it does not appear that extraordinary action by this court at this time is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\n<em>Motion denied without prejudice.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
