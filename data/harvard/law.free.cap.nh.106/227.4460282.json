Hancock, <em>Warden of the State Prison.</em></parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b271-7\">Filed January 19 and February 24, 1965.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b271-8\">Decided March 31, 1965.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ah7\"><em>Harold Amero </em>(by brief), pro se.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b271-11\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auy\">The petitioner contends that his civil rights \u201cwere denied and violated\u201d under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States in that he did not have a fair trial by an impartial jury and that his counsel \u201cdid not provide a full and proper defense as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARP\">The substance of his complaint is that one of the jurors who was drawn to sit on his case in Strafford County Superior Court was not an impartial juror and he was thus denied a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">In support of this contention the petitioner alleges that this juror had known him for over twenty years and that he (Amero) was at one time \u201ca close companion of his two (2) sons . . .\u201d; that \u201che disapproved of petitioner and that he, personally did not want his sons to associate with petitioner herein.\u201d The petition further alleges that he \u201chad on occasions had intimate relations\u201d with a former daughter-in-law of this juror, and that such relations could possibly be \u201ca material factor in a divorce decree\u201d between her and a son of the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">Because of activities and incidents which the petitioner says were known to Juror Wallingford, Sr. he argues \u201cthat it is not presumptuous to assume that when the Jury retired to deliberate; <em>Juror </em>Wallingford used all his powers of persuasion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>give the other Jurors a prejudiced and biased opinion of the petitioner... . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">At his trial in the court below the petitioner was represented by competent counsel. It is now contended that he brought to his counsel\u2019s attention during the impaneling of the jury that <em>this </em>juror knew a great deal about his past life and background and was likely to be prejudiced. He represents that his counsel said he had exhausted his challenges. We have no reason to assume that counsel did not exercise his challenges both peremptory and for cause in the best interest of the petitioner. Furthermore, it must be assumed that the Trial Court in impaneling the jury followed the required statutory and universal practice of the Superior Court in this jurisdiction of propounding certain inquiries to the panel to ascertain if they were impartial and indifferent. RSA 500:32; RSA 606:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The petitioner\u2019s exceptions taken during the trial in Superior Court which resulted in his conviction for the crime of breaking, entering and larceny in the nighttime have been considered by this court and were overruled and the conviction affirmed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Amero, </em>106 N. H. 134. In considering the petitioner\u2019s allegations now before us we have again reviewed the trial record and find no basis in fact for the contention that he did not have a fair trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The order therefore is</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AqU\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
