See \u201cEnforcement of Housing Codes,\u201d 78 Harv. L. Rev. 801, 803-804. In 1959, New Hampshire adopted an enabling act which authorized municipalities to enact housing codes prescribing minimum housing standards and forbidding tire use or occupancy of dwellings unfit for human habitation. Laws 1959, <em>c. </em>293, now RSA ch. 48-A (supp). In 1961 the city of Concord adopted a housing code effective June 19, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In June 1959 the defendants White acquired the properties involved in these actions, consisting of two multi-unit dwellings situated at 5-7 and 9-11 Curtice Avenue, which they continued to rent as low-cost housing. Sometime prior to July 1, 1963, the buildings were vacated, in part through eviction proceedings instituted after notice by the city building inspector that they were considered unfit for habitation. The defendant, Hazel White continues to own the properties as surviving joint tenant, her husband, John C. White, having deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">On May 10, 1962 die plaintiff building inspector notified the Whites, by ordinary mail, that as a result of an inspection made by him on April 16, 1962, he \u201cdeemed both buildings unfit for human habitation [and] dangerous to die health, morals, safety and general welfare of their occupants.\u201d The letter concluded with a specification of twenty-three sections of the code which were found to be violated. It contained the following order: \u201cYou, therefore, are hereby ordered to repair these buildings in such a manner that they will no longer exist in violation of the terms of the Housing Code.\u201d It further specified: \u201cFailure to correct these violations within 60 days from the date of this order will result in ordering the occupants to vacate and the buildings demolished as provided by. die terms of the code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The petition of the building inspector seeks in part an order that the defendants \u201cconform to . . . the order . . . requiring demolition of die dwellings.\u201d The defendants seek a ruling that the housing code \u201cis unconstitutional and not in conformity with . . . Chapter 48-A, RSA,\u201d and that the action of die building inspector and the city have deprived them of their property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The defendant\u2019s brief states that the \u201cvalidity and constitutionality of the Statute as enacted by the New Hampshire Legislature in 1959 ... is not in question here,\u201d and t\u00ediat it is assumed for purposes of this case that the statute is \u201ca valid exercise of die police power, and therefore constitutional.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Although in oral argument defendant\u2019s counsel expressed misgivings concerning these statements, neither he nor the city saw fit to utilize the opportunity afforded by the court for the filing of memoranda upon the issue. Our -decision is accordingly confined to questions presented by the pleadings and transferred, pertaining to the validity of the ordinance only.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In our judgment the procedural provisions of the ordinance cannot be construed to fall within the legislative grant of authority. <em>S. </em>14 (1) of the ordinance provides: \u201cWhenever the Inspector of Buildings determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any provision of this ordinance, he shall give notice ... to the person or persons responsible therefor . ...\u201d <em>S. </em>14 (3) provides that such a notice by the building inspector \u201cshall automatically become an order if a written petition for a hearing is not filed with the Board of Housing Appeals within 10 days after such notice is served.\u201d <em>S. </em>14 (5) provides for an appeal to the mayor and board of aldermen by any owner aggrieved \u201cby an order of the Board of Housing Appeals made pursuant to Subsection (3) of Section 14.\u201d Such an order is entered only in the event that the owner has sought a hearing before that board. <em>S. </em>14 (2). In the instant case no hearing before the housing board of appeals was sought or held.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In contrast to the provisions of the Concord ordinance, the enabling act provides that a housing ordinance shall be administered by a \u201cpublic agency,\u201d which \u201cshall be a board\u201d of specified membership. RSA 48-A:l IV; 3 I. It specifies that a municipal code \u201cshall\u201d include provisions by which a hearing before the \u201cpublic agency\u201d shall be held, after specified notice, (see <em>Michaud </em>v. Bangor, 159 Me. 491) before any order for repair or demolition is entered by the agency or board. <em>S. </em>3 II, III. A subsequent appeal to the mayor and board of aldermen is provided for (5. 3 IV); and in the event of noncompliance, provision is made for a hearing <em>de novo </em>before the Superior Court at which pertinent evidence \u201cconcerning the fitness of the dwelling for human habitation\u201d shall be heard. <em>S. </em>4. Although, as the city points out, the statute provides that an ordinance \u201cmay authorize the public agency ... to delegate any of its functions under such ordinance ...\u201d the Concord ordinance contains no such authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">We therefore conclude that the ordinance is defective in failing to provide for the mandatory hearing before the housing board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>which the statute requires, and in purporting to permit entry of an order for repair or demolition, by the inspector of buildings rather than by the board. These deficiencies are sufficiently material to invalidate the proceedings against these defendants. \u201cThe framework and system of state government . . . would obviously be attacked and undermined if municipalities were free to enact unpermitted legislation for their localized areas . . . \u2018In the nature of things, such [local] legislation must be not inconsistent with the laws of the state . . . . \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>30 N. H. 279, 293.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Paille, </em>90 N. H. 347, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">So far as the record discloses no order for demolition of the defendant\u2019s buildings has been entered. The letter of the building inspector of May 10, 1962 purported merely to order their \u201crepair.\u201d It stated that upon failure to correct the specified violations within sixty days, an order \u201cto vacate and the buildings demolished,\u201d \u201cwill result,\u201d a statement which contemplated the entry of a further order at a future time. The defendant\u2019s claim to compensation for a \u201ctaking\u201d of her property by the city is thus without support in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">We rule that the Concord housing code, including the provisions of section 14 (1) and (3) referred to in the first question transferred, is invalid for want of compliance with RSA ch. 48-A (supp).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">For reasons previously indicated the ordinance does violate the statute in the particulars specified by the second question transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The third transferred question requires no answer -in view of these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
