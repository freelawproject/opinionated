Following remand of this case after its former transfer to this court <em>(Alden </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>104 N. H. 454) the Labor Commissioner awarded to the defendant Kimball, widow of the deceased employee, compensation benefits at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>rate of $39.70 a week, and the employer and his insurer appealed. After hearing in the Superior Court, the Court <em>(Grant, </em>J.) found that during the year preceding the accident which caused his death, the deceased employee was paid a total of $786.90 for services rendered during \u201csome part of 8 different weeks,\u201d in trucking logs for the plaintiff Alden, and that his expenses in connection with the trucking, and for a helper totaled $300.24; so that his \u201cnet pay ... for the 52 weeks preceding his death was $486.66\u201d; and that \u201csince Kimball worked for eight weeks for Alden during said 52 week period, his net earnings per week while working for Alden were $60.83.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The Court transferred without ruling the question of whether Mrs. Kimball is entitled to compensation \u201ccomputed at the higher figure ($40 per week) ... or at the lower figure ($20.25) as contended by plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The deceased employee was killed on February 11, 1961, while engaged in transporting logs for the employer. Under the statute his dependent widow is entitled to compensation equal to two-thirds of his \u201caverage weekly wages.\u201d RSA 281:22 as amended by Laws 1959, 187:12. Section 2 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law establishes the methods by which \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d are to be determined. RSA 281:2 V (supp). The opposing contentions of the parties center around the interpretation of section 2, subsection V, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The employer Alden points out that the employee himself determined what hours he should work, worked for the employer on only fifteen days in eight different weeks in the preceding year, was paid by the thousand feet of logs transported, and derived a profit from his use of his own truck for his employer and others. The employer therefore contends that the employee\u2019s compensation should be determined on a basis of the average weekly earnings of other truck drivers in the same locality, which were shown to be $16.20 per day for a nine-hour day. He then contends that this daily wage should be multiplied by the total days worked in the preceding year (15), and that by dividing the result by \u201cthe actual number of weeks during which the deceased worked, we arrive at average weekly earnings of $30.38\u201d entitling the dependent to compensation of $20.25 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The employee contends that such a computation has no foundation in the statute; that the case is governed by subsection V (3), which would entitle the dependent to the maximum of $40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>per week; and that if the average hourly wage of truck drivers advocated by the employer as a proper yardstick is utilized, the same result is reached if the method prescribed by subsection V(l) is correcdy followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The dispute must be resolved by reference to the statute, and the governing standard which it employs of the average weekly earnings of the deceased employee. Subsection V(l) of section 2 may be considered to provide the method of determining average weekly wages most likely to be applicable in a majority of cases, in which regular full-time employment at regular hours is apt to be involved. The method is designed to produce a figure reflecting the average amount of \u201cstraight-time earnings\u201d per week in the course of a year, on the basis of a forty-hour week. However the section also provides that \u201cregard may be had\u201d for the average weekly earnings of persons in like employment where the nature, term, or period of the claimant\u2019s employment is such that use of the first method would be \u201cinequitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Subsection V(2) establishes a method to be used where the \u201cnormal schedule of hours\u201d of the employee has not exceeded twenty-four a week, or when the employee has been employed for less than a week out of the last fifty-two.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Subsection V(3) provides a formula similar to that of subsection V(2) for \u201coccupations with an indeterminate work week. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Under either V(2) or V(3), the standard is an average of actual earnings per week, without regard to hourly rate, as contrasted with the standard of subsection V(l), of the average hourly rate times forty hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">We are of the opinion that the claimant is correct in her argument that the case is controlled by subsection V(3) governing indeterminate work weeks. The decedent had no \u201cstraight time earnings\u201d by which his average hourly rate can be determined under V(l) (see <em>Cote </em>v. Company, 85 N. H. 444, 447), had no \u201cnormal schedule of hours\u201d V(2); and his hours of employment were in fact \u201cindeterminate.\u201d V (3). <em>Cf. Sprong </em>v. Academy, 99 N. H. 120, 124. The statute lends no support to the contention of the employer that an average hourly wage determined under the second sentence of subsection V( 1), should be used to determine an average weekly wage under subsection V(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The accuracy of the figures found by the Court are not in dispute. Since the claimant has seen fit to deduct the related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>expenses, it is unnecessary to determine whether the statute requires that they be deducted as sums \u201cpaid ... to cover any special expenses entailed on the employee by the nature of his employment\u201d within the meaning of RSA 281:2 IV, forbidding the inclusion of such sums in \u201cwages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The object of the statute is to compensate for lost earning capacity. <em>Bedard </em>v. <em>Public Service Co., </em>102 N. H. 349, 351; <em>Kacavisti </em>v. <em>Sprague Electric Co., </em>102 N. H. 266, 270. Taking the figure of $486.66 as the decedent\u2019s total net earnings in the service of this employer during fifty-two weeks and dividing it by \u201cthe actual number of weeks worked,\u201d as provided by subsection V(3), the decedent\u2019s average weekly earnings are seen to have been at least $60.83 as contended by the claimant. See 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, <em>ss. </em>60:20, 60:21. <em>Cf. Nelson's Case, </em>333 Mass. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Accordingly, the answer to the question transferred is that the claimant is entitled to the statutory maximum of $40 per week. Laws 1959, 187:12.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AT\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
