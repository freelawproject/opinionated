Trial by jury with a view resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">During the course of the trial the plaintiff excepted to the rulings of the Court admitting certain evidence. After verdict the plaintiff excepted to the denial of its motion for a new trial. These exceptions were reserved and transferred by Grant, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The principal issue raised here by the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions is whether the Court erred in permitting one of the principal owners of the property to testify on cross-examination what he paid for it in 1956, some five years prior to the taking. Objection was made on the ground it was too remote and not evidence of value at the time of the taking. Before permitting the witness to answer the Court instructed the jury that the sale price to the defendant was received as \u201csome aid to the jury in arriving at its ultimate answer,\u201d considering \u201cthe time [it] was made\u201d and \u201cwhether or not the property [was then] substantially similar. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The principal owner testified that he paid $19,000 for the entire property in 1956 which consisted of abandoned farm buildings and 32 acres of real estate. About a year later the plaintiff sold a one-acre portion with the buildings thereon for $14,000. The State took a five-acre strip across plaintiff\u2019s land as part of the land acquisition for the construction of the Exeter-IIampton Beach Expressway, which resulted in severing an 11-acre piece of the property on the rear from the main entrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The main exception argued here is whether the Court erred in permitting evidence of what the plaintiff paid for the entire tract some five years prior to the taking by the State of a five-acre section thereof. The competence of such evidence must depend on whether the time of such sale is so remote as to destroy its evidentiary value as an aid to the jury in arriving at the fair market value of the plaintiff\u2019s property before and after the taking. The great weight of authority, with which we agree, supports the view that it rests largely within the discretion of the Trial Court. 4 Nichols, Eminent Domain, <em>s. </em>12:311 [ 1 ]; Annot. 55 A.L.R. 2d 791; 29A C.J.S., Eminent Domain, 1203, <em>s. </em>273(5); 18 Am. Jur., Eminent Domain, 994, <em>s. </em>351; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>State, </em>103 N.

H. 119, 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">After the trial one of the jurors volunteered the information that \u201cthe jury during its deliberations discounted the damages suffered by the plaintiff by considering it likely that the plaintiff\u2019s expansion plans were hurriedly drawn up after its land had been condemned and solely for the purpose of enhancing its damages.\u201d It is well settled that testimony or affidavits of a jury are not admissible to impeach the verdict. This is so, not because they are irrelevant but because \u201cexperience has shown that they are more likely to prevent tiran to promote the discovery of the trudi . . . .\u201d <em>Blodgett </em>v. Park, 76 N. H. 435, 438; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Yeatman, </em>91 N. H. 150; <em>Eichel </em>v. <em>Payeur, </em>106 N. H. 484, decided this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The order therefore is</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled, judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A2C\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
