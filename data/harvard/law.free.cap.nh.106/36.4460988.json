Q., Canada, on September 2, 1961, while the defendant Gervais was operating a 1954 Dodge loaned to him on August 23, 1961, by a Colebrook garage operator named MacLean for use while Gervais\u2019 automobile was being repaired. Gervais, a resident of Colebrook, was employed in North Stratford, and the Dodge was furnished to him for his general use including transportation to and from work. There was evidence that it was furnished with no restriction upon its use; other evidence that he was forbidden to take the car to Canada; and still other evidence that he was told by the owner that he \u201cwould rather not have him take [the] car into Canada,\u201d and did not want him to take it to the \u201cHalf-Way House,\u201d an establishment over the Canadian line also known as the \u201cLine-House\u201d where liquors were served.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The defendant Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corporation excepted to the following findings of the Trial Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">\u201cThe Court finds that no mileage or geographic or use restrictions were imposed when the car was furnished, or subsequendy \u2014 other than those relating to the \u201cLine-House.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">\u201cThe Court finds that MacLean in substance, if not in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>exact words, stated that he would rather not have Gervais drive in Canada. It is found that this expression is not to be interpreted as a complete restriction upon driving in Canada. It was uttered in connection with the explicit injunction of not driving to the \u2018Line-House\u2019 in Canada. The Court finds that the Dodge car was operated on September 2, 1961 with the implied consent of MacLean.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The policy issued by the plaintiff to the defendant Gervais insured him against liability arising out of his use of other automobiles, subject to a provision that such insurance \u201cshall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance. \u201d At the time of the accident the automobile which Gervais was operating was insured by MacLean\u2019s garage policy issued by Employers\u2019, which furnished coverage to Gervais \u201cprovided the actual Use of the automobile [was] by the named insured or with his permission.\u201d Thus the chief issue presented turns upon the question of whether the findings of the Trial Court quoted above were warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Examination of the record indicates that they were. Gervais testified that the Dodge was loaned to him by MacLean after he told MacLean that he needed a car to go back and forth to work; and that nothing was said to him about not operating it in Canada. MacLean, on the other hand, testified that he told Gervais he could use the car around Colebrook, but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want him to go up in Canada.\u201d He gave as the reason that \u201ca lot of the fellows go up to Halfway [House] . . . and coming back they are involved in accidents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The defendant Lynch testified that no restrictions were placed by MacLean on Gervais\u2019 use of the car, denied that he had previously stated that MacLean said he \u201cwould rather not have [Gervais] take the car into Canada,\u201d but testified that MacLean \u201cdidn\u2019t want him to go to the Halfway [House].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">It was undisputed that the defendants Gervais and Lynch did not go to Halfway House, but went to Sherbrooke, some distance beyond the Canadian line, and approximately fifty miles from Colebrook; and that the accident occurred in Lennoxville, two miles south of Sherbrooke. There was no evidence that intoxicating liquors played any part in causing the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u201cFrom the evidence as a whole we think that the [Court] could properly find that the use being made of the ahtomobile when the accident occurred was impliedly ... a permitted use. <em>Standard &amp;c.
