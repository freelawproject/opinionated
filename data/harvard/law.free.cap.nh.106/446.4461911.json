The memorandum expressed the further opinion that the ordinance might constitutionally be applied to prohibit the distribution of matter of a commercial nature and that the defendant\u2019s pamphlet was not of such a nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>By his brief filed in this court, the defendant has withdrawn his objection to the nol pros \u201csince a judicial review is taking place anyway.\u201d The substance of his position is contained in the following statement of his brief: \u201cIt is my belief that a fundamental right of any person subject to a law, is to know the law\u2019s meaning, and to have any doubts or questions about the law\u2019s constitutionality settled. The County Attorney\u2019s Memorandum of Law presumably rules out further arrests by the police at this time, but it is no assurance that the ordinance will not be applied under future County Attorneys, or that Complaints will not be filed by private citizens leading to further convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aj7\">In effect the defendant seeks a declaratory judgment or advisory opinion establishing that the ordinance is invalid as applied to his conduct, although the State no longer claims the conduct to have been a violation. The law is plain that the relief which the defendant seeks will not lie in the circumstances disclosed. The State now makes no claim of any rights adverse to those asserted by the defendant. \u201cThere is no right to an adjudication of matters not in contention.\u201d <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Water Resources Board, </em>89 N. H. 346, 349. <em>Cf. Faulkner </em>v. <em>Keene, </em>85 N. H. 147. In this situation a petition for declaratory judgment will not lie. The law is also plain that advisory opinions cannot be given by this court on the petition of private individuals. Const., Pt. II, <em>Art. </em>74. See <em>Petition of Turner, </em>97 N. H. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
