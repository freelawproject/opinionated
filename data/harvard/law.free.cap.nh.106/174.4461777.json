Piper, 105 N. H. 418, 421. The plaintiff\u2019s exception to the order was sustained, however, as to his claim that the conveyance was fraudulently made for the purpose of depriving Ethel of her dower right. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Thereafter the plaintiff moved in the Superior Court for a \u201cnew trial\u201d on all issues upon the theory that the order of dismissal entered at the former trial deprived him of an opportunity to establish a prima facie case by cross-examination of witnesses which might otherwise have been called by the defendant. The defendant then moved that the trial be limited to the issue of \u201cintent to deprive the plaintiff\u2019s intestate of her dower rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The Court (Griffith, J.) denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion and granted the defendant\u2019s motion, \u201con the ground that the Supreme Court opinion in this case in effect constitutes a nonsuit on all issues except the issue stated in the defendant\u2019s motion.\u201d All questions raised by the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to this order were reserved and transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion was properly denied. While evidence necessary to a plaintiff\u2019s case may be supplied after erroneous denial of a nonsuit, and thus preclude a directed verdict founded upon deficiencies in the plaintiff\u2019s evidence <em>(Gagnon </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>69 N. H. 264, 268), it obviously does not follow that a plaintiff is entided to a new trial because an order of dismissal, properly entered, has deprived him of an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses which the defendant might or might not have called had the motion been erroneously denied. The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The defendant\u2019s brief properly supports the ruling of the Trial Court. It further suggests that the bill now be dismissed upon the assumption, contrary to our prior holding, that die plaintiff\u2019s intestate became entided to dower upon her husband\u2019s decease <em>(cf. </em>2 Tiffany, Real Property (3d ed.) <em>s. </em>533, <em>p. </em>422; <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>14 Vt. 107), and that she thereafter released it under RSA 560:11. \u201cA question of law once decided in a cause is not reexamined in the same case except upon a motion for rehearing.\u201d <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>79 N. H. 259, 260. See also, <em>Derosier </em>v. <em>Company, </em>82 N. H. 405, 407. This is particularly so where the issue is not transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
