The defendants contend since RSA 507:9 requires that the action be brought in the county where \u201csome one of them resides,\u201d no suit lay in Rockingham county.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The plaintiffs filed no affidavits, but alleged at the hearing that they could prove the plaintiff Lawrence Stiles was a proper party and that the action could be brought in Rockingham county under section 9, <em>supra. </em>The defendants claim under Superior Court Rule 47 that the Trial Court erred as a matter of law in considering the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and denying the defendants\u2019 plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">It is well established here that the Superior Court has broad discretion to determine whether to waive its own rules and that its action is not reviewable except for abuse of discretion. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>91 N. H. 6, 8; <em>Timmins </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>103 N. H. 459. Upon the record before us, we cannot say as a matter of law that there was any abuse of discretion. It follows that the defendants\u2019 exception to the Court\u2019s ruling on the motion cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The order is</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AVC\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
