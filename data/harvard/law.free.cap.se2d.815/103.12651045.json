The complaint alleges that on July 15, 2016, Behdadnia entered into a sales agreement with Beavers for the purchase of a shopping mall plaza. In consideration of the sales agreement, Behdadnia\n     paid $5,000 in earnest money to Beavers and \"put[ ] up more than $450,000 dollars\" of the $525,000 purchase price. Behdadnia also paid for an environmental assessment of the property. Following a meeting between the parties to discuss expenses related to the ownership and management of the property, Behdadnia alleges that Beavers terminated the sales agreement. In response, Behdadnia sought specific performance of the sales contract. Paragraph 8 of the Sales Agreement for the property provides in part that\n     </p>\n     <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-11\">\n      If the sale of the Property contemplated hereby is not consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement due to any circumstances or conditions other than a default by Purchaser hereunder, the Earnest Money shall be refunded to Purchaser promptly upon request, and Purchaser may exercise such rights and remedies as many be provided for or allowed by law or in equity including, but not limited to, the right to sue for specific performance.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      Beavers moved to dismiss Behdadnia's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. After conducting a hearing,\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      the trial court entered an order granting Beavers' motion to dismiss the complaint. This appeal followed.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      Behdadnia first argues that the trial court erred in holding that his failure to tender the purchase price for the property barred his action for specific performance.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      Here, Behdadnia does not claim to have paid the purchase money in accordance with the terms of the contract. But Behdadnia claims in his verified complaint to have \"put[ ] up more than $450,000 dollars\" of the $525,000 purchase price.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      It is unclear whether this means that Behdadnia made an unconditional tender of the $400,000 (or more) due under the Sales Agreement. Ordinarily, when considering an appeal from an order on a motion to dismiss, we would construe this ambiguity in the complaint in Behdadnia's favor.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Racette\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3721126\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/318/171/#p171\">\n       318 Ga.

However, following a hearing on the matter, the trial court found that Behdadnia did not pay or tender the purchase money as called for under the sales contract. Because Behdadnia failed to include a transcript of that hearing, it is unclear to us whether the trial court relied on testimonial evidence outside of the pleadings in arriving at its conclusion, thus converting the motion to one for summary judgment.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Cox Enterprises, Inc. v.
