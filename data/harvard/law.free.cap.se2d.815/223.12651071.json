Under an indictment returned on November 19, 2015, Terence Beavers stands accused in the Superior Court of Cobb County of kidnapping, aggravated sodomy (two counts), and rape. Beavers filed a plea in bar, arguing that prosecution of the offenses, which involved a single attack twenty years earlier on March 26, 1994, was barred by the applicable statutes of limitation. After a hearing, the trial court rejected the plea in bar, based on a finding that the State had proved that the case falls within a Code section that tolls the statutory period of limitation applicable to certain offenses, including those charged in the subject indictment, \"when deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence is used to establish the identity of the accused[.]\" OCGA \u00a7 17-3-1 (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted Beavers's application for interlocutory review.

As referenced above, the General Assembly expressly provided, in Section 2 of the Act that established the DNA-identification tolling provision, that the Act would \"be effective on July 1, 2002, and apply to crimes which occur on or after July 1, 2002[.]\"<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The State's reliance on OCGA \u00a7 17-3-1 (d) is therefore futile with regard to crimes that occurred before the date specified in the 2002 Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-16\">The State disputes this, arguing that Section 2's effective date conflicted with language in the preamble to the Act identifying as the purpose of the Act \"to provide that a prosecution for serious violent offenses may be commenced at any time under certain circumstances[.]\"<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is no such conflict. That the offense at issue have occurred \"on or after July 1, 2002\" was plainly one of the \"certain circumstances\" expressly specified in the Act. At any rate, the preamble to an act, where the provisions of the preamble are not included in the body of the act, \"is no part [of the act] and cannot control the plain meaning of the body of the act.\" <em>State v.

Alternatively, the State argues that the statutory periods of limitation were tolled under the person-unknown tolling provision, OCGA \u00a7 17-3-2 (2),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> because \"it was not until the DNA match in 2014 that [Beavers] was positively confirmed to be the perpetrator.\"<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The record shows that the State raised the person-unknown tolling provision in connection with an earlier, later abandoned, indictment, but did not include it as a basis for tolling in the subject indictment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-17\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"227\" href=\"#p227\" id=\"p227\">*227</a>Under controlling authority, moreover, the person who committed a crime is not \"unknown\" within the terms of OCGA \u00a7 17-3-2 (2) simply because his identity has not been positively confirmed by forensic evidence.

As the Supreme Court of Georgia explained:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">The tolling exception to the statute of limitations cannot be based upon the subjective opinion of the district attorney as to whether there was enough evidence to file charges against a particular person. Otherwise, there would be tolling of the statute of limitations for routine investigation into a crime; the State could build a case against a non-murder suspect<sup>[</sup><footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <sup>]</sup> for five or ten years and then file charges when it believes that it has obtained sufficient evidence by claiming that the statute of limitations was tolled until that moment.

As noted above, the limitation period for rape did not expire <em>until March 2009</em> . We must leave it to others to explain why the victim's rape kit was not submitted to be tested for male DNA until March 2014. The denial of justice to the victim from this delay surely shocks the conscience.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
