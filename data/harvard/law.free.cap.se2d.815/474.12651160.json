Barber, appeals the June 12, 2017, order of the Circuit Court of Wood County dismissing the complaint she filed against the respondent and defendant below, Camden Clark Memorial Hospital Corp. (\"Camden Clark\"), alleging that it wrongfully disclosed her confidential mental health treatment records in a federal court proceeding. Having considered the parties' arguments, the submitted appendix record, and pertinent authorities, we find the circuit court erred by dismissing the complaint. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's order and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2014, Ms. Barber brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against Sedwick Claims Management Services alleging fraud in connection with the handling of a worker's compensation claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January 2016, during the federal proceeding, Sedwick, through its counsel, Frith Anderson &amp; Peak, served a subpoena duces tecum on Camden Clark requesting all of Ms. Barber's medical records. Specifically, the subpoena sought production of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     All Medical Records\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of Jill C. Barber ... generated by any and all health care providers which are in your possession; inclusive of correspondence, referrals, hospital admission sheets, patient intake and information sheets, progress notes, medical reports, discharge summaries, E.R. records, medical test results and data, medical opinions, physical therapy records, rehabilitation records, lab tests, radiology and x-ray reports (and/or films if specified)[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. Barber received notice of the subpoena but did not file a motion to quash nor object in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 8, 2016, Camden Clark responded to the subpoena by producing more than one thousand pages of documents including hospital records reflecting that Ms. Barber had received in-patient mental health\n   treatment when she was a teenager.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Frith, Anderson &amp; Peak provided copies of the medical records produced by Camden Clark to Ms. Barber's counsel on February 26, 2016. Ms. Barber's counsel did not review the documents, and Ms. Barber never informed her counsel of her mental health treatment as a teenager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 7, 2016, Ms. Barber was deposed in the federal court case. During her deposition, Ms. Barber was asked whether she had ever received any psychiatric or mental health treatment in her lifetime. When she replied \"no,\" she was confronted with her mental health records that had been produced by Camden Clark. Thereafter, Ms. Barber filed this action in the Circuit Court of Wood County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In her January 23, 2017, complaint, Ms. Barber alleged that Camden Clark breached its \"statutory and common law duty to restrict access to [her] mental health medical records, including those defined as 'confidential information' under [West Virginia Code] \u00a7 27-3-1 (2008).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Barber asserted that Camden Clark had disclosed her confidential information without her consent and without a court order as provided in West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1(b)(3). Ms. Barber also asserted a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Ms. Barber alleged she \"was in denial about her prior psychiatric treatment and did not inform anyone, including her attorney, that she had been treated for mental health as an adolescent\" and \"[u]pon being confronted with this confidential material\n   ... [she] suffered extreme emotional distress, humiliation and embarrassment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to the complaint, Camden Clark filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Camden Clark asserted that it had fully complied with the Medical Records Act, West Virginia Code \u00a7 57-5-4a to - 4j (1981) (hereinafter the \"Act\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.512\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), the corresponding federal regulation under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (hereinafter \"HIPAA regulation\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which govern a non-party hospital's response to a subpoena for medical records. Camden Clark argued that Ms. Barber's failure to plead a violation of the Act and the HIPAA regulation required dismissal of her complaint. Following a hearing on the matter, the circuit court entered an order on June 12, 2017, dismissing Ms. Barber's statutory and common law claims. The circuit court found that \"a patient cannot rely on the protections of West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1 to bring an action against a hospital that properly complied with West Virginia and/or HIPAA regulations in responding to a subpoena for the patient's medical records where the patient never raised an objection to the subpoena[.]\" Upon dismissal of her complaint, Ms. Barber filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our standard for reviewing a circuit court's dismissal of a complaint is well\n   established: \"Appellate review of a circuit court's order granting a motion to dismiss a complaint is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\" Syl. Pt. 2,\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. McGraw v.

As discussed above, the circuit court dismissed Ms. Barber's complaint based on its finding that Camden Clark had complied with certain statutory and regulatory provisions. When reviewing a legal question involving statutory interpretation, we also employ the de novo standard. As set forth in syllabus point one of\n   <em>\n    Appalachian Power Company v. State Tax Department of West Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2389419\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/195/573/\">\n    195 W.Va. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2389419\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/195/573/\">\n    466 S.E.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) : \"Interpreting a statute or an administrative rule or regulation presents a purely legal question subject to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\" Under this plenary standard, we consider the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Barber contends that the circuit court erred by finding that her mental health records were properly disclosed by Camden Clark pursuant to the Act and the corresponding HIPAA regulation. She argues that her mental health records were not subject to disclosure absent her written consent or a court order as provided in West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1(b)(3), the exception that would have allowed disclosure of her confidential mental health records during the federal proceeding. Ms. Barber further disputes the circuit court's finding that by failing to object to the subpoena, she authorized the disclosure of her confidential mental health records. Finally, she maintains that neither the Act, nor the HIPAA regulation, precludes an action against a hospital that discloses mental health records in violation of West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We have previously recognized that \" W.Va. Code, 27-3-1(a), provides for confidentiality of communications and information obtained in the course of treatment and evaluation of persons who may have mental or emotional conditions or disorders, subject to the exceptions set out in W.Va.Code, 27-3-1(b).\" Syl. Pt. 1,\n   <em>\n    State v.

We have also observed that \"[t]his [statute's] location in Chapter 27 relating to mentally ill persons ... suggest[s] that the legislature intended this confidentiality with regard to communication and information to be maintained between mental health professionals and their clients.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8579898\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/172/590/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8579898\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/172/590/\">\n    at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8579898\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/172/590/\">\n    309 S.E.2d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

With regard to the Act, we have stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [a]ny time a subpoena duces tecum is issued to require the production of hospital records as defined in W.Va. Code \u00a7 57-5-4a(a) (1981) (Repl.Vol.1997), whether such records are sought in connection with a hearing, deposition, trial or other proceeding, or are merely sought for inspection and copying, the requirements of W.Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 57-5-4a - 4j apply and must be followed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Syl. Pt. 3,\n   <em>\n    Keplinger v.

Under West Virginia Code \u00a7 57-5-4a(a) (1981),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[r]ecords\" means and includes\n   <em>\n    without restriction\n   </em>\n   , those medical histories, records, reports, summaries, diagnoses, and prognoses, records of treatment and medication ordered and given, notes, entries, X-rays, and other written or graphic data prepared, kept, made or maintained in hospitals that pertain to hospital confinements or hospital services rendered to patients admitted to hospitals or receiving emergency room or outpatient care. Such records shall not, however, include ordinary business records pertaining to patients' accounts or the administration of the institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis added). In this case, there is no dispute that Camden Clark complied with the statutory procedure for production of its records. The issue is whether Ms. Barber has a claim against Camden Clark because it included documentation of her mental health treatment in the records it produced although\n   no court order or written consent authorized the disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Relying upon the \"without restriction\" language in West Virginia Code \u00a7 57-5-4a(a) and the fact that the subpoena requested \"all medical records\" of Ms. Barber, Camden Clark reasons that it was required to disclose her mental health records. Because it complied with the Act and corresponding HIPAA regulation and because Ms. Barber never objected to the subpoena, Camden Clark argues that she has no cause of action for wrongful disclosure of her mental health records. In other words, Camden Clark contends that under these facts and circumstances, West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1 simply does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In considering the meaning of statutory provisions, we are guided by our rules of statutory construction.

However, those mental health records are also clearly deemed \"confidential information\" and not subject to disclosure under West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1(a) unless one of the exceptions set forth in West Virginia \u00a7 27-3-1(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   applies or the patient gives written consent as provided in West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-2 (2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, while the Act provides for the production of mental health treatment records pursuant to a subpoena, West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1 does not permit disclosure of those records unless one of its exceptions applies or the patient provides written consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Generally, \"[s]tatutes which relate to the same subject matter should be read and applied together so that the Legislature's intention can be gathered from the whole of the enactments.\" Syl.

Vol. 2012). However, contained somewhere within these records was a mental health admission which occurred at a predecessor hospital which petitioner failed to disclose to her counsel. As part of the production of her requested complete medical record and having been advised of no objection to their production, these records were produced as required by\n   West Virginia Code \u00a7 57-5-4a\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Petitioner's counsel admitted that he did not review the records upon production. There is no dispute about these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In spite of this not only lawful, but\n   <em>\n    statutorily required\n   </em>\n   act, the majority has seen fit to find that this action was violative of West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1 (Repl. Vol. 2013). Without so much as examining the context of West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1, nor attempting to square a hospital's seemingly competing obligation in responding to a subpoena contained in West Virginia Code \u00a7 57-5-4a\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., the majority concludes that the disclosure ran afoul of a statutory provision generally deeming mental health records confidential. The majority addresses the ostensibly conflicting provisions of the hospital record disclosure statutes by simply declaring the mental health confidentiality statute \"more specific\" and therefore predominant over the \"more general\" hospital record disclosure statute. An examination of both demonstrates that this canon of statutory construction-\"specific over general\"-is not only inapplicable but its misapplication creates a wholly untenable scenario as pertains to the ability to subpoena hospital or other medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   West Virginia Code \u00a7 57-5-4a through 4j was enacted in 1981 and outlines the procedure to be followed by hospitals and litigants with regard to subpoenas\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   for \"[h]ospital records.\" It provides that, for its purposes, hospital \"records\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    includes without restriction\n   </em>\n   , those medical histories, records, reports, summaries, diagnoses, and prognoses, records of treatment and medication ordered and given, notes, entries, X-ray, and other written or graphic data prepared, kept, made or maintained in hospitals that pertain to hospital confinements or hospital services rendered or patients admitted to hospitals or receiving emergency room or outpatient care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2057-5\">\n    W.

Nowhere does it exempt records which fall within its\n   <em>\n    unrestricted\n   </em>\n   definition which involve, more specifically, mental health treatment. The statutory scheme provides that to comply with a subpoena for such records, a hospital must produce \"a true and correct copy ... of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   records described in such subpoena.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2057-5\">\n    W.

It is clear given the tenor and language of this statute that it is intended to advise mental health facilities and providers that their records-in fact, the mere existence of them-are confidential. It places no undue burden on these facilities or providers to constrain their ability to disclose the very fact of or the details regarding their treatment of their entire patient or clientele base. The conditions under which these facilities may make disclosures regarding their treatment make it quite obvious that the statute is intended to provide guidance to such specialized facilities in producing records insofar as is necessary for purposes such as voluntary and involuntary commitment proceedings, commitment of criminal defendants, and National Instant Criminal Background Check System reporting. The entire purpose, therefore, of the statute is to provide limitations on and guidance to\n   <em>\n    mental health facilities\n   </em>\n   as to how and under what circumstances their very specialized records may be utilized in the course of rendering and reporting on mental health treatment or coordinating with other mental health entities or procedures.

To reach this result, the majority misapprehends the very statutory construction principles upon which it relies. First and foremost, \" 'it is the duty of the courts, in the construction of statutes, to harmonize and reconcile laws, and to adopt that construction of a statutory provision which harmonizes and reconciles it with other statutory provisions ....' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The majority opinion does just the opposite: it saddles Camden Clark with liability for merely adhering to a long-standing statutory procedure\n   <em>\n    expressly directed at the conduct of its business specifically\n   </em>\n   on the basis of a statute that applies to the obligations of very specific entities as part of an independent statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   More importantly, however, the specific canon of statutory construction the majority singularly utilizes to reach its result simply has no application. The canon of statutory construction requiring a specific statute to be \"given precedence\" over a general statutory provision applies only to \"inconsistent statutes which,\n   <em>\n    together, form a part of a\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    comprehensive body of law\n   </em>\n   ...\"\n   <em>\n    Carvey v.

The reason for this is obvious: in creating a comprehensive body of law, lawmakers are presumed to do so holistically, such that their contents should be read in harmony. There is no question that although these two statutes both address\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   the concept of medical records, they are by no means part of a comprehensive body of law. Rather, the mental health record statute is specifically part of a body of law\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   addressing \"mentally ill persons,\" and governing mental health facilities and providers. The hospital subpoena statute pertains\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   to a hospital's production of records in response to a subpoena, as part of our general laws regarding evidence and witnesses. Accordingly, the mental health confidentiality statute is not a \"more specific\" iteration of medical record production\n   rules. Rather, as pertains to a hospital producing medical records in response to a subpoena, the statutory scheme governing precisely that activity by that entity could not possibly be more specific to that activity or entity and plainly purports to preempt and govern that process exclusively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   It goes without saying that a hospital is not a mental health facility. That is not to say that such services may not be rendered in a hospital-obviously they can be. However, it is clear that a hospital is a medical facility of such breadth of service and operation that attempting to burden it-as an entity simply responding to a properly-issued subpoena-with statutory requirements that clearly pertain to the facilities and providers which exclusively deal with such matters is inequitable and not what the Legislature intended by enacting West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1. The best evidence perhaps of the Legislature's intended reach of the statute-even specifically as to mental health facilities or providers-is its most recent amendment, which permits the disclosure of such records pursuant to a subpoena insofar as the production is HIPAA-compliant, just as the records production at issue was.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senate Bill 543, effective June 5, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This Court has made clear that \"[i]n gleaning legislative intent, we endeavor to construe the scrutinized provision consistently with the purpose of the\n   <em>\n    general body of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    law of which it forms a part\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

These are not just empty\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   edicts to be doled out as window dressing for a particular resolution. These canons of statutory construction exist to ensure that this Court does not take an isolated statutory enactment and, despite all reason, practicality, and logic, apply it to situations to which it was never meant to apply. Rather than adhering to these precepts, the majority commingles statutes of differing specific subject matters and wholly different purposes, enacted separately as parts of entirely different statutory schemes. The result is much as one would expect: an entity which complied fully with those statutes specifically appertaining to it and its specific activity is now unwittingly subjected to liability for doing so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Apple CEO Tim Cook,\n    <em>\n     New User Protections\n    </em>\n    (CNN Television Broadcast June 4, 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    <em>\n     What is Mental Health\n    </em>\n    ?, Mental Health.gov,\n    <em>\n     https://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/what-is-mental-health\n    </em>\n    .

Code \u00a7 27-3-1. The hospital moved, and the lower court ruled on W.Va.R.Civ.P. Rule 12(b)(6) that W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1 cannot state a cause of action when W.Va. Code \u00a7 57-5-4a et seq. (subpoena for records) is followed. This Court respectfully disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Mental Health\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For far too long, mental health treatment has been stigmatized. Mental health treatment can include various neurological and psychological issues. It can include many different types of treatment and the records concerning it, including the myriad of mental health issues caused by the opiate epidemic, its treatment of addiction, as well as the mental health records generated from this treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Mental health includes \"our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. [it] is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mental Health can include alcoholism, depression, autism, and PTSD, and hundreds of other illnesses, far too numerous to cite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, mental health treatment and the records generated from the treatment are equal protection issues: mental health knows no age limitations, racial barriers, genetic make-up, and sadly, sometimes no cure. This case about the legal privacy of mental health records exposes just one more hurdle in the equal protection battle for those dealing with mental health treatment and records, and for those whose lives without protection run the risk of being further marginalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act hereinafter (\"HIPPA\") ( 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a-7c(a)(3)(B)(ii) ), protects disclosure of records and treatment, creating a federal privacy and liberty interest that deserves constitutional protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. In my opinion, this state's mental health statute ( W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1 ) implies a liberty interest that can be characterized as a \"right of privacy,\" consistent with HIPPA and W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1. This Court should protect the privacy of these records and recognize the interest of privacy for what it is. \"It is an interest (through codification of 27-3-1) which cannot be taken away without due process of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not long after I began my public service career as a West Virginia State Senator in 1982, I advocated for the bill to require\n   <em>\n    mental health\n   </em>\n   insurance coverage to be provided by insurance carriers in all state public employee insurance policies that offered\n   <em>\n    physical health\n   </em>\n   protection. The stigma on mental health concerns then, as now, were evident. In years to come, mental health coverage was, and is presently, covered under provisions of the public health insurance plan \"(PEIA)\" and other health insurance plans, as it should be, consistent with equal protection of health plans for mental health treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Statutory Backdrop\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   It was not until 2007 that the process for disclosure of confidential mental health information as defined by W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1(a), at issue herein, was added to our West Virginia Code. Unless one of the exceptions in W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1(b) as applied to the patient is met, or the individual has authorized the disclosure provided in W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-2 (2007)\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   a Court has approved same after the documents in question are presented to a Court for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review to determine through a \"balancing test\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   of interests as required by federal and state law, then mental health records can not be disclosed. These statutory requirements were not met in the case below.\n   <em>\n    Thus, the privacy of a citizen's record who had before sought mental health treatment was violated by disclosure. See\n   </em>\n   HIPPA; 42 U.S.C.A.\u00a7 1320(a) W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In this case, the courts are essentially balancing the interests of the mental health patients, a minority interest if you will, against a large provider of health care to see what kind of weight to give to each side of this case, with the weight of authority on the citizen's \"privacy\" side of the equation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    The Statutes in the Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The statutory construction governing disclosure of medical records ( W.Va. Code \u00a7 57-5-4a ) involves subpoenas and the compliance on its face of the subpoena' while the privacy contained in the specific code section controlling mental health records ( W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1 ) serves as a separate protection of privacy over and above the general subpoena (57-5-4a). If mental health records were released without the interpretation as made by the majority opinion, the provisions of 27-3-1(a) would simply lack any efficacy or meaning, and render protection (non-disclosure without consent or a court order) as if there were no statutory protection in W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1(a) at all. This was done below at the trial court level in Wood County by the granting of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it is this ruling which the majority reverses herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As the\n   <em>\n    dissenting opinion\n   </em>\n   discusses legislative intent, the undersigned does agree that an important part of statutory construction could be to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. Statutes\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   be interpreted the way they were intended by the legislature to be applied. However, we don't have any published \"legislative intent\" in our part-time West Virginia legislature\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , unless the legislative journals each day or committee notes could be considered such. In this regard, however, the Code Section on mental health record disclosure is a privacy statute and is required to be read co-terminously with other disclosure statutes of all other medical records. One needs little more than to be a strict constructionist to interpret W.Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1 as it is intended. The dissent is correct in emphasizing that \"it is the duty of the courts, in the construction of statutes, to harmonize and reconcile laws, and to adopt that construction of a statutory provision which harmonizes and reconciles it with other statutory provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Without the limitations and exceptions of W.Va.

P. 45 to subpoena an opposing party's medical records from a nonparty (as opposed to obtaining them by virtue of a release tendered by the party/patient), notice to the party/patient must occur sufficiently in advance of service of the subpoena to provide a reasonable opportunity for the patient/party to object to the request.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    In light of this amendment, the majority's opinion is self-limiting, applying only to those subpoena disclosures which have already occurred or will occur until the effective date of the amendment. The amendment notwithstanding, the practical ramifications of the majority's opinion are wholly unsettling and demonstrate how badly its analysis has missed the mark.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    It begs the question what expectations the majority had, if any, as to how a hospital should have handled subpoenas issued prior to its opinion. Was a hospital in receipt of a subpoena required to scour the hundreds or thousands of pages of medical records on a patient for any mere reference, \"record or characterization\" of any semblance of a \"mental health\" matter?\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-3-1\">\n     W. Va. Code \u00a7 27-3-1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). Mental health information per the language of the statute includes not only an obvious mental health hospital admission, but any \"record or characterization\" of mental health treatment. This would presumably include any reference thereto in a past medical history or list of medications (items which are included repeatedly in nearly every hospital document created during an admission). And what was the hospital to do upon discovering such references? The statute forbids disclosing that any such information even exists; therefore, potential options such as redaction, notifying the litigants or the court officer subpoenaing the information would not appear to have been viable options. Was the hospital simply to \"hide\" such information and pretend it never existed for fear of violating the statute? Was the hospital to risk non-compliance with the subpoena at the risk of being sued for even alerting the parties that certain information, though properly requested, will not be provided if it even exists? These are quagmires peculiar to hospital records because of their overwhelming breadth of content and volume that simply do not exist if a subpoena is being issued directly to a mental health facility or provider: obviously the entirety of that record is,\n    <em>\n     presumptively\n    </em>\n    , a matter which is subject to the statute, a fact well-known to and able to be addressed head-on by the litigants. (continued ...)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    That is not to say, obviously, that no cause of action lies for violation of West Virginia Code \u00a7 27-3-1. This Court has previously held that \"[t]here is a private tort cause of action for a violation of W. Va. Code, 27-3-1 [1977].\" However, such a cause of action under the statute lies only against those who are subject to the statute-mental health providers and facilities. Moreover, my position on the inapplicability of the statute to Camden Clark's production of medical records pursuant to a subpoena is in no way affected by Syllabus Point 3 of\n    <em>\n     R. K. v. St. Mary's Med. Ctr., Inc\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849577\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/229/712/\">\n     229 W.

First, as is obvious, the majority opinion does not address the viability of a common law tort claim.\n    <em>\n     R. K\n    </em>\n    . did not reference in any fashion the statute at issue. More importantly, however, the absence of liability in this instance is not premised on HIPAA preemption.
