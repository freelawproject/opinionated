POWELL\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) allows a natural gas company to gain access to private property for the purpose of conducting surveys and other activities that are only necessary for the selection of the most advantageous route. We further consider whether the trial court in this case misapplied Code \u00a7 56-49.01 and, if so, whether a natural gas company's subsequent entry onto the property to conduct activities authorized by the trial court results in an illegal taking of private property without compensation under Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC (\"ACP\") is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. It was organized for the purpose of \"operating as a natural gas company as defined by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717a.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, ACP is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") under the Natural Gas Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20717\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presently, ACP is engaged in the regulatory approval process to build a natural gas pipeline that would extend from West Virginia, through the Commonwealth, to North Carolina. As part of this process, ACP sought to conduct surveys, tests, appraisals, and other examinations on the properties located along its proposed route. William Barr, Melissa Barr, Mary J. Hoffman, Nancy Holstein, Hazel H. Rhames, Trustee and Joseph L. Rhames, Trustee (collectively, the \"landowners\") own or are trustees for real properties along this proposed route.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 6, 2015, ACP mailed the landowners certified letters seeking permission to enter their properties to conduct preliminary surveys and other activities. When the landowners withheld their consent, ACP sent notices of intent to enter their properties pursuant to Code \u00a7 56-49.01. ACP then filed petitions for declaratory judgment against the landowners, seeking an order affirming ACP's authority to enter their properties \"for the limited purposes defined in Va. Code \u00a7 56-49.01.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The landowners demurred, asserting that (1) the allegations in ACP's petition \"fail to meet the pre-entry requirements of Va. Code \u00a7 56-49.01 ;\" (2) the activities authorized by Code \u00a7 56-49.01 are \"vague and overbroad\" and constitute a taking of private property that cannot be authorized by the legislature because such a taking violates the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia ; and (3) ACP is not a Virginia public service corporation and cannot exercise the power of eminent domain under Code \u00a7 56-49. After considering the parties' arguments, the trial court overruled the demurrers related\n   to the landowners' constitutional arguments. In its ruling, the trial court explained that entry under Code \u00a7 56-49.01 was not an unconstitutional taking because the statute did not provide ACP with an unlimited right of entry with regard to date, scope or duration. The trial court further noted that activities ACP sought to perform were not for a private use, as the transmission of natural gas serves a public purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 56-605 ; 15 U.S.C. 717(A). However, the trial court found that ACP's notices of intent to enter were deficient under Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) as they did not indicate the specific dates that ACP would enter the properties. Therefore, the trial court sustained the landowners' demurrer without prejudice on that limited basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 31, 2016, ACP filed its amended petitions for declaratory judgment. In its amended petitions, ACP acknowledged that it had not sent a new notice of intent to enter. However, ACP alleged that a new notice of intent to enter would be sent prior to entry. As an exhibit to its amended petitions, ACP included a template of its new notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The landowners again demurred, arguing that the amended petitions \"fail to establish that ACP is entitled to invoke the statutory powers for which it seeks entry of a declaratory order\" because ACP's amended petition did not allege that the activities were necessary to both satisfy regulatory requirements and to select the most advantageous route. According to the landowners, Code \u00a7 56-49.01 only permits entry to conduct activities for the purpose of satisfying both purposes. Additionally, the landowners asserted that the amended petitions failed to state an adequate claim for declaratory relief because, by only including a template of the new notice of intent to enter, ACP was seeking an advisory opinion. The trial court overruled the demurrers with regard to the statutory construction issue, but sustained the demurrers on the basis that the amended petitions did not state an adequate claim for declaratory relief. In its order sustaining the demurrer, the trial court granted ACP leave to file a second amended petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 6, 2016, ACP sent the landowners new notices of intent to enter. These notices indicated the various activities that ACP intended to perform and specified the date ranges that ACP intended to enter the properties to conduct these activities. The notices indicated that, due to the nature of the activities, two of them would take place approximately four months after the initial entry. ACP provided a specific date range that these activities would be carried out as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following day, on December 7, 2016, ACP filed its second amended petition for declaratory judgment. The landowners demurred, again arguing that the amended petition failed to state a claim under Code \u00a7 56-49.01 because ACP only alleged that the activities were for the purpose of selecting the most advantageous route. Additionally, the landowners' asserted that the notices of intent to enter were statutorily deficient under Code \u00a7 56-49.01 because the notices provided a range of dates upon which entry would occur. The trial court overruled the demurrers. The landowners subsequently filed responsive pleadings to ACP's petitions and the case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, ACP presented evidence that demonstrated its need to conduct activities in order to determine the most advantageous route for the pipeline. After ACP had presented its evidence, the landowners moved to strike, noting that Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) permits activities that are necessary for two reasons: to both satisfy regulatory requirements and to select the most advantageous route. As these provisions are separated by the word \"and,\" the landowners assert that these provisions must be read in the conjunctive. Therefore, according to the landowners, because ACP failed to present any evidence that the activities were necessary to satisfy any regulatory requirements, its petitions must fail. ACP argued that proper construction of the statute requires that the \"and\" separating the two provision be construed as\n   disjunctive, not conjunctive. After considering the parties' arguments, the trial court agreed with ACP, ruling that construing the operative language as disjunctive was the more logical reading of the statute. The trial court then granted ACP permission to enter the landowners' properties to conduct the necessary activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The landowners appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In their appeal, the landowners raise two issues. They first assert that the trial court erred in construing portions of Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) in the disjunctive, because the statute is written in the conjunctive. They also argue that by relying on improper facts and allowing ACP to conduct activities that are outside of the scope of the statute, the trial court misapplied Code \u00a7 56-49.01. According to the landowners, as a result of the trial court's misapplication of the statute, ACP's entry onto their property was outside the scope of the statute and thus amounted to an illegal taking of private property without compensation, in violation of Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In their first assignment of error, the landowners take issue with the trial court's construction of Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A). Specifically, the landowners argue that the trial court erred by construing the \"and\" separating the provisions delineated by romanettes (i) and (ii) in the statute as disjunctive rather than conjunctive. The landowners insist that, the word \"and,\" as used in this portion of the statute, must be read in the conjunctive. According to the landowners, the proper construction of the statute requires ACP to prove that its activities were necessary both \"to satisfy any regulatory requirements\" and \"for the selection of the most advantageous location or route, the improvement or straightening of its line or works, changes of location or construction, or providing additional facilities\" (collectively, \"route selection\"). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Issues of statutory construction are questions of law which we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Here, the determination of which activities to perform is left to the natural gas companies, as demonstrated by the fact that the inclusive list of activities is preceded by the auxiliary verb \"may.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. Co. v. Pulliam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2143850\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/185/908/#p916\">\n    185 Va. 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 916,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20S.E.2d%2054\">\n    41 S.E.2d 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (1947) (\"The word 'may' is prima facie permissive, importing discretion.\"). However, this discretion is not unlimited. By the plain language of the statute, a natural gas company may only conduct those activities that \"are necessary (i) to satisfy any regulatory requirements\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (ii) for the selection of the most advantageous location or route, the improvement or straightening of its line or works, changes of location or construction, or providing additional facilities.\" Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The General Assembly's use of the present indicative verb \"are\" preceding the word \"necessary\" is telling. It indicates that the activities the natural gas company seeks to conduct must be presently necessary as opposed to necessary at some future time. Had the General Assembly intended to allow activities based on future necessity, it would have used the future indicative verb \"will be.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Viewed through this prism, it is apparent that the language at issue must be read in the disjunctive. If the \"and\" separating the enumerated provisions were read in the conjunctive, natural gas companies could only conduct those activities necessary to satisfy both provisions. Yet, it is clear that not all activities necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements are also necessary for the selection of the most advantageous route, etc., and vice versa. Moreover, as the landowners have correctly pointed out, the need to satisfy regulatory requirements occurs at an entirely different time from the need to select and/or improve the pipeline and its route.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the few activities that are necessary to satisfy both provisions would not be necessary at the same time. Thus, by inextricably coupling the two enumerated provisions, any discretion granted to natural gas companies would be taken away for no discernible purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We further note that reading this language in the conjunctive would render certain\n   portions of the statute meaningless. For example, the second enumerated provision is comprised of four subparts which are written in the disjunctive. An activity may be deemed necessary under the second enumerated provision if that activity involves: (1) \"the selection of the most advantageous location or route;\" (2) \"the improvement or straightening of [a] line or works;\" (3) changing the location or construction of a pipeline; or (4) \"providing additional facilities.\" Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A). Logically, the improvement or straightening of a pipeline would occur after the pipeline has been built, as would changing the location of the pipeline and, to some extent, the construction of additional facilities. In other words, these activities would be conducted after, and independent of, the satisfaction of any regulatory requirements required to obtain the certificate. Thus, requiring that the activities of a natural gas company be necessary both for satisfying regulatory requirements and the several post-construction considerations would be completely unworkable. It is evident that the word \"and\" was used in this portion of the statute to indicate that a natural gas company may undertake activities necessary to address either of the enumerated provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We must also consider the nature of the enumerated provisions. The first enumerated provision is entirely objective, because an activity either is or is not necessary for the satisfaction of a regulatory requirement. The second enumerated provision, however, has a significant subjective component, which is eviscerated if mandatorily combined with the first enumerated provision. The second enumerated provision provides natural gas companies with access to conduct those activities that are \"necessary ... for the selection of the\n   <em>\n    most advantageous\n   </em>\n   location or route ....\" Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) (emphasis added). There is no set of universal factors that determine what makes one route or location more advantageous than another. Thus, the General Assembly has implicitly granted natural gas companies some discretion in determining which factors to weigh in selecting the most advantageous route. Similarly, there is no universal activity that would provide all of the necessary information to properly weigh each potential factor. Therefore, by granting natural gas companies the discretion to determine what makes one route or location more advantageous than another, the General Assembly has also implicitly granted natural gas companies the discretion to choose which activities are necessary to make such a determination, which is not limited to minimal federal regulatory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Reading the \"and\" separating these provisions in the conjunctive effectively eliminates this discretion, as a natural gas company would only be permitted to conduct those activities that are necessary to satisfy both provisions. The factors that a natural gas company could weigh in selecting the most advantageous route or improving the existing route would be limited to only those factors that are also necessary to satisfy the regulatory requirements. Such a construction of the statute would effectively eliminate any differentiation in the two enumerated provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   While not dispositive, our determination on this issue is further supported by the unique nature of Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A). Specifically, we cannot overlook the fact that, within the first sentence of this statute, the General Assembly has unequivocally used the word \"and\" in both the conjunctive and the disjunctive. Where the General Assembly has intended to permit the exercise of some level of discretion in this statute, it uses the word \"and\" in the disjunctive. Most notably, the \"and\" used in conjunction with the activities that may be performed is obviously written in the disjunctive. To interpret this \"and\" in the conjunctive would mean that a natural gas company could not gain access to the property to conduct a simple survey without first establishing that it was necessary to also conduct\n   other examinations, tests, hand auger borings and appraisals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In contrast, where the General Assembly has intended to foreclose any exercise of discretion in this statute, it uses the word \"and\" in the conjunctive, such as in the mandatory prerequisites that a natural gas company must perform before it can enter the property without the landowners' permission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20S.E.2d%2054\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (providing that employees of a natural gas company \"may enter upon any property without the written permission of its owner if (a) the natural gas company has requested the owner's permission to inspect the property, ... (b) the owner's written permission is not received prior to the date entry is proposed,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (c) the natural gas company has given the owner notice of intent to enter\") (emphasis added).

Any other construction would be counterproductive to the legislature's clear intent. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in its construction of Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B. Unconstitutional Taking\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The landowners next argue that the trial court failed to properly apply Code \u00a7 56-49.01 and, as a result, ACP's entry onto their properties amounts to an unconstitutional taking under Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia. The landowners have explicitly stated that they are not challenging the facial constitutionality of the statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument Audio at 9:56 to 10:07 (stating that they (the landowners) were \"not here arguing today that [ Code \u00a7] 56-49.01 is unconstitutional on its face\"); rather, their argument is expressly limited to whether the trial court improperly applied the statute and whether such improper application would result in a violation of Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In arguing that the trial court improperly applied Code \u00a7 56-49.01, the landowners assert that the trial court relied on improper facts in overruling their demurrers. Alternatively, the landowners claim that the trial court improperly allowed ACP to rely on the statute to conduct activities that were not permitted by Code \u00a7 56-49.01. Along these same lines, the landowners take issue with the duration of access to the properties that the trial court deemed permissible under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   1. Improper Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Addressing first the landowners' claims that the trial court relied on improper facts in deciding the landowners' demurrer, we note that the argument they raise revolves around the differences between ACP's allegations in its initial petition and those it made in its subsequent petitions. We note, however, that the landowners have failed to provide any citation in the record where this issue was raised to the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rules 5:17(c)(1) and 5:27(c) (requiring an exact reference to where the alleged error has been preserved for appeal). In their petition for appeal and their opening brief, the landowners cite only to their initial demurrer and the trial court's ruling on that demurrer. This issue was clearly not preserved at either of these locations, as there were no discrepancies between the petitions until ACP filed its amended petitions. Therefore, the issue could not have been raised to the trial court until after the amended petitions were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Moreover, a review of the entire record fails to reveal any indication that this issue was ever brought to the attention of the trial court. Rule 5:25 states that \"[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling.\" As it does not appear that this issue was ever brought to the trial court's attention, we hold it is not preserved for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   2. Activities Beyond the Scope of Code \u00a7 56-49.01\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The landowners next argue that the trial court permitted ACP to conduct activities that were not allowed by Code \u00a7 56-49.01. In making this argument, the landowners rely on a letter dated March 6, 2015, that ACP sent to the landowners and included in its petition as an attachment. The March 6, 2015 letter includes an outline of the survey process, which indicates that the process will include digging \"test areas approximately 1.5 feet wide x 1.5 feet deep, every 50 feet or so along the proposed pipeline route;\" collecting, cataloging and removal of \"any items of cultural interest;\" and clearing a path to see and walk. According to the landowners, \"[t]hese activities bear no resemblance to the activities allowed by Code \u00a7 56-49.01.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The landowners' reliance on the March 6, 2015 letter is misplaced. Notably, the March 6, 2015 letter represented ACP's request for permission to enter the property. In other words, the March 6, 2015 letter was an attempt by ACP to get the landowners' permission to conduct these activities; it was not a statement of the activities that would be conducted if entry was granted under Code \u00a7 56-49.01. Therefore, our analysis is not concerned with any of the activities described in the March 6, 2015 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Instead, we look to ACP's notice of intent to enter, dated December 6, 2016, which it sent after the landowners rejected its initial request for entry. The December 6, 2016 notice of intent to enter did not provide for \"test areas approximately 1.5 feet wide x 1.5 feet deep, every 50 feet or so along the proposed pipeline route;\" rather, ACP indicated that \"small, shallow holes may be dug, which will be promptly refilled and repaired.\" We fail to find any meaningful distinction between the small, shallow holes that ACP sought to dig from \"hand auger borings,\" which are expressly permitted under the statute. Similarly, the landowners fail to explain how clearing brush as part of the surveying process is a violation of the statute, when the statute allows ACP to conduct a survey. With regard to the disposition of any items of cultural significance that may be found, we note that December 6, 2016 letter explicitly disavows ACP's previous position providing for the removal of such items. Instead, the letter stated that items of cultural or historical significance would be \"immediately catalogued onsite and delivered\" to the landowner. It is unclear how merely cataloguing and delivering these items to the landowners could be considered a constitutional violation. Certainly such actions could not be considered a taking, as the artifacts are to be turned over to the landowners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, we cannot say that the trial court permitted ACP to conduct any activities that were outside of the scope of Code \u00a7 56-49.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   3. Use of Multiple Date Ranges Under Code \u00a7 56-49.01\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We also find no merit in the landowners' final argument that Code \u00a7 56-49.01 did not permit ACP to provide multiple date ranges for when it would conduct its activities. This Court has already addressed this argument, albeit from a slightly different perspective. In\n   <em>\n    Chaffins\n   </em>\n   , we addressed whether Code \u00a7 56-49.01 allowed a natural gas company to provide a notice of entry without giving the exact date of when the survey would take pace. In rejecting such open-ended notices, we explained that the notice requirements of Code \u00a7 56-49.01 provide an important purpose: they \"allow the landowner to be present during the tests if desired, arrange for livestock to be confined prior to the entry, and ensure that any property damage is documented.\" 293 Va. at 569, 801 S.E.2d at 191. Therefore,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   the requirement that a notice of intent to enter must \"set forth the date of the intended entry\" has an unmistakable meaning. The notice must provide the landowner with\n   <em>\n    dates certain\n   </em>\n   upon which the natural gas company intends to enter the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We further noted that focusing on the word \"date,\" as the landowners do in the\n   present case, \"\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   suggest that a natural gas company only has a 24-hour period to complete its surveys and tests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 571 n.1, 801 S.E.2d at 192 n.1 (emphasis added). However, we went on to explain that such an interpretation is erroneous because, when the word \"date\" is read in context, it is clear that \" Code \u00a7 56-49.01(C) only requires that a notice of intent to enter provide a limited range of dates as is necessary to complete the surveys and tests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, the December 6, 2016 notice of intent to enter explained that completion of the surveys and other activities would require multiple crews over several days. The notice provided a limited set of dates, the majority of which overlapped, when each crew would be present. As the landowners have not challenged these date ranges as being unreasonable, we cannot say that the date ranges provided by ACP's notice of intent to enter violated the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Having determined that the trial court's application of Code \u00a7 56-49.01 was not improper in this case, we do not reach the question of whether the improper application of the statute could amount to an improper taking in violation of Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717a(6) defines \"natural gas company\" as \"a person engaged in the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, or the sale in interstate commerce of such gas for resale.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    The trial court made no ruling on the landowners' third argument which related to Code \u00a7 56-49.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    This same proposition has been recognized by several courts throughout the country.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The second \"necessary\" precondition is that the company wants to enter onto the private property to decide whether it will later take the property using the power of eminent domain. This conjunctive has-to/wants-to test delicately balances the rights of private property owners against the public's interest in efficient and reliable energy infrastructure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Agreeing with Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC (\"ACP\"), the majority holds that \"and\" means \"or\" in Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) and thus concludes that satisfying precondition (ii) renders it unnecessary to satisfy precondition (i). After making this emendation, the majority concludes: \"As it is undisputed that ACP meets the definition of a natural gas company under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717a, the General Assembly has extended the privilege to enter land in the possession of another, provided that such entry falls within the scope of the authority granted by the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 788. In plain speech, this statement means that it is sufficient that an out-of-state pipeline company\n   <em>\n    wants to\n   </em>\n   enter onto private property against a landowner's will (to determine whether to take the property) even though it does not\n   <em>\n    have to\n   </em>\n   do so in order to satisfy regulatory requirements. Under this view, it does not matter that the pipeline company has never been granted a federal permit to build the pipeline or even that the company has never applied for one. All that matters is that the pipeline company qualifies as a natural gas company under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717a(6) and wants to enter the private property to figure out whether to one day build a pipeline across it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   All of this reasoning, as well as its conclusion, collapses if \"and\" means \"and.\" I think that it does. According to the plain meaning of the statute, ACP must satisfy both preconditions before it may lawfully conduct a physical survey on private property against a landowner's will. Because ACP could not prove at the time that the circuit court ruled that entering private property against the landowner's will was \"\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   ... to satisfy any regulatory\n   <em>\n    requirements\n   </em>\n   ,\" Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) (emphases added), I dissent from the majority's reasoning and result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As a general rule, one cannot unlawfully enter real property against a landowner's will. For centuries, the law has deemed such action a trespass and has subjected the trespasser to civil, and sometimes criminal, liability. Anglo-American law has an unbroken record of treating private property ownership as a fundamental right, one that serves as a pillar upon which many, if not most, other rights depend. \"This view presupposes that an essential 'interdependence exists between the personal right to liberty and the personal right in property.

As it has in other contexts, the General Assembly has vested the pipeline company with the sovereign's power to override the landowner's common-law right to exclude the public, thereby converting the company from a trespasser into a lawful licensee. The fact that the license comes from the legislature rather than the landowner is of no consequence, of course, so long as the company has not exceeded its delegated sovereign authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A), the General Assembly did not purport to delegate its inherent police power to ACP, and ACP does not claim to be acting pursuant to such delegated authority. Instead, the legislature predicated the entire enterprise on the premise that the pipeline company's entry onto private property-both for purposes of surveys and later construction-would be constitutionally justified by the power of eminent domain. This premise explains why Code \u00a7 56-49.01(D) provides for recovery of \"actual damages\" resulting from the survey entry, a remedy wholly unnecessary in the police-power context where compensation is unavailable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 794 &amp; note 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We recently addressed these issues in\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   .

The Restatement of Torts, which we relied upon in\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   , confirms this interpretation. It classifies the common-law privilege to enter another's land for survey purposes as an \"entry pursuant to legislative duty or authority\" and states that, if a \"legislative enactment\" creates a \"duty or authority\" to enter another's land, an actor is privileged to enter that land \"in so far as the entry is reasonably necessary\" to perform such duty or to exercise such authority \"if, but only if, all the requirements of the enactment are fulfilled.\" Restatement of Torts \u00a7 211, at 529 (emphasis and capitalization omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In other words, \"[i]n order that the actor may avail himself of the statutory privilege, it is necessary that all the provisions of the statute ... by way of condition precedent to entry on his part, shall have been complied with.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   cmt. j, at 532-33.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Thus, if\n   <em>\n    any one of the requirements\n   </em>\n   imposed by the enactment is not fulfilled, although the accomplishment of the purpose of the enactment may not thereby be invalidated, the actor is subject to liability to the possessor for his entry and for all harm resulting ... and the actor's privilege to continue on the land to complete the accomplishment of his purpose ceases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   cmt. i, at 532 (emphasis added).

FERC issued a certificate to ACP in October 2017, three months after our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, according to the majority, we could not have meant what we said about the eminent-domain rationale underlying Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) because \"ACP was not vested with eminent domain authority\" at the time of our decision and thus \"our holding could not have been premised on the exercise of that federal eminent domain authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 788 note 4. This reasoning fails for at least two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   First, like the present case,\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   was an appeal of a declaratory judgment action. Both our Court and the circuit court were asked to declare the future rights of the parties based upon the present law.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cherrie v.

We did just that by predicating ACP's right of entry under Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) on it being vested with the power to exercise \"eminent domain authority.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   , 293 Va. at 581-83, 801 S.E.2d at 418-19. \"\n   <em>\n    Most relevant to the present case\n   </em>\n   ,\" we said, an earlier Code provision similarly \"granted entry-for-survey authority to 'any company' vested with eminent domain authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 583, 801 S.E.2d at 419 (emphasis added) (alteration and citation omitted). Our analysis focused on this \"[m]ost relevant\" point,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , because we were answering the legal question not under past circumstances only, but also under circumstances that would arise in the foreseeable future as well-including those arising three months later when ACP ultimately obtained a FERC certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Second, the majority states that \"it is clear that our holding was based entirely on the General Assembly's decision to specifically extend the privilege to natural gas companies under Code \u00a7 56-49.01, regardless of the prior issuance of a FERC certificate.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 788 note 4. This statement exposes the conceptual error at the heart of the majority's analysis-not because the statement is wrong, but rather misunderstood. Our holding in\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   was of course \"based entirely on ... Code \u00a7 56-49.01,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 788 note 4. So is my dissent in this case. The question then and now is how to interpret Code \u00a7 56-49.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   observed that statutory rights of entry have traditionally been granted to entities \"\n   <em>\n    vested\n   </em>\n   with eminent domain authority,\"\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   , 293 Va. at 583, 801 S.E.2d at 419 (emphasis added), not only to entities actually \"\n   <em>\n    exercis\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    ing\n   </em>\n   ] ... that federal eminent domain authority,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 788 note 4 (emphasis added), at the time of the nonconsensual entry. This traditional view explains precondition (i) in Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) and shows how excising it from the statute-by interpreting \"and\" to mean \"or\"-erroneously leaves precondition (ii) as the only remaining, rather feeble, check on the power of a pipeline company to enter private property against a landowner's will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Given this background, I cannot accept the majority's assertion that \"and\" means \"or\" in Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A).

As ACP conceded at oral argument, there is \"no C.F.R. provision\" requiring a pre-certificate survey against a landowner's will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument Audio at 26:57 to 28:32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In the context of Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A), the first precondition to the right of entry-that the entry be \"necessary (i) to satisfy any regulatory requirements\"-fits securely within the constitutional justification for the statute that we explored at length in\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   . The FERC regulations encourage on-site surveys prior to obtaining a certificate so long as the landowner consents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Revision of Existing Regulations Under Part 157 and Related Sections of the Commission's Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20FERC%20P61%2C297\">\n    88 FERC P61,297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1999 FERC LEXIS 2056, at *74-76, *84-85 (1999) (\"[W]e understand that if access to the property is denied by the landowner, comments for the areas to which access has been denied would be filed after the certificate is issued.

Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) grants a pipeline company the power to supersede a landowner's will only after the company has received a certificate because only then does the Natural Gas Act vest the company with the power of eminent domain,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h). The pipeline company's nonconsensual survey is a statutory precursor to the actual exercise of that power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The word \"and\" between preconditions (i) and (ii) of Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) means exactly what it says. Its plain meaning squares the text of the statute with the constitutional justification for it under the power of eminent domain that we explained in\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   . Reading the statute to wholly dispense with precondition (i) undermines the constitutional legitimacy of the statutory scheme. Doing so allows a pipeline company without a FERC certificate (even a pipeline company that has not even applied for a certificate) to enter private property against a landowner's will. In this respect, the majority's reasoning has no limiting principle. Any natural gas company, as defined by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717a(6), apparently now has a legal right to overrule a landowner's common-law right to exclude trespassers so long as the company thinks that doing so might help it decide whether, and if so, where, to build a future pipeline. Given the jealous protection that our law has traditionally afforded property rights, I cannot presume that the General Assembly intended that we transpose \"or\" in place of \"and\" to reach this result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In support of its disjunctive interpretation, the majority relies primarily on a single Virginia case,\n   <em>\n    South East Public Service Corp. of Virginia v.

The\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   predicate qualifying both preconditions amplifies the natural understanding of \"and\" to truly mean \"and.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   I acknowledge the majority's footnote 3, listing 37 out-of-state cases recognizing that \"and\" can mean \"or\" and vice versa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 786 note 3. No doubt that is sometimes true.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Scalia &amp; Garner,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 116-25 (describing certain \"nuances\" to the general conjunctive/disjunctive canon that stem from \"negatives, plurals, and various specific wordings\" (emphases omitted) ). But this transposition is still an exception to the general rule. There are likely thousands of cases in which courts interpret \"and\" to mean \"and\" without explaining why. The linguistic default is that \"and\" is conjunctive and \"or\" is disjunctive. It is only the anomalous cases in which courts transpose these words that require an explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   A review of these 37 cases will show that not one of them has an explanation applicable to our case. Not one interprets a statutory text like Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) that imposes preconditions on a legal license authorizing an action (such as a trespass) that, absent the license, would otherwise be unlawful. Thus, none of these cases refute the view that the gravity of granting such a license counsels a cautious, not expansive, reading of the statute. Nor do these cases involve statutory texts like Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) that include items in a conjunctive list, separated by romanettes, and introduced as \"necessary\" preconditions. A list of \"necessary\" prerequisites connotes a collective\n   <em>\n    necessity\n   </em>\n   , not a smorgasbord of options from which one can pick and choose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Perhaps most important, not one of these 37 cases was decided by a Virginia court. And our own precedent provides sufficient clarity on this issue. As noted earlier,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 798-99, in\n   <em>\n    South East Public Service Corp.\n   </em>\n   we recognized that there may be anomalous textual circumstances where \"and\" can legitimately mean \"or.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1963641\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/165/116/#p122\">\n    165 Va. at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=181%20S.E.%20448\">\n    181 S.E. at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But we emphasized that a judicial transposition of \"and\" to \"or\" should only occur \"[w]hen, and\n   <em>\n    only when\n   </em>\n   , necessary to effectuate\n   <em>\n    the obvious intention\n   </em>\n   of the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=181%20S.E.%20448\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases added) (citation omitted). The only time that we ever find such a textual anomaly to exist-making it obvious that \"and\" should mean \"or\"-is when \"the legislative intent would be\n   <em>\n    completely aborted\n   </em>\n   if the conjunctive words in th[e] statute are not construed as disjunctive.\"\n   <em>\n    Industrial Dev.

The majority offers four cascading arguments as to why that circumstance exists here. I find none of them persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The majority begins with the assertion that \"the legislative intent behind Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A)... is obvious on the face of the statute: to grant natural gas companies access to private property for the purpose of conducting certain activities related to the possible construction of a natural gas pipeline.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 787. That may be the general idea, but the question that we must answer is more specific: Did the legislature intend to confer on a pipeline company the power to enter private property against a landowner's will\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   FERC grants the company the power of eminent domain? The majority answers this question with several brief observations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   If the \"and\" separating the enumerated provisions were read in the conjunctive, natural gas companies could only conduct those activities necessary to satisfy both provisions. Yet, it is clear that not all activities necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements are also necessary for the selection of the most advantageous route, etc., and vice versa.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 788. This logic does not follow. It assumes that the General Assembly cannot require both preconditions (i) and (ii) because each of those subsections may demand something that the other does not. Perhaps so. But what difference does that make? Would we not expect that stating preconditions (i) and (ii) separately would emphasize their separate requirements?\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Not in this case, the majority answers, because \"the\n   <em>\n    need\n   </em>\n   to satisfy regulatory requirements occurs at an entirely different time from the\n   <em>\n    need\n   </em>\n   to select and/or improve the pipeline and its route.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 788 (emphases added). This ambiguous assertion contributes little to the argument. The \"select and/or improve\" timeline,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 788, spans an indeterminate period before and after the issuance of a FERC certificate. The only question that we should be asking is whether some administrative regulation creates a need-a\n   <em>\n    regulatory need\n   </em>\n   -for a pipeline company to enter private property against a landowner's will when selecting a proposed pipeline route. The answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As noted earlier,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 796-98 and accompanying footnotes, the FERC pre-certificate application regulations do not require a pipeline company to enter private property against a landowner's will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20157.8\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20157.8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 380.12(a)(2), (f)(2)(ii) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20157.8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 385.2013.

The majority's need-sequencing argument thus relies on the unproven assumption that a pipeline company needs to have unauthorized access to private property prior to obtaining a FERC certificate that would authorize that very access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Next, the majority contends that interpreting \"and\" in its ordinary conjunctive sense \"would render certain portions of the statute meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 788-89. As the majority correctly observes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 789, precondition (ii) itself lists several different disjunctive reasons for entering private property. Some occur early in the process (e.g., \"the selection of the most advantageous location or route\"), and some long afterwards (e.g., \"improv[ing] or straightening ... a line or works,\" \"changing the location or construction of a pipeline,\" or \"providing additional facilities\").\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 789 (alteration omitted) (quoting Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) ). From that observation, the majority concludes that \"these [later] activities would be conducted after, and independent of, the satisfaction of any regulatory requirements required to obtain the certificate.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 789.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The error in this thinking is that precondition (i) refers generally to \"regulatory requirements,\" Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A), not solely to the \"regulatory requirements required to obtain the certificate,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 789. The Natural Gas Act requires pipeline companies to maintain, as well as obtain, a FERC certificate to sell and transport natural gas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(c)(1). This provision also prohibits a pipeline company from engaging in the \"construction or extension of any facilities\" for the transportation or sale of natural gas without a certificate of public convenience and necessity \"authorizing such acts or operations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20157.8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the Natural Gas Act requires further certificates (and thus surveys) for the modification or extension of existing facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, regulatory requirements could arise even after the initial certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As a fallback, the majority states that \"[e]ven if there were still regulatory requirements that needed to be satisfied after the construction of the pipeline,\" Code \u00a7 56-49.01\"would no longer be necessary, because any activities necessary for the satisfaction of regulatory requirements after the pipeline was built would likely be limited to the property to which the natural gas company already has access, i.e., the property occupied by the pipeline.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 789 note 7. I do not agree. Precondition (ii) of Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) permits surveys necessary for \"changes of location or construction\" and \"providing additional facilities\" for an existing pipeline. Both justifications could easily necessitate surveys of private property outside of the previously condemned strip or on adjacent property not subject to any prior condemnation order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 801 &amp; note 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Continuing, the majority states that \"[w]e must also consider the nature of the enumerated provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 789. The first is\n   \"entirely objective\" (whether an activity is necessary to satisfy a regulatory requirement or not), while the second \"has a significant subjective component\" (determining \"the most advantageous location or route\").\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 789 (emphasis and citation omitted). From that accurate observation, the majority concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Reading the \"and\" separating these provisions in the conjunctive effectively eliminates [a pipeline company's] discretion, as a natural gas company would only be permitted to conduct those activities that are necessary to satisfy both provisions. The factors that a natural gas company could weigh in selecting the most advantageous route or improving the existing route would be limited to only those factors that are also necessary to satisfy the regulatory requirements. Such a construction of the statute would effectively eliminate any differentiation in the two enumerated provisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 789.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   This argument simply assumes its own conclusion: Because a pipeline company has the discretion to figure out where the pipeline should go or how to improve it, it should also have the discretion to enter private property against a landowner's will. Under this view, imposing Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) 's first precondition-which limits entry onto private property to the extent \"necessary (i) to satisfy any regulatory requirements\"-means that a pipeline company cannot use its discretion to enter onto private property against a landowner's will when no \"regulatory requirements\" make it \"necessary\" to do so, Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A). That result, I agree, is exactly what precondition (i) does. What I do not understand is why the majority believes that simply stating that result means that it cannot be true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The majority's only answer appears to be that \"by inextricably coupling the two enumerated provisions, any discretion granted to natural gas companies would be taken away for no discernible purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 788. No discernible purpose? What about the legislative purpose to withhold from a pipeline company the legal license to trespass onto private property when no \"regulatory requirements\" make it \"necessary\" to do so, Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) ? This limitation, it seems to me, is the primary, easily discernable purpose of the first precondition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The majority adds that the second precondition would be \"eviscerated\" if combined with the first.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 789. How is that so? A pipeline company can weigh as many discretionary factors as it deems prudent in making the determination that a survey of a particular parcel is necessary to select the most advantageous route for a pipeline or to improve an existing pipeline. Imposing the additional requirement that the survey also be necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements does not preclude the use of any discretionary factors that a pipeline company can consider in making the subjective determination that precondition (ii) requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, the majority asserts that its conclusion \"is further supported by .... the fact that, within the first sentence of this statute, the General Assembly has unequivocally used the word 'and' in both the conjunctive and the disjunctive.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 789. Apparently this observation is an invitation to compare and contrast other uses of the word \"and\" in \"the first sentence of this statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 789. If so, I accept that invitation and point out that immediately following the phrase at issue in this case is another phrase using \"and\" that lists three items with parenthetical subdivisions. This phrase states that a pipeline company\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   may enter upon any property without the written permission of its owner if (a) the natural gas company has requested the owner's permission to inspect the property as provided in subsection B, (b) the owner's written permission is not received prior to the date entry is proposed,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (c) the natural gas company has given the owner notice of intent to enter as provided in subsection C.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) (emphasis added). There can be no doubt that the \"and\" in this example means \"and,\" not \"or.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaffins v. Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=293%20Va.%20564\">\n    293 Va. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647987\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/801/189/#p191\">\n    801 S.E.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191 (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this phrase lists the necessary conditions for a nonconsensual entry, it is highly analogous to the phrase used just a few words earlier in the same sentence and at issue here, undermining the majority's reliance on the various uses of \"and\" in this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In sum, the intent of Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) would not be \"completely aborted,\"\n   <em>\n    La France Cleaners &amp; Laundry Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2124968\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/216/277/#p281\">\n    216 Va. at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=217%20S.E.2d%20879\">\n    217 S.E.2d at 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , if we interpreted \"and\" to mean \"and\" in this statute. If anything, the opposite is true. Judicially substituting \"or\" in place of \"and\" in the phrase at issue here decouples the right of nonconsensual entry from its constitutional justification under the power of eminent domain. It subordinates the ancient common-law rights of private property owners to the commercial interests of a pipeline company that is under no legal requirement to enter onto another's land. And it effectively authorizes a foreign pipeline company that has neither applied for, nor received, a FERC certificate to trespass onto private property within the Commonwealth based solely on the company's self-interest in determining the location of a future pipeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    APPENDIX TO DISSENTING OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    McCurdy v.

At that time, ACP had not received the required Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (\"certificate\") from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") authorizing the construction of the pipeline. ACP filed a declaratory judgment action against the landowners seeking a judicial declaration of its right to survey their properties prior to obtaining the FERC certificate. In its final order, the circuit court held that Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A) authorized ACP's pre-certificate surveys. ACP thereafter entered the landowners' properties to conduct surveys. The landowners appealed, arguing that the pre-certificate surveys violated Code \u00a7 56-49.01(A). In October 2017, after we had granted the landowners an appeal to consider this case, FERC issued ACP a certificate. No party has suggested that the post-judgment FERC certificate has mooted any issue on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    Though similar, \"the foundations of the police power and the power of eminent domain\" rest on different footings.\n    <em>\n     Mumpower v.
