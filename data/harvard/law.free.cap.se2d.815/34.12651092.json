I am doubtful that it allowed the punishment imposed here. But the petitioner cannot prevail on the claims she actually brought even if her right to free speech was violated, and so I concur in the denial of the writ of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Kelly Tucker, a public school teacher in Tift County, engaged in a written debate on Facebook regarding the Black Lives Matter movement. The exchange became heated and racially charged; after another participant addressed her with an epithet, Tucker posted a lengthy message dismissive of the movement and derogatory of \"thugs.\" See\n   <em>\n    Atwater v. Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12649114\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/807/56/#p302\">\n    343 Ga.

This message was plainly about a topic of public concern, with no obvious link to her employment in public education. In this procedural posture (reversal of the denial of summary judgment), we assume that Tucker posted the message on her own time and on her own computer, and without referencing her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nevertheless, people viewing the debate who disagreed with the viewpoint she expressed discovered she was a teacher and complained to a local elected official, Tucker's principal, and the local school superintendent. The school administration determined that the message Tucker posted was offensive and decided to punish her. They eventually suspended her for five days and required her to participate in diversity training. Tucker did not avail herself of her right of administrative appeal; instead, she filed a lawsuit against the superintendent and the school board chair alleging claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 USC \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of her First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court of Appeals held that the school officials were entitled to qualified immunity because they did not violate any clearly established law. I agree that there does not appear to be any clearly established law in this jurisdiction that the school officials violated. Indeed, Tucker doesn't cite a single case to that effect from this Court, the Eleventh Circuit, or the United States Supreme Court, which are the only courts that can clearly establish law for this jurisdiction, and I haven't found any. Accordingly, the school officials are entitled to qualified immunity, and I concur in the denial of the writ of certiorari. Nevertheless, I write separately to express my grave concerns that the school officials may well have violated Tucker's First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court of Appeals observed that the familiar balancing test derived from\n   <em>\n    Pickering v.

But it's not obvious to me that the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   balancing test applies to public employee speech cases when the employee speaks on his or her own time about matters unrelated to his or her employment; or, at least, it's not obvious that the balancing test applies normally to potential disruption caused by public reaction to the employee speaker's viewpoint.

This has raised a significant question as to how\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   applies to speech by public employees that neither implicates employment nor occurs during the work day. See Randy J. Kozel,\n   <em>\n    Free Speech and Parity: A Theory of Public Employee Rights\n   </em>\n   , 53 WM. &amp; MARY L. REV. 1985, 2035-2039 (2012) (\"What is not entirely clear is how the First Amendment treats speech that bears no connection, physical or conceptual, to the speaker's employment.\"); Mary-Rose Papandrea,\n   <em>\n    The Free Speech Rights of Off-Duty Government Employees\n   </em>\n   , 2010 BYU L. REV. 2117, 2130-2135 (\"The Court's cases leave unclear what sort of First Amendment protection attaches to expressive activities of off-duty public employees. Specifically, it is unclear whether all such speech must involve a matter of public concern to receive any First Amendment protection at all and whether the degree to which the expression is related to work affects the strength of any such protection.\"). I do not propose an answer to that significant question here-I simply note that it exists, and that the existence of such a question should counsel government employers to act with considerably more caution in such cases than the Court of Appeals' opinion would suggest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   American courts have long been jealous guardians of the right to free speech. And at the core of the First Amendment's protection\n   of speech is a firm command that government must not engage in viewpoint discrimination. Indeed, \"[i]f there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\"\n   <em>\n    W.

Tucker's Facebook screed does not strike me as possessing any redeeming social value. But the First Amendment does not turn on whether a judge or society as a whole believes a particular viewpoint is worth sharing. Indeed, \"[i]f there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas v.
