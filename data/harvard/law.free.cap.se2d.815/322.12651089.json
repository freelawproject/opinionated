The City argues that it should have been protected from suit by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Alternatively, the City argues that the trial court should have granted its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because longstanding precedent bars the plaintiffs' nuisance claim, crime is not a legal nuisance, and the City cannot be liable for discretionary nonfeasance. We agree that the City is protected from suit here by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and accordingly reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Sheryl Stanford and Wilfred Foster, individually and as co-administrators of LeSheldon Stanford's estate (\"Plaintiffs\"), allege that although the City of Albany issued an occupational tax certificate to a business known as Brick City to operate as a recording studio and multi-purpose entertainment facility, the business was actually operating as a night club and was serving alcohol without a license. The police became aware of these facts and also learned of several fights that occurred at the location. There were also numerous incidents of drug use and sex involving minors occurring at the location. Because of these problems, the police reached out to the City's code enforcement division in an attempt to shut the business down. Police also raided the business, uncovering evidence of alcohol sales, weapons, and drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following this incident, the chief of the City's code enforcement division met with Brick City's owners (the Lovings) and advised them of the changes that were required for their business to operate in conformance with its license. However, following numerous complaints regarding the same problems at Brick City, police executed another search warrant, uncovering evidence of alcohol, drugs, and weapons once again. Daniel Loving was arrested for possession of marijuana, and a citation was issued for selling alcohol without a license. The City's code enforcement division then began preparing a recommendation for revocation of Brick City's licenses. However, no City commission hearing on the recommendation occurred, and the business continued to be re-licensed because the district attorney's office and/or police department decided to further investigate possible criminal activity occurring at the business. Violent crime continued to occur there. Plaintiffs allege that as a result of the dangerous conditions at Brick City, of which the City was aware, LeSheldon Stanford was shot and killed by another individual outside the establishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following the murder, Plaintiffs brought suit against the City of Albany and the Albany Board of City Commissioners\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for nuisance, and Daniel and Molly Loving for various negligence claims. After trial, a jury returned a verdict for Plaintiffs, awarding them $15,200,000, and apportioning 70% of the fault for those damages to the City. The trial court entered judgment on the verdict against the City for $10,640,000, which represented 70% of the total verdict. The City filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial, which the trial court denied following a hearing. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"On appeal from the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, this court must determine whether, construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party who obtained the jury verdict, there is any evidence to support the jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Holland v.
