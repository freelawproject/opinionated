Gilchrist appeals from the decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Because the Veterans Court correctly determined it lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Gilchrist\u2019s appeal, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Mr. Gilchrist seeks \u201cbenefits at 100% unemployable.\u201d This request was originally denied by the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in 2010, and Mr. Gilchrist appealed the decision to the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board). The Board remanded the appellant\u2019s claim to the RO for further consideration and development. Mr. Gilchrist filed a Notice of Appeal from the Board\u2019s decision. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Citing our decision in <em>Kirkpatrick v. Nicholson, </em>417 F.3d 1361 (Fed.Cir.2005), the Veterans Court held the Board\u2019s remand was not a final decision. Accordingly, the Veterans Court dismissed Mr. Gilchrist\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Veterans Court explained Mr. Gilchrist\u2019s response did \u201cnot adequately address the issue of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the instant appeal.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Infr. Br. App. 1. The Veterans Court indicated that, \u201c[i]f and when a final Board decision is issued on remand, any matter determined in such a decision may be appealed to this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Gilchrist appeals the dismissal of the Veterans Court to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">The jurisdiction of this court to review Veterans Court decisions is limited by statute. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. We have jurisdiction to review a decision \u201cwith respect to the validity of a decision of the [Veterans] Court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the [Veterans] Court in making the decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). If an appeal does not present a constitutional issue this court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">The Veterans Court correctly determined it lacked jurisdiction to review Mr. Gilchrist\u2019s appeal related to his disability rating. \u201cSection 7252(a) provides jurisdiction for the Veterans\u2019 Court to review \u2018decisions of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals.\u2019 Our case law and section 7104(d)(2) define a Board decision as including an order granting appropriate relief or denying relief.\u201d <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>417 F.3d at 1364 (remand for additional exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>nation is not a \u201cdecision\u201d). The Board\u2019s remand is not a final decision within the meaning of 88 U.S.C. \u00a7 7252(a). The Board order must either grant or deny the veteran\u2019s request for relief to constitute a final decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In this case, the Board remanded Mr. Gilchrist\u2019s claim to the RO for further consideration and development. Like <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>the remand order here did not grant or deny relief to Mr. Gilchrist. Because Mr. Gilchrist\u2019s remand order is not a final decision, the Veterans Court correctly determined it lacked jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">To the extent Mr. Gilchrist asks us to review facts concerning his disability rating, we lack jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). We have considered Mr. Gilchrist\u2019s other arguments and find them not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
