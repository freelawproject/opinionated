This Court should not extend the qualified privilege for emergency vehicles to hazard vehicles. <em>(McDonald v State of New York, </em>176 Misc 2d 130; <em>Saarinen v Kerr, </em>84 NY2d 494; <em>Somersall v New York Tel.

II. The 1974 amendments to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1103 (b) did not expand the qualified privilege provided for emergency vehicles under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104 to hazard vehicles. <em>(Stanton v State of New York, </em>26 NY2d 990; <em>Saarinen v Kerr, </em>84 NY2d 494; <em>Strobel v State of New York, </em>36 AD2d 485, 30 NY2d 629; <em>Thain v City of New York, </em>35 AD2d 545, 30 NY2d 524; <em>Dunn v State of New York, </em>34 AD2d 267.) III. The statutory language of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1103 (b) specifically limits the qualified privilege for hazard vehicles to parking restrictions provided for in subdivision (a) of section 1202 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. IV. Even assuming that a qualified privilege exists for hazard vehicles under Vehicle and Trafile Law \u00a7 1103 (b), it would only apply to \u201crules of the road\u201d violations. <em>(McDonald v State of New York, </em>176 Misc 2d 130; <em>Bliss v State of New York, </em>179 Misc 2d 549; <em>Gonzalez v Iocovello, </em>93 NY2d 539; <em>Szczerbiak v Pilat, </em>90 NY2d 553; <em>Sorensen v Nazarian, </em>175 AD2d 417; <em>Kelley v State of New York, </em>24 AD2d 831, 21 NY2d 901; <em>Gurecki v State of New York, </em>18 Misc 2d 527; <em>Malanify v Pauls Trucking Co., </em>27 AD2d 622, 19 NY2d 804; <em>Gaynor v State of New York, Dept. of Pub.

In particular, we are asked whether Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1103 (b) exempts statutorily defined \u201chazard vehicles\u201d engaged in highway work from the \u201crules of the road,\u201d and whether it limits the liability of their owners and operators to reckless disregard for the safety of others. We conclude that defendants correctly read the statute, and we hold \u2014 as did the courts before us \u2014 that the vehicles here were exempt from the rules of the road and their liability limited to reckless conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\n<em>Riley v County of Broome</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Defendant Garwood A. Young, an employee of the Broome County Highway Division, was operating a street sweeper on West Colesville Road in the Town of Kirkwood. Young was driving two or three miles per hour, with the sweeper straddling the shoulder and the road. Plaintiff Betty Riley was also driving on West Colesville Road, in the same direction as the street sweeper. As Riley reached the top of a hill, she saw a \u201chuge patch of fog\u201d \u2014 actually a cloud of dirt and dust created by the sweeper \u2014 and collided with the sweeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Riley and her husband brought this action against Young and the County, alleging that the sweeper caused the accident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>At trial, the court held \u2014 over Riley\u2019s objection \u2014 that, under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1103 (b), the applicable standard of care was whether defendants conducted themselves \u201cin such a way so as not to recklessly disregard the safety of others.\u201d The court then charged the jury on that standard. The jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants, finding no recklessness in the operation of the sweeper. In a comprehensive opinion by Justice Anthony J. Carpinello, the Appellate Division affirmed, holding that under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1103 (b), all vehicles engaged in \u201chighway maintenance\u201d are exempt from the rules of the road and subject only to a recklessness standard (263 AD2d 267, 273).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\n<em>Wilson v State of New York</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Claimant John Wilson was driving west from Canajoharie to Utica on Route 5, traveling at 30 to 35 miles per hour. Moderate to heavy snow was falling, rendering visibility poor. Two snowplows owned by the State were operating near the intersection of Route 5 and Route 167, one behind the other in the eastbound passing lane on Route 5. As Wilson approached the intersection, the first snowplow stopped to make a wide turn, and the second snowplow \u2014 driven by William Hunt\u2014 made a left turn inside the first plow in an attempt to enter Route 167 North. Although Hunt looked, he did not see Wilson\u2019s car approaching, and his snowplow collided with Wilson\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Wilson then brought the present action against the State of New York. The case proceeded to trial before the Court of Claims. At the close of the evidence, the State moved to dismiss, arguing that Wilson had failed to establish that the accident was the result of recklessness. The court granted the motion, holding that a recklessness standard applied because the snowplow was involved in work on a highway within the meaning of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1103 (b), and that the evidence was insufficient to meet that standard. The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that since the snowplow qualified as a vehicle \u201cactually engaged in work on a highway\u201d under section 1103 (b), the recklessness standard applied, and the evidence failed to establish that Hunt had acted recklessly (269 AD2d 854).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The \u201cHazard Vehicle\u201d Exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">On appeal to this Court, Riley and Wilson (claimants) contend that Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1103 (b) does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>exempt \u201chazard vehicles\u201d \u2014 like snowplows and street sweepers \u2014 from the rules of the road.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, they assert that section 1103 (b) exempts such vehicles only from the stopping, standing and parking regulations of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1202 (a). We agree with the trial courts and the Appellate Division that section 1103 (b) exempts all vehicles \u201cactually engaged in work on a highway\u201d \u2014 including the vehicles here\u2014 from the rules of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Some degree of risk, of course, is inherent in travel on public highways. Certain classes of vehicles \u2014 like snowplows and street sweepers \u2014 are intended to minimize the risk by keeping the roadways clean and safe for everyone. While serving an important public function, however, those vehicles may themselves cause risks to ordinary motorists with whom they share the road. Over the years, courts and legislatures have struggled to define the rules under which these vehicles may operate and the standard of care they owe to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">At common law, all vehicles, including emergency vehicles, were held to an ordinary negligence standard <em>(see, e.g., Farley v Mayor of City of N. Y., </em>152 NY 222, 227-228 [1897]; <em>Garrett v City of Schenectady, </em>268 NY 219, 223-224 [1935]; <em>Ottmann v Village of Rockville Centre, </em>275 NY 270, 273 [1937]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the common law also recognized that the level of care owed by emergency and road work vehicles must be tempered by the nature of their work. Fire trucks, for instance, were permitted to drive at the \u201cgreatest practicable speed,\u201d since the \u201csafety of property and the protection of life may * * * depend upon celerity of movement\u201d <em>(Farley v Mayor of City of N. Y., supra, </em>at 227). In addition, many emergency vehicles were, by statute, given the right of way <em>(see, id.). </em>Nevertheless, the common law required that such vehicles exercise their right of way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u201cwith care and. caution * * * measured by the purpose and necessity of the right\u201d <em>(Hashey v Board of Fire Commrs. of Roosevelt Fire Dist, </em>192 NYS2d 767, 769-770 [Sup Ct, Nassau County]).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In 1957, the Legislature enacted what is now title VII of the Vehicle and Traffic Law (\u00a7 1100 <em>et seq.), </em>creating a uniform set of traffic regulations, or the \u201crules of the road\u201d <em>(see, </em>L 1957, ch 698). That legislation was intended to update and replace the former traffic regulations, and bring them into conformance with the Uniform Vehicle Code adopted in other states <em>(see, </em>Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1957, ch 698, at 35-37).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Vehicle and Traffic Law states that the rules of the road apply to all vehicles unless otherwise provided by law <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7\u00a7 1101, 1103 [a]). Except for the provisions regarding driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, however, the rules of the road explicitly do <em>not </em>apply to \u201cpersons, teams, motor vehicles, and other equipment while actually engaged in work on a highway\u201d (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1103 [b]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 1103 (b) adds that Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1202 (a), which regulates stopping, standing and parking, does not apply to \u201chazard vehicles while actually engaged in hazardous operation on or adjacent to a highway but shall apply to such persons and vehicles .when traveling to or from such hazardous operation.\u201d Similarly, Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104 exempts \u201cemergency vehicles,\u201d such as ambulances, police vehicles and fire vehicles <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 101), engaged in emergency operations from the rules of the road, subject to specified conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The language of these statutes seems clear: all vehicles \u201cactually engaged in work on a highway\u201d \u2014 just as all emergency vehicles engaged in emergency operations \u2014 are exempt from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the rules of the road. In the cases at hand, the street sweeper and the snowplow were engaged in \u201cwork on a highway.\u201d The street sweeper was cleaning the street; the snowplow was clearing the road during a snowstorm. Thus, the Appellate Division correctly held that section 1103 (b) exempts both vehicles from the rules of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We reject claimants\u2019 contention that designated \u201chazard vehicles\u201d are exempt <em>only </em>from the stopping, standing and parking regulations of section 1202 (a), even when they are engaged in work on a highway. Section 1103 (b) says no such thing. Rather, by its plain language, section 1103 (b) excuses all vehicles \u201cactually engaged in work on a highway\u201d from the rules of the road, regardless of their classification. To be sure, the statute also gives protection to designated \u201chazard vehicles\u201d engaged in \u201chazardous operation\u201d (as defined by sections 117-a and 117-b), excusing them from the stopping, standing and parking rules of section 1202 (a). But the statute nowhere states that \u201chazard vehicles\u201d are a distinct class from \u201cwork vehicles,\u201d nor does it deny \u201chazard vehicles\u201d the special protection given to all vehicles actually engaged in road work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The legislative history of section 1103 (b) confirms this plain language reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">We note at the outset that it is appropriate to examine the legislative history even though the language of section 1103 (b) is clear. The primary consideration of courts in interpreting a statute is to \u201cascertain and give effect to the intention of the Legislature\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 92 [a], at 177). Of course, the words of the statute are the best evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent. As a general rule, unambiguous language of a statute is alone determinative <em>(see, Matter of Washington Post Co. v New York State Ins. Dept., </em>61 NY2d 557, 565). Nevertheless, the legislative history of an enactment may also be relevant and \u201cis not to be ignored, even if words be clear\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 124, at 252). \u201c When aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no \u201crule of law\u201d which forbids its use, however clear the words may appear on \u201csuperficial exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ination\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(New York State Bankers Assn. v Albright, </em>38 NY2d 430, 437). Pertinent also are \u201cthe history of the times, the circumstances surrounding the statute\u2019s passage, and * * * attempted amendments\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 124, at 253). Varying concerns may bear on the weight to be given legislative history <em>(see generally, </em>Abner J. Mikva and Eric Lane, An Introduction to Statutory Interpretation and the Legislative Process, at 27-41 [1997]), but they do not justify abandoning this Court\u2019s long tradition of using all available interpretive tools to ascertain the meaning of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Here, the history of section 1103 (b) explicates the legislative intention to create a broad exemption from the rules of the road for all vehicles engaged in highway construction, maintenance or repair, regardless of their classification. In 1954, the Committee that proposed the original version of the statute stated that the law was intended to exempt from the rules of the road all teams and vehicles that \u201cbuild highways, repair or maintain them, paint the pavement markings, remove the snow, sand the pavement and do similar work\u201d <em>(see, </em>1954 NY Legis Doc No. 36, at 35). Thus, the exemption turns on the nature of the work being performed (construction, repair, maintenance or similar work) \u2014 not on the nature of the vehicle performing the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Further, the legislative history shows that the reference to \u201chazard vehicles\u201d in section 1103 (b) is wholly unrelated to the provision excusing vehicles engaged in road work from the rules of the road. Notably, the original version of section 1103 (b), enacted in 1957, exempted vehicles \u201cengaged in work on a highway\u201d from the rules of the road, and did <em>not </em>contain any separate provisions concerning hazard vehicles <em>(see, </em>L 1957, ch 698, \u00a7 4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In 1970, the Legislature amended the Vehicle and Traffic Law to create the \u201chazard class\u201d of vehicles, enacting section 117-a defining hazard vehicles, and amending section 1103 (b) to exempt hazard vehicles from the standing, stopping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>and parking regulations <em>(see, </em>L 1970, ch 197). The Memorandum in Support of that amendment explained that it was intended to clear up confusion as to the meaning of different \u201cflashing colored lights,\u201d and thus four distinct classes of vehicles were created (emergency vehicles, hazard vehicles, privately owned vehicles of volunteer firemen and privately owned vehicles of volunteer ambulance drivers), each of which is identified by a different colored flashing light <em>(see, </em>Bill Jacket, L 1970, ch 197, at 4). The amendment was not intended to curtail the exemption for any vehicles \u2014 including \u201chazard vehicles\u201d \u2014 engaged in work on a highway <em>(see, </em>Dugan Letter, Bill Jacket, L 1970, ch 197, at 16 [noting the exemption of hazard vehicles and emergency vehicles from the rules of the road]).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Thus, we conclude that section 1103 (b) exempts from the rules of the road all vehicles actually engaged in work on a highway, including the \u201chazard vehicles\u201d in the cases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The Standard of Care</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">We next turn to the standard of care owed to other drivers by vehicles \u201cactually engaged in work on a highway.\u201d Originally, section 1103 (b) provided such vehicles with an unqualified exemption from the rules of the road <em>(see, </em>L 1957, ch 698, \u00a74). In a 1974 amendment, the Legislature added the following sentence to that section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">\u201cThe foregoing provisions of this subdivision shall not relieve any person, or team or any operator of a motor vehicle or other equipment while actually engaged in work on a highway from the duty to proceed at all times during all phases of such work with <em>due regard for the safety of all persons </em>nor shall the foregoing provisions protect such persons or teams or such operators of motor vehicles or other equipment from the consequences of their <em>reckless disregard for the safety of others\u201d </em>(L 1974, ch 223, \u00a7 1) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The legislative history explains that this amendment was designed to soften the outright exemption of vehicles engaged in road work from the rules of the road, allowing them to drive at any speed or in any manner \u201cwhich suits their fancy, without any prohibition from the Vehicle and Traffic Law\u201d <em>(see, </em>Mem of Senator Frank Padavan, Bill Jacket, L 1974, ch 223, at 4). For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>example, under the original version of the statute, \u201ca snow plow could be operated well above the speed limit and through red lights * * * without regard for the safety of other persons\u201d (Mem of Dept of Motor Vehicles, Bill Jacket, L 1974, ch 223, at 7). The Legislature therefore amended section 1103 (b) to impose <em>\u201ca </em>minimum standard of care\u201d on operators of such vehicles (Padavan Mem, <em>op. cit, </em>at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In <em>Saarinen v Kerr </em>(84 NY2d 494), we held that Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104 (e) \u2014 which contains identical language requiring emergency vehicles to act with \u201cdue regard for the safety of all persons\u201d and holding drivers responsible for \u201cthe consequences of [their] reckless disregard for the safety of others\u201d \u2014 imposes a standard of recklessness. Specifically, this Court held that, under section 1104 (e), a plaintiff seeking to recover for injuries caused by an emergency vehicle must show that \u201c \u2018the actor has intentionally done an act of an unreasonable character in disregard of a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow\u2019 and has done so with conscious indifference to the outcome\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 501 [quoting Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 34, at 213 (5th ed)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Section 1103 (b) imposes the same recklessness standard on vehicles actually engaged in work on a highway. The language here is the same language that we held in <em>Saarinen </em>to impose a recklessness standard. To be sure, as claimants point out, the statute uses the phrase \u201cdue regard\u201d as well as \u201creckless disregard\u201d to describe the standard. But as we stated in <em>Saarinen, </em>\u201cthe Legislature\u2019s specific reference to * * * <em>reckless disregard </em>* * * would be unnecessary and, in fact, inexplicable if the conventional criterion for negligence \u2014 reasonable care under the circumstances \u2014 were the intended standard\u201d <em>(Saarinen v Kerr, supra, </em>at 501) (emphasis in original). Thus, \u201cthe only way to apply the statute is to read its general admonition to exercise \u2018due care\u2019 in light of its more specific reference to \u2018recklessness\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at 501-502; <em>see also, Bliss v State of New York, </em>95 NY2d 911 [decided today]).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">We decline claimants\u2019 invitation to read the \u201cdue regard\u201d and \u201creckless disregard\u201d language in section 1103 (b) differently from our reading of those very words in section 1104 (e). As a general principle of statutory construction, \u201cwhenever a word is used in a statute in one sense and with one meaning, and subsequently the same word is used in a statute on the same subject matter, it is understood as having been used in the same sense\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 236, at 402).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Nor is there anything in the context or history of the statutes indicating that different meanings were intended. In fact, the history of section 1103 (b) confirms that the Legislature intended to subject vehicles engaged in road work to the same standard of care as emergency vehicles. The Attorney General\u2019s memorandum in support of the 1974 amendment states that the bill \u201cextends the standard of care presently applicable to drivers of authorized emergency vehicles under \u00a7 1104 * * * to persons engaged in maintenance and hazardous operations\u201d (Lefkowitz Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1974, ch 223, at 2). In addition, Senator Padavan\u2019s supporting memorandum states that the amendment imposes a standard \u201csimilar to that imposed on operators of authorized emergency vehicles\u201d (Padavan Mem, <em>op. cit., </em>Bill Jacket, at 4). Many other memoranda in the bill jacket confirm this understanding <em>(see, </em>Department of Transportation Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1974, ch 223, at 5; Department of Motor Vehicles Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1974, ch 223, at 6; New York State Police Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1974, ch 223, at 8; Association of Towns Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1974, ch 223, at 10). Undeniably then, the 1974 amendment was intended to subject vehicles engaged in road work to the same recklessness standard applicable to emergency vehicles under section 1104 (e) <em>(see, McDonald v State of New York, </em>176 Misc 2d 130, 139 [Ct Cl]).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Claimants urge that, as a matter of logic and fairness, vehicles engaged in road work should not enjoy the same level of protection as emergency vehicles, like police cars, fire trucks and ambulances. As we stated in <em>Saarinen, </em>the protection given to emergency vehicles under section 1104 (e) \u201crepresents a recognition that the duties of police officers and other emergency personnel often bring them into conflict with the rules and laws that are intended to regulate citizens\u2019 daily conduct,\u201d and that emergency personnel require a \u201cqualified privilege to disregard those laws where necessary to carry out their important responsibilities\u201d <em>(Saarinen v Kerr, supra, </em>at 502). The Court recognized, however, that giving emergency personnel this qualified privilege \u201cwill inevitably increase the risk of harm to innocent motorists and pedestrians,\u201d and \u201cwill necessarily escalate the over-all risk to the public at large\u201d \u2014 an increased risk justified by the necessity of accomplishing an \u201cimmediate, specific law enforcement or public safety goal\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 502).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">As claimants point out, it is unclear that the increased risk to the public is similarly justified for all vehicles engaged in road work. Indeed, criticizing protections given to non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>emergency vehicles under pre-1957 law, the Joint Legislative Committee that was convened to revise the Vehicle and Traffic Law also observed that the \u201creason for extending emergency privileges to non-emergency vehicles * * * is not apparent. * * * The danger to highway users and true emergency vehicles is greatly increased by the special status which is unnecessarily given to non-emergency vehicles\u201d (1954 NY Legis Doc No. 36, at 35). The trial court in <em>Gawelko v State of New York </em>(184 Misc 2d 581 [Ct Cl]) echoed that concern, questioning the present law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201cWhy, for example, should rural letter carriers or tow truck drivers be permitted, in the course of their work, to speed, drive on the wrong side of the road, ignore pedestrian rights and vehicular rights-of-way, and disregard traffic signs and signals \u2014 all without sirens or lights being employed \u2014 while the driver of an ambulance or civil defense vehicle must employ both lights and bells or sirens in order to be exempt from any rules of the road?\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at 584; <em>see also, Cottingham v State of New York, </em>182 Misc 2d 928, 942 [Ct Cl].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Apt as those concerns may be, the Legislature has spoken clearly, giving vehicles engaged in road work the benefit of the same lesser standard of care as emergency vehicles. Any change in that standard, therefore, must come from the Legislature, not the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Work Area</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Finally, there is no merit to claimants\u2019 argument that the protections of section 1103 (b) apply solely to vehicles operating in a designated \u201cwork area\u201d as defined in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 160. Section 1103 (b) states that a vehicle \u201cactually engaged in work on a highway\u201d is exempt from the rules of the road. The statute does not require that a vehicle be located in a designated \u201cwork area\u201d in order to receive the protection. Significantly, section 160 was not enacted until 1984 \u2014 long after section 1103 (b) was adopted. Thus, there is no credible argument that the Legislature only had designated \u201cwork areas\u201d in mind when it adopted section 1103 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Claimants\u2019 remaining arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Accordingly, in each case the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">In each case: Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\">.
