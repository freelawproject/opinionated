The question before us today is whether <em>Darden </em>established a requirement, or merely a procedure to be allowed in the discretion of the trial court. We reiterate that a <em>Darden </em>hearing is a requirement rather than a matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">This case arises out of the December 1, 1993 shootings of Milton Clarke (an auxiliary police officer) and Chester Martin. Clarke died as a result of the shooting; Martin survived but lost a leg. On March 18, 1994, a confidential informant \u2014 a witness in an unrelated homicide \u2014 saw a reward poster in a New York City Police Department station house concerning the shootings. The informant told Detective Neenan that a person he knew as \u201cTony\u201d had confessed to him that he had committed the crimes. The informant gave a description of \u201cTony\u201d and told Detective Neenan other details about the shootings. In addition, the informant stated that \u201cTony\u201d had admitted shooting John Thomas in an unrelated incident on July 4, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>One week later, Thomas informed the police that the person who shot him on July 4, 1993 was named Johnson Edwards. The police also received an anonymous phone call in which the caller gave a description of Edwards. On April 28, 1994, Detective Burke received a call from another unnamed informant stating Edwards\u2019 whereabouts. Based on that tip, the police apprehended defendant. After defendant had been taken into custody, the police showed Thomas a photograph of defendant, and Thomas confirmed that defendant was the person who had shot him on July 4, 1993. Subsequently, Chester Martin and two other witnesses to the December 1, 1993 shooting identified defendant in a lineup as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Under Bronx County Indictment Number 3299/94, defendant was charged with second-degree murder, attempted murder, assault and several weapons offenses for the shootings of Clarke and Martin. A hearing was held on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the lineup identifications, at which Detective Neenan testified about the investigation and arrest of defendant, as well as the lineup. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked the detective for the name of the March 18, 1994 informant. The prosecutor objected. Defense counsel then asked, in the alternative, that the court examine the informant in camera to determine \u201cwhether this individual exists and what information he had.\u201d The court denied defense counsel\u2019s requests, stating that it did not need to examine the informant, or know his name, in order to make its probable cause determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Following the hearing, the court issued a written decision denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, holding that the arrest was supported by probable cause. The court noted that the police had the right to rely on the information supplied by the confidential informant, because the informant provided a sufficient basis for his knowledge, had given reliable information in the past and furnished details consistent with information already known to the police. The court found additionally that the lineup was not suggestive. A jury convicted defendant of second-degree murder and attempted murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>court \u201cproperly exercised its discretion\u201d in denying defendant\u2019s motion for an in camera examination of the confidential informant (268 AD2d 288, 289). The court stated that an in camera hearing was not necessary because the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing \u201csatisfied the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test,\u201d and defendant \u201cmade no showing to warrant an in camera examination\u201d <em>(id.). </em>On appeal to this Court, defendant argues that the trial court erred by denying his request for an in camera examination of the confidential informant. We agree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The Informer\u2019s Privilege at Suppression Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The use of confidential informants to establish probable cause presents a difficult issue for the courts. As a general rule, hearsay is admissible at a suppression hearing <em>(see, </em>CPL 710.60 [4]). A police witness at a suppression hearing may establish probable cause by personal knowledge, as well as by information supplied by fellow officers or private citizens <em>(see, People v Washington, </em>87 NY2d 945, 947; <em>People v Parris, </em>83 NY2d 342, 346). The People are not required \u201cto produce any particular witness, provided they sustain their burden of coming forward with evidence showing that there was probable cause for the arrest\u201d <em>(People v Parris, supra, </em>at 346; <em>see also, People v Chipp, </em>75 NY2d 327, 337-339 [defendant does not have an absolute right to call the complaining witness to testify at a <em>Wade </em>hearing], <em>cert denied </em>498 US 833). The People may even rely on hearsay evidence provided by an anonymous tipster, \u201cso long as the requirements of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test are met\u201d <em>(People v Parris, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">As a counterbalancing principle, the defendant has a right to cross-examine the People\u2019s witnesses at the suppression hearing <em>(see, People v Williamson, </em>79 NY2d 799, 800-801 [trial court committed reversible error by curtailing cross-examination of witness at suppression hearing]). Thus, in the ordinary case where a police officer has obtained evidence from a third person providing probable cause, the defendant has the opportunity to question the officer about the third person\u2019s identity, relationship to the crime, basis of knowledge, past relationship to the police and criminal history. The defendant is thus able to raise any appropriate question about the officer\u2019s testimony to the suppression court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>In the case of a confidential informant, however, the defendant\u2019s ability to test the officer\u2019s claim of probable cause is circumscribed. Since it is often important to maintain the secrecy of the informant\u2019s identity, especially at the early stages of a criminal proceeding, trial courts have the discretion to prohibit a defendant from eliciting the informant\u2019s name or any other information that could reveal the informant\u2019s identity <em>(see, People v Castro, </em>29 NY2d 324, 326 [finding it \u201cunnecessary\u201d to disclose informant\u2019s name at suppression hearing where other evidence established informant\u2019s reliability]; <em>People v Coffey, </em>12 NY2d 443, 450-453 [upholding trial court\u2019s decision not to disclose informant\u2019s name where informant\u2019s existence and statements were verified by sworn testimony from Assistant District Attorney], <em>cert denied </em>376 US 916; <em>McCray v Illinois, </em>386 US 300, 311-314 [due process does not require disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity at a suppression hearing]). Thus, the defendant would be \u201cthwarted\u201d in efforts to test the officer\u2019s credibility <em>(see, 2 </em>Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.3 [g], at 188 [3d ed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Responding to these concerns, in 1974 this Court established a procedure to verify the testifying officer\u2019s credibility while keeping the informant\u2019s identity secret. The Court held that, where \u201cthere is insufficient evidence to establish probable cause apart from the testimony of the arresting officer as to communications received from an informer,\u201d it would be \u201cfair and wise\u201d for the People to \u201cbe required to make the informer available for interrogation before the Judge\u201d <em>(People v Darden, supra, </em>34 NY2d, at 181). In order to protect the informer\u2019s confidentiality, the prosecutor may be present at the hearing, but defendant and defense counsel may not. Defense counsel, however, may submit, in writing, suggested questions for the Judge to ask the informant, and the transcript of the in camera hearing must be placed under seal and made available to appellate courts should the case be appealed. Further, a \u201csummary report\u201d of the hearing should be made available to defense counsel and the People, regarding \u201cthe existence of the informer\u201d and the \u201ccommunications made by the informer to the police\u201d <em>(id.). </em>By contrast, at trial, \u201cwhere the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence is at issue, disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity should not be resolved in an ex parte proceeding\u201d <em>(People v Liberatore, </em>79 NY2d 208, 215).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The Trial Court\u2019s Obligation under <em>Darden</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In the present case, the trial court prohibited defendant from cross-examining Detective Neenan about the confidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>informant\u2019s identity. The court, however, declined to follow the <em>Darden </em>procedure, holding that it could rely on the information provided by the informant without examining him in camera. That ruling was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">At the outset, we reject the People\u2019s contention that probable cause could be established without the informant\u2019s statements, which would render a <em>Darden </em>hearing unnecessary. The People argue before us that John Thomas\u2019 identification of defendant as the person who shot him provided an independent basis for his arrest. The People, however, did not raise that theory before the trial court; they argued only that Thomas\u2019 identification of defendant from a single photograph was \u201cconfirmatory\u201d of the information provided by the confidential informant and other unnamed sources. The People\u2019s current argument is therefore unpreserved. In any event, Thomas did not identify defendant until <em>after </em>he was arrested; indeed, the identification was made from defendant\u2019s arrest photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We likewise reject the People\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s refusal to follow the <em>Darden </em>procedure was a proper exercise of discretion. Where, as here, the informant\u2019s testimony is necessary to establish probable cause, the court must grant the defendant\u2019s request for a <em>Darden </em>hearing. To be sure, there are exceptions to the <em>Darden </em>rule. Informants need not be produced, for example, if they cannot be located despite the People\u2019s diligent efforts <em>(see, People v Fulton, </em>58 NY2d 914, 916), or if they refuse to appear because they fear personal injury <em>(see, People v Carpenito, </em>80 NY2d 65, 68). In such cases, the People may instead \u201cestablish the existence of confidential informants through extrinsic evidence\u201d after demonstrating that \u201cthe informant is legitimately unavailable\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Moreover, informants who previously testified before the Magistrate who issued a warrant need not be produced for a <em>Darden </em>hearing, since their existence and statements have already been verified <em>(see, People v Serrano, </em>93 NY2d 73, 76-77).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The existence of these exceptions reinforces our holding that <em>Darden </em>did in fact establish a rule. If, as the People contend, <em>Darden </em>had established only a discretionary procedure, there would have been no need for exceptions. Further, our precedents speak of <em>Darden </em>hearings as required rather than discretionary. In <em>People v Serrano </em>(93 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 77), for example, this Court stated that a <em>Darden </em>hearing \u201cis <em>required </em>\u2018where there is insufficient evidence to establish probable cause apart from the testimony of the arresting officer as to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>munications received from an informer\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>People v Darden, supra, </em>34 NY2d, at 181 [emphasis added]). The Court explained that an in camera hearing is necessary to allay any concern that the informant is \u201cwholly imaginary\u201d and his statements to the police \u201cfabricated\u201d <em>(People v Serrano, supra, </em>at 77).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Similarly, in <em>People v Adrion </em>(82 NY2d 628, 634), we held that a trial court\u2019s order to produce an informant for an in camera examination is mandatory, and the prosecutor must comply on pain of suppression. The Court described the <em>Darden </em>hearing as a requirement, stating that once the defendant has challenged the informant\u2019s existence or identity, \u201cthe People are required to produce the police informant for an in camera inquiry unless they can demonstrate that the informant is unavailable and cannot be produced through the exercise of due diligence\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Further, as we stated in <em>Serrano </em>and <em>Adrion, </em>a <em>Darden </em>rule is necessary in order to fulfill the underlying purpose of Darden: insuring that the confidential informant both exists and gave the police information sufficient to establish probable cause, while protecting the informant\u2019s identity. The surest way to accomplish this task is to produce the informant for an in camera examination. In addition, this rule gives clear guidance to lower courts and guarantees that \u201cthe protections of the Fourth Amendment have not been circumvented\u201d (2 LaFave, Search and Seizure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.3 [g], at 203).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\"><em>People v Huggins </em>(36 NY2d 827, 828), on which the People rely, is not to the contrary. In <em>Huggins, </em>the Court held that the trial court\u2019s failure to order in camera examination of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>confidential informant was not an abuse of discretion, noting that <em>Darden </em>provides \u201cguidelines to assist the courts in exercising their discretionary powers * * * to hold in camera inquiries\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Significantly, the suppression hearing in <em>Huggins </em>took place before <em>Darden </em>was decided. Cognizant of that fact, the <em>Huggins </em>Court could not say that the trial court \u2014 which did not have the benefit of <em>Darden </em>\u2014 abused its discretion as a matter of law, and did not address whether <em>Darden </em>established a mandatory procedure for subsequent cases. Thus, <em>Huggins </em>is inapplicable here. Furthermore, any language in <em>Huggins </em>suggesting a discretionary standard is contradicted by our strong endorsement in <em>Adrion </em>of a mandatory procedure and by our subsequent statement in <em>Serrano </em>that <em>Darden </em>creates a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Nor is a <em>Darden </em>hearing unnecessary if the police officer\u2019s testimony satisfies the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. That test provides that a tip from a hearsay informant (which may include an anonymous informant) may not be used unless the source of his knowledge is revealed and the informant is of known reliability <em>(see, People v DiFalco, </em>80 NY2d 693, 696-697; <em>People v Elwell, </em>50 NY2d 231, 236; <em>see generally, Spinelli v United States, </em>393 US 410; <em>Aguilar v Texas, </em>378 US 108).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The People contend that since this test applies even to an anonymous informant, it should apply to a confidential informant as well, and where the officer\u2019s testimony establishes both the informant\u2019s reliability and basis of knowledge, the information may be used to establish probable cause without a <em>Darden </em>hearing. In <em>Adrion, </em>however, this Court rejected that very argument, holding that the concerns are different when a confidential informant is involved, since the reason for the <em>Darden </em>rule is to verify the informant\u2019s <em>existence </em>\u2014 not merely to establish the reliability of a tip <em>(see, People v Adrion, supra, </em>at 634-636). Further, while the defendant has free reign to cross-examine the officer about any relevant subject where an anonymous tip is used, the defendant cannot cross-examine the officer about any matter that may reveal the identity of a confidential informant. Therefore, in the case of a confidential informant, an in camera inquiry is necessary to properly test the officer\u2019s credibility. Moreover, unlike anonymous tipsters, it is possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>to bring confidential informants before the Judge to verify their existence and statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Finally, contrary to the Appellate Division, defendant was not required to make any threshold showing in order to be entitled to a <em>Darden </em>hearing <em>(see, Matter of Pierre H., </em>260 AD2d 320, 320-321; <em>People v Ferron, </em>248 AD2d 962, 963, <em>lv denied </em>92 NY2d 879). Obviously, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a defendant to present evidence that a confidential informant did not exist or was unreliable. It was error for the Appellate Division to place a burden on defendant that he could not reasonably have been expected to meet <em>(see, </em>2 LaFave, Search and Seizure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.4 [d], at 505 [discussing a defendant\u2019s duty to make a \u201cthreshold showing\u201d to challenge a warrant: where the defendant cannot discover the identity of the informer, \u201cthe defendant should not be deemed to have failed in his \u2018threshold showing\u2019 merely because he has no information as to whether the informant lied to the officer-affiant * * * or the officer-affiant lied to the magistrate\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Defendant, therefore, is entitled to remittal to Supreme Court for a <em>Darden </em>hearing, at which the court shall conduct an in camera examination of the confidential informant. Alternatively, if the People demonstrate that one of the exceptions to the <em>Darden </em>rule applies, they may establish the informant\u2019s existence and reliability through other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be modified by remitting to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this Opinion and, as so modified, affirmed. If, on remittal, Supreme Court determines that probable cause to arrest was lacking, then the judgment of conviction under Indictment Number 3299/94 should be vacated and the motion to suppress granted. If Supreme Court determines that probable cause to arrest existed, then the judgment should be amended to reflect that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Order, insofar as appealed from, modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty under a separate indictment (Bronx County Indictment Number 3396/94) to attempted murder and a weapons charge for the shooting of Thomas. The two indictments were consolidated for sentencing and appeal. Defendant, however, does not raise any issues relating to Indictment Number 3396/94 in this appeal, nor does he seek to set aside that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">. Contrary to the People\u2019s contention, the issue of probable cause to arrest is preserved for our review because, in its written decision denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court \u201cexpressly decided\u201d the question in response to a \u201cprotest by a party\u201d (CPL 470.05 [2]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\">. <em>Serrano, </em>in fact, fell within one of the exceptions to the <em>Darden </em>rule: no hearing was necessary because the informant had previously appeared before the Magistrate during the search warrant application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\">. Elsewhere, some courts have endorsed a mandatory <em>Darden </em>procedure (see, <em>e.g., United States v Freund, </em>525 F2d 873, 877-878 [5th Cir] [remanding for in camera examination of informant where informant supplied information necessary to establishing probable cause], <em>after remand </em>532 F2d 501, <em>cert denied </em>426 US 923). Other courts require disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity at an ex parte hearing but do not specifically mandate that the informant be produced <em>(see, e.g., United States v Reeves, </em>210 F3d 1041, 1044 [9th Cir], <em>cert denied </em>\u2014 US \u2014, 121 S Ct 499 [Nov. 13, 2000]; <em>United States v Abramson, </em>553 F2d 1164, 1168 [8th Cir], <em>cert denied </em>433 US 911). Still other courts hold that an in camera hearing is not required if there is sufficient evidence of the informant\u2019s reliability <em>(see, e.g., United States v Santarpio, </em>560 F2d 448, 453 [1st Cir], <em>cert denied sub nom. Schepici v United States, </em>434 US 984; <em>United States v Carneglia, </em>468 F2d 1084, 1088-1089 [2d Cir], <em>cert denied sub nom. Inzerillo v United States, </em>410 US 945).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\">. Although the Federal courts no longer utilize the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standard <em>(see, Illinois v Gates, </em>462 US 213, 230-231), New York continues to follow it as a matter of State constitutional law <em>(see, People v DiFalco, supra, </em>80 NY2d, at 697, n 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
