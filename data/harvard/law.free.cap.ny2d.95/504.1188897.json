Wynter was charged with two counts of robbery in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 160.10 [1], [2] [a]). During jury voir dire, the court indicated that a prospective juror was ineligible for jury service because he had reported for Federal jury duty within the previous four years. Defendant challenged the court\u2019s view, contending that the juror reported to Federal court for two days but was never sworn as a juror and therefore was not disqualified under Judiciary Law \u00a7 524. Relying upon the Judiciary Law and the Rules of the Chief Administrator of the Courts, the court dismissed the juror from the panel and rejected defendant\u2019s purported waiver of the juror\u2019s apparent ineligibility. Defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied. Defendant was convicted of the offenses charged, and the conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division. Leave to appeal was granted by a Judge of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Judiciary Law \u00a7 524 (a) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201cA person who has served on a grand or petit jury in any court of the unified court system or in a federal court shall not be competent to serve again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>as a trial or grand juror in any court of the unified court system for four years subsequent to the last day of such service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Rules of statutory construction require that section 524 be read in conjunction with section 525 in order to properly interpret the intent of the Legislature (see, <em>Khela v Neiger, </em>85 NY2d 333, 336-337; <em>Matter of Klein [Hartnett], </em>78 NY2d 662, 667). Judiciary Law \u00a7 525 (c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u201cFor the purposes of this section, actual attendance shall include a juror\u2019s actual physical attendance wherein the court convenes or service by means of a telephone standby system whereby a juror shall remain available to report for jury service upon notification by means of telephone or other electronic communication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Accordingly, when sections 524 and 525 are read together, it is evident that the Legislature did not intend to require the impaneling of a person as a trial or grand juror in order to be deemed ineligible for future juror service under the statute. Rather, section 524 is intended to include individuals who fulfilled their jury service obligations by responding to a summons for jury duty through either actual physical attendance or telephone standby service. Notably, this interpretation of juror service requiring disqualification is mirrored in New York Rules of Court [22 NYCRR] \u00a7\u00a7 128.8<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 128.9 (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which were promulgated by the Chief Administrator of the Courts to implement the provisions of Judiciary Law \u00a7\u00a7 524 and 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Judges Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur Chief Judge Kaye taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-10\">. Section 128.8 of the Rules, entitled \u201cDuration of Service\u201d states in pertinent part that \u201cthe duration of a juror\u2019s service shall be computed by counting the first day on which the juror is required to appear and each consecutive day thereafter, excluding days in which the court is not in session, until the juror is released from service. The commissioner of jurors may release a trial juror from service at any time, except that a trial juror who has been sworn or selected to sit on a panel in a proceeding may be released before the proceeding is terminated only by a judge or justice\u201d (22 NYCRR 128.8 [a]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-11\">. Section 128.9 of the Rules, entitled \u201cFrequency of Service,\u201d states in pertinent part that \u201c[a] person who has served on a trial jury or grand jury in any court of record within the state, including service as set forth in section 128.8 of this Part or service in a federal court, is disqualified from further jury service, pursuant to section 524 of the Judiciary Law, for four years * * * For purposes of this subdivision, jury service shall include service in the court and telephone standby service\u201d (22 NYCRR 128.9 [b]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
