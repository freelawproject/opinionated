Thus, defendant adequately preserved his partial closure argument for purposes of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">On the merits, although the trial court may have been justified in excluding the general public from the courtroom during the officers\u2019 testimony <em>(see, People v Ramos, </em>90 NY2d 490, 498), on this record, it was error to exclude defendant\u2019s girlfriend and uncle. At the <em>Hinton </em>hearings, the officers failed to address how their safety interest might be compromised by testifying in front of defendant\u2019s girlfriend or uncle. Indeed, the officers \u201cnever even mentioned\u201d any of defendant\u2019s friends and family <em>(see, People v Nieves, </em>90 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 430).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.4 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.4), order affirmed in a memorandum.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
