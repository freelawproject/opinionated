The court below correctly held that, as a matter of law, the 1985 Patrol Guide Procedure No. 104-1 (k) (\u201cUse of Firearms\u201d) regarding a police officer\u2019s cocking of a firearm could not support plaintiffs\u2019 General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e claim because that provision does not meet the test set forth by this Court in <em>Desmond v City of New York </em>(88 NY2d 455, 464 [1996]) for ascertaining whether a government enactment is legally sufficient in that regard. Thus, inasmuch as the jury\u2019s liability finding was based solely on a supposed \u201cviolation\u201d of Procedure No. 104-1 (k), the court below properly reversed the judgment and dismissed the complaint. <em>(St. Jacques v City of New York, </em>88 NY2d 920; <em>Gonzalez v Iocovello, </em>93 NY2d 539; <em>Santangelo v State of New York, </em>71 NY2d 393; <em>Schiavone v City of New York, </em>92 NY2d 308; <em>Flynn v City of New York, </em>258 AD2d 129; <em>Kenavan v City of New York, </em>70 NY2d 558; <em>Williams v City of New York, </em>256 AD2d 332; <em>Simons v City of New York, </em>252 AD2d 451; <em>Matter of Krieger v Krauskopf, </em>121 AD2d 448, 70 NY2d 637, <em>cert denied sub nom.

In any event, there should be an affirmance because the verdict was based on legally insufficient evidence that Sergeant Martin had cocked his gun before it accidentally discharged. The only direct evidence on that issue established that the weapon was not cocked, and both parties\u2019 gun experts agreed that an uncocked firearm could discharge accidentally. By contrast, plaintiffs relied solely on the contrary testimony of a witness without expertise in ballistics which was entirely speculative. <em>(McCormick v State of New York, </em>34 Misc 2d 806; <em>Quain v Buzzetta Constr.

The plain language and the legislative history of General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e dictate that mandatory New York City Police Department Patrol Guide provisions, such as New York City Police Department Patrol Guide No. 104-1 (k) (\u201cUse of Firearms\u201d), can be proper predicates for General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e liability. <em>(Touche Ross &amp; Co. v Redington, </em>442 US 560; <em>State of New York v Shore Realty Corp., </em>759 F2d 1032; <em>Gonzalez v Iocovello, </em>93 NY2d 539; <em>Flynn v City of New York, </em>258 AD2d 129; <em>Desmond v City of New York, </em>88 NY2d 455.) II. The application of New York City Police Department Patrol Guide provisions to members of the service indicates that many of these are mandatory provisions and are part of a well-developed body of law such that they can be proper predicates for General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e liability. <em>(Gonzalez v locovello, </em>93 NY2d 539; <em>Maisky v Towner, </em>196 AD2d 532; <em>People ex rel.

After observing a possible drug transaction, the officers approached a group of suspects. Sergeant Martin followed one of the suspects, Joseph Barker, and recovered a glassine envelope believed to contain heroin. While securing Barker, who was told to place his hands on the roof of a nearby car, Martin noticed another suspect refusing to cooperate with Galapo. Unsure whether the suspects were armed and believing the situation dangerous, Martin took out his gun, a .38 caliber revolver he had received as a reward for outstanding police duty in arresting an armed narcotics suspect. Martin pointed the revolver upward, with his index finger touching the trigger guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">In an effort to escape, Barker suddenly pushed off the car and slammed into Martin, knocking him backward. Martin felt his gun fly from his hand. Reflexively, he grabbed the revolver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>and, while he was attempting to regain his grip the gun discharged, tragically resulting in Galapo\u2019s death. The Police Department\u2019s Firearms Discharge Review Board, after investigation, concluded \u201cthat the discharge by Sergeant Martin was accidental and not in violation of Department Guidelines.\u201d In accordance with the Board\u2019s recommendation, no discipline was imposed. Barker was convicted of escape, criminal possession of a controlled substance and criminally negligent homicide in connection with Galapo\u2019s death (see, <em>People v Barker, </em>186 AD2d 207, <em>lv denied </em>81 NY2d 785).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Plaintiffs \u2014 the widow and children of Officer Galapo \u2014 commenced this wrongful death action against Martin, the New York City Police Department and the City of New York, seeking $49 million in damages. Plaintiffs asserted causes of action for, among other things, negligence and violation of General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e, which authorizes recovery for negligent failure to \u201ccomply with the requirements of any of the statutes, ordinances, rules, orders and requirements\u201d (subd [1]) of any City department. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged violation of Procedure 104-1 (k) (\u201cUse of Firearms\u201d) of the Police Department Patrol Guide, which at the time stated that to \u201cminimize the possibility of accidentally discharging a weapon, firearms shall not be cocked and should be fired double action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The trial court dismissed the complaint, concluding both that plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim was barred by the <em>\u201cSantangelo </em>rule\u201d (see, <em>Santangelo v State of New York, </em>71 NY2d 393, 397) and that the Patrol Guide could not serve as a basis for liability under General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e. Disagreeing with the latter conclusion, the Appellate Division reversed (219 AD2d 581). At trial, plaintiffs presented circumstantial evidence that Martin\u2019s gun had been cocked, that its hammer had been depressed making it easier for the weapon to discharge. The case proceeded to a jury award of $17.9 million. Defendants moved to set aside the verdict, urging that statutory liability could not be based on violation of Patrol Guide Procedure 104-1 (k). Bound by the Appellate Division\u2019s earlier determination, Supreme Court denied the motion. The Appellate Division, however, itself reversed, concluding that this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Gonzalez v Iocovello </em>(93 NY2d 539), <em>Desmond v City of New York </em>(88 NY2d 455, <em>rearg denied </em>89 NY2d 861) and <em>St. Jacques v City of New York </em>(88 NY2d 920) had \u201ceffectively overruled\u201d its prior determination (267 AD2d 349, 350). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Central to this appeal is a longstanding common-law doctrine known as the \u201cfirefighters\u2019 rule.\u201d The rule bars recovery by a firefighter against a property owner or occupant for injuries related to the risks firefighters are expected to assume as part of their job (see, <em>Kenavan v City of New York, </em>70 NY2d 558, 566; <em>Cooper v City of New York, </em>81 NY2d 584, 588). The rule is grounded on the policy that \u2014 unlike members of the general public \u2014 firefighters are specially trained and compensated to confront hazards and therefore \u201cmust be precluded from recovering damages for the very situations that create a need for their services\u201d <em>(see, Santangelo v State of New York, supra, </em>71 NY2d, at 397).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The Legislature opened a narrow passageway around the common-law rule by enacting General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-a, affording firefighters and their survivors a statutory cause of action for line-of-duty injuries resulting from negligent noncompliance \u201cwith the requirements of any [governmental] statutes, ordinances, rules, orders and requirements\u201d <em>(see, L </em>1935, ch 800, \u00a7 2, as amended by L 1936, ch 251, \u00a7 1; <em>Desmond v City of New York, supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 462).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In <em>Santangelo, </em>this Court recognized that the firefighters\u2019 rule applies equally to police officers. Like firefighters, police officers are \u201cexperts engaged, trained and compensated by the public to deal on its behalf with emergencies and hazards often created by negligence\u201d <em>(Santangelo v State of New York, supra, </em>71 NY2d, at 397). They too are barred from recovering damages for on-the-job, work-related injuries. Soon after <em>Santangelo, </em>the Legislature enacted General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e, allowing to police officers the same limited exception to the common-law rule that had been made available to firefighters (se<em>e, </em>Div of Budget Report, Bill Jacket, L 1989, ch 346 [section 205-e \u201cmerely extends to on-duty police officers, a right already enjoyed by firemen and by the general public\u201d]). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The Legislature most recently added yet another circumscribed exception to the common-law rule by authorizing a cause of action for firefighters and police officers for on-duty injuries \u201cproximately caused by the neglect, willful omission, or intentional, willful or culpable conduct of any person or entity, <em>other than that police officer\u2019s or firefighter\u2019s employer or co-employee\u201d (see, </em>General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-106 [1] [emphasis added]). As the Governor noted in approving the legislation, \u201cthis bill does not authorize injured firefighters and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>police officers to sue their fellow firefighters and police officers. Accordingly, it does not carry with it \u2018the potential for impairing discipline and the teamwork values that are vital.to effective firefighting and law enforcement\u2019 \u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1996, ch 703, 1996 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1935 [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Like General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-a (1), General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e (1) permits police officers or their survivors to recover for injuries or death caused by negligent failure to comply \u201cwith the requirements of any of the statutes, ordinances, rules, orders and requirements of the federal, state, county, village, town or city governments or of any and all their departments, divisions and bureaus.\u201d Although section 205-e purports to authorize recovery for noncompliance with \u201cany\u201d governmental requirement, it is well settled that the statute cannot \u201creasonably be applied literally in accordance with its broad language\u201d <em>(Desmond v City of New York, supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 463; <em>see also, </em>Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1996, ch 703, 1996 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1936-1937). Rather, as a prerequisite to recovery, a police officer must demonstrate injury resulting from negligent noncompliance with a requirement found in a \u201cwell-developed body of law and regulation\u201d that \u201cimposes clear duties\u201d <em>(see, Desmond v City of New York, supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 464; <em>see also, </em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association Letter in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1989, ch 346 [statute authorizes cause of action based on disregard of \u201ca local statute or ordinance\u201d]; Sponsor\u2019s Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1992, ch 474 [\u201cIt was clearly the intent of the Legislature, in enacting General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e, that this Section apply to the violation of any statute or other law\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Procedure 104-1 (k) of the New York City Police Department Patrol Guide is not part of a duly-enacted body of law or regulation that gives rise to civil liability under General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e <em>(see, Malenczak v City of New York, </em>265 AD2d 532, 533; <em>Flynn v City of New York, </em>258 AD2d 129, 138; <em>Lawrence v City of New York, </em>240 AD2d 711, <em>lv denied </em>90 NY2d 812; <em>Luongo v City of New York, </em>240 AD2d 712, <em>lv denied </em>90 NY2d 812; <em>see also, Shelton v City of New York, </em>256 AD2d 611, 613 [internal Fire Department rule cannot serve as a predicate for liability under General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-a], <em>lv dismissed and denied </em>93 NY2d 907; <em>Pascarella v City of New York, </em>146 AD2d 61, 70, <em>lv denied </em>74 NY2d 610).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The Patrol Guide is an internal manual \u2014 nearly 1,500 closely printed pages \u2014 containing thousands of rules, procedures and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>policies adopted by the Police Commissioner for the governance, discipline, administration and guidance of the Police Department (see, Foreword to New York City Police Department Patrol Guide). It is not a body of law or regulation establishing clear legal duties that should serve as a basis for civil liability of municipalities <em>(contrast, Gonzalez v Iocovello, supra, </em>93 NY2d, at 551 [permitting section 205-e recovery based on violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104, which establishes a standard for determining civil liability for damages]; <em>Cosgriff v City of New York, </em>93 NY2d 539, 552 [authorizing section 205-e recovery based on Administrative Code provision recognizing the potential for liability]). Significantly, though some of its provisions are couched in mandatory terms, the Patrol Guide does not prescribe the specific action to be taken in each situation encountered by individual officers, but rather is intended to serve as a guide for members of the Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Establishing Procedure 104-1 (k) as a foundation for monetary damage lawsuits under section 205-e, with the specter of massive civil liability, would, moreover, operate as a powerful disincentive to the adoption of internal rules, which authorize the police department to discipline officers even before conduct might become actionable by members of the general public <em>(see, Flynn v City of New York, supra, </em>258 AD2d, at 138). As illustrated by the present case, it would additionally allow a trier of fact, using rules the Police Department itself regards merely as <em>\u201ca </em>guide,\u201d to second-guess line-of-duty decisions on matters affecting public safety <em>(see, Desmond v City of New York, supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 464; <em>see also, </em>Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1996, ch 703, 1996 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1936-1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Permitting the recovery of damages by a police officer based on a fellow officer\u2019s violation of Procedure 104-1 (k) would, finally, be at odds with the history and purpose of General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e. The overriding purpose behind adoption of General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e was to ameliorate the effect of the common-law rule that <em>disadvantaged </em>police officers who, unlike members of the general public, were barred from recovery for injuries resulting from risks inherent in their job. The statute, was not, however, intended to give police officers <em>greater </em>rights and remedies than those available to the general public, as would occur here if plaintiffs could found their damages claims on Procedure 104-1 (k) <em>(see, Crosland v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>68 NY2d 165, 168 [liability cannot be based on alleged breach of Authority rule imposing higher duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>than that owed under common law]; <em>see also, Rivera v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>77 NY2d 322, 329 [Authority rule imposing higher standard inadmissible at trial], <em>rearg denied </em>77 NY2d 990; <em>Lesser v Manhattan &amp; Bronx Surface Tr. Operating Auth., </em>157 AD2d 352, 356 [internal operating rules inadmissible where \u201cthey require a standard of care which transcends the area of reasonable care\u201d] [Smith, J.], <em>affd sub nom. Fishman v Manhattan &amp; Bronx Surface Tr. Operating Auth., </em>79 NY2d 1031, <em>rearg denied </em>80 NY2d 893).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In sum, General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e was not intended to allow suits by fellow officers or their survivors for \u201cbreaches of any and all governmental pronouncements of whatever type\u201d <em>(Desmond v City of New York, supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 464). Procedure 104-1 (k) of the New York City Police Department Patrol Guide is not a statute, ordinance, rule, order or requirement giving rise to section 205-e recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b678-7\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_z\">(dissenting). The majority holds that a provision of the New York City Police Department Patrol Guide cannot serve as a predicate for a civil action under General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e. Because Patrol Guide Procedure 104-1 (k) (\u201cUse of Firearms\u201d) is part of a well-developed body of law with a particularized mandate, we dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">On August 16, 1988, during a buy-and-bust operation, while the police were apprehending several suspects, Sergeant William Martin accidentally shot and killed Officer Joseph Galapo. By verified complaint sworn to on February 22, 1989, Helen Galapo, as administratrix of the estate of Joseph Galapo, and as mother and natural guardian of their three minor children, Daniel J. Galapo, Robert M. Galapo, and Richard B. Galapo, brought an action alleging negligence and wrongful death against the City of New York, the New York City Police Department, and Sergeant William L. Martin in the Supreme Court, Kings County. A verified bill of particulars, dated August 15, 1989, alleged that the defendants were negligent \u201cin cocking said hand gun improperly, negligently and carelessly and in violation of the rules and regulations in the use of a hand gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Supreme Court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The Appellate Division reversed, holding \u201cSupreme Court erred in concluding that an alleged violation of the New York City Police Department Patrol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Guide procedures concerning the use of firearms could not serve as the basis for an action seeking recovery pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e\u201d (219 AD2d 581, 582). The Appellate Division concluded that the broad language of General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e did not preclude the assertion of a claim based upon an alleged violation of an internal police department procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">By an amended complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were negligent in violating requirements and regulations of the Police Department, including General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e. On November 14, 1997, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiffs in the sum of $17.9 million. Supreme Court reduced the jury verdict to $5,095,000. The Appellate Division (267 AD2d 349, 350) reversed the judgment and dismissed the complaint, concluding, \u201cThe decisions of the Court of Appeals in <em>Gonzalez v Iocovello,[</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>] Desmond v City of New York[</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>and <em>St. Jacques v City of New </em>York,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] effectively overruled this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Galapo v City of New York </em>[219 AD2d 581].\u201d The Court noted that the only basis for the jury\u2019s determination of liability was a violation of the Patrol Guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e provides that a police officer can maintain a cause of action where injury or death \u201coccurs directly or indirectly as a result of any neglect, omission, willful or culpable negligence of any person or persons in failing to comply with the requirements of any of the statutes, ordinances, rules, orders and requirements of the federal, state * * * or city governments or of any and all their departments, divisions and bureaus.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The primary issue on this appeal is whether the Patrol Guide meets the definition of a rule or requirement under General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e. The purpose of the 1989 enactment was to provide police officers injured in the line of duty with the same right of action accorded firefighters in 1935 <em>(see, </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-a, adopted L 1935, ch 800; L 1989, ch 346). The statute was enacted in response to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Santangelo v State of New York </em>(71 NY2d 393, 397), which denied recovery to police officers who were injured while attempting to subdue an escaped mental patient. Based upon public policy, the <em>Santangelo </em>Court concluded that the very nature of police work was to engage in difficult situations for which police officers received special training and additional benefits (71 NY2d, at 398).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In 1992, General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e was amended to make clear that liability for injury or death of police officers was not limited to violations relating to the maintenance and control of premises, which is the requirement for claims by firefighters, but was designed to cover injury or death \u201cat any time or place.\u201d This amendment was meant to clarify for courts that the intent of the Legislature was to allow broad-based recovery when a police officer or firefighter was injured or killed as the result of third-party negligence <em>(see, </em>L 1992, ch 474).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In <em>Desmond v City of New York, </em>citing the legislative history, this Court stated that the purpose of General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e was to provide recourse to a police officer \u201c \u2018where injury is the result of negligent non-compliance with well-developed bodies of law and regulation\u2019 which \u2018impose clear duties\u2019 \u201d (88 NY2d 455, 464; Mem of State Executive Dept, 1989 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2141). In order for a departmental policy to be a requirement under General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e, the policy must have some historical basis in law, and there must be a particularized mandate or clear legal duty embodied in the procedure which places restrictions on the officer\u2019s ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tions <em>(see, Desmond, supra, </em>at 464). Patrol Guide Procedure 104-1 (k) meets the test set forth in <em>Desmond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The legislative history of section 205-e demonstrates unmistakably the intent of the Legislature in authorizing lawsuits for injuries to, or the death of, police officers. Less than a year ago, in discussing General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e, this Court noted that since its passage in 1989, the section has been amended on several occasions to answer restrictive court interpretations and to emphasize the legislative intent that the section be interpreted \u201cexpansively\u201d <em>(see, Gonzalez v Iocovello, </em>93 NY2d 539, 548; L 1990, ch 762; L 1992, ch 474; L 1994, ch 664; L 1996, ch 703) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The plain wording of Patrol Guide Procedure 104-1 (k) indicates that it is a <em>requirement </em>of the New York City Police Department. The section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201cTo minimize the possibility of accidentally discharging a weapon, firearms shall not be cocked and should be fired double action\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Plaintiffs expert referred to the Patrol Guide as \u201cthe Bible, it is what you go by.\u201d Moreover, it is not disputed that the Patrol Guide contains requirements and regulations for officers which can serve as the basis for discipline and dismissal <em>(see, e.g., People v Feerick, </em>93 NY2d 433, 442-443; <em>Matter of Williams v Police Dept., </em>50 NY2d 956). The requirement in question was developed as the result of growing concern in New York State and across the country about unnecessary and unwarranted accidental killings of police officers and suspects being apprehended <em>(see, Tennessee v Garner, </em>471 US 1, 15-19; <em>McCummings v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>81 NY2d 923). Robert DiGrazia, plaintiffs expert, and a former Superintendent of Police in St. Louis County, Missouri, and Boston, Massachusetts, testified that the prohibition against cocking of guns evolved during the 1970s and 1980s because of the number of accidental shootings, with most of the injuries occurring to police officers rather than citizens. The end result was the purchase by municipalities of guns which could not be cocked. Such purchases began in New York City in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Martin Landa, a former police officer and Chairman of the Law Department at the Police Academy, was at one time responsible for all of the legal training of entry level police officers and had written most of Patrol Guide Procedure 104-1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>(k). Officer Landa testified to the mandatory nature of the provision for both police officers who were in training and those who had completed it. From the time that an incoming police officer received training at the police academy and during his or her service on the force, adherence to this section of the Patrol Guide was required.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus the requirement meets the <em>Desmond </em>test of a clear, unequivocal mandate that developed out of a concern over the negligent use of an essential piece of law enforcement equipment \u2014 a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The majority writing sets forth a test for determining whether the procedure in question constitutes a qualifying mandate that would serve to impose liability under General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e. The writing indicates that the Department Patrol Guide <em>\u201cis not part of a duly-enacted body of law or regulation\u201d </em>and thus does not give rise to civil liability under the statute (emphasis supplied). The majority appears to adopt a formal legislative/administrative enactment test. The statute imposes no such requirement and further recognizes that \u201cany of the statutes, ordinances, rules, orders and requirements of the federal, state, county, village, town or city governments or of any and all their departments, divisions and bureaus\u201d will qualify in defining a claim under the statute (General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e [1]). The language of the statute is all encompassing and clearly can include a rule of a department, such as the Patrol Guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The majority writing identifies three reasons why the rule in question does not fall within the sweep of section 205-e. One is that the Patrol Guide is an internal manual and \u201cnot a body of law or regulation establishing clear legal duties that should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>serve as a basis for civil liability of municipalities.\u201d As noted above, the provision in question was developed out of a concern for the very outcome that serves as the basis for this lawsuit\u2014 the negligent use of \u00e1 weapon in a potentially dangerous situation. The manual is significant enough that a violation of it can be grounds for dismissal or discipline and the language of the section in question is mandatory. \u201c[F]irearms shall not be cocked.\u201d The regulation could not be clearer. Furthermore, the record reflects that the City adhered to the prohibition of not allowing a firearm to be cocked by ceasing the purchase of guns that could be cocked prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Second, the majority asserts that allowing the Patrol Guide section in question to serve as a foundation for a section 205-e claim \u201cwould additionally allow a trier of fact, using rules the Police Department itself regards merely as \u2018a guide,\u2019 to second-guess line-of-duty decisions on matters affecting public safety.\u201d (Majority opn, at 575, citing <em>Desmond, supra. </em>The memorandum in question in <em>Desmond </em>failed as a directive because it contained \u201cno particularized mandates, but instead simply authorizes the officer to exercise a measure of guided discretion within certain specific criteria\u201d <em>id., </em>at 464.) In this case, the statute does not call upon the officer to make a specific, split-second, discretionary decision that could be reviewed for its appropriateness by the trier of fact. The rule mandates that no officer shall cock his or her gun. Judgment in difficult situations is not called for here; the mandate is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Third, the majority concludes its analysis by determining that allowing recovery in this instance would \u201cbe at odds with the history and purpose of General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e.\u201d As noted earlier, the purpose of General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e was to ameliorate the <em>Santangelo </em>rule and we have been repeatedly told by the Legislature that the statute is to be applied expansively <em>(see, </em>L 1990, ch 762; L 1992, ch 474; L 1994, ch 664; L 1996, ch 703; <em>see also, Gonzalez, supra, </em>at 548). The majority concludes, without showing how it reached that conclusion, that to afford the officer in this case a cause of action would provide police officers with greater rights than those available to the public. It cites <em>Crosland v New York City Tr. Auth. </em>(68 NY2d 165, 168). <em>Crosland </em>stands for the proposition that common-law liability cannot be imposed upon a municipality based on a breach of a rule which imposes a higher duty than that owed under common law. Here, we are not concerned with a common-law claim but a specific statutory cause of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>tion given to police officers. The fact that the Patrol Guide establishes a specific and mandatory level of conduct with regard to the use of firearms has no correlation to a common-law claim that an individual might have with regard to a claim against a municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">As this Court has noted before, \u201cWhen the Legislature\u2019s words and actions point out the correct interpretative road to follow, there is no justification for a court of law to follow another path\u201d <em>(Schiavone v City of New York, </em>92 NY2d 308, 317). To our minds the majority has taken the wrong road in its attempt to restrict the sweep of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Accordingly, we dissent and would reinstate the trial judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Judges Levine, Ciparick and Rosenblatt concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judge Smith dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Wesley concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\">. 93 NY2d 539</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\">. 88 NY2d 455</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\">. 88 NY2d 920</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\">. \u201c1. In addition to any other right of action or recovery under any other provision of law, in the event any accident, causing injury, death or a disease which results in death, occurs directly or indirectly as a result of any neglect, omission, willful or culpable negligence of any person or persons in failing to comply with the requirements of any of the statutes, ordinances, rules, orders and requirements of the federal, state, county, village, town or city governments or of any and all their departments, divisions and bureaus, the person or persons guilty of said neglect, omission, willful or culpable negligence at the time of such injury or death shall be liable to pay any officer, member, agent or employee of any police department injured, or whose life may be lost while in the discharge or performance at any time or place of any duty imposed by the police commissioner * * * or to pay to the spouse and children * * * a sum of money, in case of injury to person, not less than one thousand dollars, and in the case of death not less than five thousand dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>lare, such liability to be determined and such sums recovered in an action to be instituted by any person injured or the family or relatives of any person killed * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">\u201c3.

The mandatory nature of Patrol Guide Procedure 104-1 (k) is shown both by the Police Student\u2019s Guide and the Patrol Guide.

To prevent this occurrence the Department mandates that NO police officer shall cock his/her weapon\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">The provision contained in the Police Student\u2019s Guide is carried forward into the Patrol Guide Regulations as Patrol Guide Procedure 104-1 (k).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
