The article 78 proceeding was untimely commenced within the clear meaning of CPLR 203 and 304 because the order to show cause and petition were filed with the Albany County clerk beyond the four-month limitations period governing special proceedings, and petitioner failed to set forth any extraordinary circumstances which prevented him from filing his papers on time. <em>(Goldmark v Keystone &amp; Grading Corp., </em>226 AD2d 143; <em>Matter of Gerdts v State of New York, </em>210 AD2d 645, 85 NY2d 810, 856; <em>Redding v Saunders, </em>213 AD2d 1015, 85 NY2d 811; <em>Brooks v Inn at Saratoga Assn., </em>188 AD2d 921; <em>Matter of Fry v Village of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>Tarrytown, </em>89 NY2d 714; <em>Bryant v New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

II. The prison mailbox rule is inconsistent with the clear statutory language governing the commencement of article 78 proceedings, which provides that a paper is \u201cfiled\u201d when it is actually delivered to the clerk of the court. <em>(Houston v Lack, </em>487 US 266; <em>Matter of Greenhaus v Milano, </em>242 AD2d 383; <em>Fex v Michigan, </em>507 US 43; <em>Nigro v Sullivan, </em>40 F3d 990; <em>Guirguis v Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>993 F2d 508; <em>Dory v Ryan, </em>999 F2d 679, 25 F3d 81; <em>United States v ParedesBatista, </em>140 F3d 367, 525 US 859; <em>Matter of Marcus v New York State Div. of Parole, </em>264 AD2d 919; <em>Matter of Fry v Village of Tarrytown, </em>89 NY2d 714; <em>Matter of Gershel v Porr, </em>89 NY2d 327.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b709-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b709-5\">Levine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Petitioner, while an inmate at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility, brought this CPLR article 78 proceeding to challenge a determination finding him guilty of violating a prison disciplinary rule prohibiting the possession of a weapon. The sole issue on appeal is whether petitioner timely complied with CPLR 304\u2019s commencement-by-filing requirements when he delivered a proposed order to show cause, verified CPLR article 78 petition and request to proceed as a poor person to prison authorities for mailing to the appropriate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Petitioner, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>submitted his proposed order to show cause, petition and request for poor person relief to prison authorities on Wednesday, October 21, 1998, five days before the applicable Statute of Limitations period expired <em>(see, </em>CPLR 217 [1]). Because he requested that the papers be sent by certified mail, petitioner also submitted a form authorizing the Department of Correctional Services to deduct the required additional postage from his prisoner account. The prison business office processed that request and, on Monday, October 26, 1998, mailed petitioner\u2019s papers to Supreme Court, Albany County, where they were received in the court clerk\u2019s office on October 28, 1998, two days after the Statute of Limitations expired. A Supreme Court Justice signed the order to show cause on November 5. Thereafter, the signed order to show cause and verified petition were filed with the court clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Respondents moved to dismiss the proceeding as time-barred. Supreme Court granted the motion and entered a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>dismissing the proceeding. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed. We granted leave to appeal and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Under this State\u2019s commencement-by-filing system, an article 78 proceeding is \u201ccommenced by filing a notice of petition or order to show cause and a petition\u201d (CPLR 304). Claims asserted in such proceedings are deemed \u201cinterposed\u201d for Statute of Limitations purposes at the time of filing <em>(see, </em>CPLR 203 [c]). The term \u201cfiling\u201d is statutorily defined as \u201cthe delivery of the * * * notice of petition or order to show cause to the clerk of the court in the county in which the action or special proceeding is brought or any other person designated by the clerk of the court for that purpose together with any fee required * * * for filing\u201d (CPLR 304).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Relying on the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Houston v Lack </em>(487 US 266), petitioner urges us to adopt a <em>pro se </em>prisoner \u201cmailbox rule,\u201d under which the term \u201cfiling\u201d would be redefined to mean the delivery of a notice of petition or order to show cause by a <em>pro se </em>prisoner to prison authorities for forwarding to the appropriate court. Because he delivered his proposed order to show cause, verified petition and request for poor person relief to prison authorities before the Statute of Limitations expired, petitioner argues that his CPLR article 78 proceeding should be deemed timely commenced. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In <em>Houston, </em>the Supreme Court held that a <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s notice of appeal was filed when delivered to prison officials for transmittal to the court. That holding was based, in part, upon the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cfiling\u201d as used in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which were promulgated and adopted by the Supreme Court itself. The Supreme Court\u2019s authority in interpreting its own rules exceeds our authority in interpreting the CPLR, which consists of statutory provisions that we are constrained to interpret so as to give effect to the will of the Legislature. Here, the Legislature\u2019s intent to treat papers commencing litigation as \u201cfiled\u201d upon the actual receipt of those papers by the clerk of the court \u2014 rather than upon delivery to prison authorities for forwarding to the court \u2014 is manifest from the statute\u2019s language and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">After defining the term \u201cfiling\u201d as the delivery of certain litigation papers to the clerk of the court or other person designated by the clerk, CPLR 304 specifies that, \u201c[a]t the time of filing, the filed papers shall be date stamped by the clerk of the court who shall file them and maintain a record of the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>of the filing and who shall return forthwith a date stamped copy, together with an index number, to the filing party.\u201d In addition, CPLR 306-a (a) provides that an index number shall be assigned \u201c[u]pon filing.\u201d This express statutory language\u2014 which requires an. immediate temporal link between (1) the litigant\u2019s physical act of filing, (2) the court\u2019s date stamping of filed papers and (3) the assignment of an index number\u2014 evinces the Legislature\u2019s intent to treat litigation papers as \u201cfiled\u201d within the meaning of CPLR 304 only upon the physical receipt of those papers by the court clerk or the clerk\u2019s designee.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Moreover, construing the term \u201cfiling\u201d as requiring the actual receipt of litigation papers which are date-stamped by the court clerk or the clerk\u2019s designee furthers one of the primary purposes underlying the filing requirements: \u201cto pinpoint the moment of \u2018commencement,\u2019 \u201d thereby fixing the \u201ccrucial date\u201d for determining whether the Statute of Limitations is satisfied <em>(Matter of Fry v Village of Tarrytown, </em>89 NY2d 714, 719). Adoption of a prisoner mailbox rule would substantially undermine this goal and render the date of commencement uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We recognize the greater impediments <em>pro se </em>prisoners may face over most other litigants in filing their legal papers on time. But, absent any evidence that the Legislature intended to vary for their benefit the filing-by-receipt requirement established in CPLR 304, we cannot depart from the statutorily mandated filing requirements by incorporating a <em>pro se </em>prisoner mailbox exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In one limited respect, however, the Legislature has evidenced its intent to ease the burden of the unique impediments involved in the commencement of proceedings by <em>pro se </em>inmates. Generally, litigants are required to file a <em>signed </em>order to show cause to commence a proceeding because \u201can unexecuted order to show cause is of no legal effect\u201d <em>(Matter of Fry v Village of Tarrytown, supra, </em>89 NY2d, at 717). Indeed, the Appellate Division here applied this rule in stating that \u201c [petitioner did not commence the proceeding * * * until November 10, 1998\u201d (270 AD2d 536, 537). But CPLR 1101 (f) sets up a special procedure for <em>pro se </em>prisoners, which effectively changes the general rule and allows the commencement of a proceeding by the filing of an unsigned order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">CPLR 1101 (f), entitled \u201cFees for inmates,\u201d was enacted in 1999 to provide a means for an inmate to commence an \u201caction or proceeding\u201d by paying a reduced filing fee <em>(see, </em>L 1999, ch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>412). The inmate requests such relief by filing a \u201cform affidavit * * * along with the summons and complaint or summons with notice or third-party summons and complaint or petition or notice of petition or <em>order to show cause\u201d </em>(CPLR 1101 [f] [1] [emphasis supplied]). At that point in time, even before the proposed order to show cause is signed by a Judge, CPLR 1101 (f) (1) directs that the case \u201cbe given an index number * * * and the application will be submitted to a judge of the court.\u201d We conclude that this statutory scheme evinces the Legislature\u2019s intent to treat an inmate\u2019s unsigned order to show cause as \u201cfiled\u201d when the case is assigned an index number upon receipt of the papers by the clerk of the court <em>(see, </em>CPLR 306-a [a] [index number shall be assigned \u201c(u)pon filing\u201d]; CPLR 304 [index number is assigned \u201c(a)t the time of filing\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">CPLR 1101 (f), however, is of no avail to petitioner. Petitioner\u2019s proposed order to show cause, verified petition and request for poor person relief were not received by the clerk of the court until two days after the Statute of Limitations expired and, thus, were not timely filed even under the procedure for commencement of actions and proceedings by indigent prison inmates established in CPLR 1101 (f). Whether untimeliness could be excused by reason of inordinate delay in the mailing of litigation papers by prison officials is not before us in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur; Judge Graffeo taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
