Here we answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Three-year-old Andrew Lauer died on August 7, 1993. That same day, Dr. Eddy Lilavois, a New York City Medical Examiner, performed an autopsy and prepared a report stating that the child\u2019s death was a homicide caused by \u201cblunt injuries\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>to the neck and brain. Although the report indicated that the brain was being preserved for further examination, the following day a death certificate was issued stating that Andrew\u2019s death was a homicide. Based on the Medical Examiner\u2019s conclusion, the police began investigating what they thought was a homicide, focusing primarily on plaintiff, Andrew\u2019s father. Weeks later, on August 31, 1993, the Medical Examiner and a neuropathologist conducted a more detailed study of Andrew\u2019s brain. The report, prepared in October 1993, indicated that a ruptured brain aneurysm caused the child\u2019s death, thus contradicting the earlier conclusion. The Medical Examiner, however, failed to correct the autopsy report or death certificate, and failed to notify law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Meanwhile, the Police Department\u2019s investigation into Andrew\u2019s death continued. Some 17 months later, in March 1995, after a newspaper expos\u00e9, the autopsy findings were revised, the police investigation ceased and an amended death certificate was prepared. As a result of this incident, the City Medical Examiner who had conducted the examination resigned. Plaintiff and his estranged wife subsequently commenced separate actions. Lisa Lauer\u2019s action against the City of New York and Dr. Lilavois, seeking damages for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, was dismissed. In affirming the dismissal, the Appellate Division held that her allegations failed to establish \u201cthat she fell within any recognized orbit of duty upon which liability may be based\u201d <em>(see, Lauer v City of New York, </em>240 AD2d 543, 544, <em>lv denied </em>91 NY2d 807).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In the present action seeking $10 million in damages against the City of New York, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Lilavois and the Police Department, plaintiff alleges defamation, violation of his civil rights, and both negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He claims that defendants\u2019 conduct \u2014 including the Medical Examiner\u2019s negligent performance of the autopsy, failure to correct the erroneous report and death certificate, and failure to disclose that Andrew\u2019s death was not a homicide \u2014 \u201cprecipitated the destruction of [his] marriage * * * forced him to sell his home and leave his neighborhood, and caused him to become the object of public scorn, humiliation, ridicule, embarrassment, harassment and contempt throughout the City of New York.\u201d He further alleges that he \u201csustained severe and debilitating emotional distress, emotional anguish, anxiety and mental suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>On defendants\u2019 motion, Supreme Court dismissed the defamation and civil rights causes of action, but allowed plaintiff to pursue his emotional distress claims. A divided Appellate Division modified Supreme Court\u2019s order <em>(see, </em>258 AD2d 92). All of the Justices agreed that the defamation and civil rights claims were properly dismissed. They also unanimously concluded that plaintiffs intentional infliction of emotional distress claim warranted dismissal; that any causes of action based on performance of the initial autopsy were immunized as a governmental exercise of discretion; and that the Medical Examiner\u2019s failure to correct the reports and accurately inform the authorities were \u201cministerial\u201d acts. The Appellate Division divided, however, as to whether plaintiff could maintain a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress based on those ministerial acts, a majority concluding that he could. Viability of that single remaining claim is the issue now before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The Law as Applied to the Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Analysis begins with several undisputed propositions. Municipalities long ago surrendered common-law tort immunity for the negligence of their employees. A distinction is drawn, however, between \u201cdiscretionary\u201d and \u201cministerial\u201d governmental acts. A public employee\u2019s discretionary acts\u2014 meaning conduct involving the exercise of reasoned judgment\u2014 may not result in the municipality\u2019s liability even when the conduct is negligent. By contrast, ministerial acts \u2014 meaning conduct requiring adherence to a governing rule, with a compulsory result \u2014 may subject the municipal employer to liability for negligence <em>(see, Tango v Tulevech, </em>61 NY2d 34, 40-41). No one disputes that the Medical Examiner\u2019s misconduct here in failing to correct the record and deliver it to the authorities was ministerial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">There agreement ends. Plaintiff contends that the City should be liable for the Medical Examiner\u2019s \u201cministerial negligence,\u201d while defendant urges that the complaint be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">We do not agree with plaintiff that a ministerial breach by a governmental employee necessarily gives rise to municipal liability. Rather, a ministerial wrong \u201cmerely removes the issue of governmental immunity from a given case\u201d <em>(supra, </em>258 AD2d, at 111 [Sullivan, J. P., dissenting in part]). Ministerial negligence may not be immunized, but it is not necessarily tortious <em>(see, Tango v Tulevech, supra, </em>61 NY2d, at 40 [recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>available only if ministerial action <em>\u201cis otherwise tortious </em>and not justifiable pursuant to statutory command\u201d (emphasis added)]; <em>see also, </em>Robertson, <em>Municipal Tort Liability: Special Duty Issues of Police, Fire, and Safety, </em>44 Syracuse L Rev 943, 945 [\u201cwaiver-of-immunity statutes have not created new causes of action where none existed before; they have only removed the shield of governmental immunity where a cause of action would exist if the tort-feasor were a private person\u201d]). There must still be a basis to hold the municipality liable for negligence <em>(see, Florence v Goldberg, </em>44 NY2d 189, 195 [\u201cAbsent the existence and breach of* * * a duty, the abrogation of governmental immunity, in itself, affords little aid to a plaintiff seeking to cast a municipality in damages\u201d]; <em>see also, De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296 [liability for ministerial failure to process \u201c911\u201d call rested on County employee\u2019s affirmative assurances of assistance made to victim]; 18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 53.04.25, at 165 [3d rev ed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">This brings us directly to an essential element of any negligence case: duty. Without a duty running directly to the injured person there can be no liability in damages, however careless the conduct or foreseeable the harm (see, <em>Pulka v Edelman, </em>40 NY2d 781, 785, <em>rearg denied </em>41 NY2d 901; <em>see also </em>Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 53, at 357 [5th ed]; 3 Harper, James and Gray, Torts \u00a7 18.1, at 650 [2d ed]). While the Legislature can create a duty by statute, in most cases duty is defined by the courts, as a matter of policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Fixing the orbit of duty may be a difficult task. Despite often sympathetic facts in a particular case before them, courts must be mindful of the precedential, and consequential, future effects of their rulings, and \u201climit the legal consequences of wrongs to a controllable degree\u201d <em>(Tobin v Grossman, </em>24 NY2d 609, 619; <em>Strauss v Belle Realty Co., </em>65 NY2d 399, 402). Time and again we have required \u201cthat the equation be balanced; that the damaged plaintiff be able to point the finger of responsibility at a defendant owing, not a general duty to society, but a specific duty to him\u201d <em>(Johnson v Jamaica Hosp., </em>62 NY2d 523, 527; <em>see also, Palsgraf v Long Is. R. R. Co., </em>248 NY 339, 341, <em>rearg denied </em>249 NY 511).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">This is especially so where an individual seeks recovery out of the public purse. To sustain liability against a municipality, the duty breached must be more than that owed the public generally <em>(see, Florence v Goldberg, supra, </em>44 NY2d, at 195; <em>Smullen v City of New York, </em>28 NY2d 66, 70; <em>see also, </em>18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 53.04.25, at 165, <em>supra). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Indeed, we have consistently refused to impose liability for a municipality in performing a public function absent <em>\u201ca </em>duty to use due care for the benefit of particular persons or classes of persons\u201d <em>(Motyka v City of Amsterdam, </em>15 NY2d 134, 139). Here, because plaintiff cannot point to a duty owed to him by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, his negligence claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Pointing to New York City Charter \u00a7 557, plaintiff argues that the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner owed him a duty to communicate accurate information to authorities pertaining to his son\u2019s death. Section 557 charges the Chief Medical Examiner with examining \u201cbodies of persons dying from criminal violence\u201d or other suspicious circumstances, keeping \u201cfull and complete records in such form as may be provided by law,\u201d and promptly delivering \u201cto the appropriate district attorney copies of all records relating to every death as to which there, is, in the judgment of the medical examiner in charge, any indication of criminality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Violation of a statute resulting in injury gives rise to a tort action only if the intent of the statute is to protect an individual against an invasion of a property or personal interest <em>(Steitz v City of Beacon, </em>295 NY 51, 56; <em>see also, O\u2019Connor v City of New York, </em>58 NY2d 184, 189-190; <em>Motyka v City of Amsterdam, supra, </em>15 NY2d, at 139).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In <em>Steitz v City of Beacon (supra, </em>295 NY 51), for example, plaintiff sought to recover damages suffered as a result of a fire, relying on a City Charter provision requiring maintenance of a fire department. We concluded that liability could not be predicated on the Charter provision, which was not designed to protect the personal interest of any individual, but rather was \u201cdesigned to secure the benefits of well ordered municipal government enjoyed by all as members of the community\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 55). We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201cAn intention to impose upon the city the crushing burden of such an obligation should not be imputed to the Legislature in the absence of language clearly designed to have that effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">\u201cSuch [City Charter] enactments do not import intention to protect the interests of any individual except as they secure to all members of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>munity the enjoyment of rights and privileges to which they are entitled only as members of the public. Neglect in the performance of such requirements creates no civil liability to individuals\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 55-56).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">New York City Charter \u00a7 557 similarly defines one of the municipality\u2019s governmental functions. It establishes the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner as part of the City\u2019s Department of Health, and requires performance of autopsies and preparation of reports for the benefit of the public at large. Significantly, the only individual to whom the Medical Examiner must by statute report is \u201cthe appropriate district attorney\u201d <em>(see, </em>New York City Charter \u00a7 557 [g]). Neither plaintiff, nor other members of the general public who may become criminal suspects upon the death of a person, are persons \u201cfor whose especial benefit the statute was enacted\u201d <em>(see, Motyka v City of Amsterdam, supra, </em>15 NY2d, at 139). Permitting recovery here would rewrite section 557, radically enlarging both the responsibility of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the potential liability of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Nor do we find any duty to plaintiff derived from a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with him. A \u201cspecial relationship\u201d requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">\u201c(1) an assumption by the municipality, through promises or actions, of an affirmative duty to act on behalf of the party who was injured; (2) knowledge on the part of the municipality\u2019s agents that inaction could lead to harm; (3) some form of direct contact between the municipality\u2019s agents and the injured party; and (4) that party\u2019s justifiable reliance on the municipality\u2019s affirmative undertaking\u201d <em>(Cuffy v City of New York, </em>69 NY2d 255, 260).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The \u201cdirect contact\u201d and \u201creliance\u201d requirements are particularly important, as they rationally define and limit the class of persons to whom the municipality\u2019s \u201cspecial duty\u201d extends <em>(id., </em>at 261).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Those requirements are not met here. The Medical Examiner never undertook to act on plaintiffs behalf. He made no promises or assurances to plaintiff, and assumed no affirmative duty upon which plaintiff might have justifiably relied. Plaintiff alleges no personal contact with the Medical Examiner, and therefore also fails to satisfy the \u201cdirect contact\u201d requirement of the test. There is, moreover, no indication that the Medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Examiner knew that plaintiff, or anyone else, had become a suspect in the case. Nor do Medical Examiners generally owe a \u201cspecial duty\u201d to potential homicide suspects. Their function in this context is not as a law enforcement agency but solely to impart objective information to the appropriate authorities for the benefit of the public at large (see, <em>People v </em>Washington, 86 NY2d 189, 192-193).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">As we explained in <em>De Angelis v Lutheran Med. Ctr. </em>(58 NY2d 1053, 1055):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201cA line must be drawn between the competing policy considerations of providing a remedy to everyone who is injured and of extending exposure to tort liability almost without limit. It is always tempting, especially when symmetry and sympathy would so seem to be best served, to impose new duties, and, concomitantly, liabilities, regardless of the economic and social burden. But, absent legislative intervention, the fixing of the \u2018orbit\u2019 of duty, as here, in the end is the responsibility of the courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Here, in order for plaintiff\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress to be successful, we would have to impose a new duty on the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, which for the future would run to members of the public who may become subjects of a criminal investigation into a death. This we refuse to do.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The Dissents</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Fixing the orbit of duty has likely divided this Court more than any other issue. The present case is no exception, as evidenced by two dissenting opinions. Were the issue solely one of \u201chumanistic intuition\u201d or \u201cmoral duty,\u201d the result might well be otherwise. Our responsibility, however, is to set the particular case before us into its carefully developed precedential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>framework, mindful always of the opportunities the common law allows for refinements to assure that the rule or principle that emerges is a sound one.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Here we cannot agree with our dissenting colleagues that a duty to plaintiff is found under existing law. The Smith dissent, urging that the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d test has been satisfied, assumes \u201cextensive contact\u201d, between plaintiff and the Medical Examiner that is not borne out by the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor can we agree with the dissenting Judges\u2019 proposed new duty, based on negligent initiation of a course of events with foreseeable harm. This is simply not a prudent expansion of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Neither <em>Wagner, </em>nor <em>Moch, </em>nor <em>Crosland </em>\u2014 the dissenters\u2019 case law pivots \u2014 supports such a duty. In <em>Wagner v International Ry. Co. </em>(232 NY 176, 180), danger did indeed invite rescue, but significantly there was a recognized duty owed by defendant railroad directly to its passenger, who was the subject of the rescue; there was no comparable relationship between plaintiff and the Medical Examiner. In <em>Moch Co. v Rensselaer Water Co. </em>(247 NY 160, 168), the Court acknowledged that launching \u201ca force or instrument of harm\u201d might constitute legally cognizable negligence. Any liability for such conduct, however, nonetheless required a recognized duty on the part of the municipal defendant running to the plaintiff. Indeed, Moch exemplifies the principle we apply today: the Court there <em>dismissed </em>plaintiffs claim, concluding the action was \u201cnot maintainable as one for a common-law tort\u201d because defendant waterworks company \u2014 having contracted to supply water to the City \u2014 owed no duty directly to the plaintiff when the water supply failed and its warehouse was destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Finally, <em>Crosland v New York City Tr. Auth. </em>(68 NY2d 165, 169-170), addressing the standard of care owed by a publicly owned common carrier to its passengers, is also readily distinguishable. Relying on Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1212 (3), which authorizes private recovery against the Transit Authority for the negligence of its employees in the operation of the subway system, the Court in <em>Crosland </em>held that defendant could be liable for its employees\u2019 negligent failure to summon aid while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>watching, from a position of safety, a passenger beaten to death. As we made clear in <em>Kircher v City of Jamestown </em>(74 NY2d 251, 254-255, n 1), the City\u2019s statutory responsibility was key to our holding in <em>Crosland. </em>There is no similar responsibility here.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Among the many concerns courts have in enlarging the ambit of duty \u2014 especially in the area of municipal liability \u2014 is concern for the consequential effects of their decision. The Bellacosa dissent insists that its proposed heightened duty is \u201cinevitably narrowed\u201d and \u201cpinpointed,\u201d owing to a \u201crelatively self-defined, small circle of potential suspects\u201d \u2014 indeed, \u201cextending] only to this plaintiff.\u201d We cannot agree that this is so. In our view, allowing emotional distress claims against a municipality for an official\u2019s negligent failure to transmit correct information to law enforcement authorities conducting criminal investigations in this case will have far-reaching effects in future cases. As is already evident, the argument for the next case quickly becomes \u201cThe duty of care that this Court recognized in <em>[Lauer] </em>places the duty that ought to be recognized in this case within the realm and contemplation of that precedent\u201d <em>(see, e.g., </em>Bellacosa, J., dissenting opn, at 118).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In the end, plaintiff\u2019s claim is not supported by existing law, and we cannot agree that the proposed enlargement of the orbit of duty, resting largely on the foreseeability of harm, is a sound one.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, the complaint dismissed and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\">. This Court has been especially reluctant to broaden the concept of duty where, as here, the injury alleged is negligently inflicted emotional injury (see, <em>e.g., Johnson v Jamaica Hosp., supra, </em>62 NY2d, at 530). The dissenting Judges would unduly expand the narrow, limited class of cases where we have permitted recovery for emotional injury based on the long-established, common-law duty to next of kin with respect to the death of close family members <em>(see, </em>Smith, J., dissenting opn, at 114, citing <em>Johnson v State of New York, </em>37 NY2d 378, 381-382; <em>Darcy v Presbyterian Hosp., </em>202 NY 259). Those cases, however, do not support the quite different duty urged here, which would make a municipality liable, for emotional injury, to an open-ended plaintiff class of potential suspects in criminal investigations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\">. <em>Sorichetti v City of New York </em>(65 NY2d 461) is in no way analogous <em>(see, </em>Smith, J., dissenting opn, at 113). In <em>Sorichetti, </em>a special relationship between the City and infant plaintiff arose out of an order of protection, <em>plus </em>the City\u2019s knowledge \u2014 through direct dealings with the family \u2014 of the specific danger to the child, <em>plus </em>the City\u2019s instructions to the mother on the day of the assault, <em>plus </em>her reasonable expectation that the police would protect them <em>(id., </em>at 469).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b207-8\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">(dissenting). Because I believe that plaintiff Edward G. Lauer has adequately pleaded a prima facie case for negligent infliction of emotional distress, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">On August 6, 1993, plaintiff and his wife took their three-year-old son Andrew to the hospital because he was gasping for breath. After an examination, the hospital sent the child home. The next morning the child was dead. Defendant Eddy Lilavois, a medical examiner from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), conducted an autopsy and concluded that the child was murdered by \u201cblunt injuries of [the] neck and brain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">An investigation by the District Attorney focused almost immediately on plaintiff. On August 31, 1993, however, approximately three weeks after the initial autopsy, Dr. Angeline R Mastri and Dr. Lilavois examined Andrew\u2019s brain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>concluded that he died of natural causes from an aneurysm due to dysplasia of a branch of the left posterior cerebral artery. On that day, Drs. Lilavois and Mastri prepared a neuropathology report reflecting the accurate cause of Andrew\u2019s death. The report was filed with the OCME on October 14, 1993. Neither the New York City Police Department nor the District Attorney\u2019s office was apprised of the OCME\u2019s new findings regarding the true cause of Andrew\u2019s death. The Lauers were also not informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Police investigators allegedly attended Andrew\u2019s funeral, informing plaintiffs friends and family that plaintiff had \u201ctwisted his son\u2019s neck\u201d and had \u201ckilled his son.\u201d Many of plaintiffs friends and family became openly hostile towards him, and his wife sued him for divorce. In addition, plaintiff was forced to sell his home because he was ostracized by his neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In March 1995, approximately 17 months after the OCME discovered the true cause of death, the New York Daily News began an inquiry into the status of the police investigation. The newspaper learned from the OCME that \u201ccoroners had long ago reclassified Andrew\u2019s death as natural.\u201d It was only upon the Daily News\u2019 expos\u00e9 that the authorities learned that Andrew\u2019s death was no longer considered a homicide. The OCME subsequently amended the autopsy report and prepared an amended death certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Plaintiff commenced this action against the City of New York, the OCME, Dr. Lilavois, and the NYPD (collectively, defendants), sounding in intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, defamation and civil rights violations. Supreme Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint except for the causes of action alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. On defendants\u2019 appeal and plaintiffs cross appeal, the Appellate Division determined that only the cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress was viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">On this appeal, defendants contend that by failing to provide the District Attorney with an amended autopsy report, Dr. Lilavois and the OCME breached a governmental duty owed to the public at large, not a duty owed directly to plaintiff, and thus they are protected by governmental immunity. Plaintiff counters that Dr. Lilavois\u2019 omission was a breach of a ministerial function, for which governmental immunity does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>In my view, plaintiff has adequately alleged the breach of a ministerial duty for which defendants may be held liable in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Although municipalities in this State have long surrendered their common-law tort immunity for the misfeasance of their employees, limitations exist regarding the scope of municipal tort liability. Generally, governmental immunity will attach when the official act of a municipal employee \u201cinvolves the exercise of discretion or expert judgment in policy matters\u201d and a municipal defendant will not be liable in damages for injuries sustained, even if resulting from negligence or malice <em>(Haddock v City of New York, </em>75 NY2d 478, 484). If the action is exclusively ministerial, however, the municipality \u201cwill be liable if [the action] is otherwise tortious and not justifiable pursuant to statutory command\u201d <em>(Tango v Tulevech, </em>61 NY2d 34, 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Although distinguishing between an act of discretion and a ministerial function may sometimes be difficult, this Court has articulated a basic rule which serves as a guidepost in helping courts make the distinction. \u201c[D]iscretionary or quasi-judicial acts involve the exercise of reasoned judgment which could typically produce different acceptable results whereas a ministerial act envisions direct adherence to a governing rule or standard with a compulsory result\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 41).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Turning to the actions of Dr. Lilavois, a medical examiner\u2019s conclusions after an autopsy regarding an individual\u2019s cause of death involve the exercise of reasoned professional judgment and discretion. Thus, the doctor\u2019s initial erroneous conclusion that Andrew died from \u201c[b]lunt injuries of the neck and brain\u201d and his characterization of the child\u2019s death as a homicide would be cloaked with governmental immunity. In contrast, Dr. Lilavois\u2019 duty to notify prosecuting authorities of an error in the original autopsy diagnosis stems from a duty delineated by the New York City Charter \u00a7 557 (g), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">\u201cThe chief medical examiner shall keep full and complete records in such form as may be provided by law. The chief medical examiner shall promptly deliver to the appropriate district attorney copies of all records relating to every death as to which there is, in the judgment of the medical examiner in charge, any indication of criminality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Compliance with the requirements of section 557 required no exercise of reasoned judgment on the part of Dr. Lilavois and the Appellate Division properly deemed the omission a breach of a ministerial function.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Defendants\u2019 contention that even if Dr. Lilavois failed to perform a ministerial function, he breached a duty only to the public at large and not to plaintiff individually should be rejected. Municipal immunity presupposes an exercise of discretion while performing a governmental function <em>(Cuffy v City of New York, </em>69 NY2d 255). We have articulated that the policy rationale underlying governmental immunity \u201creflects a value judgment that \u2014 despite injury to a member of the public \u2014 the broader interest in having government officers and employees free to exercise judgment and discretion in their official functions, unhampered by fear of second-guessing and retaliatory lawsuits, outweighs the benefits to be had from imposing liability for that injury\u201d <em>(Haddock v City of New York, </em>75 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 484; <em>Mon v City of New York, </em>78 NY2d 309, 313). Where, however, a municipal employee fails to perform a ministerial task, liability should attach, so long as a common-law duty running from the municipality to the individual claiming injury is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">With regard to whether the OCME owed a duty to plaintiff to accurately report the status of Andrew\u2019s death, general principles of negligence law are instructive. Liability sounding in negligence must first be premised upon a finding of a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff <em>(D\u2019Amico v Christie, </em>71 NY2d 76, 87). The concept of legal duty merges logic, science and public policy to determine whether the plaintiffs interests are entitled to legal protection against a defendant\u2019s conduct <em>(Turcotte v Fell, </em>68 NY2d 432, 437; <em>De Angelis v Lutheran Med. Ctr., </em>58 NY2d 1053, 1055). While foreseeability of injury does not solely determine the existence of a duty, that rule must be balanced with the well-established principle that \u201c[t]he risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed, and risk imports relation\u201d <em>(Palsgraf v Long Is. R. R. Co., </em>248 NY 339, 344). In other words, foreseeability of injury and duty are not two discrete concepts when considering li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ability grounded in negligence. Thus, \u201c \u2018whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense who did think would at once recognize that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct with regard to the circumstances he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger\u2019 \u201d <em>(Havas v Victory Paper Stock Co., </em>49 NY2d 381, 386, quoting <em>Heaven v Prender, </em>11 QBD 503, 509, Britt, MR [1883]).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Here, once Dr.. Lilavois characterized Andrew\u2019s death as a homicide and shortly thereafter learned that Andrew died of natural causes, a duty arose to plaintiff, an individual targeted by the investigation, resulting from the erroneous report. Dr. Lilavois knew that characterizing Andrew\u2019s death as a homicide was the impetus for the police investigation. Moreover, he allegedly knew that plaintiff was suspected in the homicide. Thus, the risk of failing to communicate the exculpatory evidence to the proper authorities, evidence which Dr. Lilavois and the OCME alone possessed, was reasonably perceivable. Dr. Lilavois knew or should have known that failing to exercise reasonable care under these circumstances would cause injury to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Although a court, exercising extreme caution, may impose a legal duty where none previously existed <em>(Pulka v Edelman, </em>40 NY2d 781, 786), imposing a duty under these circumstances would not lead this Court into novel, uncharted waters of legal consequences. For example, liability in negligence may rest on a defendant\u2019s nondisclosure, which misleads a third party and results in injury or damage to a plaintiff predicated on the fact that \u201cthe misrepresentation or nondisclosure has led the person to whom it was made to forego action that might otherwise have been taken for the protection of the plaintiff\u2019 <em>(Eiseman v State of New York, </em>70 NY2d 175, 187). This Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201cLiability in such cases arises only where there is a duty * * * to give the correct information * * *. There must be knowledge, or its equivalent that the information is desired for a serious purpose; that he to whom it is given intends to rely and act upon it; that, if false or erroneous he will because of it be injured in person or property. Finally, the relationship of the parties <em>* * * </em>must be such that * * * the one has the right to rely upon the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>for information, and the other giving the information owes a duty to give it with care\u201d <em>(International Prods. Co. v Erie R. R. Co., </em>244 NY 331, 338; <em>see also, Eiseman v State of New York, supra, </em>at 187-188).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Applying these principles to this case, defendants owed a duty to plaintiff upon which liability may be predicated. It is undisputed that Dr. Lilavois breached his duty to \u201cpromptly deliver to the appropriate district attorney copies of all records relating to\u201d Andrew\u2019s death (NY City Charter \u00a7 557 [g]). Moreover, there can be no question that Dr. Lilavois knew (1) of the importance and seriousness of communicating correct information to the proper authorities regarding the actual cause of Andrew\u2019s death, (2) that the authorities were acting upon his initial assessment of the cause of death as a homicide, and that they relied upon the OCME to act with due care in deciphering Andrew\u2019s cause of death, and (3) that an error of this kind would lead to an unnecessary homicide investigation and possibly an erroneous arrest. Thus, the nature of the relationship between the OCME and the District Attorney was such that the District Attorney had the right to rely on the other for information regarding criminality in death. Once Dr. Lilavois and the OCME learned of the true cause of Andrew\u2019s death, they had a duty to act with reasonable care to inform the authorities, knowing that nondisclosure would result in further injury to plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In <em>Eiseman v State of New York </em>(70 NY2d 175, <em>supra), </em>this Court considered whether the State owed a legal duty to the estate of a decedent killed by an ex-felon admitted into a government-sponsored college program after a prison physician inaccurately completed a medical report indicating that the ex-felon had no history of mental instability. This Court declined to impose a duty on the State, concluding that the physician\u2019s duty to accurately report the ex-felon\u2019s medical history ran only to the college and not the entire college community. Moreover, questions existed regarding whether the physician had in fact withheld any information personally known to him and whether the physician was aware of or should have been aware that the information would be relied on by the decedent, or other students, as his representation of the ex-felon\u2019s medical history <em>(id., </em>at 189).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The facts of this case hardly mirror the circumstances in <em>Eiseman. </em>Dr. Lilavois knew that an investigation into Andrew\u2019s death was pending pursuant to his initial report and he alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>edly knew that plaintiff was a suspect. Thus, the possibility of danger to plaintiff here was so \u201capparent as to entitle him to be protected\u201d <em>(Palsgraf v Long Is. R. R. Co., </em>248 NY 339, 345, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The imposition of a duty in this case is further supported by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crosland v New York City Tr. Auth. </em>(68 NY2d 165). In that case, the Court ruled that the New York City Transit Authority owed a duty to one of its passengers who was beaten to death by hoodlums as Transit Authority employees stood by and did nothing. In holding that \u201cMatching someone being beaten from a vantage point offering both safety and the means to summon help without danger is within the narrow range of circumstances which could be found to be actionable\u201d <em>(supra, </em>at 170), the Court rejected the Authority\u2019s governmental immunity-based argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the Court stated that because the Authority\u2019s employee unreasonably failed to summon aid though he could have done so without risk to himself, such failure was beyond the boundary of immunity articulated in <em>Weiner v Metropolitan Transp. Auth. </em>(55 NY2d 175). Instead, balancing several policy considerations, the Court considered compensation for the victim and general deterrence, and concluded that the Authority had \u201cfailed to insure that its employees observe not only its own regulations, but also common standards of behavior\u201d <em>(Crosland v New York City Tr. Auth., supra, </em>at 170).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Although the majority points out that the Transit Authority in <em>Crosland </em>was liable pursuant to Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1212 (3), that statute merely states that the Transit Authority \u201cshall be liable for * * * the negligence of\u2019 a duly appointed employee. In holding the conduct of the Transit Authority actionable, the Court implicitly decided the legal question of duty, and determined that the Transit Authority owed a duty to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Indeed, <em>Crosland </em>reflects the flexibility of this Court to balance considerations of social welfare and public interest against the boundaries of tort responsibility. The concept of duty is not static. As part of the common-law process, courts may indeed fashion the scope of duty \u201cby balancing factors, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>reasonable expectations of parties and society generally, the proliferation of claims * * * disproportionate risk and reparation allocation, and public policies affecting the expansion or limitation of new channels of liability\u201d <em>(Palka v Servicemaster Mgt. Servs. Corp., </em>83 NY2d 579, 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In this case, like the Transit Authority employee in <em>Crosland, </em>Dr. Lilavois\u2019 ministerial, mechanical task of notifying the authorities required nothing more than minimal efforts to avert a grave injustice. Plaintiff had a right to reasonably expect that the OCME perform its ministerial duties with reasonable care and in compliance with statutory mandates. Indeed society as a whole has the right to reasonably expect the same, particularly where, as here, misfeasance has such far-reaching implications. The imposition of liability here would not therefore contravene public policy. On the contrary, liability under these circumstances would affirm the reasonable expectations of both the parties and society. Moreover, it would emphasize to those who fail to use care that there are consequences for their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Finally, by causing a criminal investigation, Dr. Lilavois initiated a chain of events that created a danger to plaintiff. Subsequently, upon realizing that he created an unreasonable danger to plaintiff, a targeted suspect of the investigation, Dr. Lilavois had a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent the harm <em>(Moch Co. v Rensselaer Water Co., </em>247 NY 160, 167; Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 321; <em>see also, id., </em>illustration 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">This Court has stated that, absent a special relationship, \u201ca municipality does not owe a duty to its citizens in the performance of governmental functions, and thus courts will not examine the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the municipality\u2019s actions\u201d <em>(Sorichetti v City of New York, </em>65 NY2d 461, 468). There can be no serious dispute here that Dr. Lilavois\u2019 negligent act was ministerial in nature. Thus, plaintiff need not show the existence of a special relationship to establish defendants\u2019 liability <em>(see, Boland v State of New York, </em>218 AD2d 235). Nevertheless, the facts demonstrate that a special relationship between defendants and plaintiff existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">In <em>Cuffy v City of New York </em>(69 NY2d 255, 260), this Court delineated the four elements of a special relationship, which are: \u201c(1) an assumption by the municipality, through promises or actions, of an affirmative duty to act on behalf of the party who was injured; (2) knowledge on the part of the municipality\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>agents that inaction could lead to harm; (3) some form of direct contact between the municipality\u2019s agents and the injured party; and (4) that party\u2019s justifiable reliance on the municipality\u2019s affirmative undertaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">These four factors are sufficiently alleged in this case. The OCME assumed control of Andrew\u2019s remains and undertook an affirmative duty, through its actions, to correctly determine the cause of death. Once labeling the death a homicide, Dr. Lilavois and the OCME knew that such characterization would prompt a police investigation. Setting an investigation into motion, the doctor and the OCME knew or should have known that any failure to come forth with exculpatory information could unnecessarily prolong the police investigation, causing harm to the limited number of individuals suspected of the crime. Significantly, Dr. Lilavois and the OCME exclusively possessed the exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The \u201cdirect contact\u201d element, \u201cwhich is closely related to the element of reliance, serves to rationally limit the class of persons to whom the municipality\u2019s duty of protection runs and exists\u201d <em>(Kircher v City of Jamestown, </em>74 NY2d 251, 257). While direct contact is necessary, this Court has not been overly rigid in its application, taking the particularities of each case into consideration <em>(Cuffy v City of New York, </em>69 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 261-262). For example, in <em>Sorichetti v City of New York </em>(65 NY2d 461, <em>supra), </em>this Court permitted contact between the mother of an injured infant and the police to substitute for contact directly between the police and the infant <em>(compare, Kircher v City of Jamestown, supra </em>[direct contact not satisfied where two strangers to plaintiff notified police of plaintiff\u2019s danger]).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Here, plaintiff alleges that he had extensive contact with the OCME. While the extent of the contact is not clear from the record, this appeal is before us through a motion to dismiss. Given the procedural posture, plaintiff has been foreclosed up to this point from conducting discovery. Presumably, an agent from the OCME came to retrieve Andrew\u2019s body from plaintiffs home. However, what the record does establish is that Andrew\u2019s body came into direct contact with the OCME and that plaintiff is Andrew\u2019s next of kin. Under the circumstances of this case, Andrew\u2019s body, in which plaintiff maintained a cognizable property interest <em>(see generally, Darcy v Presbyterian Hosp., </em>202 NY 259), is another link between plaintiff and the OCME, and sufficiently distinguishes plaintiff from the public at large (see, <em>Kircher v City of Jamestown, supra, </em>at 257-258).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Finally, the key element of justifiable reliance is adequately alleged. Indeed, plaintiff had no choice but to rely on the OCME for an accurate assessment of Andrew\u2019s cause of death. Furthermore, plaintiff relied on the OCME to correctly report to the authorities any information in this regard. Even if defendant\u2019s initial conclusion regarding the nature of Andrew\u2019s death is shielded from liability, at a minimum, plaintiff had the right to rely upon the OCME to competently perform its statutorily mandated duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The conclusion that a special relationship exists does not mean that plaintiff may automatically recover. It remains a question for the trier of fact as to whether plaintiff has established the claims raised in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">One to whom a duty of care is owed may recover for injuries sustained as a result of negligently caused psychological trauma so long as consequential physical manifestations of trauma exist <em>(Johnson v State of New York, </em>37 NY2d 378, 381). Requiring physical manifestations, rather than emotional symptoms alone, is thought to provide an index of reliability <em>(id.). </em>This Court has recognized several exceptions to the rule requiring physical symptoms, however. One may recover for the emotional harm resulting from (1) the negligent transmission by a telegraph company of a message announcing death <em>(id., </em>at 382), (2) the negligent misinformation to a next of kin regarding the death of a relative (id.; <em>see also, Rotondo v Reeves, </em>153 Misc 2d 769 [father could maintain action to recover damages for emotional distress from coroner\u2019s mistaken identification of family\u2019s pet rabbit\u2019s remains as those of the child and the consequent delay in discovering the true remains]), (3) the negligent mishandling of a corpse <em>(Darcy v Presbyterian Hosp., </em>202 NY 259, <em>supra), </em>and (4) the denial of access to control the body of a deceased relative <em>(Lando v State of New York, </em>39 NY2d 803, 805). In those cases, this Court has recognized that there exists \u201c \u2018an especial likelihood of genuine and serious mental distress, arising from the special circumstances, which serves as a guarantee that the claim is not spurious\u2019 \u201d <em>(Johnson v State of New York, </em>37 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 382).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The unique circumstances of this case present a sufficient guarantee of genuineness and seriousness to sustain a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The record establishes that for 17 months plaintiff was erroneously suspected of the murder of his only son. Plaintiff\u2019s emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>injuries were allegedly the proximate result of Dr. Lilavois\u2019 failure to inform authorities that Andrew\u2019s death was caused by natural circumstances rather than homicide, as initially suspected. Believing that plaintiff was a murderer, his wife divorced him. His family, friends and neighbors shunned him. For close to two years, plaintiff needlessly lived under a cloud of suspicion, allegedly enduring depression and loss of weight caused by the nightmare he lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Under the circumstances presented, plaintiff should be given the opportunity to prove his allegations <em>(see, </em>Prosser, Torts \u00a7 54, at 330 [4th ed]; <em>see also, Bovsun v Sanperi, </em>61 NY2d 219, 231; <em>Battalla v State of New York, </em>10 NY2d 237, 240-242).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">. While New York City Charter \u00a7 557 requires the Medical Examiner to report his autopsy findings to the District Attorney, it cannot be disputed that the autopsy report is available to the next of kin (see, <em>e.g., </em>County Law \u00a7 677 [3] [b]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\">. The Court expressly rejected the plaintiffs argument that the Authority owed the plaintiff a special duty because no evidence of direct contact between Authority agents and decedent existed. Furthermore, the Court ruled that liability to the Authority could not be premised on the alleged breach of Transit Authority rule 85, which imposed a duty higher than the Authority actually owed to decedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b217-7\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGZ\">(also dissenting). I agree with Judge Smith\u2019s lead dissenting opinion, and add this expression to augment my vote for affirmance of the Appellate Division order.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">This State\u2019s tort jurisprudence recognizes that \u201c[d] anger invites rescue\u201d <em>(Wagner v International Ry. Co., </em>232 NY 176, 180). That renowned case offers apt pari materia reasoning, and much more in the way of classic Cardozean guidance that is transcendent <em>(id., </em>at 180-182 [\u201cThe law does not ignore these reactions of the mind in tracing conduct to its consequences\u201d and in determining that the \u201cquality\u201d of a defendant\u2019s acts relating to duty are appropriately questions of fact for a jury in circumstances such as are presented there and here]).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">When an official initiates a course of events that creates a particular danger, then affirmatively maintains the Sword of Damocles over and directly onto the head of a particular individual, a common-law duty to that endangered and harmed person ought to be recognized. This Court would do well to make the policy choice open to it in this case, by acknowledging this legal duty. The effect here would merely allow an opportunity, as in <em>Wagner, </em>for a jury to redress the Job-like ruination of plaintiff\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The ruling I propose is especially warranted when the public servant, who precipitated the investigation of plaintiff as the suspect in the wrongfully certified homicide of his three-year-old son, fails to remove or at least mitigate the risk and harm that enveloped the life of that one knowable person. Time, circumstance, and place make the Medical Examiner\u2019s matter-of-course intervention a reasonable and feasible obligation. The care would, in balanced and controllable theory, extend only to this plaintiff. Indeed, the theoretical, foreseeable class would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>be a relatively self-defined, small circle of potential suspects, in any event (compare the widened duty perimeter in <em>Wagner, supra, </em>and cases discussed <em>infra). </em>Moreover, a mathematical process of elimination naturally reduces the operational reach of this rule, and would not result in some open-ended potential drain on the public purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Next, the juridical norm I proffer is particularly appropriate \u2014 arguably, at an a fortiori level \u2014 when the culpable employee unilaterally possesses the exclusive knowledge and singular power to right the wrong. He should be legally accountable for failing to act reasonably at the time when complete innocence became medically known and certain to him. It should not be overlooked that the public at large was never potentially a suspect in the infant\u2019s death; as it turned out and from the outset, only plaintiff was a beleaguered suspect from the moment the mistaken notice of a \u201chomicide\u201d by \u201cblunt injuries to the neck and brain\u201d was reported by the Medical Examiner to the District Attorney of Queens County. Death actually occurred from a natural cause \u2014 a ruptured aneurysm within the youngster\u2019s brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">This duty theorem should be as much the legal canon, as it is the humanistic intuition and moral duty of anyone with such official control over another human being \u2014 indeed, someone in a unique and proximate position to \u201crescue\u201d the very person he spliced onto the investigatory slide. This corollary to standard tort duty propositions involving the general governmental responsibility to the public evolves as an inevitably narrowed obligation, directed toward the unmistakably sole identifiable object of the Medical Examiner\u2019s series of actions and subsequent inactions <em>(see, </em>Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 321; <em>see also, id., </em>comment <em>a, </em>illustration 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The general and the particular duties would thus complement one another, most justifiably <em>(Moch Co. v Rensselaer Water Co., </em>247 NY 160, 167-168). <em>Moch </em>teaches: \u201cIf conduct has gone forward to such a stage that inaction would commonly result, not negatively merely in withholding a benefit, but <em>positively or actively in working an injury, there exists a relation out of which arises a duty to go forward. </em>* * * The query always is whether the putative wrongdoer has advanced to such a point as to have launched a force or instrument of harm, or has stopped where inaction is at most a refusal to become an instrument for good\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added, citations omitted]). Indeed, <em>Moch </em>also presciently warns against facile classifications or demarcations that contribute to calcifications in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the articulation and application of legal principles to real cases <em>(Moch Co. v Rensselaer Water Co., supra; see also, </em>Cardozo, Nature of the Judicial Process, at 19-23 [Yale Univ Press]). Legal principles should evolve with suppleness and flexible analysis <em>(see, Palka v Servicemaster Mgt. Servs. Corp., </em>83 NY2d 579, 585 [\u201cCommon-law experience teaches that duty is not something derived or discerned from an algebraic formula\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">To immunize the kind of alleged misconduct described by the pleading of this case would reward government agents who hide the truth and sweep wrongdoings under a rug of tort impunity. In such instances, truly responsible public employees have little to no incentive to own up to wrongdoings, since their official information is usually their secret (especially so in this case), and aggrieved parties will be barred from even entering a courthouse, no less reaching a trial airing of the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The danger to the public purse and public tort policy is not sufficient or proportionate enough to block any chance of accountability and redress here. The zone of the proposed duty, as paradigmed through this case for future guidance, would be prudently limited by the exceptional quality and quantum of factors in this hard, and yes sympathetic, case. The sympathy feature, I must emphasize, does not drive my analysis; nor should it, on the other hand, disqualify the plaintiff and his case from common-law evolvement. The precedential template I propose is fully consistent with this Court\u2019s careful line drawing on the threshold duty question <em>(see, e.g., Bovsun v Sanperi, </em>61 NY2d 219; <em>see also especially, Crosland v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>68 NY2d 165, 170).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The key language of <em>Crosland </em>is particularly instructive, and not legally, realistically or semantically distinguishable, as the majority proposes. We said in Crosland: \u201cWatching someone being beaten from a vantage point [subway token booth] offering both safety and the means to summon help without danger is within the narrow range of circumstances which could be found to be actionable <em>(cf. Putnam v Broadway &amp; Seventh Ave. R. R. Co., </em>55 NY 108, 116; <em>Scalise v City of New York, </em>3 NY2d 951)\u201d <em>(Crosland v New York City Tr. Auth., supra, </em>at 170). The allegations of plaintiffs complaint and the accompanying affidavits on this CPLR 3211 (a) (7) motion present enough to warrant further opportunity to proceed in the case. The next stages might uncover the direct and associated dealings of all the parties through EBTs, official files and medical records. Plaintiff is, after all, entitled to every favorable inference at this first pleading stage. Therefore, the Medical Examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>should not be deemed, unrealistically or simply, ignorant of what he had officially unleashed against this particular plaintiff \u2014 the prime and only suspect in a homicide that never was. That is too easy an \u201cout\u201d for the Medical Examiner who ought to be in an even higher duty position and relationship than the subway token booth clerk in <em>Crosland. </em>That lesser ranking employee was held to a duty to an ordinary subway passenger \u2014 a victim with whom he otherwise never had anything to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">After the follow-up autopsy proving that no crime was committed, the Medical Examiner did not so much as phone or E-mail the District Attorney or the investigating detectives of the New York Police Department with a simple message, e.g., \u201cI was wrong when I reported this as a homicide. The child died of natural causes. Please stop the investigation of this man.\u201d Instead, he did not even amend the death certificate for two years until a newspaper blew the whistle on this tragedy. The duty of care that this Court recognized in <em>Crosland </em>places the duty that ought to be recognized in this case within the realm and contemplation of that precedent. The compelling reason is that here the \u201csafe observer\u201d personally and officially initiated the criminal investigation of this plaintiff and had to know that it was ongoing. Yet, he like the subway clerk did not \u201csummon help\u201d from his lofty post, nor did he even lift a finger to stop the ongoing damage to plaintiff. Yet, he was the most proximate, immediate and only agent in a position to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The issue in this case, after all, does not hinge on a general duty to the public or merely a ministerial one that is imposed on the Medical Examiner under the reporting statute <em>(see, </em>New York City Charter \u00a7 557 [g]). This case involves a heightened duty phase, triggered at the subsequent and next level of particularized obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">I am, therefore, persuaded that the fact-pattern parameters and the pinpointed legal rule that would emerge from this case would parallel and build incrementally on the tempered configurations of cases like <em>Crosland </em>and <em>Wagner (supra) (see also and compare, Kircher v City of Jamestown, </em>74 NY2d 251, 262 [dissenting opn, Bellacosa, J.], <em>Merced v City of New York, </em>75 NY2d 798, 800 [concurrence, Bellacosa, J.], <em>with Mastroianni v County of Suffolk, </em>91 NY2d 198).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The principle and analysis that I endorse, along with Judge Smith, are what the law ought to proclaim as the standard measurement of human and governmental conduct to foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>responsible and accountable discharges of specific obligations to generally governed and yet directly affected citizens. That is one of the traditional purposes of tort law principles. Prudent and fair evolvement of the common law supports this tort law policy choice. That is the process and role this Court has long taken, generally toward the positive development of the law, and particularly as applied to cognizable supplicants for judicial redress, like this plaintiff <em>(see, </em>Cardozo, Nature of the Judicial Process, at 133-137 and 161-167 [Yale Univ Press]).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The step back from this opportunity \u2014 by operation of the majority reversal in this case of the sound Appellate Division majority ruling below \u2014 seals an undeniable miscarriage of justice. It was, to be sure, set in motion by the series of alleged blunders by the New York City Medical Examiner in this case. Instead of \u201crescuing\u201d Lauer with the newly discovered truth, the Medical Examiner, under the microscope of the most benign reading of the allegations, remained grossly indifferent to stemming the harm he had let loose.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Plaintiff has sought only a day in court that is now foreclosed, thus immunizing the government\u2019s alleged wrongdoing against a concededly innocent citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Judges Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judges Bellacosa and Smith dissent and vote to affirm in separate opinions in which each concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
