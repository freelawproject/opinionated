In 1988, CalPERS and Equitable Real Estate Investment Management, Inc. entered a \u201cCorrespondent Agreement for Commercial Property Loans.\u201d Under the Correspondent Agreement, Equitable originates and closes commercial property loans for sale and assignment to CalPERS. Equitable is responsible under the Correspondent Agreement for retaining counsel to provide advice and services in connection with the loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">In August 1993, CalPERS agreed to purchase a $23,300,000 long-term commercial loan that Equitable proposed to make to a New York borrower, Nathan L. Serota. After receiving CalPERS\u2019 commitment approving the loan, Equitable in turn executed a commitment approving Serota\u2019s application. Serota subsequently assigned the commitment to Sersons Corp. Equit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>able retained defendant Shearman &amp; Sterling as counsel in negotiating and closing the Sersons loan. CalPERS and Equitable had developed standard form loan documents, including a promissory note that contained a prepayment and acceleration penalty, for use in connection with the loan transactions under the Correspondent Agreement. CalPERS alleges that Equitable asked Shearman &amp; Sterling to incorporate the agreed-upon standard form note into the loan documents. At Equitable\u2019s request, Shearman &amp; Sterling prepared the documents and sent a draft note to CalPERS and its counsel. In its cover letter to CalPERS\u2019 counsel, Shearman &amp; Sterling indicated that the documents enclosed included Equitable\u2019s standard loan forms, which had been black-lined to reflect changes required by New York law and those negotiated by Sersons; one of the black-lined provisions was the acceleration clause of the loan. CalPERS made no objection to the loan documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">At the closing in November 1994, Sersons executed the note and delivered it to Equitable. A month later, Equitable assigned the note by an instrument entitled \u201cOmnibus Assignment of Loan Documents.\u201d The instrument purported to assign all of Equitable\u2019s \u201cright, title and interest in, to and under the [loan] documents\u201d to CalPERS. The assignment was made \u201cwithout recourse to, and without covenant or warranty (express or implied) by, Assignor, except as set forth in\u201d the Correspondent Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Subsequently, Sersons defaulted and CalPERS accelerated the loan. CalPERS asserts that only then did it discover that the note provided for an acceleration fee of approximately $1.1 million, rather than $9.1 million had the note been drafted in conformity with the standard CalPERS note. In March 1997, Sersons paid CalPERS the $1.1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Before commencing this lawsuit, CalPERS and Equitable entered into a Settlement Agreement whereby Equitable paid Ca]PERS $400,000.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Settlement Agreement noted the previous Omnibus Assignment and declared that both Equitable and CalPERS had intended to include in the assignment all possible claims relating to the note \u201cincluding without limitation all causes of action * * * relating to professional malpractice, including without limitation all causes of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>against, and rights to sue, Shearman &amp; Sterling for negligence and breach of contract.\u201d Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Equitable further assigned to CalPERS all of its rights \u201cto the extent * * * not previously assigned, arising from or relating in any manner whatsoever to the Sersons loan transaction, including without limitation all Equitable\u2019s causes of action against, and rights to sue, Shearman &amp; Sterling for negligence and breach of contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">CalPERS, as the assignee of Equitable\u2019s rights under the loan documents, then commenced this action against Shear-man &amp; Sterling, asserting two causes of action for professional negligence and breach of contract. CalPERS also alleged that its relationship with the law firm was \u201cso close as to approach that of privity of contract\u201d to permit it to raise direct claims of negligence and breach of contract against Shearman &amp; Sterling. Lastly, CalPERS claimed third-party beneficiary status under the Equitable and Shearman &amp; Sterling contract to sustain its direct claims against the law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Shearman &amp; Sterling moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. Supreme Court granted the motion in part, dismissing only the direct causes of action based on its conclusion that CalPERS had not alleged facts sufficient to show either that CalPERS had a relationship approaching privity with Shearman &amp; Sterling or that CalPERS was the intended third-party beneficiary of Shearman &amp; Sterling\u2019s contract with Equitable. The court noted that although the language in the Omnibus Assignment was legally insufficient to effect an assignment of Equitable\u2019s claims, the specific language in the subsequent Settlement Agreement did assign Equitable\u2019s claims to CalPERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The Appellate Division dismissed the complaint in its entirety (269 AD2d 221). The Court agreed that the language in the Omnibus Assignment did not transfer Equitable\u2019s claims against Shearman &amp; Sterling to CalPERS but rejected the contention that the Settlement Agreement nevertheless assigned those claims to CalPERS. The Appellate Division noted that, upon assignment of the loan to CalPERS, Equitable received the full benefit of its bargain with CalPERS. The Court concluded that \u201c[s]ince injury is an essential element of a cause of action for legal malpractice * * * the elimination of any injury to Equitable upon the assignment of the loan extinguished any malpractice claims Equitable may have had against defendant related to the loan, and Equitable could not thereafter assign such defunct claims\u201d <em>(supra, </em>at 222). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>As an initial matter, we agree with the courts below that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to establish that CalPERS and Shearman &amp; Sterling had a relationship so close as to approach that of privity. We have long held that \u201cbefore a party may recover in tort for pecuniary loss sustained as a result of another\u2019s negligent misrepresentations there must be a showing that there was either actual privity of contract between the parties or a relationship so close as to approach that of privity\u201d <em>(Prudential Ins. Co. v Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer &amp; Wood, </em>80 NY2d 377, 382 [citing <em>Ossining Union Free School Dist. v Anderson LaRocca Anderson, </em>73 NY2d 417, 424; <em>Credit Alliance Corp. v Andersen &amp; Co., </em>65 NY2d 536]). The evidence must demonstrate \u201c(1) an awareness by the maker of the statement that it is to be used for a particular purpose; (2) reliance by a known party on the statement in furtherance of that purpose; and (3) some conduct by the maker of the statement linking it to the relying party and evincing its understanding of that reliance\u201d <em>(Prudential Ins. Co. v Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer &amp; Wood, supra, </em>80 NY2d, at 384 [citing <em>Credit Alliance Corp. v Andersen &amp; Co., </em>65 NY2d 536, 551, <em>supra]).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The only direct contact between Shearman &amp; Sterling and CalPERS prior to the closing of the Sersons loan is a letter Shearman &amp; Sterling sent to CalPERS asking for review and approval of the note by CalPERS and its counsel. Moreover, Shearman &amp; Sterling provided CalPERS with a black-lined copy of the standard form note, indicating the changes that it had made so that the note would conform to New York law and the borrower\u2019s demands. CalPERS cannot assert that it relied on Shearman &amp; Sterling\u2019s letter when it reserved the right of final approval of the loan documents for itself and its counsel, and failed to object. Thus, the complaint and the documentary evidence fail to establish that Shearman &amp; Sterling knew that CalPERS would and did rely on the note it prepared without reviewing it and that CalPERS\u2019 reliance was premised on conduct by Shearman &amp; Sterling evincing an understanding that CalPERS would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">We also reject CalPERS\u2019 argument that it was an intended third-party beneficiary of Shearman &amp; Sterling\u2019s contract to provide legal services to Equitable. A party asserting rights as a third-party beneficiary must establish \u201c(1) the existence of a valid and binding contract between other parties, (2) that the contract was intended for his benefit and (3) that the benefit to him is sufficiently immediate, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>incidental, to indicate the assumption by the contracting parties of a duty to compensate him if the benefit is lost\u201d <em>(Burns Jackson Miller Summit &amp; Spitzer v Lindner, 59 </em>NY2d 314, 336; <em>see also, Fourth Ocean Putnam Corp. v Interstate Wrecking Co., </em>66 NY2d 38, 44).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">There certainly was a valid and binding contract between Equitable and Shearman &amp; Sterling for the law firm\u2019s services in the Sersons loan transaction. However, contrary to CalPERS\u2019 assertion, Equitable did not retain Shearman &amp; Sterling for CalPERS\u2019 benefit. The Correspondent Agreement explicitly declares that the agents of Equitable act independently and are not agents for CalPERS. In addition, the agreement acknowledges that CalPERS\u2019 counsel (not Shearman &amp; Sterling) must approve all closing documents. Although the correspondent program was designed for the purpose of allowing CalPERS to invest in long-term commercial real estate loans obtained by Equitable, CalPERS and Equitable did not share at all times the same interests. Shearman &amp; Sterling was retained to assist Equitable as its counsel in meeting the requirements of the Correspondent Agreement without harming Equitable\u2019s interests under New York law. It had no corresponding duties to CalPERS, a party on the opposite side of the Correspondent Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Having determined that CalPERS has no direct causes of action against Shearman &amp; Sterling, we turn to its remaining claims as Equitable\u2019s assignee. CalPERS contends that the Omnibus Assignment was sufficient to transfer the entirety of Equitable\u2019s \u201cbundle of rights\u201d in the Sersons loan transaction, including the right to assert any claims Equitable had against Shearman &amp; Sterling for legal malpractice. CalPERS maintains that the use of the word \u201call\u201d in the Omnibus Agreement evinces an intention by Equitable to transfer <em>all claims, </em>including then-unknown but accrued claims against Shearman &amp; Sterling. CalPERS\u2019 reliance on the Omnibus Assignment\u2019s use of the word \u201call\u201d to include all of Equitable\u2019s claims against Shearman &amp; Sterling is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The Omnibus Assignment refers only to rights and interests under the loan documents (including the promissory note) between Equitable and Sersons and does not refer to the overall loan transaction <em>(compare with Banque Arabe et Internationale D'Investissement v Maryland Natl. Bank, </em>57 F3d 146, 152 [2d Cir]). The Omnibus Assignment transferred every right of action Equitable had against Sersons growing \u201cout of the receipt of the notes and the refusal to pay the share thereof\u2019 <em>(Allen v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Brown, </em>44 NY 228, 234). The assignment did not include a cause of action arising outside the loan documents themselves <em>(Fox v Hirschfeld, </em>157 App Div 364, 368 [1st Dept]).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The claim alleged here \u2014 that Shearman &amp; Sterling prepared a defective note by materially altering the prepayment and acceleration provisions of the standard form note and the terms of the commitment \u2014 does not arise from the note itself or from the loan documents. Rather, CalPERS\u2019 claim against Shearman &amp; Sterling is premised on the firm\u2019s failure to prepare loan documents for Equitable that complied with the terms of the Correspondent Agreement. Thus, while \u201call\u201d of Equitable\u2019s rights to and under the loan documents were assigned to CalPERS, \u201call\u201d in this case does not include the right to assert Equitable\u2019s claims, whatever they may be, against Shearman &amp; Sterling arising from the firm\u2019s failure to observe the specifications of the Correspondent Agreement <em>(see, Allen v Brown, </em>44 NY 228, 233, <em>supra </em>[\u201c(t)he transfer of a note or draft * * * carries with it a claim for money had and received, arising out of the transaction for which the note or draft was given\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">CalPERS\u2019 allegation that the Settlement Agreement operated as an assignment of malpractice claims against Shearman &amp; Sterling must fail as well. The Settlement Agreement\u2019s residual assignment provision specifically includes all of Equitable\u2019s claims against Shearman &amp; Sterling for negligence and breach of contract. Upon executing the Omnibus Assignment, CalPERS paid Equitable in full for the part it played in the negotiation and sale of the Sersons loan. There was no discount to Equitable in the value of the Sersons loan notwithstanding the alleged patent defect in the acceleration clause. Thus, when Sersons defaulted on the note, Equitable, having already assigned the note to CalPERS, no longer had any rights to, or under, the note. Equitable had been paid. The reduced acceleration fee caused no injury to Equitable and thus Equitable had no malpractice claim against Shearman &amp; Sterling to assign.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine and Ciparick concur; Judge Rosenblatt taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\"> CalPERS concedes that Equitable\u2019s settlement payment has nothing to do with this litigation. The sum was paid by Equitable in the interest of \u201cpreserving and advancing its relationship with [CalPERS]\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief, at 22, n 13).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
