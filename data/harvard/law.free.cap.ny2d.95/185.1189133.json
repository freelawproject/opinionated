Appellant is incorrect in asserting to this Court that insurance regulation 35-D in any way supports appellant\u2019s claim for underinsured motorist benefits under the Worcester policy. II. The policy language \u201cat issue\u201d does not \u201cinvolve\u201d an exclusion, but rather a lack of inclusion. <em>(Greater N. Y. Mut. Ins. Co. v Clark, </em>205 AD2d 857.) III. The insurance policy at issue never provided appellant underinsured motorist coverage for the vehicle involved in the accident. <em>(Schiff Assocs. v Flack, </em>51 NY2d 692; <em>Government Empls. Ins. Co. v Kligler, </em>42 NY2d 863.) IV. Case law dictates that when interpreting insurance policies, the coverage afforded is the net total of inclusions minus exclusions. (Sc<em>hiff Assocs. v Flack, </em>51 NY2d 692; <em>New York Univ. v Continental Ins. Co., </em>87 NY2d 308; <em>Crouse W. Holding Corp. v Sphere Drake Ins.

Co. v Sarno, </em>128 AD2d 870.) V. Failure to issue a timely disclaimer pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (d) will not create coverage where none existed. VI. The imposition of coverage where none exists may only be created by estoppel, which has not been raised or argued on this appeal, and is therefore waived. <em>(New York Univ. v Continental Ins. Co., </em>87 NY2d 308; <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co. v National Sur. Corp., </em>215 AD2d 456.) VII.

The other driver\u2019s insurance policy had a $10,000 limit, and Bettenhauser\u2019s policy did not include underinsurance coverage. Accordingly, on February 1, 1996, Bettenhauser, who lived with his parents at the time of the accident, filed an underinsurance claim pursuant to their policy with respondent Worcester Insurance Company. Over the next several months, Bettenhauser responded to Worcester\u2019s demands for discovery and for a medical examination. In December 1996, with Worcester\u2019s consent, Bettenhauser settled his negligence action against the other driver for the policy limit of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">After settlement negotiations on the underinsurance claim stalled, Bettenhauser served Worcester with a demand for arbitration, and the arbitration was set down for March 24, 1997. Worcester then commenced this special proceeding to permanently stay arbitration, urging for the first time that <em>\u201cno coverage </em>exists in respect to thomas bettenhauser\u2019s claim for underinsured motorist benefits in that [he] was operating his <em>own vehicle </em>at the time of the accident and was not operating a vehicle owned by the policyholder.\u201d Supreme Court granted the stay, concluding that the policy did not provide coverage \u201cfor family members driving an automobile not covered by [the] policy.\u201d A divided Appellate Division affirmed. Because Worcester failed to timely deny coverage, we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Analysis begins with the Worcester policy. The \u201cUnderinsured Motorists Coverage\u201d endorsement opens with the following \u201cInsuring Agreement:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">\u201cA. We will pay damages which an \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 because of \u2018bodily injury:\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">\u201c1. Sustained by an \u2018insured;\u2019 and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A45\">\u201c2. Caused by an accident. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">\u201cB. \u2018Insured\u2019 as used in this endorsement means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">\u201c1. You or any \u2018family member.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The policy defines \u201cfamily member\u201d as \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Following the \u201cInsuring Agreement\u201d paragraphs is a section labeled \u201cExclusions,\u201d which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201cA. <em>We </em>do not provide Underinsured Motorists Coverage for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201c1. While \u2018occupying,\u2019 or when struck by, any motor vehicle owned by you or any \u2018family member\u2019 which is not insured for this coverage under this policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Worcester urges that, read as a whole, the policy unambiguously indicated lack of coverage where, as here, a family member was involved in an accident while driving his own car that was not insured under the policy. Consequently, Worcester maintains that it had no duty whatever \u2014 whether to arbitrate or timely deny coverage \u2014 with respect to Bettenhauser\u2019s claim. Bettenhauser, on the other hand, argues that Worcester waived its right to invoke a policy exclusion by failing to timely deny coverage pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (d). We agree with Bettenhauser and disagree with Worcester.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (d), applicable only to claims for \u201cdeath or bodily injury,\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">\u201cIf under a liability policy delivered or issued for delivery in this state, an insurer shall disclaim liability or deny coverage for death or bodily injury arising out of a motor vehicle accident or any other type of accident occurring within this state, it shall give written notice as soon as is reasonably possible of such disclaimer of liability or denial of coverage to the insured and the injured person or any other claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Disclaimer pursuant to section 3420 (d) is unnecessary when a claim falls outside the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage portion. Under those circumstances, the insurance policy does not contemplate coverage in the first instance, and requiring payment of a claim upon failure to timely disclaim would create coverage where it never existed. By contrast, disclaimer pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>section 3420 (d) is necessary when denial of coverage is based on a policy exclusion without which the claim would be covered <em>(see, Zappone v Home Ins. Co., </em>55 NY2d 131, 134, 138 [construing former Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (8), now Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (d)]; <em>see also, Jerge v Buettner, </em>90 NY2d 950, 953; <em>Handelsman v Sea Ins. Co., </em>85 NY2d 96, 102, <em>rearg denied </em>85 NY2d 924). Failure to comply with section 3420 (d) precludes denial of coverage based on a policy exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">As the split at the Appellate Division evidences, drawing the line between a lack of coverage in the first instance (requiring no disclaimer) and a lack of coverage based on an exclusion (requiring timely disclaimer) has at times proved problematic. Both are situations where there is no coverage. <em>Zappone </em>and <em>Handelsman, </em>however, illustrate the distinction and demonstrate why, in the case before us, timely denial of coverage was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In <em>Zappone, </em>the policy\u2019s coverage clause at the outset conditioned recovery on liability \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of [a covered] or a <em>non-owned </em>automobile\u201d (emphasis supplied) <em>(see, Handelsman v Sea Ins. Co., supra, </em>85 NY2d, at 102). Because the automobile involved in the accident was owned by a family member and was not within the coverage clause, we concluded that there was never a contractual relationship between the carrier and the claimant giving rise to any duty, including the statutory duty to timely disclaim. We explicitly distinguished the situation where a claim would be covered but for a specific policy exclusion, explaining that \u201cthe carrier must deny coverage on the basis of the exclusion if it is not to mislead the insured and the injured person to their detriment\u201d <em>(Zappone v Home Ins. Co., supra, </em>55 NY2d, at 136).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In <em>Handelsman, </em>by contrast, the coverage portion of the insurance policy required payment for \u201cbodily injury or property damage for which any \u2018insured\u2019 becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident,\u201d and defined an \u201cinsured\u201d as a \u201c \u2018family member\u2019 for the ownership, maintenance or use of any auto\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 99-100). The policy also contained a \u201cspecific exclusion,\u201d stating that the coverage described elsewhere did not apply to the ownership or use of a vehicle \u201cowned by any \u2018family member\u2019 \u201d that was not a \u201ccovered auto\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 101).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In <em>Handelsman, </em>a son was involved in an accident while driving his mother\u2019s car. Both mother and son filed a claim under the father\u2019s insurance policy, which did not specifically list the vehicle involved in the accident as a \u201ccovered auto.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Because mother and son were \u201cinsureds\u201d who satisfied all the conditions of the relevant coverage provisions \u2014 which did not contain any limitation with reference to vehicles \u2014 we concluded that a relationship between the carrier and the claimants existed, requiring timely denial of coverage based on the policy exclusion. We further explained that the carrier\u2019s failure to timely disclaim was \u201cdispositive\u201d and precluded subsequent reliance on the exclusion to avoid its obligations <em>(see also, Jerge v Buettner, supra, </em>90 NY2d, at 952-953; <em>Sphere Drake Ins. Co. v Block 7206 Corp., </em>265 AD2d 78; <em>Government Empls. Ins. Co. v Kolodny, </em>269 AD2d 564).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">This case is no different from <em>Handelsman. </em>Timely disclaimer was necessary because Bettenhauser\u2019s claim falls squarely within the policy\u2019s coverage provisions set out in the \u201cInsuring Agreement.\u201d The relevant conditions of the Insuring Agreement \u2014 none of which depend on the vehicle driven \u2014 are met: Bettenhauser is defined as an \u201cinsured\u201d entitled to recover from an owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle for \u201cbodily injuries\u201d caused by an accident. Denial of coverage is predicated on one of the designated \u201cExclusions.\u201d But for a specified circumstance \u2014 here, the use of a family-owned motor vehicle not insured by the policy \u2014 Bettenhauser\u2019s claim would have been covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The situation presented is precisely the one Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (d) was intended to avoid. Section 3420 (d) was enacted to avoid prejudice to an injured claimant who could be harmed by delay in learning the insurer\u2019s position. Worcester waited more than a year to deny coverage, all the while subjecting Bettenhauser to discovery demands, and ultimately consenting to settlement of his action against the other driver. Having failed to comply with Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (d), Worcester cannot now rely on the policy exclusion to escape liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petition to stay arbitration dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\"> Worcester\u2019s reliance on <em>New York Univ. v Continental Ins. Co. </em>(87 NY2d 308, 323) and <em>Schiff Assocs. v Flack </em>(51 NY2d 692, 697-699) is misplaced. Neither case involved a claim for bodily injury implicating Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (d). Reliance on <em>Crouse W. Holding Corp. v Sphere Drake Ins. Co. </em>(92 NY2d 1017) is also unwarranted as we had no occasion in that case to review the Appellate Division\u2019s determination regarding the insurer\u2019s disclaimer (see, <em>Crouse </em>W. <em>Holding Corp. v Sphere Drake Ins. Co., </em>248 AD2d 932, <em>appeal dismissed, lv denied </em>92 NY2d 941).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
