The determination that claimants had reasonable assurance of employment in the fall semester is premised upon a manifest misunderstanding of the applicable Labor Law principles. <em>(National Labor Relations Bd. v Mackay Radio &amp; Tel.

The Board\u2019s determination that Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11) disqualifies claimants from receiving unemployment insurance benefits due to the reasonable assurance of their continued employment for the fall 1996 academic semester is supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Matter of Fisher [Levine], </em>36 NY2d 146; <em>Matter of Sierant [Catherwood </em>\u2014 General <em>Mills], </em>24 NY2d 675; <em>Matter of Field Delivery Serv.

Where there is no dispute over material facts, the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute and its legal conclusions from the undisputed facts are not entitled to the deference afforded credibility determinations or other findings of fact. <em>(Matter of Gruber [New York City Dept. of </em>Personnel\u2014 <em>Sweeney], </em>89 NY2d 225; <em>Matter of Halperin [New York City Bd. of Educ. </em>\u2014 Roberts], 102 AD2d 933.) II. Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11) should only be applied to educational institution employees whose unemployment is due to their employer\u2019s seasonal break period. <em>(Matter of Heitzenrater [Hooker Chem.

Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11) may not be applied to disqualify otherwise eligible claimants when their employer did not take reasonable steps to assure claimants or their union that claimants would not be replaced and that they would return to their jobs on August 18, 1996 or when the labor dispute ended. <em>(Matter of La Mountain [Westport Cent. School Dist. </em>\u2014 Ross], 51 NY2d 318; <em>National Labor Relations Bd. v Mackay Radio &amp; Tel. Co., </em>304 US 333; <em>New York Tel. Co. v New York State Dept. of Labor, </em>566 F2d 388.) IV. The New York Unemployment Insurance Law is a beneficial statute and must be liberally construed to pay benefits and avoid disqualification. <em>(New York Tel.

Assn. v United States, </em>333 F2d 157; <em>Steward Mach. Co. v Davis, </em>301 US 548.) V. Under unemployment insurance laws, the employer has the burden to prove that an otherwise eligible claimant is disqualified. Barnard did not prove that any claimant had reasonable assurance of being employed in the new term or when the strike ended and of not being replaced. <em>(Federal Trade Commn. v Morton Salt Co., </em>334 US 37.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b120-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b120-6\">ClPARICK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">This is an appeal by employees of Barnard College from an order of the Appellate Division which affirmed a determination of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board that denied them benefits. The employees had gone on strike against Barnard six weeks before the end of the spring semester in 1996. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>They claim that the Appeal Board, in denying them unemployment insurance benefits, improperly relied on Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11), which prohibits payment of benefits during an academic recess or holiday if the employee has a \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of employment for the following academic term. Petitioners contend that Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11) has no application here as they were not on academic recess, but on strike. In their view, only Labor Law \u00a7 592 applies, which suspends unemployment insurance benefits for a period of seven weeks in the event of a strike. We disagree with petitioners and conclude that under the circumstances presented Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11) and \u00a7 592 can be harmonized, and that section 592 does not preclude the application of section 590 (11).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Nevertheless, we conclude that it was error for the Appeal Board and the Appellate Division to rely on the parties\u2019 expired collective bargaining agreement through the operation of the <em>\u201cTriborough </em>Doctrine.\u201d They used this public employee doctrine to support the conclusion that each claimant had a \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of fall semester employment. Since this constitutes an error of law in arriving at the decision, we remit for consideration of the \u201creasonable assurance\u201d question, free of reliance on the expired collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Petitioners were employed by Barnard College during the 1995/1996 academic year in various nonprofessional capacities, including desk attendant positions. All petitioners were members of Technical Office and Professional Union Local 2110, UAW, AFL-CIO (Union). The parties operated under a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which prohibited Barnard from terminating petitioners without good cause. The CBA expired on December 31, 1995. According to the CBA, petitioners were designated as hourly wage, permanent employees of Barnard. Some had been employed by the college for over 10 years. Barnard worked on a traditional two-semester system, fall and spring, and although the school had a summer session, petitioners were not required to work during the summer. In past years, Barnard inquired as to who among the desk attendants would be interested in working during the summer and also typically sent letters to those in desk attendant positions informing them of when they were expected to report to work in the fall. Barnard did not send such letters to the non-desk attendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">During 1996, the Union and Barnard attempted to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. Failing to reach agreement, however, petitioners struck on February 22, but returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>to work on March 5. On March 15, Barnard sent a letter to all desk attendants, inquiring as to who would be interested in working during the summer session and that such assignments would be made based on seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">With no new agreement, petitioners again struck on April 10, six weeks before the end of the spring semester. The strike lasted until September 13, approximately one month into the fall semester. During the strike, Barnard did not send letters to the desk attendants regarding work during the fall semester. Barnard was under the impression that communicating directly with the striking employees would have violated the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In late May and early June 1996, petitioners filed for unemployment insurance benefits. Labor Law \u00a7 592 provides that for unemployment due to an industrial controversy, including a strike, \u201cbenefit rights * * * shall be suspended during a period of seven consecutive weeks beginning with the day after\u201d the employee lost employment due to the strike (Labor Law \u00a7 592 [1]). The local unemployment insurance office determined that benefits were appropriate. Barnard, however, objected and requested a hearing on the ground that Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11) precluded benefits. Section 590 (11) prohibits payment of benefits to nonprofessional employees of educational institutions for \u201cany week commencing during the period between two successive academic years or terms provided there is a <em>reasonable assurance </em>that the claimant will perform services in such capacity for any such institution or institutions for both of such academic years or terms\u201d (emphasis added). As relevant to petitioners, the benefit calculation rules that apply where there is \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of employment for the following semester require that the wages during the past academic year \u2014 on which unemployment insurance benefits are based \u2014 must be disregarded. In other words, no unemployment insurance benefits can be distributed to a claimant, still employed, but on summer break.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) overruled Barnard\u2019s objections and held that for all petitioners \u201cthere must be an affirmative expression of intent to rehire made to the claimants in order to establish the [reasonable] assurance.\u201d In the ALJ\u2019s view, although an actual letter was not required, the evidence and testimony failed to establish that such an affirmative expression had been communicated to the petitioners to support a finding of \u201creasonable assurances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board disagreed and reversed the ALJ\u2019s determination. Based on the record before the ALJ, it concluded that each claimant had a \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of employment for the fall semester because (1) claimants were considered permanent and not temporary employees; (2) as a matter of past practice, claimants historically had \u201ca right to return to work at the start of the Fall semester\u201d; (3) the terms of the expired CBA continued in effect by virtue of the <em>\u201cTriborough </em>Doctrine\u201d (see, <em>Matter of La Mountain [Westport Cent. School Dist. </em>\u2014 Ross], 51 NY2d 318), thus supporting their right to return to work for the fall semester; and (4) during the strike, although Barnard had the right under Federal law to hire replacement workers, it took no steps to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">On petitioners\u2019 appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed. It noted that the issue \u201cdistil [led] to whether claimants received \u2018reasonable assurance\u2019 of employment\u201d (259 AD2d 907, 908), and concluded that past practices as well as the expired CBA which remained in effect until a new one was negotiated, gave claimants the requisite \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of fall semester employment. We granted petitioners leave to appeal and reverse because of the error of law in applying the <em>\u201cTriborough </em>Doctrine\u201d to this private sector labor-management dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Petitioners primarily contend that Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11) and \u00a7 592 cannot be reconciled, and that only section 592 applies here. We disagree. It is true that the two statutory provisions address different situations, with section 590 (11) guarding against the distribution of unemployment insurance benefits merely because employment was interrupted by an academic recess and with section 592 maintaining the \u201cprinciple of governmental neutrality\u201d in the face of an industrial controversy by suspending benefits for seven weeks if the claimant-worker is unemployed due to a strike <em>(Matter of Heitzenrater [Hooker Chem. Co. </em>\u2014 Catherwood], 19 NY2d 1, 7 [citations omitted]). This case, however, gives us both situations, and nothing in the statutes themselves, the unemployment insurance legislative scheme, or the legislative history of these statutes suggests that one is to have primacy over the other. Expressed another way, \u201c[i]t is not the function of the court * * * to declare one statute the victor over another if the statutes may be read together, without misdirecting the one, or breaking the spirit of the other\u201d <em>(Matter of Foley v Bratton, </em>92 NY2d 781, 787; <em>see, Morris Plan Indus. Bank v Gunning, </em>295 NY 324, 330-331; <em>Matthews v Matthews, </em>240 NY 28, 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The tension between these two statutes may benefit from legislative refinement, but nothing prevents section 590 (11) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>and. section 592 from operating together. There is no undermining of section 592\u2019s statutory purpose in allowing section 590 (ll)\u2019s disqualification of benefits to operate during a break between semesters. Indeed, if section 592 alone were to apply, it would neutralize section 590 (11) during industrial controversies that straddle a summer recess such as was present here. Without good reason however, we cannot interpret one statute to nullify another when both are part of the same statutory scheme. Here, although the strike lasted through the entire summer, it began less than seven weeks \u2014 the section 592 (1) threshold \u2014 before the summer recess. Once the summer recess began, the requirements of section 590 (11) took effect, along with the \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of employment provision for the following academic semester.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Thus, the question in this case boils down to whether there were \u201creasonable assurances\u201d under Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11) that petitioners could return to their employment after the summer recess. In deciding this issue, however, both the Appeal Board and the Appellate Division erred by relying on the <em>\u201cTriborough </em>Doctrine\u201d to support their determinations. As limited by <em>Matter of Board of Coop. Educ. Servs. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd. </em>(41 NY2d 753), the <em>\u201cTriborough </em>Doctrine\u201d seeks to preserve the status quo in situations where a collective bargaining agreement between a public employer and its employees has expired and a new one has yet to be agreed upon. In certain instances, the terms and conditions of the expired CBA continue in effect until a new agreement is negotiated <em>(Matter of La Mountain [Westport Cent. School Dist. </em>\u2014 Ross], <em>51 NY2d 318, 330, supra', but see, Burns Jackson Miller Summit &amp; Spitzer v Lindner, </em>59 NY2d 314, 336).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Notably, the <em>\u201cTriborough </em>Doctrine\u201d has never been applied in the private employment context because the doctrine is grounded in the limitations imposed on public employee organizations by the Civil Service Law <em>(Matter of Triborough Bridge &amp; Tunnel Auth. [District Council 37], 5 </em>PERB 3064; <em>see, </em>Civil Service Law \u00a7\u00a7 209, 210). Moreover, both parties now agree that in this case, the doctrine cannot supercede an employer\u2019s rights under Federal law to replace temporarily or permanently a striking worker <em>(see, National Labor Relations Bd. v Mackay Radio &amp; Tel. Co., </em>304 US 333, 345-346). Thus, any reliance by the Appeal Board on the <em>\u201cTriborough </em>Doctrine\u201d to find that employees rights under the expired contract constituted reasonable assurance was misplaced. Our review is limited to the legal question of whether the Appeal Board\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>cisi\u00f3n regarding \u201creasonable assurances\u201d was supported by substantial evidence <em>(Matter of Di Maria v Ross, </em>52 NY2d 771, 772; <em>Matter of Fisher [Levine], </em>36 NY2d 146, 150; <em>Matter of Sierant [Catherwood </em>\u2014 General <em>Mills], </em>24 NY2d 675, 679). Because an error of law was made in the application of the <em>\u201cTriborough </em>Doctrine,\u201d we remit for a plenary consideration of the \u201creasonable assurance\u201d question, free of reliance on the expired collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Further, we likewise reject petitioners\u2019 remaining contention that under Labor Law \u00a7 590 (11) (d) the denial of unemployment insurance benefits was improper because the strike lasted several weeks into the fall semester. Section 590 (11) (d) provides that \u201ca claimant who was not offered an opportunity to perform services for the educational institution for the second of such academic years or terms shall be entitled to be paid benefits retroactively\u201d (Labor Law \u00a7 590 [11] [d]). Here, it is undisputed that once the strike settled, petitioners returned to work for the fall semester, and under these circumstances, petitioners cannot claim the benefit of this statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and the matter remitted to that Court with directions to remand to the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur; Chief Judge Kaye taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
