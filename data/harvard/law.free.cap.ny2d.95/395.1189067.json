After an acquaintance allegedly stole the car and totaled it, the rental company sued Walters for the damage. General Business Law \u00a7 396-z <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>prohibits a rental company from holding an \u201cauthorized driver\u201d liable for damage to the rental car in excess of $100. The question before us is whether that limitation applies when someone other than the \u201cauthorized driver\u201d was operating the car when damaged. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Listing himself as the only \u201cauthorized driver,\u201d Walters rented a car from plaintiff Americar Rental System. Several nights later, after parking the car in his driveway, Walters went to bed. While he was sleeping, Ron Bacon \u2014 Walters\u2019 houseguest \u2014 took the keys and made off with the car. The next morning, Walters discovered the car missing and reported it stolen to both the Baldwinsville Police and Americar. Three days later, the Niagara County Sheriff\u2019s Department found the car irreparably damaged and abandoned in a field. The Sheriff\u2019s Department located Bacon and, after he confessed, arrested him for Criminal Possession of Stolen Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Americar sued Walters and Bacon to recover the full value of the rental car plus towing expenses. Americar asserts that Walters breached the express terms of the Rental Agreement by allowing an unauthorized driver \u2014 Bacon\u2014to operate the car. Paragraph four of the Agreement provides that the authorized driver \u201cmay not engage in any willful and wanton misconduct, which among other things, may include reckless conduct such as: * * * permit [ting] the use of the car by anyone other than an authorized driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Walters moved for summary judgment pursuant to CPLR 3212 arguing that General Business Law \u00a7 396-z nullifies paragraph 4 of the Agreement by insulating him from liability in excess of $100. Americar cross-moved for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim. Supreme Court granted Walters\u2019 motion and denied Americar\u2019s. The Appellate Division affirmed, with two Justices dissenting. Americar appeals to this Court as of right <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5601 [a]). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">General Business Law \u00a7 396-z (2) states as a general rule that <em>\u201c[n]o rental vehicle company </em>renting private passenger motor vehicles <em>shall </em>* * * <em>hold an authorized driver liable for actual damage to, or loss of, such rental </em>vehicle\u201d (emphasis added). It then carves out six exceptions to this rule <em>(see, </em>General Business Law \u00a7 396-z [2] [a] \u2014 [f]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Concededly, none of them applies. Notwithstanding the general rule, section 396-z (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>does allow a rental company to recover up to $100 for \u201cactual damage to, or loss of, a rental vehicle caused by such authorized driver\u201d (General Business Law \u00a7 396-z [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Walters claims he is an \u201cauthorized driver\u201d and, as such, Americar cannot hold him liable for more than $100. The definition of an \u201cauthorized driver\u201d includes a \u201cperson to whom the vehicle is rented if a licensed driver\u201d (General Business Law \u00a7 396-z [1] [a] [i]). Clearly, Walters \u2014 a licensed driver \u201cto whom the vehicle [was] rented\u201d \u2014 is an authorized driver under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Americar asserts that even though Walters is an \u201cauthorized driver\u201d the $100 liability cap does not apply when someone other than an authorized driver \u2014 i.e., someone like Bacon\u2014 was driving the rental car when it was damaged. Americar argues that the word \u201cdriver\u201d would lose its import if the statute protected \u201cauthorized <em>drivers\u201d </em>who were not driving the rental car <em>at the time of damage. </em>Moreover, Americar argues that public policy prohibits interpreting section 396-z so as to place the risk of loss or damage entirely on rental car companies even when renters lend cars to unauthorized or unlicensed drivers, who in turn, damage the cars. These arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">When a statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, we must construe it so as to give effect to the plain meaning of its words <em>(Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669, 674-675). Here, the statutory language leaves no room for Americar\u2019s interpretation. Under section 396-z (1) (a), Walters was an \u201cauthorized driver.\u201d Americar, therefore, cannot hold him \u201cliable for actual damage to, or loss of\u2019 the rental car unless one of the exceptions applies (General Business Law \u00a7 396-z [2]). As Americar concedes, none does.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The legislative history of section 396-z is entirely in keeping with its plain wording. Nothing in the legislative history sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>gests that the Legislature intended to impose the added requirement that an \u201cauthorized driver\u201d be driving the rental car at the time of damage. Rather, the Legislature enacted the statute to protect rental car consumers in general. It did not contemplate that the consumer, to invoke the statutory protection, had to be driving the car at the time of damage (see, Mem of Senator Bruno, Bill Jacket, L 1988, ch 784 [\u201c(R)ental car <em>consumers </em>will be liable for the costs of repair to rental vehicles only under certain enumerated circumstances.\u201d]; Mem of Attorney General, Bill Jacket, L 1988, ch 784 [\u201cThis bill would * * * cap the <em>consumer\u2019s </em>liability for damage to a rented car at $100.\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The year after section 396-z was enacted, the rental industry complained about its increased exposure to liability (Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1989, ch 66). In response, the Legislature, among other things, narrowed the definition of \u201cauthorized driver\u201d (L 1989, ch 66, \u00a7 3); created a new exception enabling the rental company to hold an authorized driver liable for failing to obtain an accident report after an accident (L 1989, ch 66, \u00a7 4); and required authorized drivers to report a theft of a rental car to police or the rental company within 48 hours of learning of the theft (L 1989, ch 66, \u00a7 7). These amendments fortify our conclusion. Even the second time around, no one, including the rental car industry, advanced the prospect of holding an \u201cauthorized driver\u201d liable for damage occurring while an unauthorized driver operated the rental car.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Invoking public policy, Americar argues that under Walters\u2019 interpretation, a consumer could rent a car, lend it to an unauthorized driver and still benefit from the $100 cap. It is for the Legislature, however, to determine that this concern outweighs competing considerations designed to protect consumers and allocate losses in connection with car rentals. The Legislature could have written in a seventh exception enabling rental companies to recover fully against authorized drivers for damages occurring while unauthorized drivers were behind the wheel. Illinois did.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> New York did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\">. The six exceptions, i.e., instances in which the rental company <em>can </em>hold an authorized driver liable, are: \u201cwhere: (a) the damage or loss is caused intentionally by an authorized driver or is caused by such authorized driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>willful and wanton misconduct; (b) the damage or loss arises out of an authorized driver\u2019s operation of the motor vehicle while intoxicated by alcohol or impaired by the use of drugs within the meaning of [Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192]; (c) the damage or loss arises out of an authorized driver\u2019s participation in any organized speed racing competition; (d) the damage or loss arises out of the use of the vehicle when carrying persons or property for hire; (e) the damage or loss arises out of the use of the vehicle while an authorized driver is committing a felony or otherwise engaged in a criminal act in which the damage or loss of such vehicle is caused by such criminal activity; or (f) the authorized driver fails to furnish the rental vehicle company a report of an accident and the rental vehicle company complies with [a specified] procedure\u201d (General Business Law \u00a7 396-z [2]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\">. The former Illinois statute, similar to the current New York statute, prohibited rental companies from holding renters liable for damage to rental cars in excess of $200 (see, 625 Ill Comp Stat \u00a7 5/6-305 [d] [repealed 1997]). Unlike the New York statute, however, Illinois\u2019 liability cap did not apply if the \u201cdamage occurs while the vehicle is operated by a person other than an authorized driver\u201d (625 Ill Comp Stat \u00a7 5/6-305 [d] [7]). Illinois has since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>amended its statute by deleting the $200 liability cap altogether (1997 Ill Pub Act 90-113).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
