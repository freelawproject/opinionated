The duty to register was based on defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction in Supreme Court in May 1995 upon his plea of guilty to charges of sodomy in the second degree and sexual abuse in the first degree. These charges arose out of defendant\u2019s sexual contact with two underage victims. Having served his concurrent 90-day jail sentences for these crimes, defendant had yet to complete his five-year term of probation when SORA went into effect on January 21, 1996. As a result, defendant was required to register as a sex offender (Correction Law \u00a7\u00a7 168-a, 168-g). His probation officer sent defendant a letter informing him of this obligation along with a \u201cSex Offender Registration Form,\u201d a \u201cRisk Assessment Instrument\u201d and a \u201cNotice of Risk Level Assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">These documents notified defendant that he had been assigned a risk level determination of \u201c3,\u201d indicating that he represented the highest risk under SORA and was a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d (Correction Law \u00a7 168-Z [6] [c]). A level three designation permits a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction to distribute \u201cthe sex offender\u2019s name, exact address, a photograph of the offender, background information including the offender\u2019s crime of conviction, modus of operation, type of victim\u201d and any other conditions imposed on the offender to \u201cvulnerable populations\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Those receiving this information are at liberty to further disseminate this information \u201cat their discretion\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Risk level three designees also are subject to registration requirements for a minimum of 10 years and must verify their address and registration information every 90 days with local law enforcement (Correction Law \u00a7 168-d [3]; \u00a7 168-f [3]; \u00a7 168-h), while those at risk level one or two must register annually for 10 years (Correction Law \u00a7 168-f [2]; \u00a7 168-h).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">On advice of counsel, defendant refused to sign and return the sex offender registration notice classifying him at risk level three. At no time before the risk level determination did defendant receive notice that a determination was being made, he was not notified of the information relied upon to make the determination, nor did he receive a hearing or any opportunity to be heard. Instead, the initial determination was made by an employee of the Division of Probation and Correctional Alternatives (DPCA) pursuant to Correction Law \u00a7 168-g. In this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the determination was made by an employee of the Suffolk County Probation Department, who had received one day of training in the guidelines established by the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders. The Board\u2019s Risk Assessment Guidelines provide an explanation of the various characteristics to be examined by those filling out the \u201cRisk Assessment Instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The \u201cRisk Assessment Instrument\u201d is a chart divided into four risk factors: current offense(s); criminal history; post-offense behavior; and release environment <em>(see, </em>Correction Law \u00a7 168-/). Within each of these factors, there are several specific issues that a probation officer must analyze, and depending on whether defendant or his conduct exhibits certain characteristics, points are assigned. When totaled, the points for all risk factors determine an individual\u2019s presumptive SORA risk level, except that there are certain \u201coverrides\u201d not relied on by the Probation Department here, which will result in the offender being classified as a risk level three. According to the DPCA, the presumptive SORA risk level is reviewed by another employee of DPCA or, as here, by one member of the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders before the final risk level determination is sent to the probationer.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Defendant received 125 points, which placed him above the 110 point threshold for a sexually violent predator, and thus was determined to be a risk level three. Although no statute or regulation provides for it, the Notice of Risk Level Assessment offered defendant the opportunity to seek review of the determination with DPCA. Defendant took advantage of this review, and challenged his risk level classification and DPCA\u2019s characterization of the offenses. Specifically, he disputed the points assigned regarding \u201cthe allegation of forcible compulsion [10], the relationship with the victim [20] and the acceptance of responsibility [10].\u201d Without explicitly addressing these objections or identifying the information upon which the challenged factors were analyzed, the DPCA sent a letter to defendant stating that the level three determination had been correctly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Upon refusal to sign the form classifying him as a sexually violent predator, defendant was charged with failure to register under Correction Law \u00a7\u00a7 168-g and 168-t. Defendant moved to dismiss the information charging him with failure to register on the grounds that SORA violated the ex post facto, equal protection and due process guarantees of the United States and New York Constitutions. The Justice Court rejected these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>challenges, and after the trial, sentenced defendant to a term of one year of imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellate Term affirmed and rejected defendant\u2019s ex post facto and equal protection challenges. Regarding defendant\u2019s due process claims, the Appellate Term held that SORA\u2019s provision allowing a sex offender to petition the sentencing court for relief from the further duty to register (Correction Law \u00a7 168-g [4]; \u00a7 168-o) and the availability of an article 78 proceeding to review DPCA\u2019s determination \u201ceffectively minimized the risk of an erroneous deprivation of defendant\u2019s private interest.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQA\">A Judge of this Court having granted defendant leave to appeal, defendant presses only his claims of due process and equal protection violations. Concluding that defendant was not afforded the process he was due in determining his SORA risk level, we reverse and reach no other issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The commonsense principle at the heart of the due process guarantees in the United States and New York Constitutions is that when the State seeks to take life, liberty or property from an individual, the State must provide effective procedures that guard against an erroneous deprivation (US Const, Amend XIV, \u00a7 1; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6; <em>Mathews v Eldridge, </em>424 US 319, 334-335; <em>Wisconsin v Constantineau, </em>400 US 433, 436 [\u201c(I)t is procedure that marks much of the difference between rule by law and rule by fiat\u201d]). Due process, however, is a flexible concept that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">\u201cgenerally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>requirement would entail.\u201d <em>(Mathews v Eldridge, supra, </em>at 335.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Here, the procedures that the State has employed are inadequate to mitigate the risk of an erroneous determination that a sex offender on probation is a sexually violent predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Defendant\u2019s private interest, his liberty interest in not being stigmatized as a sexually violent predator, is substantial <em>(see, E.B. v Verniero, </em>119 F3d 1077, 1107 [3d Cir]; <em>Doe v Pataki, </em>3 F Supp 2d 456, 469 [SD NY]). The ramifications of being classified and having that information disseminated fall squarely within those cases that recognize a liberty interest where there is some stigma to one\u2019s good name, reputation or integrity, coupled with some more \u201ctangible\u201d interest that is affected or a legal right that is altered <em>(Matter of Lee TT. v Dowling, </em>87 NY2d 699, 708 [placing petitioners\u2019 names on Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment foreclosed future child care employment and satisfied \u201cstigma plus\u201d test]; <em>see, Paul v Davis, </em>424 US 693; <em>Wisconsin v Constantineau, supra, </em>at 437; <em>Valmonte v Bane, </em>18 F3d 992). More than \u201cname calling by public officials,\u201d the sexually violent predator label \u201cis a determination of status\u201d that can have a considerable adverse impact on an individual\u2019s ability to live in a community and obtain or maintain employment <em>(see, Paul v Davis, supra, </em>at 703 [internal quotations omitted]). A level three classification imposes significant burdens. Not only is one identified as a \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d but also this information along with the individual\u2019s name and \u201cexact\u201d address can be widely disseminated to and by any \u201centity with vulnerable populations related to the nature of the offense committed by such sex offender\u201d (Correction Law \u00a7 168-Z [6] [c]). Additionally, a level three sex offender must by photograph, description and exact address, along with other identifying information, appear in a \u201csexually violent predator subdirectory,\u201d which is annually \u201cdistributed to the offices of local village, town, city, county or state law enforcement agencies for purposes of public access,\u201d and is updated monthly (Correction Law \u00a7 168-q [1]; <em>see, </em>L 1999, ch 453, \u00a7 19). This information also appears in a telephone database accessible by a \u201c900\u201d telephone number (Correction Law \u00a7 168-p). Moreover, SORA places affirmative obligations on all sex offenders to register annually with local law enforcement and to promptly advise of changes in address (Correction Law \u00a7\u00a7 168-f, 168-j, 168-k). Those classified at risk level three must also register every 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">This Court has held that the mere likelihood of dissemination to prospective employers of allegations of rape and abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>in a fired public employee\u2019s personnel file sufficiently impaired that employee\u2019s liberty interest to warrant due process protections <em>(Matter of Swinton v Safir, </em>93 NY2d 758, 764). Given the significantly greater effect of a risk level three determination, we are persuaded that it implicated defendant\u2019s liberty interest and triggered due process safeguards <em>(see, Board of Regents of State Colls, v Roth, </em>408 US 564, 570-571).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">ra</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Under the second prong of the <em>Mathews </em>analysis, the procedures in place for this probationer-defendant, however, do not sufficiently prevent \u201cthe risk of an erroneous deprivation of [defendant\u2019s] interest\u201d <em>(Mathews v Eldridge, supra, </em>424 US, at 335). The bedrock of due process is notice and opportunity to be heard <em>(id., </em>at 333; <em>see, Goldberg v Kelly, </em>397 US 254, 265-268; <em>Mullane v Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 US 306, 314; <em>Matter of LaCorte Elec. Constr. &amp; Maintenance v County of Rensselaer, </em>80 NY2d 232, 237). Yet defendant was afforded no meaningful opportunity to contest his initial risk level determination. Defendant did not receive notice that his risk level was being determined, was not informed of what materials would be relied upon in making that determination and was not afforded an opportunity to present his objections to the State\u2019s characterization of his behavior and history before the key decision was unilaterally made.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The process afforded offenders, like defendant, who were serving a sentence of probation when SORA took effect, stands in stark contrast to that provided sex offenders still in custody. For offenders still in custody, the sentencing court makes the risk level determination after receiving a recommendation from the Board (Correction Law \u00a7 168-n [1], [2]). In making the determination, the court must consider the victim\u2019s statement, allow the offender to appear and be heard and, if necessary, inform the sex offender of the right to have counsel appointed (Correction Law \u00a7 168-n [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The Legislature attempted to provide streamlined procedures in determining SORA risk levels for those already on probation because the danger of a repeat sex offense is most acute with those who have been released to the community. In providing a quicker method of determining risk level for probationers, the Legislature was attempting to fulfill expeditiously SORA\u2019s purpose of aiding law enforcement in investigating sex offenses and notifying vulnerable populations of a possible threat. However, in this case, the efficiency of streamlined classifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>tion procedures for probationers runs into constitutional due process impediments <em>(see, Goss v Lopez, </em>419 US 565, 580). Under the third prong of the <em>Mathews </em>analysis, the fiscal and administrative burdens imposed by requiring notice and opportunity to be heard are not prohibitive and are not so significant as to warrant limiting defendant to the procedures the Legislature provided <em>(Fuentes v Shevin, </em>407 US 67, 90, n 22; <em>see, Goldberg v Kelly, supra, </em>at 261). The need for expediency cannot overshadow the fact that a critical decision was being made about defendant that determined his potential to commit further sex offenses, the extent to which he would have to register, and the extent to which his personal information and propensity for committing sex offenses could be distributed to his community <em>(see, Doe v Poritz, </em>142 NJ 1, 105-108, 662 A2d 367, 420-421). Indeed, the Legislature, recognizing the significance of the risk level decision, provided a panoply of procedures to those still serving their prison sentences <em>(see, </em>Correction Law \u00a7\u00a7 168-l, 168-n).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The review procedures provided to defendant here do not bridge the due process gap. DPCA\u2019s internal review of the risk level determination is inadequate. Significantly, no statute, regulation or guideline provides for it, and presumably the risk level review process is subject to instant change or abandonment. As demonstrated by the facts of this case, the review process did not provide defendant with any meaningful way to voice his objections since defendant was not provided a hearing or any opportunity to present evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Even if defendant could also seek judicial review of DPCA\u2019s determination in a CPLR article 78 proceeding \u2014 this Court has not addressed the availability of such review, and we do not decide that issue today<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 that review would not be meaningful since the basis for DPCA\u2019s initial assessment of a sex offender, at least with regard to some categories on the risk assessment instrument, remains unilateral. The deferential standard of review accorded administrative determinations in article 78 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>proceedings presupposes administrative procedures that conform with due process requirements <em>(see, Lutheran Church v City of New York, </em>35 NY2d 121; <em>Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222; <em>Matter of Sullivan County Harness Racing Assn. v Glasser, </em>30 NY2d 269). Here, not only were DPCA\u2019s conclusions untested, but there is no record to permit adequate judicial review, nor was defendant given any reasonable opportunity to create one.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Furthermore, the right to petition the sentencing court to be \u201crelieved of any <em>further </em>duty to register\u201d under Correction Law \u00a7 168-o (1) (emphasis added) does not permit the court to review the correctness of the <em>initial </em>risk level determination <em>(see, </em>Correction Law \u00a7 168-g [4]). In using the words \u201crelieved\u201d and \u201cfurther\u201d the Legislature indicated that this section was to be used after the SORA risk level determination had been in place along with all the adverse consequences of that risk level imposed on the sex offender. The ability to make <em>future </em>modifications to the duty to register differs from the procedures that go into making the original risk level determination. Correction Law \u00a7 168-o fails to guard against an erroneous original risk level classification because it does not provide a vehicle for reviewing whether defendant\u2019s circumstances were properly analyzed in the first instance to arrive at his risk level. The right to petition the sentencing court is not a substitute for an initial due process hearing because the defendant bears the burden of proving by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that his risk level should be modified (Correction Law \u00a7 168-o [2]). Due process requires that the State bear the burden of proving, at some meaningful time, that a defendant deserves the classification assigned. Here, the State did not bear the burden of proof at any proceeding before a neutral fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Defendant may or may not deserve a risk level three classification, but without any notice and an opportunity to be heard before a determination is made, the risk level determination made below failed to comport with minimum State and Federal constitutional requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Term should be reversed and defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the information granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\">. By virtue of bis conviction for failure to register under SORA, defendant was also held to have violated his probation and was sentenced in Supreme Court to one year of imprisonment to run concurrently with the sentence imposed in Justice Court. Issues regarding the violation of probation are not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">. Defendant, after conviction, petitioned the sentencing court for relief from the farther duty to register under Correction Law \u00a7 168-0, but the court denied this petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">. We note that a recent amendment to SORA gives sex offenders the right to appeal their risk level determinations pursuant to CPLR articles 55, 56, and 57, but neither party contends that this provision could apply to defendant (L 1999, ch 453, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 29; <em>see also, People v Kearns, </em>95 NY2d 816 [decided today] [holding as a matter of statutory law that the risk level determination is not appealable in the direct appeal from a criminal conviction]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
