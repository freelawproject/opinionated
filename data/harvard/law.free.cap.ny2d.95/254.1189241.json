All defendants challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence as to fraudulent intent \u2014 a necessary element in all of the crimes charged. Because this contention lacks merit, we affirm the order of the Appellate Division. Another aspect of this appeal requires us to consider our power to address an issue raised by two of the defendants: whether a conviction for grand larceny by false pretenses (Penal Law \u00a7 155.05 [2] [a]) may be based merely upon the concealment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>omission of material facts. For reasons that follow, we are unable to reach this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Defendants Roger V. Sala, John Donovan and Roger C. Sala were each indicted on one count of scheme to defraud in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 190.65 [1]). Roger V. and Donovan were also indicted on 16 counts of grand larceny (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 155.30, 155.35) and 16 counts of securities fraud (General Business Law \u00a7 352-c [6]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants were tried jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">While the indictment did not specify the theory on which the grand larceny counts rested, the People, in their bill of particulars and at trial, proceeded on the basis of a larceny by false pretenses. At the close of the People\u2019s case, Roger C. moved for a trial order of dismissal based on insufficiency of the evidence, upon which the court reserved decision. Defendants Roger V. and Donovan made similar motions. They identified specific alleged insufficiencies but did not assert \u2014 as they do now \u2014 that false pretenses larceny must rest on affirmative false statements and that omissions or concealments alone are insufficient. Supreme Court denied their motions and the case proceeded against all three as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Instructing the jury as to the \u201cfalse statement\u201d element of false pretenses larceny, the trial court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">\u201c[a] misstatement or representation is false, obviously, when it is untrue. Whether a statement or representation is false depends upon the facts as they existed at the time the statement or representation was made and not the facts as they may appear now with the benefit of hindsight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The court, however, went on to state that \u201c[a] representation or statement may be false when it constitutes a half truth or <em>effectively conceals or omits a material fact.\u201d </em>Sala and Donovan did not object to this formulation. The jury found all three defendants guilty on all counts. Prior to sentencing, the trial court dismissed the case against Roger C. The court then granted \u201creargument\u201d on Roger V. and Donovan\u2019s dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>motions and, on its own initiative, dismissed 10 of the 16 larceny counts against each of them. It ruled that larceny by false pretenses requires affirmative, overt misrepresentations, and that the proof revealed only defendants\u2019 \u201comissions with .respect to disclosure of fees and commissions and other matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The People appealed; Roger V. and Donovan cross-appealed. The Appellate Division modified by reversing so much of Supreme Court\u2019s order as granted the motions by all defendants for trial orders of dismissal, and affirmed the judgments of conviction against Roger V. and Donovan. A Judge of this Court granted defendants leave to appeal. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">At trial, the prosecution presented proof that defendants disguised First Meridian as an objective financial planning institution that employed expert advisers who developed individualized investment strategies for its investors. There was evidence that, in reality, defendants used First Meridian to channel investors\u2019 assets into the same three risky investment vehicles, while misrepresenting the risks involved and concealing the fact that the company earned substantial commissions on the investments. Indeed, the proof revealed that 85% of First Meridian\u2019s annual revenue was derived from these undisclosed commissions. Investors had no idea of this; defendants went to some length to keep them in the dark. We agree with the Appellate Division that the evidence at trial was legally sufficient to demonstrate defendants\u2019 fraudulent intent in relation to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\"> In addition, Roger V. and Donovan argue that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions on the larceny counts dismissed by the trial court, because an omission of material fact does not constitute a \u201cfalse statement\u201d for purposes of larceny by false pretenses. That argument, however, is not properly before this Court. The trial court instructed the jury that the definition of a \u201cfalse statement\u201d included both affirmative misrepresentations and any representation that \u201ceffectively conceals or omits a material fact.\u201d Defendants did not object to this construction. Given the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, our review is limited to whether there was legally sufficient evidence as to false statements based on <em>the court\u2019s charge as given without exception (see, People v Dekle, </em>56 NY2d 835, 836; <em>see also, People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10, 24). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>There was; and we must therefore affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the Appellate Division went further and addressed the question whether a false pretenses larceny conviction could ever rest merely on material omissions or concealments, our affirmance does not reach this issue and we express no opinion on the point. The evidence was legally sufficient under the unchallenged charge and provided a proper basis for the jury\u2019s verdict <em>(People v Williams, </em>84 NY2d 925, 926; <em>People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620, 621).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In each case: Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\">. Before trial, the motion court dismissed the scheme to defraud count as duplicitous. Upon the People\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division reinstated it (see, 201 AD2d 145). We affirmed, holding that the count was not invalid for duplicity, and that the evidence before the Grand Jury supported the existence of a unitary scheme to defraud (see, 86 NY2d 608). That appeal also dealt with dismissals of various counts that are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">.
