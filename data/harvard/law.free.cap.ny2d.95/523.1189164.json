In the case at hand, the carrier, after being sued in Supreme Court, did not interpose an answer but instead moved to dismiss the complaint as time barred and subject to a defense founded upon documentary evidence. Does the carrier\u2019s motion constitute a \u201cpleading\u201d within the meaning of section 1213 (c) so as to require it to post a bond? We hold yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In 1980, defendant Intercontinental Casualty Insurance Company, a Cayman Islands insurance carrier, and Ideal Mutual Insurance Company, a New York insurance carrier, entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement to reinsure certain workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>of Ideal and one of its subsidiaries. Ideal later became insolvent and the New York State Superintendent of Insurance brought a proceeding in Supreme Court to have Ideal placed in liquidation pursuant to article 74 of the Insurance Law. Supreme Court granted the petition, appointed the Superintendent as liquidator, and vested the Superintendent with title to all of Ideal\u2019s property and rights of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">In February 1998, the Superintendent, as liquidator, commenced an action in Supreme Court against Intercontinental. On behalf of Ideal\u2019s estate, the Superintendent sought to recover some $20.5 million in reinsurance proceeds allegedly outstanding under the Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement. Interposing no answer, Intercontinental moved to dismiss the complaint on Statute of Limitations and documentary evidence grounds (see, CPLR 3211 [a] [1], [5]). Intercontinental also informed the court that it would not object if the court were to treat the motion as one for summary judgment pursuant to CPLR 3211 (c). Arguing that Intercontinental was defending the action on the merits, the Superintendent sought an order compelling Intercontinental to post a bond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Supreme Court granted the Superintendent\u2019s application and ordered Intercontinental \u201cto post a bond in the amount of $4,835,333.99, or, in the alternative, to provide a certification from the Commissioner of Insurance that defendant maintains within New York funds or securities in trust or otherwise sufficient and available to satisfy any final judgment against [it].\u201d After Intercontinental failed to post a bond, Supreme Court granted the Superintendent\u2019s motion for judgment, and a judgment in the amount of $4,835,333.99 was entered. Intercontinental appealed, contending that its motion to dismiss was not a pleading and therefore did not trigger the Insurance Law\u2019s requirement to post a bond. In the alternative, Intercontinental argued that Supreme Court set the bond too high. The Appellate Division affirmed. We granted Intercontinental leave to appeal and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Insurance Law \u00a7 1213 has clear objectives. It imposes accountability on foreign or alien carriers who, although not authorized to do business in this State, issue or deliver insurance policies here <em>(see, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 1213 [a]). Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>enactment provides a local forum for resolving disputes that arise out of those policies (including reinsurance treaties).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, by requiring a foreign carrier to post a bond at the outset of a proceeding, the statute seeks to assure that a foreign carrier\u2019s funds will be available in this State to satisfy any potential judgment against it from the proceeding <em>(see, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 1213 [c]; <em>Curiale v Ardra Ins. Co., supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 275).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Section 1213 (c) (1) requires any unauthorized foreign or alien carrier to post a bond before it \u201cfiles any pleading in any proceeding against it.\u201d At the same time, section 1213 (c) (3) excuses a foreign carrier from the bond posting requirement when it files a \u201cmotion\u201d to set aside service on the ground that the carrier, or the person upon whom service is made pursuant to section 1213 (b) (3), did not commit the acts in this State that form the predicate for the court\u2019s jurisdiction <em>(see, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 1213 [c] [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Intercontinental argues that pre-answer motions to dismiss are not \u201cpleadings.\u201d In support of its position, Intercontinental relies on <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v Administratia Asigurarilor De Stat </em>(948 F Supp 285, 295 [SD NY]). There, the court allowed a carrier to file a motion for summary judgment without a bond. The court relied in part on CPLR 3011, entitled \u201cKinds of pleadings.\u201d The court noted that \u201c[s]ection 3011 provides for a complaint, an answer, a cross-claim against plaintiff, a counterclaim or cross-claim against a not-yet-joined party, interpleader pleadings, third party pleadings, a reply to counterclaim, and a reply to a reply\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 295). Because a motion for summary judgment was not on the list, the court concluded that it was not a \u201cpleading\u201d for purposes of Insurance Law \u00a7 1213 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We disagree with the holding in <em>Allstate. </em>CPLR 3011 is essentially a \u201clabeling provision\u201d <em>(see, </em>Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C3011:1, at 625-626). In concluding that a bond is required, we are guided not by nomenclature but by the realities of litigation. We are unwilling to import CPLR 3011\u2019s labeling function into Insurance Law \u00a7 1213. To do so would impede section 1213\u2019s objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The Legislature\u2019s choice of words in the exception carved out by subdivision (c) (3) is revealing. By carving out certain \u201cmo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tions\u201d to set aside service, the Legislature obviously contemplated that other \u201cmotions\u201d may qualify as pleadings under subdivision (c) (1). Whether any particular motion to dismiss\u2014 other than the one carved out \u2014 falls within the category of a \u201cpleading\u201d must be determined in accordance with the Legislature\u2019s objectives in enacting the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Intercontinental argues that allowing it to file a motion to dismiss without posting a bond would not compromise section 1213 (c)\u2019s goals. It contends that \u201c[i]f a complaint is so flawed that it cannot survive a motion to dismiss, there is no possibility that a judgment [for plaintiff! will be entered and no need to ensure that funds are available to satisfy one.\u201d Thus, according to Intercontinental, allowing foreign carriers to forestall filing a bond until they interpose a formal answer is consistent with section 1213 (c)\u2019s objective. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Allowing Intercontinental to raise its defenses without posting a bond would compromise section 1213 (c)\u2019s goal of assuring that funds are available in New York to satisfy any judgment in plaintiffs favor. A foreign carrier could wage extensive, costly motion practice, and yet avoid the bond requirement by simply advancing a host of defenses before interposing a formal answer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If defeated, the carrier could simply ignore the remainder of the proceedings and relegate the plaintiff to a default judgment with no in-State collateral. This is what the Legislature sought to avoid by enacting section 1213 (c). We therefore read the term \u201cpleading\u201d to include Intercontinental\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The grant of this motion to dismiss would cut the heart out of the plaintiffs case, while a denial could advance it substantially. Moreover, CPLR 3211 (c) allows a trial court to treat a motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment. In doing so, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>allows the court to order an \u201cimmediate trial of the issues raised on the motion.\u201d Thus, the motion to dismiss in this case pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (1) and (5) could give Intercontinental the practical equivalent of a complete victory \u2014 or a severe setback \u2014 in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Finally, Intercontinental argues that Supreme Court erred in calculating the amount of the bond that Insurance Law \u00a7 1213 (c) requires. The statute requires a bond that is \u201csufficient to secure payment of any final judgment which may be rendered in the proceeding\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 1213 [c] [1] [A]). The task of fixing the amount necessarily falls within the trial court\u2019s discretion (see, <em>Curiale v Ardra Ins. Co., </em>189 AD2d 217, 221, <em>affd </em>88 NY2d 268, <em>supra). </em>The calculation must be made at an early stage of the litigation, prior to the resolution of potentially complex factual and legal issues. We conclude from the record that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of the bond that section 1213 would require.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. A carrier may comply with section 1213 (c) (1) (A) by either putting up cash or securities or by posting a bond. The amount, to be fixed by the court, must be \u201csufficient to secure payment of any final judgment which may be rendered in the proceeding\u201d (see, Insurance Law \u00a7 1213 [c] [1] [A]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">. <em>See, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 1213 (b); <em>see generally, Curiale v Ardra Ins.
