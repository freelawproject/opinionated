By imposing a reliance requirement on General Business Law \u00a7 349, the court below has nullified the consumer protection statute and disregarded this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Oswego. (Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20; <em>Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>94 NY2d 43; <em>Gershon v Hertz Corp., </em>215 AD2d 202; <em>Ortho Pharm.

Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is directly supported by recent decisions from other courts which have not required \u201creliance\u201d under section 349. <em>(Littlefield v Goldome Bank, </em>142 AD2d 978; <em>Walts v First Union Mtge.

The dismissal by the court below of the General Business Law \u00a7 349 claim was correct because plaintiffs failed to plead causation. <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20; <em>Kenney v Kemper Natl.

We hold that it did not, and we therefore affirm the Appellate Division order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">In November 1991, plaintiff Michael Stutman and his wife, plaintiff Jeanette Rodriguez, borrowed $175,000 from defendant Chemical Bank (now merged into the Chase Manhattan Bank) to finance the purchase of a cooperative apartment. The loan was secured by plaintiffs\u2019 shares in the co-op. The note covering the loan permitted plaintiffs to prepay the principal at any time without incurring \u201cany prepayment charge.\u201d The note stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u201cI have the right to make payments of principal at any time before they are due. * * * I may make a full prepayment or partial prepayments without paying any prepayment charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">In February 1994, plaintiffs sought to refinance their loan with a new loan from Citibank, using the same shares of stock as collateral. Chemical, however, would not release the collateral until it received the funds to satisfy the loan, and Citibank would not release the funds for the new loan until it received the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Chemical informed plaintiffs that it would charge a $275 \u201cattorney\u2019s fee\u201d to arrange a simultaneous transfer in which Chemical would deliver the collateral and other documents to Citibank in exchange for the funds. Plaintiffs initially objected to the fee, but then decided to pay it, under protest, in order to complete the refinancing. About a day after plaintiffs \u201cclosed\u201d the loan with Citibank, a representative from Chemical \u2014 who plaintiffs allege was not an attorney \u2014 delivered the collateral and other unidentified documents to Citibank. Simultaneously, Citibank gave the representative a check which retired the Chemical Bank loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Plaintiffs then brought the instant lawsuit, on behalf of themselves and all persons similarly situated, alleging that the $275 charge was a deceptive practice under General Business Law \u00a7 349, and that it violated the Federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) (15 USC \u00a7 1601 <em>et seq.). </em>Plaintiffs also raised several common-law claims, including breach of contract, fraud and excessiveness of the $275 fee. Defendant removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The District Court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the TILA claim, holding that the $275 charge was not a finance or prepayment charge under TILA, and that TILA did not create a general prohibition against making misleading statements in connection with loans. The court added that, in any event, the $275 charge was not misleading but was assessed for plaintiff\u2019s \u201cspecial request\u201d that the loan be refinanced through Citibank. Having dismissed the only Federal claim, and there being no diversity of citizenship, the District Court remanded the State claims to State court <em>(Stutman v Chemical Bank, </em>1996 US Dist LEXIS 13970, 1996 WL 539845 [SD NY 1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Defendant then filed a preanswer motion in Supreme Court to dismiss the remaining claims <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3211 [a] [5], [7]). The court declined to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 General Business Law \u00a7 349 claim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201cIt is impossible to conclude, as a matter of law, that it was not materially misleading to contract with plaintiffs in the language of their note \u2014 that there would not be \u2018any\u2019 prepayment charge\u2014 without telling them that there may be an attorney\u2019s fee payable if prepayment were made in the not unusual manner of a refinancing through another bank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The court also denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the $275 fee was excessive, but granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">On defendant\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division reversed and dismissed both of plaintiffs\u2019 surviving claims. Concerning the General Business Law \u00a7 349 claim, the Appellate Division stated that the \u201cburden is on plaintiffs to show materially deceptive conduct on which they relied to their detriment\u201d (internal quotations omitted). The court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to meet this burden, because it was \u201chighly improbable that the allegedly misleading language had any effect on plaintiffs\u2019 decision to borrow from defendant in the first place.\u201d In addition, the Appellate Division held that plaintiffs failed to state a claim that the $275 fee was excessive, noting that \u201c \u2018courts are not empowered to set policy on [the excessiveness of] prices.\u2019 \u201d (260 AD2d 272, 273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">On appeal to this Court, plaintiffs have abandoned their excessiveness claim and argue only that their General Business Law \u00a7 349 claim was improperly dismissed, because the Appellate Division applied the wrong legal standard. We affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, although for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Section 349 of the General Business Law, enacted in 1970 as a broad consumer protection measure, begins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">\u201cDeceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state are hereby declared unlawful\u201d (General Business Law \u00a7 349 [a]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">A decade later, in 1980, the Legislature added section 349 (h), giving private citizens a right of action for deceptive trade practices. Citizens can enjoin an unlawful business practice, recover actual damages (or $50, whichever is greater) and obtain attorney\u2019s fees. In addition, if a defendant knowingly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>willfully engages in a deceptive practice, the court may, in its discretion, award treble damages up to a maximum of $1,000 <em>(see, </em>General Business Law \u00a7 349 [h]).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">A plaintiff under section 349 must prove three elements: first, that the challenged act or practice was consumer-oriented; second, that it was misleading in a material way; and third, that the plaintiff suffered injury as a result of the deceptive act <em>(see, Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20, 25; <em>see also, Gaidon v Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>94 NY2d 330, 344; <em>Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>94 NY2d 43, 55-56). Whether a representation or an omission, the deceptive practice must be \u201clikely to mislead a reasonable consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances\u201d <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 26). A deceptive practice, however, need not reach the level of common-law fraud to be actionable under section 349 <em>(see, Gaidon v Guardian Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>at 343). In addition, a plaintiff must prove \u201cactual\u201d injury to recover under the statute, though not necessarily pecuniary harm <em>(see, Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 26; <em>see also, </em>Givens, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 19, General Business Law \u00a7 349, at 565).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Further, as we have repeatedly stated, reliance is not an element of a section 349 claim <em>(see, Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., supra, </em>at 55 [\u201cIntent to defraud and justifiable reliance by the plaintiff are not elements of the statutory claim\u201d]; <em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 26 [\u201cthe statute does not require proof of justifiable reliance\u201d]; <em>see also, </em>Givens, Supp Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 19, General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349-350, 2000 Cum Pocket Part, at 223 [section 349 contains \u201cno requirement that an injured party show reasonable reliance on erroneous statements * * * in order to obtain relief\u2019]). The plaintiff, however, must show that the defendant\u2019s \u201cmaterial deceptive act\u201d caused the injury <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In the case at hand, plaintiffs allege that defendant violated section 349 by promising, in the note, that there would be no \u201cprepayment charge,\u201d but then assessing a $275 \u201cattorney\u2019s fee\u201d when plaintiffs sought to refinance their loan. Plaintiffs contend that the $275 fee was a \u201cprepayment charge\u201d in disguise and that the note was deceptive for not revealing that fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The Appellate Division dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claim, holding that they failed to show justifiable reliance: that is, that the note\u2019s failure to disclose the $275 attorney\u2019s fee \u201chad any effect on plaintiffs\u2019 decision to borrow from defendant in the first place.\u201d That, however, was the wrong standard, because reliance is <em>not </em>an element of a section 349 claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Nor did the Appellate Division merely apply the causation standard in the guise of reliance. The Appellate Division\u2019s ruling clearly imposed a reliance requirement: that plaintiffs made the decision to take the loan in reliance on their belief that the $275 fee would not apply. In contrast to section 349 claims, that is precisely the type of reliance that must be shown in order to state a common-law fraud claim <em>(see, </em>Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 538 [2] [a] [justifiable reliance on a fraudulent misrepresentation is shown if \u201ca reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Reliance and causation are twin concepts, but they are not identical. In the context of fraud, they are often intertwined <em>(see, </em>Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 548A [\u201cA fraudulent misrepresentation is a legal cause of a pecuniary loss resulting from action or inaction in reliance upon it if, but only if, the loss might reasonably be expected to result from the reliance\u201d]). But there is a difference between reliance and causation, as illustrated by the facts of this case. Here, plaintiffs allege that because of defendant\u2019s deceptive act, they were forced to pay a $275 fee that they had been led to believe was not required. In other words, plaintiffs allege that defendant\u2019s material deception caused them to suffer a $275 loss. This allegation satisfies the causation requirement. Plaintiffs need not additionally allege that they would not otherwise have entered into the transaction. Nothing more is required.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Nevertheless, we uphold the Appellate Division\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, for a different reason: plaintiffs have failed to show that defendant committed a deceptive act. The nub of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that the $275 \u201cattorney\u2019s fee\u201d was really a prepayment charge in disguise. Even taking plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true, as we must in deciding defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the fee was a prepayment charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">It is undisputed that the $275 fee was not a \u201cprepayment charge\u201d in the classic sense: defendant did not impose a penalty on plaintiffs for early repayment of the loan <em>(see, </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1182 [6th ed 1990] [defining prepayment penalty as a \u201cpenalty under a note, mortgage, or deed of trust, imposed when the loan is paid before its due date\u201d]; 12 CFR 226.18 [k] [defining prepayment charge under TILA as a \u201cpenalty * * * imposed if the obligation is prepaid in full\u201d]). Indeed, plaintiffs acknowledge in their complaint that, had they shown up at Chemical Bank with cash or a certified check for the balance of their loan, they \u201cwould not have been charged for the calculation of the pay-off amount or the review of the check or file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Rather, the $275 fee was assessed for the special arrangement in which a Chemical representative was required to go to Citibank, attend the closing and tender the collateral in exchange for a check satisfying the balance of the loan. Plaintiffs acknowledge that defendant properly charged a fee for these special services, but argue that an \u201cattorney\u2019s fee\u201d was not justified because the services of an attorney were not required to deliver the collateral to Citibank in exchange for the check. Plaintiffs allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201cdefendant charged the plaintiffs an attorney fee for essentially the services of a delivery person or a title company which agrees to hold documents or a check in escrow pending the termination of the sale\u201d (Amended complaint, If 22).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Thus, at bottom, plaintiffs\u2019 argument is not that the note was deceptive in stating that there would be no prepayment charge. Clearly, no such charge was assessed. Rather, plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that the $275 fee was excessive because it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>necessary for Chemical to retain an attorney. There might, or might not, be merit to that assertion. But it is in any event unnecessary to consider it because plaintiffs have abandoned their excessiveness claim on appeal to this Court, and argue only that defendant committed a deceptive act under General Business Law \u00a7 349. Since no \u201cprepayment charge\u201d was assessed, plaintiffs have failed to show that the note was deceptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">. Notably, even after <em>Oswego, </em>the Appellate Division has occasionally applied an incorrect standard in section 349 cases, imposing a reliance requirement when in fact there is none (see, <em>e.g., Gershon v Hertz Corp., </em>215 AD2d 202, 202-203 [finding no section 349 claim where plaintiffs \u201callegations do not show materially deceptive conduct on which plaintiff relied to his detriment\u201d]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">. Similarly, in the securities context, proof of reliance is not required where a duty to disclose material information has been breached, or where there are material omissions or misstatements in a proxy statement. Rather, the materiality of the omission or misstatement satisfies the causation requirement (see, <em>e.g., Affiliated Ute Citizens v United States, </em>406 US 128, 154 [breach of duty to disclose: the \u201cobligation to disclose and (the) withhold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ing of a material fact establish the requisite element of causation in fact\u201d]; <em>Mills v Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 US 375, 385 [misstatement or material omission in proxy statement: \u201cWhere there has been a finding of materiality, a shareholder has made a sufficient showing of causal relationship between the violation and the injury for which he seeks redress\u201d]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
