On June 20, 1994, petitioner was released on parole. Two years later, he was re-arrested and charged with two robberies committed in the Town of Wallkill. In a search of his apartment, the police recovered a .38 caliber pistol. After petitioner was acquitted of the robberies, the Division of Parole instituted proceedings against him, alleging that he had violated the conditions of his parole by possessing a firearm. Following a parole revocation hearing, on August 8, 1997 an Administrative Law Judge issued a recommendation that petitioner\u2019s parole be revoked and that he be assessed a penalty of 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ten days later, the Division of Parole adopted that recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Petitioner appealed to the Division\u2019s appeals unit, which affirmed both the revocation and the penalty. A notice of the decision was mailed to petitioner on January 2, 1998. On the decision sent to petitioner, a handwritten note beneath the determination read, \u201cGiven length of hold, schedule for full Parole Board review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">On January 16, petitioner\u2019s attorney sent a letter to the Board, asking it to consider on its \u201cfull Board\u201d review all of the arguments raised before the appeals unit. The Board one week later issued a decision stating that it had conducted a Delinquent Time Case Review pursuant to 9 NYCRR 8005.21, and that petitioner\u2019s penalty was reduced from 96 months to 60 months. The Board sent petitioner notice of that decision on March 2, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Precisely four months later, on July 1, 1998, petitioner commenced the instant CPLR article 78 proceeding, arguing that his parole was improperly revoked because the evidence was not sufficient to show that he possessed the gun found in his apartment. Respondent moved to dismiss the petition, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that it was not filed within the four-month limitations period <em>(see, </em>CPLR 217). Specifically, respondent urged that, pursuant to Division of Parole regulations, the appeals unit determination was the final administrative action, and the full Board Delinquent Time Case Review was an internal review, not an administrative remedy. Petitioner responded that the appeals unit\u2019s decision was \u201cambiguous as to finality\u201d since on its face it scheduled the case for full Board review, and that the administrative process was not completed until the full Board acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Supreme Court granted respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that the appeals unit decision was a final administrative determination, and thus the four-month limitations period ran from January 2, 1998, the date notice of the appeals unit decision was mailed to petitioner. Full Board review, according to the court, was <em>\u201csua sponte\u201d </em>and did not constitute a final administrative action. The Appellate Division affirmed, concluding that the administrative review process was complete after the decision of the appeals unit, and that \u201cpetitioner and his counsel are charged with knowledge\u201d of the regulations providing for Delinquent Time Case Review by the Board on its own initiative (267 AD2d 590, 591). The Appellate Division found no merit in petitioner\u2019s argument that the \u201chandwritten note on the parole appeal decision notice made the notice ambiguous\u201d <em>(supra, </em>at 591). We granted leave, and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">A CPLR article 78 proceeding against a public \u201cbody or officer must be commenced within four months after the determination to be reviewed becomes final and binding\u201d (CPLR 217 [1]). An agency determination is final \u2014 triggering the statute of limitations \u2014 when the petitioner is aggrieved by the determination <em>(see, Matter of Biondo v New York State Bd. of Parole, </em>60 NY2d 832, 834; <em>Matter of Martin v Ronan, </em>44 NY2d 374, 380-381). A petitioner is aggrieved once the agency has issued an unambiguously final decision that puts the petitioner on notice that all administrative appeals have been exhausted. If an agency has created ambiguity or uncertainty as to whether a final and binding decision has been issued, \u201c \u2018the courts should resolve any ambiguity created by the public body against it in order to reach a determination on the merits and not deny a party his day in court\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mundy v Nassau County Civ. Serv. Commn., </em>44 NY2d 352, 358 [quoting <em>Matter of Castaways Motel v Schuyler, </em>24 NY2d 120, 126-127, <em>adhered to on rearg </em>25 NY2d 692]).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Here, the appeals unit decision affirming the revocation and penalty qualified as a final and binding determination. Division of Parole regulations specify only one avenue for administrative review: an appeal to the appeals unit <em>(see, </em>9 NYCRR 8006.4). No further avenues for administrative review are available. Thus, once the appeals unit has rendered its decision, administrative review is complete, triggering the four-month limitations period for article 78 review <em>(see, </em>9 NYCRR 8005.21 [b]; <em>see also, Matter of Blondo v New York State Bd. of Parole, supra, </em>60 NY2d, at 834).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Further, the handwritten note on the appeals unit decision did not create an ambiguity as to whether the decision was \u201cfinal and binding.\u201d The note stated, \u201cGiven length of hold, schedule for full Parole Board review.\u201d That note was plainly a reference to 9 NYCRR 8005.21, which provides for full Board review, on the Board\u2019s own initiative, of all penalty assessments in excess of 24 months. As the regulations state, this review \u2014 known as Delinquent Time Case Review \u2014 is \u201cnot a substitute for an administrative appeal,\u201d but rather is an \u201cinternal opportunity for the members of the board to discuss\u201d the case among themselves, and \u201cto permit the board to consider any information in its records that it considers to be pertinent to the case, so as to facilitate equitable and consistent decision making\u201d (9 NYCRR 8005.21 [a]). The time assessment may only be decreased, not increased, as a result of this review (9 NYCRR 8005.21 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Delinquent Time Case Review, in effect, is an internal audit conducted by the Board. Its timing is left to the \u201csole discretion\u201d of the Board, and the Board does not \u201csolicit or accept input from outside\u201d when conducting this review (9 NYCRR 8005.21 [a]). Indeed, the parole violator is notified of the result of the review only if the full Board decides to reduce the time assessment <em>(see, </em>9 NYCRR 8005.21 [c]). Further, the regulations explicitly state that Delinquent Time Case Review \u201cis not an administrative remedy,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cits pendency or conduct shall not preclude a violator from seeking judicial review of an underlying revocation determination once the administrative appeal [to the appeals unit] * * * is concluded\u201d (9 NYCRR 8005.21 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">In light of these regulations, it is clear that the handwritten note on the appeals unit\u2019s decision referred to the Division\u2019s internal Delinquent Time Case Review, which is explicitly <em>not </em>an administrative remedy. Further, the regulations make clear that the appeals unit decision was a \u201cfinal and binding\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>administrative determination, notwithstanding the pendency of the Delinquent Time Case Review. Thus, the four-month limitations period began to run when notice of the appeals unit decision was mailed to petitioner in January 1998. His article 78 petition filed nearly six months later was therefore untimely.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> Only the timeliness of petitioner\u2019s article 78 proceeding \u2014 and no other aspect of Delinquent Time Case Review \u2014 is before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
