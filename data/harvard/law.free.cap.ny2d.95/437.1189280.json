II. The Court below correctly upheld the BSA\u2019s determination that an environmental impact statement was not required to issue the variances. <em>(Matter of Jackson v New York State Urban Dev. Corp., </em>67 NY2d 400.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b542-4\">Levine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">At issue here is the validity of a determination made by the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA) to grant use variances permitting development of two neighboring properties and issuing a Type I Negative Declaration rather than requiring an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The properties at issue in this matter are located on West Houston Street within and along the northernmost boundary of the SoHo Cast-Iron Historic District. In addition, these sites fall within an M1-5A zoning district, designated as a light manufacturing district.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The BSA\u2019s determination was made after proceedings spanning eight months, and included four days of public hearings and review of an abundance of documentary materials and exhibits. Additionally, the BSA had the benefit of an initial review conducted by the City Planning Commission (CPC). Moreover, because the sites were located within an historic district, the owners sought and ultimately obtained the necessary approval of the Landmarks Preservation Commission <em>(see, </em>Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7\u00a7 25-306, 25-307).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In order to issue the variances here, the BSA was required to find that the proposed development met five specific requirements: that (a) because of \u201cunique physical conditions\u201d of the property, conforming uses would impose \u201cpractical difficulties or unnecessary hardship;\u201d (b) also due to the unique physical conditions, conforming uses would not \u201cenable the owner to realize a reasonable return\u201d from the zoned property; (c) the proposed variances would \u201cnot alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district;\u201d (d) the owner did not create the practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship; and (e) only the \u201cminimum variance necessary to afford relief\u2019 is sought (NY City Zoning Resolution \u00a7 72-21; <em>see, Matter of Bella Vista Apt. Co. v Bennett, </em>89 NY2d 465, 469).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">This Court\u2019s review of the BSA\u2019s determination to grant the variances sought is limited by the well-established principle that a municipal zoning board has wide discretion in considering applications for variances. A \u201cboard determination may not be set aside in the absence of illegality, arbitrariness or abuse of discretion,\u201d and \u201cwill be sustained if it has a rational basis and is supported by substantial evidence\u201d <em>(Matter of Consolidated Edison Co. v Hoffman, </em>43 NY2d 598, 608).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">As to the existence of unique physical conditions resulting in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship, the BSA was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>entitled to rely on the study completed by the CPC. The CPC found that the \u201cproperties have idiosyncratic lot configurations that are generally not duplicated in other parts of the M1-5A district\u201d in that the properties extended along a lengthy stretch of West Houston Street, a major thoroughfare, and were L-shaped, measuring only approximately 25 feet deep in places. In addition, the CPC study noted that \u201c[t]he properties have been unable to be significantly improved since the widening of [West] Houston Street in 1963\u201d which caused the irregular and unique shape of the lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Likewise, the BSA could reasonably rely upon expert testimony submitted by the owners based upon significant documentation, including detailed economic analysis, which undeniably provided \u201cdollars and cents\u201d evidence <em>(Matter of Village Bd. of Vil. of Fayetteville v Jarrold, </em>53 NY2d 254, 256) that the unique physical configurations of the properties would preclude a reasonable rate of return from conforming uses. The owners\u2019 expert demonstrated that a reasonable rate of return on the properties at issue would be 9.9%. Moreover, the submitted financial data and economic analysis also supported the conclusion that, not only would conforming uses fail to provide the 9.9% rate of return, but also no lesser non-conforming uses could yield that rate of return.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Appellants do not seriously dispute that there was submitted the kind of detailed economic analysis necessary to provide \u201cdollars and cents proof\u2019 to support the BSA\u2019s findings that conforming uses would yield an insufficient rate of return. Rather, their main objection is that, in part, the exposition of the owners\u2019 expert was based upon comparable properties from outside the zoning district. In actuality, more than half of the properties examined were within the district, and virtually all of the remaining properties within the survey were located in areas adjoining the district. No inflexible rule exists .which requires, as a matter of law, that an economic analysis to support a use variance must be restricted exclusively to data on properties within a particular zoning district. Indeed, the New York City Zoning Ordinance\u2019s requirement that any proposed development \u201cnot alter the essential character of the <em>neighborhood or district\u201d </em>(\u00a7 72-21 [c] [emphasis supplied]) demonstrably contemplates the possibility of consideration of properties that might fall outside the actual boundaries of the pertinent district. As the Appellate Division aptly observed, the value of the property \u2014 and thus the feasibility of potential uses \u2014 was due as much to its geographical location as to the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>district of which it was a part. Under these circumstances it cannot be said that it was irrational or erroneous as a matter of law for the BSA to have considered comparables from outside the zoning district.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Furthermore, appellants\u2019 assertion that the current use of the properties as parking lots yielded a reasonable rate of return was raised for the first time on appeal and, thus, is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">As to the BSA\u2019s finding that the proposed development plans would not change the essential character of the neighborhood, the agency could reasonably rely upon the changes to the plans of the development made to reflect the Landmarks Preservation Commission\u2019s detailed construction requirements, which appellants do not challenge, that the two proposed buildings should have very different outward appearances and yet each would be designed in a manner consistent with the special architectural features of the SoHo district. Furthermore, it was not irrational for the BSA to conclude that the development\u2014 which would bring only an additional 185 residents to the already existent population of 10,000 residents in the neighborhood and immediately surrounding areas \u2014 would have only an insignificant effect on the general character of the mixed use neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">For all of the foregoing reasons, it cannot be said that there was an absence of substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings as to each of the five requirements necessary to issue the proposed use variances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Moreover, the BSA\u2019s determination that no EIS was necessary was also neither irrational nor illegal. The BSA took a \u201chard look\u201d at the potential environmental effects of the proposed development, and sought input from several interested agencies, including the City\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection and the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The BSA also required archaeological studies and soil and groundwater testing. Thus, there was a rational basis for the BSA\u2019s determination that there were \u201cno foreseeable significant environmental impacts that would require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
