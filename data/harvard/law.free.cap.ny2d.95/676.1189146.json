After Rhonda Greer abandoned three of the children, they were removed from her home in late 1985 by the New York City Human Resources Administration\u2019s Child Welfare Administration (now the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, or ACS) and, in 1986, were placed with Teresa and Cynthia Greer. In 1991, Rhonda gave birth to, and abandoned, a fourth child, who was then placed with Sandra Greer Smith. Commencing in 1986, petitioners Teresa and Cynthia Greer repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, requested foster care benefits from ACS. In 1991, all three petitioners requested fair hearings from the New York State Department of Social Services to challenge ACS\u2019s denial of benefits, and the requests were consolidated. In a decision after fair hearing, the State confirmed the denial of benefits on the ground that petitioners took in their sister\u2019s children as an alternative to foster care, rendering them ineligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">After petitioners commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the denial of benefits, Supreme Court vacated the fair hearing decision and ordered a new hearing <em>(Matter of Greer v Bane, </em>158 Misc 2d 486). The court ordered retroactive foster care payments unless ACS could show that petitioners were not fit foster parents, and that the children \u2014 prior to petitioners\u2019 custody of them \u2014 were not endangered in their mother\u2019s care. On remand, the State issued a decision awarding petitioners retroactive foster care payments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioners then moved, pursuant to CPLR article 86 \u2014 the Equal Access to Justice Act \u2014 for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Supreme Court rejected the request for legal fees related to the initial administrative proceeding, and limited the award to work performed on the article 78 litigation and subsequent administrative hearing. The Appellate Division affirmed, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>In 1989, New York enacted the State Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) \u201cto create a mechanism authorizing the recovery of counsel fees and other reasonable expenses in certain actions against the state of New York\u201d (CPLR 8600). As adopted in 1989, the EAJA provided that the law was intended to be \u201csimilar to the provisions of federal law contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 and the significant body of case law that has evolved thereunder\u201d (L 1989, ch 770, \u00a7 1). Section 504 permits a prevailing party in an adversary adjudication to obtain an award of fees and expenses from the administrative agency conducting the adjudication (5 USC \u00a7 504 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">One year after adopting the EAJA, the New York Legislature amended CPLR 8600 by deleting reference to 5 USC \u00a7 504 and substituting reference to 28 USC \u00a7 2412 (L 1990, ch 73, \u00a7 1). Section 2412 provides for fees to a prevailing party</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">\u201cincurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust\u201d (28 USC \u00a7 2412 [d] [1] [A]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">To this day, CPLR 8600 provides that the New York EAJA is intended to be \u201csimilar to the provisions of federal law contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (d) and the significant body of case law that has evolved thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Like 28 USC \u00a7 2412 (d) (1) (A) \u2014 the Federal.counterpart\u2014 section 8601 (a) of the EAJA states that fees and other expenses may be awarded in favor of a prevailing party \u201cin any civil action brought against the state, unless the court finds that the position of the state was substantially justified.\u201d An \u201caction\u201d is, according to the statute, \u201cany civil action or proceeding brought to seek judicial review of an action of the state\u201d (CPLR 8602 [a]). Fees and expenses are delimited as \u201cthe reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, consultation with experts, and like expenses, and reasonable attorney fees, including fees for work performed by law students or paralegals under the supervision of an attorney incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding and judicial action\u201d (CPLR 8602 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Petitioners contend that the language of section 8602 (b) clearly and unambiguously allows for an award of attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>fees for work performed in connection with an administrative proceeding that predates a civil action. Specifically, petitioners urge that section 8601 (a) allows an award when a civil action is brought, and once that threshold has been met section 8602 (b) defines the scope of fees and expenses that may be awarded, which includes administrative proceedings predating article 78 review.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We read the statute differently. Section 8601 (a) limits the award of fees and expenses to those incurred <em>\u201cin any civil action </em>brought against the state\u201d (emphasis added). As noted, an action is specifically defined as \u201cany civil action or proceeding brought to seek judicial review of an action of the state\u201d (CPLR 8602 [a]). Thus, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and other allowable expenses to a prevailing party first requires a civil action, and does not encompass administrative proceedings that precede a civil action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Any doubt as to the scope of the statute is dispelled upon proper examination of its history. In 1989, immediately after the bill\u2019s passage by the Legislature but before requisite gubernatorial approval, the Governor sought clarification regarding the reference to 5 USC \u00a7 504. The bill\u2019s Assembly sponsor, Robin Schimminger, wrote that the more appropriate reference would be to 28 USC \u00a7 2412 (d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">\u201cthe term \u2018administrative proceeding\u2019 contained in the definition of permissible fees (CPLR 8602 (b)) was intended to include only those administrative proceedings that occur as a result of the EAJA litigation, including hearings on remand, <em>not </em>the administrative proceedings that may precede a judicial action. This comports with the federal case law construing 28 USC 2412 (d)\u201d (Letter of Assemblymember Robin Schimminger, Bill Jacket, L 1989, ch 770, at 8-9 [emphasis in original]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Senatorial sponsor John M. McHugh confirmed that Assembly-member Schimminger\u2019s letter \u201caccurately reflect [ed] the agreements which were reached with regard to the applicability and effect of the legislation\u201d (Letter of Senator John M. McHugh, Bill Jacket, L 1989, ch 770, at 7). Despite reference to 5 USC \u00a7 504 in the bill, the Governor\u2019s Approval Memorandum made clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>\u201cthe administrative proceedings for which fees may be awarded are only those that occur as a result of a court action, not those that lead to an action under the provisions of this bill\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1989, ch 770, reprinted in 1989 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2437).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Petitioners urge that such post-enactment statements are inconsequential as to a law\u2019s meaning and \u201cshould not be taken seriously\u201d <em>(see, Sullivan v Finkelstein, </em>496 US 617, 632 [Scalia, J., concurring in part]). That the sponsors\u2019 letters postdate the 1989 legislative action initially taken is irrelevant here. The statute we apply today actually references 28 USC \u00a7 2412 (d), not 5 USC \u00a7 504. As the Governor explained in his Approval Memorandum, the amendment \u2014 which substituted 28 USC \u00a7 2412 (d) for 5 USC \u00a7 504 \u2014 \u201ccorrects certain technical errors\u201d and \u201csupports all of the interpretive clarifications outlined in the 1989 Approval Memorandum for that chapter * * * and the letters from the sponsors of the bill to my Counsel\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1990, ch 73, reprinted in 1990 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2699).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Finally, we harmonize section 8602 (b)\u2019s reference to fees \u201cincurred in connection with an administrative proceeding and judicial action\u201d with our conclusion that such fees may not be awarded for administrative proceedings commenced before judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">As the Legislature directed, in reaching this conclusion we are guided by 28 USC \u00a7 2412 and case law interpreting that statute. In <em>Sullivan v Hudson </em>(490 US 877), the United States Supreme Court recognized that proceedings on remand from judicial action are an integral part of the civil action. The Court reasoned that, where proceedings on remand are required, a claimant could not achieve \u201cprevailing party\u201d status within the meaning of 28 USC \u00a7 2412 without successful completion of those proceedings. Thus, to deny a claimant an award for proceedings on remand would be the equivalent of attributing to Congress an intent to throw the \u201cclaimant a lifeline that it knew was a foot short\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 890). The Court rejected such a skewed interpretation of legislative intent, as do we. By parity of reasoning, section 8602 (b) allows for an award of fees for administrative proceedings on remand from judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed and the certified question answered in the affirmative, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur; Judge Graffeo taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\">. In October of 1992, during the pendency of these proceedings, petitioners were certified as foster parents and began receiving timely, but not retroactive, foster care benefits (see, <em>Matter of Greer v Bane, </em>158 Misc 2d, at 490).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\">. <em>Matter of Perez v New York State Dept. of Labor </em>(259 AD2d 161), which reached the contrary conclusion, should not be followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
