The Court below properly determined that defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel where his attorney, in a weak one-witness case, promised to raise an \u201calibi\u201d in his opening statement, proceeded to present an \u201calibi\u201d for the wrong period of time during his case-in-chief, and then highlighted the \u201calibi\u201d testimony on summation, hinging defendant\u2019s fate on the jury\u2019s acceptance of the nonexistent alibi. <em>(People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708; <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668; <em>People v Claudio, </em>83 NY2d 76; <em>People v Vilardi, </em>76 NY2d 67; <em>People v Ellis, </em>81 NY2d 854; <em>People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137; <em>People v Brown, </em>45 NY2d 852; <em>Flores v Demskie, </em>215 F3d 293.) II. The Court below properly held that defendant was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. <em>(People v Long, </em>81 AD2d 521; <em>People v Cabrera, </em>234 AD2d 557; <em>People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708; <em>People v Bell, </em>48 NY2d 933.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b666-7\">Ciparick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">At issue on this appeal is whether defendant was denied meaningful representation when his attorney called an alibi witness who failed to account for defendant\u2019s whereabouts on the night of the crime. We conclude that, on this record, he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Evidence was adduced at trial that shortly after midnight on August 10, 1995, a livery cab driver pulled in front of a car service stand to pick up a fare. Defendant entered the car through the front while another man entered through the back. As the car pulled away, defendant asked the driver to make a stop. When they reached the stop, defendant pointed a handgun at him and demanded his money. The driver handed defendant $130 while the man seated in the back pointed a shotgun at him. After defendant ordered the driver out of the car, three other men jumped into the car and all five sped off with defendant at the wheel. On August 31, 1995, the driver identified defendant in a lineup. Defendant was arrested and charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>with robbery in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 160.15 [4]) and robbery in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 160.10 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">At trial, defense counsel presented two defenses. Counsel challenged the reliability of the identification and also presented an alibi witness who testified that she was with defendant at midnight on August 10, 1995. On cross-examination, however, the witness acknowledged her Grand Jury testimony that she knew of defendant\u2019s whereabouts only during the night of August 10 and early morning hours of August 11. She could not account for defendant\u2019s whereabouts in the early morning hours of August 10. On summation, defense counsel attacked the victim\u2019s credibility and argued that the victim mistakenly identified his client as the perpetrator. As for the alibi witness\u2019s testimony, counsel maintained that the discrepancy was one for the jury to resolve. In response, the prosecutor argued that because the witness provided an alibi for the wrong date, her testimony should be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The jury convicted defendant of all charges. The Appellate Division reversed and held that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel. The Court reasoned that because the failed testimony \u201c \u2018went to the heart of the alibi, counsel\u2019s error undermined the defense\u2019 \u201d (266 AD2d 564, 565 [quoting <em>People v Cabrera, </em>234 AD2d 557, 558]). A Justice of the Appellate Division granted the People leave to appeal to this Court. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims, this Court has consistently applied a \u201cflexible\u201d approach <em>(People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 712). \u201cSo long as the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation,\u201d a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel will have been met <em>(People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147). Thus, the standard in New York has long been whether the defendant was afforded \u201cmeaningful representation\u201d <em>(see, People v Benevento, supra, </em>91 NY2d, at 712; <em>People v Flores, </em>84 NY2d 184, 187; <em>People v Claudio, </em>83 NY2d 76, 79-80, <em>rearg dismissed </em>88 NY2d 1007).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">In applying this standard, courts should not confuse true ineffectiveness with losing trial tactics or unsuccessful attempts to advance the best possible defense. The Constitution guarantees a defendant a fair trial, not a perfect one <em>(Delaware v Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 681). Isolated errors in counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>representation generally will not rise to the level of ineffectiveness, unless the error is \u201cso serious that defendant did not receive a \u2018fair trial\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Flores, supra, </em>84 NY2d, at 188-189).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Despite our well-settled test for evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the People ask this Court to adopt the Federal standard, maintaining that it is more precise than the State\u2019s \u201cmeaningful representation\u201d standard.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This Court has previously recognized the differences between the Federal and State tests for ineffectiveness, and has consistently adhered to the application of our \u201cmeaningful representation\u201d test <em>(see, People v Benevento, supra, </em>91 NY2d, at 713-714; <em>People v Claudio, supra, </em>83 NY2d, at 79-80). In doing so, we have clarified \u201cmeaningful representation\u201d to include a prejudice component which focuses on the \u201cfairness of the process as a whole rather than [any] particular impact on the outcome of the case\u201d <em>(People v Benevento, supra, </em>91 NY2d, at 714). No further clarification of the standard is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Applying that standard here, we conclude that defendant received meaningful representation. Although the prosecution discredited the alibi testimony, this alone did not \u201cseriously compromise\u201d defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial <em>(see, People v Hobot, </em>84 NY2d 1021, 1022). Counsel competently represented defendant\u2019s interests at other stages of the proceedings, and counsel\u2019s presentation of the alibi testimony did not diminish the legitimacy of defendant\u2019s misidentification defense. Indeed, the thrust of the defense was misidentification, which was, in part, buttressed by the alibi witness\u2019s testimony. Counsel further supported that defense by vigorously attacking the reliability of the victim\u2019s identification and highlighting the discrepancies in the victim\u2019s description of defendant. In view of the extensive misidentification defense and counsel\u2019s competency in all other respects, we conclude that counsel\u2019s failed attempt to establish an alibi was at most an unsuccessful tactic that cannot be characterized as ineffective assistance <em>(see, People v Jackson, </em>52 NY2d 1027, 1029).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the case remitted to the Appellate Division for consideration of the facts and issues raised but not determined on appeal to that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Order reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Division, Second Department, for consideration of the facts (CPL 470.25 [2] [d]; 470.40 [2] [b]) and issues raised but not determined on the appeal to that Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\"> The Federal test for evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims is set forth in <em>Strickland v Washington </em>(466 US 668). To overcome the presumption of effective representation, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) the attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different <em>(id., </em>at 687, 694). The United States Supreme Court has held that the \u201ctouchstone\u201d of the second prong of the analysis is whether counsel\u2019s performance rendered the proceeding fundamentally unfair or left an unreliable result (see, <em>Lockhart v Fretwell, </em>506 US 364, 369-370).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
