The order of the Court below should be affirmed in all respects because the Board\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion, arbitrary and capricious and did not constitute a \u201cbalanced evaluation of factors germane to restoration.\u201d <em>(Matter of Melone v State of New York Educ. Dept., </em>182 AD2d 875; <em>Citizens State Bank v Federal Deposit Ins.

II. It now transpires that the Board\u2019s decision was fatally tainted because matters dehors the record were considered which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>gravely prejudiced petitioner. <em>(Matter of Simpson v Wolansky, </em>45 AD2d 876, 38 NY2d 391; <em>Matter of Newbrand v City of Yonkers, </em>285 NY 164; <em>Matter of Citrin, </em>94 NY2d 459; <em>Lechich v Rinaldi, </em>246 F Supp 675; <em>Marathon Oil Co. v Environmental Protection Agency, </em>564 F2d 1253; <em>United States v Pierce Auto Frgt.

III. Appellants failed to deny and thus admit that their failure to serve the order by June 20, 1997 was arbitrary and capricious. Delay in service of the order until September 15, 1997 deprived petitioner of the right to reapply within one year of the Board\u2019s decision because the applicable rule had been changed in the interim.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b775-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b775-5\">Ciparick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In 1991, the Board of Regents permanently revoked petitioner\u2019s license to practice medicine after he negligently performed five abortions, one resulting in a patient\u2019s death, and failed to maintain proper records. Eighteen months later, petitioner applied for restoration of his medical license, maintaining that he recognized the \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in his conduct. As proof of his rehabilitation, petitioner submitted certificates of attendance at various medical conferences and courses, and also submitted letters from friends and colleagues attesting to his character.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Petitioner\u2019s application was first reviewed by a Peer Review Committee <em>(see, </em>Education Law \u00a7 6510 [3] [b]). After a hearing, the Peer Review Committee concluded that petitioner had \u201csufficiently fulfilled\u201d the standards of rehabilitation and remorse necessary to resume the practice of medicine. Accordingly, it unanimously recommended that the revocation of petitioner\u2019s license be stayed, that he be placed on probation for three years and that, upon completion of probation, his license be restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Petitioner next appeared before the Committee on the Professions, which issued a recommendation to the Board for a final determination (8 NYCRR 24.7 [b]). Troubled by the gravity of the original misconduct, the Committee was \u201cnot inclined to adopt the recommendation of the Peer Review Panel.\u201d However, before making its own recommendation, the Committee asked petitioner to furnish an expert opinion on his fitness to reenter the practice of medicine which, with approval from the Executive Secretary of the State Board for Medicine, petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>did. Acknowledging his inability to observe petitioner perform any procedures, the consultant concluded that petitioner was fit to practice medicine, subject to supervision and restrictions. A subcommittee of the State Board for Medicine reviewed the consultant\u2019s report and unanimously supported his conclusion. Although the Committee on the Professions remained \u201ctroubled\u201d by the seriousness of petitioner\u2019s misconduct, it recommended, by a two-to-one vote, restoration of petitioner\u2019s license with restrictions. The Committee recommended a 10-year probation period, the first five years limited to a hospital setting. It also adopted the terms imposed by the Peer Review Committee and recommended that petitioner obtain re-certification in obstetrics and gynecology by the end of the second year of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The Board of Regents rejected the recommendation of the Committee on the Professions and denied petitioner\u2019s reinstatement application. It cited the gravity of the original offense, the size of petitioner\u2019s practice at that time, petitioner\u2019s failure to express appropriate remorse for his patients and the reservations and limitations expressed by the consultant and the Committee on the Professions. Petitioner thereafter commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding, challenging the Board\u2019s determination as an abuse of discretion. Supreme Court dismissed the petition, concluding that the Board\u2019s determination was neither arbitrary nor capricious, but supported by a rational basis. A majority of the Appellate Division reversed, holding that petitioner\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for his misconduct and his continuing education compelled the exercise of discretion in his favor. Justice Mercure dissented on the ground that the majority \u201cimpermissibly weighed the evidence and substituted its judgment for that of [the] Board\u201d (270 AD2d 748, 750). Agreeing with the view cogently articulated by the dissenting Justice, we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Education Law \u00a7\u00a7 6510 and 6511 vest the Board of Regents with considerable discretion concerning matters of professional misconduct, including the revocation and restoration of medical licenses <em>(see also, Matter of Tompkins v Board of Regents, </em>299 NY 469, 476). Indeed, restoration of such licenses is permissive and is granted only in rare cases \u201c \u2018where the merit of the applicant is clearly established to the satisfaction of the [Board]\u201d\u2019 <em>(Matter of Jablon v Board of Regents, </em>271 App Div 369, 373, <em>affd </em>296 NY 1027, quoting <em>Matter of Erlanger v Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., </em>256 App Div 444, 447, <em>affd sub nom. Matter of Levi v Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>281 NY 627). The burden of proof is on the applicant to present evidence \u201cso ineluctable in its implications that it would compel affirmative action from a Board which has 'discretion\u2019 to restore or to refuse to restore\u201d <em>(Matter of Jablon v Board of Regents, supra, </em>at 373). In exercising that discretion, the Board is not required to weigh or consider any particular factors. As long as the Board\u2019s determination is supported by a rational basis, and is neither arbitrary nor capricious, it will not be disturbed <em>(see, id.; see also, Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222, 230-231).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Here, the Appellate Division departed from this well-settled standard and substituted its own judgment for that of the Board. The majority determined that, \u201c[i]n [its] view,\u201d (270 AD2d, at 750) petitioner\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for his actions, his continuing medical education and his consultant\u2019s fitness assessment justified reinstatement of his medical license. The majority\u2019s holding not only reflects an impermissible weighing of the evidence, but also is based on an erroneous \u201cbalanced evaluation of factors\u201d standard (270 AD2d, at 749) that neither this Court, nor the Legislature, has ever authorized. Rather, the appropriate standard of review is whether the Board\u2019s determination is supported by a rational basis <em>(Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., supra, </em>34 NY2d, at 231). We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In denying petitioner\u2019s application, the Board cited the seriousness of petitioner\u2019s misconduct, as well as \u201cqualifications expressed by the expert consultant,\u201d whose assessment was admittedly limited by his inability to observe petitioner\u2019s performance. Further, the Board expressed dissatisfaction with the \u201camount and type of supervision\u201d that would be available in a hospital setting. Finally, although petitioner felt \u201csad for what happened to the patients,\u201d the Board determined that petitioner\u2019s statements did not reflect an appropriate degree of remorse for his patients. On this record, the Board\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s application was neither irrational nor arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to the Appellate Division for consideration of issues raised but not determined on the appeal to that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
