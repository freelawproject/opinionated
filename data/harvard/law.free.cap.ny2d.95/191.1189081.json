When she returned a short time later, plaintiff found that her car had been blocked in by another car. Told that the vehicle belonged to someone at the law firm, plaintiff entered the reception area to ask that the car be moved. After arguing with Harvey, who refused to move his car, plaintiff was asked to leave the offices. Defendant\u2019s brother Jack Harvey, another partner in the firm, physically escorted her out. While being maneuvered out the door, plaintiff fell down a nine-step stairway to the sidewalk pavement below. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where she underwent surgery and remained for nine days.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">On the day of the incident, defendant Jonathan Harvey signed an information charging plaintiff with trespass, a violation <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 140.05). Days later, plaintiff swore to a complaint charging Jack Harvey with third-degree assault, a class A misdemeanor <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 120.00 [2]), alleging that he had recklessly caused her to fall down stairs and fracture a bone in her knee. On the application of the District Attorney, the court appointed James Banagan to prosecute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>charges against plaintiff, and a special prosecutor for the charges against Jack Harvey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">After she was arraigned on the charges against her, plaintiff served demands for discovery as well as motions for dismissal. Banagan, however, failed to respond, or to appear on six separate court dates, despite plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s notice to him by phone or letter. Exasperated by the delays, on June 11, 1996 plaintiff moved to dismiss the case for violation of CPL 30.30; the court adjourned the case for two weeks to give the People an opportunity to respond. On June 28, 1996, Banagan by fax served plaintiffs counsel with a \u201cNotice of Readiness for Trial,\u201d with a transmittal sheet reading \u201cCovering the Record.\u201d The Trial Judge dismissed the case, concluding that \u201cthe filing of a bare statement of readiness * * * [was] in fact illusory\u201d based on \u201cthe People\u2019s failure to respond in any meaningful way to [plaintiffs pretrial] demands and motions.\u201d The People took no appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">On April 16, 1997, defendant Jonathan Harvey wrote plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201cWith the passage of time, I have reflected upon what transpired the day we met. Upon considering the facts, and particularly in view of the extent and nature of your injury, I believe the incidents of that day could have, and should have, been avoided, and I am sorry for what happened. I believe the filing of a trespass charge against you was unnecessary and did not help the situation. I should have been more considerate and I understand how you have been offended by the charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">By letter dated June 17, 1997, Jonathan Harvey advised Banagan that he had recently learned of plaintiffs intention to sue him for malicious prosecution; that but for Banagan\u2019s negligent failure to oppose plaintiffs dismissal motion such an action could not be brought; and that \u201cin the event such an action for malicious prosecution is commenced against me, I have instructed defense counsel to assert appropriate claims against you.\u201d In July 1997, a year after the trespass charges against plaintiff were dismissed, she instituted the present malicious prosecution action. Defendants sought summary judgment on the ground that dismissal of the criminal proceedings pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>to CPL 30.30 did not constitute a \u201cfavorable termination.\u201d Defendants supported their motion with a Banagan affidavit averring that he had failed to respond to plaintiffs discovery demands \u2014 resulting in the 30.30 dismissal \u2014 because he was busy conducting a trial outside the area and not due to any \u201cdetermination that probable cause was lacking * * * or that Ms. Smith-Hunter was innocent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Supreme Court granted defendants summary judgment because, in dismissing the trespass action, the \u201cJudge did not engage in a discussion of the merits and there is absolutely nothing in the decision from which it can fairly be implied that he found the accused to be innocent of the charges lodged against her.\u201d The Appellate Division affirmed, concluding that a CPL 30.30 dismissal could never constitute a \u201cfavorable termination.\u201d We reverse and deny summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">While the tort of malicious prosecution protects against the consequences of wrongful prosecution, public policy favors bringing criminals to justice, and accusers must be allowed room for benign misjudgments. The law therefore places a heavy burden on malicious prosecution plaintiffs, requiring that they establish four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">\u201c(1) the commencement or continuation of a criminal proceeding by the defendant against the plaintiff, (2) the termination of the proceeding in favor of the accused, (3) the absence of probable cause for the criminal proceeding and (4) actual malice\u201d <em>(Broughton v State of New York, </em>37 NY2d 451, 457, <em>cert denied sub nom. Schanbarger v Kellogg, </em>423 US 929).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">This appeal centers exclusively on the second element, and asks a narrow, novel question: whether a CPL 30.30 dismissal can constitute \u201ctermination of the proceeding in favor of the accused.\u201d We hold that it can.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">As a general rule, under the common law any final termination of a criminal proceeding in favor of the accused, such that the proceeding cannot be brought again, qualifies as a favorable termination for purposes of a malicious prosecution action <em>(see, </em>Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 659-660; Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 119, at 874 [5th ed]). Our cases have long embraced this rule as the law of New York. As we stated in <em>Robbins v Robbins </em>(133 NY 597, 599), a criminal proceeding is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>terminated, favorably to the accused when \u201cthere can be no further proceeding upon the complaint or indictment, and no further prosecution of the alleged offense.\u201d Moreover, it makes no \u201cdifference how the criminal prosecution is terminated, provided it is terminated, and at an end\u201d (133 NY, at 599-600; see <em>also, Burt v Smith, </em>181 NY 1, 5 [favorable termination is a prosecution that \u201cfinally ends in failure\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">A dismissal pursuant to CPL 30.30 falls squarely within <em>Robbins. </em>Once an accusatory instrument is dismissed on speedy trial grounds there can be no further prosecution of the offense. Indeed, other courts that have considered the issue have concluded that, for malicious prosecution purposes, a speedy trial dismissal is a favorable termination <em>(see, Vitellaro v Eagle Ins. Co., </em>150 AD2d 770 [2d Dept] [Rosenblatt, J., participating]; <em>Lenehan v Familo, </em>79 AD2d 73 [4th Dept], <em>appeal dismissed </em>54 NY2d 680; <em>Posr v Court Officer Shield </em># <em>207, </em>180 F3d 409 [2d Cir]; <em>Murphy v Lynn, </em>118 F3d 938 [2d Cir], <em>cert denied </em>522 US 1115; <em>Van v Grand Casinos of Miss., </em>724 So 2d 889 [Miss]; <em>Miller v Watkins, </em>200 Mont 455, 653 P2d 126; <em>Rich v Baldwin, </em>133 Ill App 3d 712, 479 NE2d 361).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The common law, however, also recognizes an exception to the general rule where termination of the criminal prosecution is inconsistent with the innocence of the accused. A termination is not considered favorable, for example, if the charge is dismissed \u201cbecause of misconduct on the part of the accused or in his behalf for the purpose of preventing proper trial\u201d (Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 660 [b]). We applied that exception in <em>Halberstadt v New York Life Ins. Co. </em>(194 NY 1, 8-14), concluding that dismissal of a prosecution because the accused had fled the jurisdiction was not a favorable termination. We noted that an accused should not benefit where his own misconduct \u201cprevented a consideration of the merits\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 11; <em>see also, </em>Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 661 [no favorable termination where criminal proceeding dismissed because of the \u201cimpossibility or impracticality of bringing the accused to trial\u201d]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">A termination is not favorable to the accused, additionally, if the charge is withdrawn or the prosecution abandoned pursuant to a compromise with the accused. Indeed, it is hornbook law that \u201cwhere charges are withdrawn or the prosecution is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>terminated * * * by reason of a compromise into which [the accused] has entered voluntarily, there is no sufficient termination in favor of the accused\u201d (Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 119, at 875 [5th ed]). Accordingly, in <em>Hollender v Trump Vil. Coop. </em>(58 NY2d 420), we held that an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal \u2014 a disposition that requires the consent of the prosecutor, the accused and the court <em>(see, </em>CPL 170.55 [1])\u2014 does not qualify as a favorable termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Similarly, if the charge is withdrawn or dismissed out of mercy requested or accepted by the accused, there is no favorable termination. Mercy, it is reasoned, would not be appropriate if the prosecution were groundless; rather, mercy \u201cimplies a belief in the guilt of the accused or at the least in the possibility that he may be guilty\u201d (Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 660 [c], comment f). Again, applying the exception to the common-law rule, we have held that the dismissal of a prosecution in the interest of justice did not constitute a favorable termination <em>(see, Ward v Silverberg, </em>85 NY2d 993, 994).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">While defendants rely heavily on two of our precedents\u2014 <em>MacFawn v Kresler </em>(88 NY2d 859) and <em>Heaney v Purdy </em>(29 NY2d 157) \u2014 both decisions are distinguishable from the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In <em>MacFawn v Kresler (supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 860), we held in a summary judgment context that the dismissal \u2014 without prejudice \u2014 of the information for insufficiency under CPL 170.30 (1) (a) and 170.35 (1) (a) could not serve as the basis for a malicious prosecution claim. We noted that the dismissal without prejudice was not a final termination of the action. Rather, the People remained \u201cat liberty to amend the information to correct the deficiency\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 860).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Far from controlling the case at hand, <em>MacFawn </em>simply held that a plaintiff in a malicious prosecution action must show, as a threshold matter, that the criminal proceeding was <em>finally </em>terminated. Indeed, it is well settled that any \u201cdisposition of the criminal action which does not terminate it but permits it to be renewed * * * cannot serve as a foundation for the [malicious prosecution] action\u201d (Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 119, at 874 [5th ed]). This is so for two reasons. First, \u201cit cannot be known that the prosecution was unjust or unfounded until it is terminated\u201d <em>(Robbins v Robbins, </em>133 NY 597, 599, <em>supra). </em>Second, if a malicious prosecution action is allowed to proceed before the final termination of the underlying action, \u201cthere might be two conflicting determinations as to the same transaction\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 599).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>A dismissal without prejudice qualifies as a final, favorable termination if the dismissal represents \u201cthe formal abandonment of the proceedings by the public prosecutor,\u201d for instance, by the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>(Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 659 [c] and comment <em>e; see also, Stevens v Redwing, </em>146 F3d 538, 546 [8th Cir]; <em>Joiner Ins. Agency v Principal Cas. Ins. Co., </em>684 So 2d 1242 [Miss]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>MacFawn, </em>however, there was no indication that the prosecutor abandoned charges against the accused. Accordingly, we held that the dismissal without prejudice was not final and thus could not support a malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Similarly, in <em>Heaney v Purdy </em>(29 NY2d 157, 158), after a three-hour \u201ctrial,\u201d an Ontario court refused to exercise jurisdiction over an accused who had been charged with trespass. This Court held that there was no favorable termination because, under the specific circumstances at issue, \u201cthe termination of the proceeding was so inconclusive that it shows an absence of prosecution\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 159).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Here, by contrast, the dismissal under CPL 30.30 was a final judgment which cannot be revived by re-filing the accusatory instrument. Nor was the action terminated as a result of a settlement, mercy or any misconduct by plaintiff. The prosecution terminated in a manner not inconsistent with plaintiffs innocence. The CPL 30.30 dismissal was sought and granted as a matter of statutory right based on the prosecutor\u2019s inaction. Plaintiff, the record reflects, was eager to vindicate herself. On several occasions her attorney reminded Banagan of pending pretrial procedures and court appearances. Despite plaintiffs urgings, however, Banagan failed to oppose the CPL 30.30 motion to dismiss and ignored all other requests. Banagan\u2019s bald statement that this failure was the consequence of his conducting a trial out of town and not due to any \u201cdetermination that probable cause was lacking\u201d \u2014 the only proof offered in support of defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion \u2014 is insufficient to overcome the general rule that a dismissal on speedy trial grounds is a favorable termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">There is, to be sure, language in some of our more recent cases implying that a dismissal, in order to qualify as a favorable termination, must affirmatively indicate the innocence of the accused. In <em>MacFawn, </em>for example, the Court described a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>favorable termination as one that \u201cinvolves the merits and indicates the accused\u2019s innocence\u201d <em>(MacFawn v Kresler, supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 860). Similarly, in <em>Ward, </em>the Court stated the test as whether \u201ca judicial determination of the accused\u2019s innocence on the merits of the action has been made\u201d <em>(Ward v Silverberg, supra, </em>85 NY2d, at 994; <em>see also, Hollender v Trump Vil. Coop., supra, </em>58 NY2d, at 425-426). That language, however, was not necessary to the resolution of those cases, which were decided in accordance with the settled principles described above.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">We reject the notion \u2014 as contrary to the common law and our longstanding precedents \u2014 that, under the particular circumstances here, plaintiff must demonstrate innocence in order to satisfy the favorable termination prong of the malicious prosecution action. Indeed, requiring that a plaintiff demonstrate innocence after a prosecution has been dismissed on speedy trial grounds would have the anomalous effect of barring recovery for an innocent accused whose prosecution was abandoned for lack of merit. Moreover, an individual improperly charged with a criminal offense would be compelled to waive speedy trial rights in order to preserve a civil remedy. The law should not require one who is falsely and maliciously accused to proceed to trial \u2014 incurring additional financial and emotional costs \u2014 as a prerequisite to recovery for malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Our holdings in <em>Ward, Hollender </em>and <em>MacFawn </em>stand only for the proposition that dispositions inconsistent with innocence, like the ones in those cases, cannot be viewed as favorable to the accused. While there may be instances where a malicious prosecution defendant can show that the circumstances surrounding a CPL 30.30 dismissal are inconsistent with a plaintiff\u2019s innocence, no such circumstances are present on this record. Finally, it bears note that we are not called upon to, nor do we, consider any other element of a malicious prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>tion action that plaintiff must establish in order to recover against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\">. After the Trial Judge denied Jack Harvey\u2019s motion to dismiss the assault charges against him, he pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of disorderly conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. In <em>Halberstadt, </em>four of the eight Judges who made up the Court concurred in dismissal of the action on the alternative ground that there had been no prosecution of the accused at all (194 NY, at 14).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">. If the prosecutor abandons the criminal proceedings but then subsequently re-institutes charges, the action has not been terminated favorably to the accused (Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 660 [d] and comment <em>g).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">. Nor did <em>Ryan v New York Tel. Co. </em>(62 NY2d 494, 502) establish a per se rule regarding 30.30 dismissals <em>(see, </em>257 AD2d 239, 241). In <em>Ryan, </em>this Court held that plaintiff was collaterally estopped from suing for wrongful discharge and other related claims based on an administrative determination that he had stolen company property. We held that collateral estoppel applied even though criminal charges against plaintiff had been dismissed in the interest of justice, noting that such a dismissal did not establish plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinnocence of the charges\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 504). In addition, the Court dismissed plaintiffs malicious prosecution claim because the administrative determination provided probable cause to prosecute <em>(id., </em>at 503). <em>Ryan </em>did not address whether a dismissal in the interest of justice constitutes a \u201cfavorable termination\u201d for the purposes of a malicious prosecution action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b302-6\">Rosenblatt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae5\">(concurring). The Chief Judge has written a cogent decision resolving a conundrum that has beset the law of malicious prosecution: the appropriate test for determining what is a \u201cfavorable termination.\u201d The Court, I believe, has articulated the test correctly, holding that the speedy trial dismissal was \u201cnot inconsistent with innocence\u201d and therefore constituted a favorable termination. I write separately only to emphasize that this test is far more sensible than the \u201cindicative of innocence\u201d test articulated in <em>MacFawn v Kresler </em>(88 NY2d 859).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Over a century ago, this Court established the general rule that a criminal prosecution terminated \u201cfavorably\u201d if the accused was not convicted and \u201cthere [could] be no further proceeding upon the complaint or indictment, and no further prosecution of the alleged offense\u201d <em>(Robbins v Robbins, </em>133 NY 597, 599). A primary purpose behind the favorable termination element was (and still is) to ensure against \u201cconflicting determinations\u201d and parallel litigation in criminal and civil actions <em>(see, Robbins v Robbins, </em>supra; <em>see also, Hauser v Bartow, </em>273 NY 370, 375; Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 119, at 874 [5th ed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Criminal cases that do not end in convictions are not always considered \u201cfavorable\u201d to the accused. For example, a criminal case is not terminated \u201cfavorably\u201d if the prosecutor abandons it because of misconduct by the accused preventing successful prosecution, or pursuant to a compromise between the accused and the complainant, or out of mercy requested or accepted by the accused <em>(see, </em>Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 660 [a]-[c]). This all makes good sense under an estoppel rationale: we foreclose malicious prosecution actions by those who carry even an aroma of guilt. The estoppel rationale is not applicable, however, to an innocent plaintiff who was relieved of criminal charges in a neutral manner, i.e., one that carried no indicia of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The \u201cnot inconsistent with innocence\u201d rule is the equivalent of the <em>Robbins </em>rule (together with estoppel-type exceptions). For the most part, New York jurisprudence conformed to this rule until <em>Heaney v Purdy </em>(29 NY2d 157). There, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>held that a malicious prosecution action could \u201cnot be maintained if the prior prosecution [did] not \u2018fairly impl[y] lack of a reasonable ground for the prosecution\u2019 \u201d <em>(Heaney v Purdy, supra, </em>at 160 [quoting <em>Halberstadt v New York Life Ins. Co., </em>194 NY 1, 11]). Subsequent decisions relied on the <em>Heaney </em>majority\u2019s articulation of the favorable termination standard and held that a termination could not be deemed favorable unless it affirmatively <em>indicated innocence (Hollender v Trump Vil. Coop., </em>58 NY2d 420, 425-426 [quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 660, comment a]; <em>see also, Ward v Silverberg, </em>85 NY2d 993, 994; <em>MacFawn v Kresler, </em>88 NY2d 859, 860, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The transformation of the formulation from <em>Robbins v Robbins </em>(133 NY 597, 599, <em>supra) </em>to <em>Hollender v Trump Vil. Coop. </em>(58 NY2d 420, 425-426, <em>supra) </em>resulted at least in part by references to infelicitous language in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 660, comment <em>a, </em>to the effect that favorable terminations are to be equated only with dispositions that \u201cindicate the innocence of the accused\u201d <em>(see, Hollender v Trump Vil. Coop., supra). </em>The comment, however, is better read in conjunction with its heading (\u201cTermination <em>inconsistent with guilt\u201d) </em>and the actual provisions of section 660 to which the comment applies (Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 660 [a]-[c]). In my view, the Restatement does not purport to read into the favorable termination element a requirement that the underlying criminal termination \u201cindicates innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The <em>pre-Heaney </em>\u201cnot inconsistent with innocence\u201d rule, designed to exclude only undeserving plaintiffs, had thus become transformed into the \u201cindicative of innocence\u201d rule. Dissenting in <em>Heaney, </em>Judge Breitel (joined by Judge Jasen) cautioned against this transformation. He argued that a neutral criminal termination, inconsistent with guilt, should continue to satisfy the favorable termination element <em>(see, Heaney v Purdy, 29 </em>NY2d 157, 161, n, <em>supra). </em>The \u201cindicative of innocence\u201d rule carried the potential for sweeping out claims by deserving plaintiffs whose criminal cases were disposed of in ways that carried not even the slightest indication of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">An \u201cindicative of innocence\u201d test saddles plaintiffs with a burden that is often difficult if not impossible to prove in speedy trial dismissal cases. Recognizing, this, courts strained to squeeze speedy trial dismissals into the \u201cindicative of innocence\u201d pigeon hole <em>(see, e.g., Loeb v Teitelbaum, 77 </em>AD2d 92, 101). Too often it is a poor fit. Most of the time, speedy trial dismissals do not indicate innocence. Unless supported by reasons set forth on the record \u2014 a rarity \u2014 a speedy trial dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>missal generally indicates nothing as to guilt or innocence. Typically, those dismissals are neutral and do not suggest guilt, innocence or anything other than the fact that the time ran out.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Indeed, some speedy trial motions are fiercely resisted. A review of the large body of CPL 30.30 decisional law reveals as much. Speedy trial dismissals may be the product of under-staffing, imperfect case management, inefficiencies in detainer filings or interstate rendition, turnover of personnel, bureaucratic delay, misunderstanding, police department or prison delays, misplaced files, demands of other States or jurisdictions or the difficulty of tracking witnesses \u2014 or simply allowing a weak case to languish \u2014 to name a few of the more common reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Moreover, a speedy trial dismissal, particularly when unresisted, may reflect a prosecutor\u2019s belief that the case cannot be proved. But even then the reasons are not necessarily indicative of innocence. In prosecuting a possessory crime, for example, the District Attorney may drop the case, unconvinced of defendant\u2019s ever having possessed the contraband at all, or because the police seized it from defendant\u2019s possession in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Or perhaps because the contraband was lost somewhere in the evidence room, or mistagged.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">By virtue of the Court\u2019s endorsement of the \u201cnot inconsistent with innocence\u201d test in speedy trial cases, New York courts will no longer have to engage in jurisprudential gymnastics or semantics. Nor will courts have to contemplate the prospect of an exotic branch of jurisprudence in which Assistant District Attorneys are summoned to appear at trials or depositions to answer (or not answer) questions as to their subjective opinions relating to the degree of guilt of the accused, the strength of the case, their work habits and philosophies, their attitudes toward particular crimes or the reasons they abided or resisted a speedy trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The \u201cindicative of innocence\u201d rule potentially stood to bar recovery by deserving plaintiffs whose criminal cases were dismissed on neutral grounds. As a practical matter, the cases that satisfy a malicious prosecution claim are often weak from a prosecutorial standpoint. Given that prosecutors generally will be more likely to neglect a weak case than a strong one, the \u201cindicative of innocence\u201d standard creates a paradox:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In case number one, a complainant bent on malice causes the arrest of a wholly innocent person based on trumped up al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>legations. The accused wants vindication, but the prosecution drags its feet, believing the case lacks merit. Eventually, the criminal court grants the accused\u2019s speedy trial dismissal motion. In case number two, a more credible complainant provides the prosecution with a meritorious case more likely to sustain the prosecutor\u2019s interest. Accordingly, the prosecutor takes it to trial \u2014 but the jury acquits.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Under the \u201cindicative of innocence\u201d rule, only the second accused gains a \u201cfavorable\u201d termination. The first does not, even though the accusation was trumped up and malicious. The more far-fetched the accusation, the greater the likelihood the case will be dismissed on speedy trial grounds, thereby dooming the accused\u2019s subsequent malicious prosecution suit. In the end, the most wrongly maligned are the least likely to gain civil redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The Court obviously is sensitive to this paradox and rectifies its consequences by applying the \u201cnot inconsistent with innocence\u201d test. In that manner, a potentially deserving plaintiff whose criminal case was dismissed by a neutral speedy trial termination satisfies the favorable termination element.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judge Rosenblatt concurs in a separate concurring opinion; Judge Levine taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
