Before the expiration of that time the default of the defendant had been taken. Immediately thereafter he moved to set aside the default, and the court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The stipulation being oral\u2014besides having been given by the plaintiff himself instead of by his attorney\u2014was doubtless without force and not binding; but in relying upon it, as they certainly did, the defendants, it seems to us, committed no more than an act of inadvertence and excusable neglect, upon a showing of which the court was fully justified in setting aside the default. To hold otherwise would be to deprive the defendants of the very remedy that section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure was intended to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
