N. Gillett, governor of the state of California, ... do hereby commute the sentence of the said Frank S. Wilson . . . provided that if said Frank S. Wilson shall thereafter be convicted of any felony, this commutation shall become void, and in addition to the sentence imposed for such felony, he shall serve the remainder of the sentence cut short by this order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">By section 1, article VII, of the constitution, \u201cThe Governor shall have the .power to grant reprieves, pardons, and commutations of sentence, after conviction, for all offenses except treason and cases of impeachment, upon such conditions and with such restrictions and limitations, as he may think proper. \u2019 \u2019 It was held in <em>Ex parte Marks, </em>64 Cal. 29, [49 Am. Rep. 684, 28 Pac. 109], that the Governor is authorized to grant pardons upon conditions stated which may be defeated</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>by a breach of such conditions. In a note to <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntire, </em>59 Am. Dec. 566, 572, 576, numerous cases are cited showing that it is well settled that the executive may grant conditions to a pardon. Such conditions as the following are among others which may be imposed: That the prisoner refrain from the use of intoxicating liquors; that he shall use all proper exertions to support his mother and sister; that he shall not be convicted of any offense against the criminal laws of the state. Cases are cited where it was held that if the prisoner fails to perform the condition, the original sentence remains in full force and may be carried into execution\".</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The constitution makes no distinction between the power to grant pardons and commutations of sentence. The rule above stated applies equally to pardons and commutations of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
