The answer admitted the execution of the note and then proceeded as follows: \u201cAdmits that the principal and interest on said promissory note remains wholly unpaid. Denies that same is now due and owing, or that any amount is now due and owing.\u201d The admission contained in the first clause of the paragraph quoted was an admission of the ultimate fact as to the nonpayment of the note. The second clause in its terms of denial stated a mere conclusion of law which should be disregarded. <em>(Penrose </em>v. <em>Winter, </em>135 Cal. 289, [67 Pac. 772], and cases therein cited.) Attached to defendant\u2019s answer was a set of allegations, which were termed a cross-complaint. In this portion of the answer the execution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>promissory notes was again admitted, but it was alleged, in effect, that the same were given in exchange for one thousand two hundred shares of stock in the plaintiff corporation; and the further consideration that \u2018 plaintiff would extend certain favors to defendant herein because of such purchase. \u2019 \u2019 It was further alleged that the plaintiff had agreed \u201cin case said execution of such notes above referred to by defendant was had,\u201d that a certain trade discount certificate should be issued which provided that for a period of ten years the defendant should be entitled to a five per cent discount from catalogue prices of merchandise purchased from the plaintiff. It was then alleged that, after the certificate had been issued, the privilege therein stated was repudiated by the plaintiff, and \u201cthat plaintiff ever since has refused and still refuses to allow defendant discounts as set forth in said certificate.\u201d In another allegation it is said that a further consideration \u201cas an inducing cause to secure the two notes,\u201d was that the defendant was promised a catalogue showing prices of goods for sale by the plaintiff, which catalogue was never furnished. It was then alleged that an agent of the plaintiff, at the time of the execution of the notes, represented to defendant that the corporation was a \u201cstrong corporation, and within eighteen months or thereabouts would pay dividends.\u201d The allegation follows that the representations were false and untrue, and were intended to deceive the defendant, and were relied upon by him, and that they did deceive him and result in his damage. If it was the intention of appellant to state a cause of action for damages in his alleged cross-complaint, he failed to do so, for nowhere does it appear by any of his allegations as to what the value of the shares of stock received by him was, or what was the value of the alleged privileges which he claims to have been denied the right to enjoy. The allegations of the answer are wholly insufficient to state a cause of action for damages, and so also are they insufficient to support a judgment of rescission. Nowhere among the allegations is it in any wise alleged or shown that the defendant ever tendered back the certificates of stock received by him. For aught that appears, those shares may be of great value. And it is very correctly argued by the respondent that, even had the answer been complete in the essential last referred to, there is no showing of vigilance on the part of the defendant in asserting any right to rescind the contract, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>any excuse for the long delay which had occurred at the time this action was commenced. The promissory note was dated in January, 1912. This action was commenced on March 30, 1914. By his own allegations defendant shows that whatever repudiation there was by the plaintiff of the alleged rights granted under the certificate of discount, that repudiation took place \u201cimmediately after the issuance of said certificate.\u201d The answer having admitted all of the material matters contained in the complaint, and having failed to state any legal defense thereto, the ruling- of the trial judge granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Conrey, P.
