Tried below before the Hon. J. M. Hall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZl\">This suit was brought by the appellees, Thos. Goggan &amp; Bro., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>against H. M. Dillard to recover the value of a piano and rent for the same. The property was sequestered by the plaintiff. The appellants, S. J. Siddall and J. J. Lumpkin, became the sureties on the replevy bond filed by Dillard and sought to make themselves parties defendant to the suit, setting up that an agreement between plaintiff\u2019s attorney and Dillard had been filed in the cause, by which it was agreed that all answers of Dillard should be withdrawn, \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is just,\u201d and that they take judgment against Dillard for three hundred and fifty dollars or the value of the property; that they were not parties to the agreement; that Dillard promised them to defend the suit; that they should not be bound by the confession of judgment; that the defendant had no right in law or equity to \u201ccollude\u201d with plaintiffs and their attorney; that Dillard was insolvent, and that the\" agreement was wickedly, unlawfully and fraudulently entered into.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b741-6\">There was no denial of the justness of the plaintiff\u2019s claim nor any specific allegation setting up a valid defense against it. Exceptions to the plea of the sureties were sustained, and it was stricken out on the ground that it did not deny the justness of plaintiff\u2019s claim or set up any defense to the same permitted by law. The sureties excepted and afterward moved to set aside and reform the judgment, which motion being overruled, they again excepted. There were other allegations in the plea filed by the sureties not deemed necessary to mention, in view of the opinion. The charge with reference to the attorney of Dillard urged by the sureties will be apparent from the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b741-7\">The court having stricken out the answer of said sureties, and \"they not having amended, and defendant Dillard having withdrawn his defenses and consented to plaintiffs taking judgment against him, the court concludes, as a matter of law, that plaintiffs were entitled to a judgment against defendant Dillard as per agreement, and against the sureties on the replevin bond, .as per the evidence adduced on the trial and shown by the records and pleadings in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b741-8\">Appellants\u2019 assignment of error contains six grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b741-9\">1. The court erred in striking out and holding for naught the \u2022answer of appellants, filed August 20, 1885, because the same showed fraud and collusion between plaintiffs and defendant Dillard, in attempting to make said Lumpkin and Siddall pay said three hundred and fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b741-10\">2.

The first and second grounds of error assigned relate to the ruling of the court in striking out the exceptions and answers of appellants to the \u201cagreement and confession of judgment\u201d entered into by appellees and Dillard, and which had been filed in the case on the eighth day of August, 1885. It is insisted by appellants that their answers showed \u201cfraud and collusion\u201d between appellees and Dillard, the defendant in the writ of sequestration and the principal in the replevy bond upon which appellants are sureties. From the answer it is evident that the charge of fraud and collusion is predicated upon the fact that after defendant Dillard had entered into the replevy bond for the piano, stool and cover, with appellants as sureties thereon, he and appellees, acting by their attorney, entered into an agreement in writing to the effect, that appellee\u2019s demand is just, that defendant Dillard withdraws all his defenses, and consents that judgment be entered on his replevy bond, and that appellees pay all costs. It is alleged in the answer that the day after the writ of sequestration was levied, Dillard sold and delivered the piano to S. H. Lumpkin in payment for his professional services in defending this suit, and that the agreement between appellees and Dillard was entered into secretly and without their knowledge or consent, and was made with intent upon the part of appellees and Dillard to extort from appellants three hundred and fifty dollars, or to compel S. H. Lumpkin, attorney for Dillard and attorney for appellants, to deliver up the piano.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">It is not alleged in appellants\u2019 answer that the admission of Dillard that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 demand is just\u201d is untrue, nor is it alleged in their answer that Dillard had any defense, legal or equitable, to appellees\u2019 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Appellants had the right to absolve themselves from all liability in the premises by delivering the property to the sheriff of the county, at any time within ten days after rendition of the judgment. (Rev. Stats., art. 4502.) We conclude that the answer of appellants contained no allegations that entitled them to be relieved from the consequences of the agreement and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>fession of judgment entered into by their principal, Dillard, and that the court did not err in striking out the answer.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AZO4\">Report adopted October 25, 1887.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Defendant Dillard having withdrawn all answers and defenses and confessed judgment in favor of appellees, and appellants\u2019 \u00a1answer having been stricken out, the court did not err in rendering judgment for three hundred and fifty dollars, the value of the property as fixed in the replevy bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The record does not sustain the fourth ground of error assigned. The conclusions of fact and law filed by the court show that the judgment was rendered against Dillard on his withdrawal of all defenses and confession of judgment, and against appellants on the replevy bond, their answer having been stricken out, and they not having filed any other pleading. There was no request for other conclusions, nor was there exception to those found.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">It appears from the explanation of the trial judge, endorsed upon appellants\u2019 bill of exception taken to the refusal of the court to give time to make application for continuance, that when the case was called for trial plaintiffs\u2019 attorney announced ready for trial, defendant Dillard was not present, and appellants announced not ready. Attorney for appellees informed the court that he had filed exceptions to appellants\u2019 answer, and asked permission to present them, which -iyas granted. The court sustained the exceptions and struck out the answer, and appellants did not take leave to amend. Defendant Dillard having withdrawn all his pleadings, there was nothing to support an application for continuance. (Rules Dist. Court, No. 25.) The sixth ground of error assigned is too general to require consideration. (Supreme Court Rules, No. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">We find no error in the record of which appellants can complain, and it is our opinion that the judgment. of the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
