Assignment eor Benefit of Creditors.\u2014When an assignment which purports to have been made for the benefit of creditors, by an insolvent! shows by its terms an intention to assign under the statute, and there is no provision in it indicating a design to make a partial assignment! except that the instrument after its specific designation of property conveyed, does not declare that it is all the property subject to the payment of debts, the law will presume an intention to convey all. This construction is based on the terms of the statute, which declares that such an assignment, however expressed, shall be construed to pass the entire estate, \u201cwhether specified therein or not.\u201d This case distinguished from Donoho v. Fish Bros., 58 Texas, 167.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>2.

Tried below before the Hon. W. H. Blackburn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">T. P. Lockhart, by deed of assignment conveyed his property to S. W. Miller, for the benefit of such of his creditors as would consent to accept their proportionate share of his estate and release him. Miller immediately qualified as assignee according to law, and took possession of the property assigned. Mcllhenny Company afterwards caused an attachment to issue and had it levied on the property in Miller\u2019s possession. Miller filed affidavit and bond for the trial of the right of property. McHhenny Company alleged on the trial that the property was conveyed to Miller to defraud Lockhart\u2019s creditors, etc. Miller alleged that the property was conveyed to him in good faith, for the benefit of such of Lockhart\u2019s creditors as would accept and release their claims, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">The deed conveyed goods, wares and merchandise of the value of three thousand five hundred dollars, about three hundred and fifty dollars in notes and accounts belonging to the late firm of Lockhart &amp; Wheat, one safe, one show case and scales worth one hundred and twenty-five dollars, and two hundred bushels of corn, to S.

Fish, 58 Texas, 167; Parsons on Contracts, volume 2, p. 504, 506, sixth edition; Id., 515, 516; Id., volume 3, p. 13, Burrill on Assignments, 354, second edition; Id., 377; Id., 392, 393.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>On their proposition that the defendant claiming the property in controversy as assignee for the benefit of creditors, must show that there are other creditors who had accepted the benefits of the assignment and filed their claims within the time provided for acceptances, else plaintiffs would have a right to recover the-amount of their claims or the value of the property in the hands of the assignee, cited Keating v. Vaughn, 61 Texas, 518; Revised Statutes, Appendix, page 8, sections 7, 8; W. R. and J. M. Caton v. C. C. Jones et al., 21 Texas, 788; Burrell on Assignments, second edition, 2 page 241.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-7\"><em>Harris &amp; </em>Saunders, for appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgK\">cited Acts of 1879, chapter 53, page 57, sections 1, 3-10.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b388-8\">Stayton, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A0W\">The assignment in this case, from the provisions contained in the deed through which it was-made, was intended to be in compliance with the act of March 24, 1879, and the amendments thereto, and, while it does not in terms declare that the property enumerated in it is all that the assignor owned at the time, except such as was exempt from forced sale, yet, loooking to the whole instrument, we are of the opinion that it must be considered a statutory assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">There is nothing which restricts its operation upon all the property owned by the assignor, and being intended as a statutory assignment, by operation of the statute, it passed all of the assignor\u2019s property subject to forced sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">The statute provides: \u201cThat every assignment made by an insolvent debtor, or in contemplation of' insolvency for the benefit of his creditors, shall provide, except as herein otherwise provided, for a distribution of all his real and personal estate other than that which is by law exempt from execution, among all his creditors in proportion to their respective claims, and, however made or expressed, shall have the effect aforesaid, and shall be construed to pass all such estate whether specified therein or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">No question is made as to the insolvency of the assignor, and that he made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors can not be denied. The object of the statute, when such an assignment is made, is to compel a distribution of the proceeds of all the assignee\u2019s estate, real and personal, subject to the payment of debts, among his creditors under its provisions; and the express provision that such an assignment <em>\u201cshall be construed to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>pass all such estate, whether specified therein or not,\u201d </em>must be given the effect which its terms require.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AZ9\">Opinion delivered May 27, 1887.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">It was held in Donoho v. Fish Bros. (58 Texas, 167), that an assignment made by partners which only purported to carry the partnership property, and was otherwise restrictive upon its face, could not be aided by the statute and thus made to pass title to the real and personal property owned in separate right by each of the partners; for this would be to make a contract which the parties never intended to make. When, however, an instrument, on its face, shows an intention to make an assignment under the statute, if there is nothing in it, save the fact that the assignor, after enumerating property conveyed, does not state that this is all of his property subject to the payment of debts, from which an inference may be drawn that he intended to make only a partial assignment, then he will be presumed to have intended to convey what the statute declares his conveyance shall be construed to pass; and thus will the law aid the imperfect instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The court below did not err in admitting in evidence the deed of assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The law fixes the proportion of debts which must be paid before the insolvent can become entitled to a release, and it is not necessary that this be stipulated in the deed of assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">There is no error in the judgment and it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
