Because the petition for review was not timely filed, we vacate the judgment of the district court and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">On June 14, 2005, Marvin Erickson (Erickson) sent a verified letter to the Idaho Board of Registration of Professional Engineers and Professional Land Surveyors (Board)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that Alan Soderling (Soderling), a professional engineer, had violated several of the Board\u2019s rules of professional responsibility. At its regularly scheduled meeting in mid-September 2005, the Board voted to conduct an investigation into Erickson\u2019s complaint. The Board\u2019s executive director and primary investigator recused himself because of a prior relationship with Soderling\u2019s employer. The Board ultimately found another professional engineer who agreed to investigate the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-23\">Idaho Code \u00a7 54-1220(2) provides, \u201cAll charges, unless dismissed by the board as unfounded or trivial, or unless settled informally, shall be heard by the board within six (6) months after the date they were received at the board office unless such time is extended by the board for justifiable cause.\u201d Because of other commitments and scheduling difficulties, the engineer who agreed to investigate the complaint did not complete his investigation before the expiration of the six-month period specified in Section 54-1220(2). On March 2, 2006, the Board found that there was good cause for extending the six-month period and ordered \u201cthat the period be extended until such time as we exhaust the need for further investigation or negotiation of a Stipulation and Consent Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-24\">On April 21, 2006, Soderling moved to dismiss Erickson\u2019s complaint with prejudice on the ground that because the six-month period for holding a hearing had expired before the Board took action to extend it, the Board had no power to extend the period. Soderling asked that the complaint therefore be dismissed with prejudice. Erickson responded with a written objection to the motion and a supporting memorandum. On May 12, 2006, the Board issued an order dismissing Erickson\u2019s complaint. It did not state whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-25\">On June 5, 2006, Erickson submitted a motion for reconsideration along with a supporting memorandum. Soderling filed a written response to Erickson\u2019s motion. On June 10, 2006, the Board issued an order denying the motion for reconsideration..</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>On July 12, 2006, Erickson filed a petition for judicial review. Soderling moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that it was untimely because the time for filing the petition expired on July 10, 2006. After filing that motion, Soderling filed a motion to intervene in this action, which was granted. The court heard the motion to dismiss on November 1, 2006, and on November 9, 2006, it entered a decision and order denying the motion. The court held that the twenty-eight day period within which to file the petition for review did not begin to run until the order denying reconsideration was served by the Board on June 16, 2006, and therefore the petition for review was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The parties then litigated the merits of the appeal. In a memorandum decision entered on August 8, 2007, the district court held that the Board\u2019s interpretation of Idaho Code \u00a7 54-1220(2) was reasonable, that once the six-month period had expired the Board lost jurisdiction to hear Erickson\u2019s complaint, and that the Board had to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Soderling\u2019s motion. Erickson asked the district court to rule upon whether he could re-file his complaint. The district court held that because the Board\u2019s dismissal was not on the merits of the complaint, Erickson could re-file it. Soderling then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">We need not address the issues raised by Soderling on this appeal because this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. \u201cThe filing of a petition for judicial review within the time permitted by statute is jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Horne v. Idaho State University, </em>138 Idaho 700, 703, 69 P.3d 120, 123 (2003). \u201cPursuant to Rule 84(n) [of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure], the failure to timely file a petition for judicial review \u2018shall be jurisdictional and shall cause automatic dismissal of the petition for judicial review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Canyon County Bd. of Equalization v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., LLC, </em>143 Idaho 58, 62, 137 P.3d 445, 449 (2006). Even though none of the parties has raised the issue of jurisdiction on appeal, \u201c[t]he question of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised by the Court at any time <em>sua sponte.\u201d In re Quesnell Dairy, </em>143 Idaho 691, 693, 152 P.3d 562, 564 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The time for filing a petition for judicial review from the Board\u2019s decision was governed by Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5273(2), which provides, \u201cA petition for judicial review of a final order ... must be filed within twenty-eight (28) days of the issuance of the final order ... or, if reconsideration is sought, within twenty-eight (28) days after the decision thereon.\u201d The statute requires that if reconsideration of the final order is sought, the petition for judicial review must be filed within twenty-eight days after the decision on the reconsideration. In this case, the decision on the reconsideration was made on June 10, 2006. The twenty-eighth day after that decision was July 8, 2006, which was a Saturday. Erickson had until the following Monday, July 10, 2006, to file the petition for judicial review. <em>Cather v. Kelso, </em>103 Idaho 684, 652 P.2d 188 (1982); I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 73-108, 73-109, and 73-110. He did not file his petition for review until July 12, 2006, two days too late. Therefore, neither the district court nor this Court has jurisdiction, and the petition for review must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">In order to hold that the petition was timely in this case, the district court ruled that the decision on June 10, 2006, denying reconsideration was the final order; that the petition for review had to be filed within twenty-eight days of the \u201cissuance\u201d of that final order; that \u201cissuance\u201d meant \u201cservice\u201d; that the decision denying reconsideration was not served until June 16, 2006; and that the petition for review was therefore timely filed because Erickson had until July 14, 2006, to file it. The district court\u2019s analysis is clearly in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">First, the order denying reconsideration was not \u201cthe final order\u201d as that term is used in Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5273(2). The district court held that it was \u201cthe final order\u201d because it was entitled \u201cFinal Order.\u201d \u201cThe real character of a written instrument is to be judged by its contents and substance, not by its title.\u201d <em>Swinehart v. Turner, </em>36 Idaho 450, 452, 211 P. 558, 559 (1922); <em>accord Camp v. East Fork Ditch Co., Ltd., </em>137 Idaho 850, 867, 55 P.3d 304, 321 (2002); <em>Idah-Best, Inc. v. First Security Bank of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number><em>Idaho, N.A., </em>99 Idaho 517, 519, 584 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1978). The order dated June 10, 2006, was an order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">On June 5, 2006, the Board received Erickson\u2019s \u201cMotion for Reconsideration\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in which he moved \u201cfor reconsideration of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER issued by the Board of Registration of Professional Engineers and Professional Land Surveyors dated May 12, 2006.\u201d On June 10, 2006, the Board issued an order entitled \u201cFinal Order\u201d in which it denied the motion for reconsideration. The \u201cFinal Order\u201d stated, \u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, after reconsideration by the Board of the Petition for Reconsideration filed by Mr. Erickson in this matter, our decision to dismiss the complaint is affirmed.\u201d The order entitled \u201cFinal Order\u201d was clearly a decision on the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The district court held that the order of May 12, 2006, could be both a decision on reconsideration and the final order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The decision on the motion for reconsideration cannot be \u201cthe final order\u201d mentioned in Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5273(2). The statute provides, \u201cA petition for judicial review of a final order ... must be filed within twenty-eight (28) days of the issuance of the final order ... or, if reconsideration is sought, within twenty-eight (28) days after the decision thereon.\u201d The order denying reconsideration was certainly <em>a </em>final order in the sense it was appealable. The statute, however, refers to <em>\u201cthe </em>final order.\u201d The statute\u2019s use of the definite article \u201cthe\u201d rather than the indefinite article \u201ca\u201d indicates it was referring to a specific final order rather than to any order that was final in the sense it was appealable. <em>The </em>final order would be the initial final order, which in this ease is the order that Erickson sought to have reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">The statutory language \u201cor, if reconsideration is sought\u201d has to be reconsideration of the previously issued final order. If there was any question about that, Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5246(4) resolves it. That statute, entitled \u201cFinal Orders \u2014 Effectiveness of Final Orders,\u201d states: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by statute or rule, any party may file a motion for reconsideration of any final order issued by the agency head within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of that order. The agency head shall issue a written order disposing of the petition.\u201d The motion for reconsideration seeks <em>\u201creconsideration of any final order.\u201d </em>The final order must already have been issued when the motion for reconsideration is filed. An order denying reconsideration of the final order cannot also be the final order that the motion sought to have reconsidered. For the order denying reconsideration to also be the final order, it would have to be denying reconsideration of itself. Thus, the order issued on May 12, 2006, was \u201cthe final order\u201d under Section 67-5273(2), and the order issued on June 5, 2006, was the decision on the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">The order issued on May 12, 2006, meets the definition of a final order. An \u201corder\u201d \u201cmeans an agency action of particular applicability that determines the legal rights, duties, privileges, immunities, or other legal interests of one (1) or more specific persons.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5201(12). An order issued by the agency head is a final order. I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 67-5243(1) and 67-5246(l)-(3). In this ease, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Board was the agency head. I.C. \u00a7 67-5201(4). The order of May 12, 2006, was issued by the Board, and it dismissed Erickson\u2019s complaint. It was therefore \u201cthe final order\u201d as that term is used in Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5273(2). <em>See Westway Constr., Inc. v. Idaho Transp. Dept., </em>139 Idaho 107, 73 P.3d 721 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The district court also held that the word \u201cissuance\u201d means \u201cservice.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It stated that it was \u201cconvinced the word \u2018issuance\u2019 contemplates service of the order.\u201d Again, the district court erred. The prior version of the Administrative Procedure Act enacted in 1965 provided that a petition for judicial review must be filed \u201cwithin 30 days <em>after the service of </em>the final decision of the agency or, if a rehearing is requested within 30 days after the decision thereon.\u201d Ch. 273, \u00a7 15, 1965 Idaho Sess. Laws 701, 710 (emphasis added). In 1992, that code section was repealed, and the statute enacted in its place provided that the petition for judicial review must be filed \u201cwithin twenty-eight (28) days <em>of the issuance </em>o/the order or, if reconsideration is sought, within twenty-eight (28) days of the decision thereon.\u201d Ch. 263, \u00a7\u00a7 41 &amp; 45, 1992 Idaho Sess. Laws 783, 811-12 (emphasis added). The effect of the 1992 legislation was to change the commencement of the time period for filing a petition for judicial review from \u201cthe service of the final decision\u201d to \u201cthe issuance of the [final] order.\u201d When a statute is amended we presume that the legislature intended to change the meaning of the statute. <em>Athay v. Stacey, </em>142 Idaho 360, 366, 128 P.3d 897, 903 (2005); <em>DeRousse v. Higginson, </em>95 Idaho 173, 176, 505 P.2d 321, 324 (1973). Therefore, because the legislature changed \u201cservice\u201d to \u201cissuance,\u201d the word \u201cissuance\u201d clearly does not mean service. The Board\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order\u201d was issued on the date it was signed, May 12, 2006. That is the date of <em>issuance, </em>not the date of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The use of \u201cissuance\u201d or \u201cissue\u201d in other statutes also shows that those words do not mean or contemplate \u201cservice.\u201d The following are a few examples. Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5251(4) provides that before taking official notice of facts, \u201c[n]otiee ... must be provided before the <em>issuance </em>of any order that is based in whole or in part on facts or material noticed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Obviously, the statute does not require notice before the \u201cservice\u201d of the order, because that would be too late. The decision would already have been made. Both Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 67-5244(2)(a) and 67-5245(6)(a) require an agency head to <em>\u201cissue </em>a final order in writing.\u201d They are obviously not referring to \u201cserving\u201d the order. The original jurisdiction of this Court \u201cextends to the <em>issuance </em>of writs of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, habeas corpus, and all writs necessary or proper to the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 1-203 (emphasis added). This Court does not need jurisdiction to serve those writs. Idaho Code \u00a7 1-1607(3) provides that on non-judicial days, \u201cwrits of attachment, executions, injunctions and writs of prohibition may be <em>issued and served.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-310 and 6-320 provide that in the specified landlord-tenant litigation, \u201ca summons must be <em>issued, served </em>and returned as in other actions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Idaho Code 7-1509(1) provides that the evaluator under the Small Lawsuit Resolution Act \u201cshall <em>issue </em>a written, signed decision\u201d and that \u201c[t]he decision shall be <em>served </em>on the parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4530(1) provides that in extradition proceedings, the person arrested \u201cmay waive the <em>issuance and service </em>of the warrant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Idaho Code \u00a7 30-14-604 provides: \u201cAn order under subsection (a) of this section is effective on the date of <em>issuance. </em>Upon <em>issuance </em>of the order, the administrator <em>shall promptly serve </em>each person subject to the order with a copy of the order and a notice that the order has been entered.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Because the petition for judicial review was not filed within the time provided by Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5273(2), the district court did not have jurisdiction to hear the petition for judicial review, and we do not have jurisdiction to review the merits of the issues raised on appeal to this Court. Therefore, we vacate the judgment of the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>and dismiss this appeal. On remand, the district court shall dismiss the petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">There is one other issue we should address so that other litigants may not be misled. The Board included in both the final order and the order denying reconsideration the following statement regarding the time for filing a petition for judicial review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-5\">An appeal must be filed within twenty-eight (28) days (a) of the service date of this final order, (b) of an order denying a petition for reconsideration, or (c) the failure within twenty-one (21) days to grant or deny a petition for reconsideration, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">This statement is incorrect with respect to the time to appeal when there has not been a motion for reconsideration. It states that the time for appeal begins to run on \u201cthe <em>service date </em>of this final order.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As explained above, Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5273(2) provides that it begins to run on the date of the <em>issuance </em>of the final order, not the date of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Undoubtedly, the reason for this error is a mistake in the \u201cIdaho Rules of Administrative Procedure of the Attorney General.\u201d Rule 04.11.01.740.02(c) requires that every final agency order include or be accompanied by a statement in writing informing the parties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-8\">An appeal must be filed within twenty-eight (28) days (a) of the service date of this final order, (b) of an order denying petition for reconsideration, or (c) the failure within twenty-one (21) days to grant or deny a petition for reconsideration, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Likewise, Rule 04.11.01.791.02 states that the time for appeal is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-10\">Time. Pursuant to Section 67-5273, Idaho Code, a petition for judicial review of a final order in a contested case must be filed within twenty-eight (28) days:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-11\">a. Of the service date of the final order,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-12\">b. Of the denial of the petition for reconsideration, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-13\">c. The failure within twenty-one (21) days to grant or deny the petition for reconsideration. Both Rules state that, with respect to a final order, a petition for review must be filed within twenty-eight days after \u201cthe service date of the final order.\u201d These Rules are not in accord with Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5273(2). Although these Rules were adopted in 1993, they failed to take into account the 1992 statutory amendments. That error did not mislead Erickson in this case, however, because he had filed a motion for reconsideration. In that circumstance, he had to file his petition for judicial review \u201cwithin twenty-eight days after the decision thereon.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5273(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">We vacate the judgment of the district court and dismiss this appeal. The case is remanded to the district court with directions to dismiss the petition for judicial review. We award costs on appeal to the respondents.</p>\n<judges id=\"b885-18\">Justices BURDICK, J.
