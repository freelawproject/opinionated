Pro Tern.</author>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">Jennifer L. Blake (Blake) appeals from an order awarding summary judgment to Delbert L. Starr (Starr) in Blake\u2019s action to recover damages in a personal injury action. Starr was alleged to have injured Blake when the front end loader Starr was operating struck and ran over Blake while she was working as a flagger on an Ada County Highway District project. We affirm the order granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">I.FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">Blake was injured while working for Traffic Products &amp; Services (TPS), a subcontractor providing flagging service to the primary contractor, Idaho Sand and Gravel (ISG), on a construction site. Starr, an employee of ISG, was operating a Caterpillar model front end loader on the construction site, when the loader struck and injured Blake. Blake was struck from behind when Starr raised the bucket of the loader, apparently obstructing his ability to see objects and persons in front of him, and drove forward into and over Blake. Starr backed up the machine and ran over Blake a second time, dragging her along the ground until someone caught his attention. Blake was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">Blake filed suit against Starr to recover damages for her injuries. The district court granted summary judgment to Starr, ruling that Starr was exempt from liability under I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3). Blake timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-17\">II. ISSUES PRESENTED ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b876-18\">We are asked to address two issues on this appeal. First, did the district court err in holding that Starr was exempt from liability under I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3)? Second, is Starr entitled to an award for attorney fees on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b876-19\">III.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b876-20\">In an appeal from an order of summary judgment, this Court\u2019s standard of review is the same as the standard used by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Conway v. Sonntag, </em>141 Idaho 144, 146, 106 P.3d 470, 472 (2005). All disputed facts are to be construed liberally in favor of the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>If the evidence reveals no disputed issues of material fact, then only a question of law remains, over which this Court exercises free review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-21\">IV.ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b876-22\">1. Did district court err in holding Starr exempt from liability under I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3)?</p>\n<p id=\"b876-23\">A. Idaho\u2019s Worker\u2019s Compensation Law provides the exclusive remedy of employees against employers for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-24\">The Idaho Worker\u2019s Compensation Act (Act) provides employees a definite remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment. I.C. \u00a7 72-201; <em>Robison v. Bateman-Hall, Inc., </em>139 Idaho 207, 209, 76 P.3d 951, 953 (2003). In <em>Kolar v. Cassia County Idaho, </em>142 Idaho 346, 127 P.3d 962 (2005), this Court repeated that, with few exceptions, the Idaho legislature has removed all workplace injuries from \u201cprivate controversy,\u201d by crafting a system whereby \u201csure and certain relief\u2019 would be provided to injured workers regardless of fault. Id. at 351, 127 P.3d at 967; <em>see also Venters v. Sorrento, </em>141 Idaho 245, 248-49, 108 P.3d 392, 395-96 (2005). This relief is provided \u201cto the exclusion of every other remedy, proceeding, or compensation, except as is otherwise provided in the worker\u2019s compensation scheme.\u201d <em>Kolar, </em>142 Idaho at 351-52, 127 P.3d at 967-68. <em>See also </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-209(1);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I.C. \u00a7 72-211.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">It is undisputed that Blake and Starr were working within the normal course and scope of their employment. This case concerns the proper interpretation of the limited exception of third party tort liability set forth in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">B. Idaho Sand and Gravel is a category one statutory employer of Traffic Products &amp; Services employees, and therefore protected from tort suit by the exclusive remedy rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The Act provides a limited exception to the exclusive remedy rule, allowing an injured worker who is eligible for worker\u2019s compensation benefits to bring a civil action for damages against certain third parties. <em>Venters, </em>141 Idaho at 249, 108 P.3d at 396. Idaho Code \u00a7 72-223(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">\u201cThe right to compensation under this law shall not be affected by the fact that the injury, occupational disease or death is caused under circumstances creating in some person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages therefor, such person so liable being referred to as the third party. Such third party shall not include those employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code; nor include the ower or lessee of premises, or other person who is wtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on, but who, by reason of there being an independent contractor or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of the workmen there employed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">The Act \u201cspecifically excludes certain employers from third party liability.\u201d <em>Fuhriman v. State, Dept. of Transp., </em>143 Idaho 800, 804, 153 P.3d 480, 484 (2007). The plain language of I.C. \u00a7 72-223 refers to the term \u201cemployer\u201d which has a' specific definition under the Act. The previously established statutory definition of \u201cemployer\u201d is found in I.C. \u00a7 72-102(13)(a). As presented by this Court in <em>Fuhriman, </em>that definition has two categories. <em>Id. </em>Under the first category, a statutory employer \u201cmeans any person who has expressly or impliedly hired or contracted the services of another. It includes contractors and subcontractors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">This Court also explained in <em>Gonzalez v. Lamb Weston, Inc., </em>142 Idaho 120, 122, 124 P.3d 996, 998 (2005), that the term \u201cemployer\u201d is more broadly defined under the Idaho Worker\u2019s Compensation Laws than under the common law. \u201cAn employee may have more than one employer: the employer who directly hired the employee and a person or entity who, by statute, is also held to be the employer for the purposes of worker\u2019s compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court clarified the legal position of statutory employers by stating that while they \u201ccan be held liable for worker\u2019s compensation benefits, they also enjoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>immunity from liability for common law torts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In <em>Robison, </em>this Court held that a statutory employer was anyone who, by contracting or subcontracting out services, is liable to pay worker\u2019s compensation benefits if the direct employer does not pay those benefits. <em>Robison, </em>139 Idaho at 210-11, 76 P.3d at 954-55. In <em>Fuhriman, </em>this Court reviewed the proper approach to evaluating whether a party qualifies as a statutory employer in relation to Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 72-102(13)(a), 72-223(1) and 72-216. <em>Fuhriman, </em>143 Idaho at 804-05, 153 P.3d at 484-85. \u201cIn order to qualify as a category one statutory employer, the employer by contracting or subcontracting out services, must be liable to pay worker\u2019s compensation benefits if the direct employer does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 805, 153 P.3d at 485. (citing <em>Venters, </em>141 Idaho at 249, 108 P.3d at 396). \u201cThe Court has summarized the I.C. \u00a7 72-223 category one protection for employers as including \u2018employers who make use of a contractor\u2019s or subcontractor\u2019s employees.\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Blake concedes that because TPS complied with \u00a7 72-301 by procuring worker\u2019s compensation coverage, ISG \u201cmay be\u201d a third party exempt from suit. Blake argues, however, that the definition of employers in I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-216 and 72-223(1) are mutually exclusive. Blake contends that because TPS had complied with \u00a7 72-301, ISG is not one of the employers described in I.C. \u00a7 72-216. Blake questions whether ISG can qualify for third party exemption under I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1), concluding \u201cthis issue may be visited through a subsequent action directly against ISG.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">This Court has not held I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-216 and 72-223(1) to be mutually exclusive. To the contrary, this Court harmonized these provisions in <em>Venters, </em>stating that I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1) \u201cclearly excludes certain parties, known as statutory employers from third party liability. Such third party liability shall not include those employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code.\u201d <em>Venters, </em>141 Idaho at 249, 108 P.3d at 396. There is nothing ambiguous or contradictory in these provisions of the Act. ISG was an employer described in I.C. \u00a7 72-216 because it had under it a contractor (TPS) and ISG would have been liable to the contractor\u2019s employee (Blake) for worker\u2019s compensation benefits if the contractor had not provided coverage. <em>Gonzalez, </em>142 Idaho at 122, 124 P.3d at 998. Blake represents that TPS had complied with I.C. \u00a7 72-301 by providing worker\u2019s compensation benefits for its employees, and in her argument Blake states she was covered by TPS\u2019s insurance \u201cto the extent the worker\u2019s compensation system allows.\u201d If, as Blake argues, TPS did in fact comply with the provisions of I.C \u00a7 72-301, then ISG is immune from liability for Blake\u2019s injuries. <em>Id. </em>Under this Court\u2019s recent holdings and the plain language of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, ISG is a category one statutory employer of TPS\u2019s employees, and therefore protected from tort suit by the exclusive remedy rule. The parties agree that ISG and TPS had a contractual relationship at the time of the accident, and that both Blake and Starr were working within the normal course and scope of their employment. Because ISG \u201cexpressly ... contracted the services\u201d of TPS, it meets the definition of a statutory employer. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-102(13)(a). TPS was liable to its employees for employment related injuries. Because ISG is a statutory employer it would have had to pay worker\u2019s compensation benefits to Blake if TPS had not paid those benefits. <em>Fuhriman, </em>143 Idaho at 805, 153 P.3d at 485. Therefore, ISG is a statutory employer immune from third party liability under Idaho Code \u00a7 72-223(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">C. Idaho Sand and Gravel\u2019s immunity from suit is extended to its employees by I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">The Idaho legislature has expressly extended the employer\u2019s immunity from liability \u201cto the employer\u2019s surety and to all officers, agents, servants and employees of the employer or surety.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 72-209(3). In <em>White v. Ponozzo, </em>77 Idaho 276, 291 P.2d 843 (1955), White and Ponozzo Brothers, logging contractors, entered into a contract of employment agreement whereby White agreed to haul logs using his own truck and furnishing the gas, oil, mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>nance and repair necessary to keep the truck operational. <em>White, </em>77 Idaho at 278, 291 P.2d at 843. White received payment based on the amount of feet of lumber in the logs hauled. <em>Id. </em>A portion of this amount was deducted and paid to White as wages, the balance being paid to him for equipment hire. Evidence showed he had been paid on the basis of an eight-hour day. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 291 P.2d at 844. White was injured on his way to repair a failed transmission bearing in the truck he employed to haul logs, when his vehicle collided with a truck owned by Ponozzo Brothers, and driven by one of their employees, Dykes. <em>Id. </em>While White argued he was working for himself at the time of the accident because his contract required him to maintain his own truck at his own expense, the Court held that the accident arose out of and in the scope of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 279-80, 291 P.2d at 844-45. The Court also held that Dykes and White were co-employees, and that as such, Dykes was immune from tort liability. <em>Id. </em>at 280, 291 P.2d at 845. The Court analyzed the relationship employing basic principles of agency law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6C\">His acts and conduct became the acts and conduct of the employer, and the exemption from damages at law extended to the employer by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law is also by that act extended to co-employees through whom the employer acts. Thus <em>the co-employee becomes merged in the employer and is not a third person, </em>within the meaning of the compensation law, against whom a damage action may be maintained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Blake argues that she was not employed by the employer of Starr. It is said in her brief on appeal that \u201cJennifer would and must freely admit that if both she and Delbert Starr were both direct employees of ISG she would be unable to sue Starr because of the operation of \u00a7 72-209(3).\u201d Blake submits that Starr does not fall within \u00a7 72-209 \u201cboth logically and by the limiting language of the statute.\u201d Although Blake suggests that Starr\u2019s status is unrelated to his employer\u2019s relationship with her, she conceded at oral argument in the district court that an employer acts through its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The plain language of the statute encompasses every relationship in which the employer could be held liable through <em>respondeat superior. </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3). Allowing a suit against an employee of a statutory employer would create vicarious liability for the employer who is otherwise statutorily immune from liability. I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-209(1) and 72-223. In enacting the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, the legislature intended to \u201cprovide sure and certain relief for injured workmen ... regardless of fault and to the exclusion of every other remedy.\u201d <em>Page v. McCain Foods, Inc., </em>141 Idaho 342, 346, 109 P.3d 1084, 1088 (2005). Furthermore, the legislature intended \u201cnot only to provide relief for workers but also to protect industry by providing a limit on liability.\u201d <em>Meisner v. Potlatch Corp., </em>131 Idaho 258, 262, 954 P.2d 676, 680 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The purpose behind the various provisions of the worker\u2019s compensation law leads to the conclusion that the employee of a statutory employer and the employee of his employer\u2019s subcontractor are statutory co-employees under \u00a7 72-209(3). In accordance with the agency relationship set forth in <em>White, </em>Starr, an employee of ISG, \u201cbecomes merged\u201d in ISG and \u201cis not a third person, within the meaning of the compensation law, against whom a damage action may be maintained.\u201d <em>White, </em>77 Idaho at 280, 291 P.2d at 845. In other words, a statutory employer\u2019s immunity from suit under I.C. \u00a7 72-223 must logically and necessarily be extended to its employees through I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3) to fulfill the purpose of the Idaho Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. To hold otherwise would undermine the entire framework of liability and immunity provided by the worker\u2019s compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Accordingly, this Court concludes that the district court did not err in holding Starr exempt from liability under I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">2. Attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">Starr requests attorney fees on appeal under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-121. Under that statute, attorney fees will be awarded to the prevailing party when this Court is left with the abiding belief that the appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>brought or pursued frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. <em>Andrus v. Nicholson, </em>145 Idaho 774, 779, 186 P.3d 630, 635 (2008). When there are fairly debatable questions attorney fees are not awardable pursuant to this statute. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh P.A. v. Dixon, </em>141 Idaho 537, 542, 112 P.3d 825, 830 (2005). Cases of first impression ordinarily do not constitute an area of settled law. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Purco Fleet Services, Inc. v. Idaho State Dept. of Finance, </em>140 Idaho 121, 127, 90 P.3d 346, 352 (2004)). This appeal sought determination of an issue not heretofore expressly decided by this Court and therefore involved a case of first impression. The appeal was not brought frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Therefore we refrain from awarding Starr attorney\u2019s fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The district court did not err in holding Starr exempt from liability under I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3). The judgment entered by the district court is affirmed. Costs on appeal are awarded to the respondent; no attorney fees on appeal are awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b880-6\">Justices BURDICK, J. JONES, W.
