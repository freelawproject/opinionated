Hickman appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">On May 24, 2006, Appellant Dean Keith Hickman was gambling at Fort Hall Casino (the Casino). After another patron, Edward Cain, reported his wallet was missing, the Casino reviewed its video surveillance. The surveillance showed Hickman bending down to pick something up off of the floor near Cain, going to the restroom, and then walking out of the Casino. Hickman returned to the Casino in different clothing about two hours later. He was recognized, detained by security guards, and subsequently arrested for grand theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Hickman was convicted by a jury of grand theft. The district court imposed a ten year sentence on Hickman, with one year fixed. Hickman then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Hickman argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a ten year sentence, that his substantial rights were violated due to the variance existing between the charging document and the jury instructions, and that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction of grand theft. We will address each issue in turn. First, however, we will discuss the existence of a clerical error as it relates to Hickman\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">A. Clerical Error</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">The Amended Information and jury instructions support a conviction of grand theft pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(1)(b)(3), theft of financial transaction cards. However, the Judgment on Verdict and the Judgment/Order of Commitment state Hickman is convicted of grand theft pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(1)(b)(1), theft of property having value exceeding one thousand dollars. The reference to I.C. \u00a7 18 \u2014 2407(1)(b)(1) appears to be a clerical mistake which may be corrected by the district court. <em>See </em>I.C.R. 36. There is no indication from the record that either party brought this error to the attention of the district court. Nor does Hickman now argue the mistake mandates reversal. Therefore, we conclude the incorrect statutory reference in the Judgment on Verdict and in the Judgment/Order of Commitment is a clerical mistake. On this appeal, we review the case to determine whether a conviction pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(l)(b)(3) is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">Hickman argues the district court\u2019s sentence was excessive, and as such, an abuse of discretion. Hickman asserts that because the jury was not properly instructed as to the felony charge the jury verdict only supported a conviction and consequently, a sentence, for a misdemeanor. The State asserts that although Hickman is characterizing his claim as a sentencing error, the claim is actually that the jury instructions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">We agree Hickman\u2019s argument is a jury instruction issue and not a sentencing issue. The omission of an essential element in a jury instruction is reviewed for harmless error. <em>State v. Lovelace, </em>140 Idaho 73, 79, 90 P.3d 298, 304 (2004); <em>State v. Nath, </em>137 Idaho 712, 716-717, 52 P.3d 857, 861-62 (2002); <em>see also Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 10-11, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 1834, 144 L.Ed.2d 35, 47-48 (1999). Hickman relies heavily on <em>State v. Nunez, </em>133 Idaho 13, 19-21, 981 P.2d 738, 744-46 (1999), where this Court remanded the case for resentencing as a misdemeanor when the jury instructions only supported a misdemeanor conviction and not a felony conviction. However <em>Nath </em>was decided after <em>Nunez; </em>in <em>Nath </em>the omission of a material element from the jury instructions was reviewed for harmless error and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>remedy was to vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial. To determine whether the omission of an essential element from the jury instructions is harmless, this Court must determine \u201cwhether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead ter a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.\u201d <em>Lovelace, </em>140 Idaho at 79, 90 P.3d at 304; <em>see also Neder, </em>527 U.S. at 19, 119 S.Ct. at 1839, 144 L.Ed.2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">However, before we can reach the question of whether the omission was harmless, we must first determine whether we can review the omission at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>1. Fundamental error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Idaho Criminal Rules 30(b) states that \u201c[n]o party may assign as error the giving of or failure to give an instruction unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict____\u201d Hickman did not object to the jury instructions at the time of trial. Nonetheless, this Court will review fundamental errors in jury instructions even in the absence of an objection below. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>144 Idaho 743, 749, 170 P.3d 886, 892 (2007). To determine whether there was fundamental error, the Court must first determine whether there was any error, and, if so, then whether the error is fundamental. <em>Id. </em>at 748, 170 P.3d at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Jury instructions must correctly inform the jury as to the elements of the crime charged. <em>Anderson, </em>144 Idaho at 749, 170 P.3d at 892 (quoting <em>Middleton v. McNeil, </em>541 U.S. 433, 437, 124 S.Ct. 1830, 1832, 158 L.Ed.2d 701, 707 (2004)). \u201cWhen reviewing jury instructions, this Court must determine whether \u2018the instructions, as a whole, fairly and adequately present the issues and state the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Sheahan, </em>139 Idaho 267, 281, 77 P.3d 956, 970 (2003) (quoting <em>Silver Creek Computers, Inc. v. Petra, Inc., </em>136 Idaho 879, 882, 42 P.3d 672, 675 (2002)). An erroneous instruction is reversible error when the instructions, taken as a whole, \u201cmisled the jury or prejudiced a party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-17\">We agree with Hickman that Instruction No. 14 does not contain the elements necessary to prove grand theft. Theft occurs when \u201cwith intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or to a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner thereof.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-2403(1). Theft is divided into two degrees: grand theft and petit theft. I.C. \u00a7 18-2407. The statutory scheme lists specific actions or circumstances that constitute grand theft; all other theft is petit theft. <em>Id. </em>It is grand theft if the property taken consists of a financial transaction card. I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(l)(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-18\">Jury Instruction No. 14 encompasses the elements of petit theft, but does not include any element which would constitute grand theft.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the State argues there is no error because the jury was instructed that the prosecution must \u201cprove every material allegation contained in the Amended Information beyond a reasonable doubt____\u201d The Amended Information was included in the jury instructions and alleges Hickman \u201cwrongfully, took, obtained, or withheld a financial transaction card.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-20\">Even though the information accuses Hickman of taking a financial transaction card, we conclud\u00e9 that as a whole, the jury instructions misled the jury. The Verdict form asks the jury to answer whether Hickman is \u201cguilty or not guilty of Grand Theft.\u201d Instruction No. 14 sets forth what the State must prove in order to show Hickman is guilty of grand theft, and it erroneously omits an essential element. It further states if \u201ceach of the above has been proven beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>a reasonable doubt, you <em>must </em>find the defendant guilty of Theft.\u201d (Emphasis added). In this case, the jury instructions were unclear on whether it was necessary the State prove the property taken was a financial transaction card, and therefore, the jury instructions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Error is fundamental error if it \u201cso profoundly distorts the trial that it produces manifest injustice and deprives the accused of his fundamental right to due process.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>144 Idaho at 748, 170 P.3d at 891 (quoting <em>State v. Lavy, </em>121 Idaho 842, 844, 828 P.2d 871, 873 (1992) (internal quotations omitted)). Here, the omission of a material element in the jury instructions constitutes fundamental error. As we noted in Anderson, a jury instruction violates due process if it fails to give effect to the requirement that the State prove every element of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 749, 170 P.3d at 892. In this case, the State was not required to prove Hickman took a financial transaction card, which was a necessary element to support the grand theft conviction, and consequently, Hickman was denied due process. Therefore, although there was no objection made below, the error was fundamental and we will review it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\n<em>2. Harmless error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">We will only reverse a conviction for fundamental error, if that error was not harmless. The omission of an essential element from a jury instruction is not harmless when \u201cthe record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.\u201d <em>Lovelace, </em>140 Idaho at 79, 90 P.3d at 304; <em>see also Neder, </em>527 U.S. at 19, 119 S.Ct. at 1839, 144 L.Ed.2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Here, the omitted element was that the property taken was a financial transaction card. The jury concluded Hickman took or withheld property. Hickman was only accused of taking Cain\u2019s wallet and its contents. The evidence that the wallet contained financial transaction cards was uncontroverted. There is absolutely no evidence in the record that could rationally lead to a finding that the wallet did not contain financial transaction cards. Thus, we hold the omission of the element that the property taken be financial transaction cards is harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">C. Variance Between Charging Document and Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Hickman also asserts there was an impermissible variance between the Amended Information and the jury instructions because the jury instructions allowed the State to prove grand theft by proving that Hickman \u201ctook, obtained, or withheld any property, regardless of the value of the property or if the property was a financial transaction card.\u201d Consequently, Hickman contends, his substantial rights were affected because the jury was not required beyond a reasonable doubt to find Hickman took, obtained, or withheld property that is a financial transaction card.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">Whether there is an impermissible variance between the charging document and jury instructions is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review. <em>State v. Sherrod, </em>131 Idaho 56, 57, 951 P.2d 1283, 1284 (Ct.App.1998). A variance between the charging document and jury instructions is fatal when \u201cthe record suggests the possibility that the defendant was misled or embarrassed in the preparation or presentation of his defense.\u201d <em>State v. Windsor, </em>110 Idaho 410, 418, 716 P.2d 1182, 1190 (1985) (citing <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 82-84, 55 S.Ct. 629, 630-31, 79 L.Ed. 1314, 1318-19 (1935)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">In this case, assuming for the purposes of argument that there was a variance, Hickman has not shown he was misled or embarrassed in the preparation of his defense. The Amended Information accused him of taking a wallet containing financial transaction cards and the State presented evidence showing Hickman took the wallet and its contents. Hickman was not embarrassed in his defense which was that he did pick up a wallet, but it was his own and not Cain\u2019s. Thus, we hold there was no impermissible variance between the Amended Information and the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">D. Substantial and Competent Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">Hickman contends there was insufficient evidence to convict him of grand theft be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>yond a reasonable doubt.. Thus, he asks this Court to reverse the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for directed verdict and to vacate the conviction because the jury verdict is unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">This Court has observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">A directed verdict for defendant, however, or judgment for acquittal as it is now called, is an important safeguard to the defendant. It tests the sufficiency of the evidence against him, and avoids the risk that a jury may capriciously find him guilty though there is no legally sufficient evidence of his guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\"><em>State v. Holder, </em>100 Idaho 129, 130, 594 P.2d 639, 640 (1979), <em>overruled, on other grounds by State v. Humpherys, </em>134 Idaho 657, 8 P.3d 652 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Idaho Criminal Rules 29 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">(a) Motion before submission to jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">The court on motion of the defendant or on its own motion shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment, information or complaint after the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">On review, this Court must determine whether \u201cthe evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction of the crime charged.\u201d <em>State v. Hansen, </em>125 Idaho 927, 930, 877 P.2d 898, 901 (1994). This Court examines the evidence to determine whether a reasonable mind could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s guilt as to each material element of the offense was proven. <em>State v. DeGrat, </em>128 Idaho 352, 355, 913 P.2d 568, 571 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Theft requires that \u201cwith intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or to a third person, [the defendant] wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner thereof.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-2403(1). The theft is grand theft if the property is a \u201cfinancial transaction card.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18 \u2014 2407(1)(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">Hickman argues there is insufficient evidence to support a conviction of grand theft because there was insufficient evidence connecting Hickman to the wallet and because there was insufficient evidence the wallet contained financial transaction cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">\n<em>1. Theft of the wallet</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">Hickman argues the evidence shows nothing more than that he bent over and picked up something near Cain, and he emphasizes that there was no other information showing any other connection between Hickman and Cain or between Hickman and Cain\u2019s wallet. The State argues the evidence is sufficient because it showed Hickman picking something up from under Cain at the relevant time, and Hickman admitted to picking up a wallet. Furthermore, the State contends simply because the evidence is circumstantial does not mean it is insufficient. We hold that the evidence presented by the State is sufficient for a reasonable mind to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hickman committed theft of Cain\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">There was a video from the Casino\u2019s surveillance department showing Hickman bend down- near Cain and pick something up, walk to the bathroom, and exit the casino. Cain testified that in his wallet he had between six to nine hundred dollars in denominations of hundreds, twenties, fives, and ones when he started playing the machine. David Johnson of the Bingham County Sheriffs Office testified that Hickman\u2019s wallet contained hundred dollar bills, twenty dollar bills, five dollar bills, and one dollar bills. Ethan Tendore, the Casino\u2019s security supervisor, testified as to the following conversation between himself and Hickman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-17\">Q: Mr. Tendore, you took him \u2014 did you ask him any questions after you got him away from his machine other than would he come with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-18\">A: Yeah. I asked him if he\u2019d been in the casino earlier.. He said, \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-19\">I might have \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure. I showed him a picture and asked him if it was him. And he said, \u201cYeah, that was me. I was in here earlier.\u201d But he was wearing different clothes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-20\">And- then I asked him if he\u2019d found anything on the \u2014 -in the casino, if he picked anything off the floor. And he said, \u2018Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>I dropped my wallet, and I picked it up.\u201d And then\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">Q: Okay. Prior to him making the comment about the wallet, had anybody said anything about a wallet being on the floor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Though this evidence does require the jury to make inferences, it is sufficient evidence for a reasonable mind to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hickman took Cain\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\n<em>2. Financial transaction cards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">A person is guilty of grand theft when the property consists of a \u201cfinancial transaction card or financial transaction card account number as those terms are defined in section 18-3122, Idaho Code____\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(1)(b)(3). A financial transaction card is a credit card or debit card \u201cissued by the issuer for the use of the card holder in obtaining money, goods, services, or anything else of value on credit....\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-3122(6). A card holder is \u201cany person or organization named on the face of a financial transaction card to whom, or for whose benefit, a financial transaction card is issued by an issuer.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-3122(3). An issuer is \u201ca business organization or financial institution or its duly authorized agent which issues a financial transaction card.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-3122(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">Hickman points out there are distinct definitions for an \u201cexpired financial transaction card,\u201d a \u201crevoked financial transaction card,\u201d and simply a \u201cfinancial transaction card,\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-3122(5), (6), and (11); consequently, when the legislature made theft of a \u201cfinancial transaction card\u201d a felony without reference to the other two defined terms, the legislature intended the felony only include valid financial transaction cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">Statutory construction is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review. <em>State v. Yager, </em>139 Idaho 680, 689, 85 P.3d 656, 665 (2004). This Court \u201cinterprets statutes according to the plain, express meaning of the provision in question, and will resort to judicial construction only if the provision is ambiguous, incomplete, absurd, or arguably in conflict with other laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A construction that leads to an absurd or unreasonably harsh result is disfavored. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 85 P.3d at 666. The goal \u201cis to give effect to the purpose of the statute and the legislative intent in enacting it, which may be implied from the language used or inferred on grounds of policy or reasonableness.\u201d <em>The Senator, Inc., v. Ada County, Bd. of Equalization, </em>138 Idaho 566, 570, 67 P.3d 45, 49 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">In the grand theft statute the legislature chose to use the defined term \u201cfinancial transaction card\u201d instead of \u201cexpired financial transaction card\u201d or \u201crevoked financial transaction card.\u201d <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(1)(b)(3). An \u201cexpired financial transaction card\u201d and a \u201crevoked financial transaction card\u201d are distinct from a \u201cfinancial transaction card\u201d in that they are no longer valid. I.C. \u00a7 18-3122(5), (6), and (11). Thus, it is reasonable to infer from the language used in the statutes and on grounds of reasonableness that a \u201cfinancial transaction card\u201d is a valid card and that the legislature intended grand theft of a \u201cfinancial transaction card\u201d involve only valid cards and not revoked or expired financial transaction cards. Therefore, the financial transaction card must have been valid at the time it was taken. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 18-2403(1); I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(1)(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-17\">The only evidence as to the financial transaction cards came from Cain\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKk\">Q: Okay. Did you have any other items in your wallet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-18\">A: Yes, I did. I had a credit card. It had &amp; \u2014 I had $15,000 on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-19\">Q: Do, do you remember what\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-20\">A: Visa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-21\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-22\">A: I had three concealed weapons for different states. I had my badge that I use in my job and, and miscellaneous other things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-23\">Q: Okay. Other than the Visa card, did you have any other type of like a credit card or debit card?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-24\">A: I had \u2014 well, actually I have another debit card, a Visa debit card, in there for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>That had a one of my other accounts. 30,000-dollar limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azh\">Q: Okay. Any identification in your wallet indentifying[identifying] it as you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5v\">A: Yes, a driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afn\">Additionally, on cross-examination, Cain testified that no one tried to use his credit card or debit card and that immediately after noticing the missing wallet he used his cellular phone to cancel his cards.</p>\n<p id=\"Alh\">Hickman argues the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show that Cain\u2019s credit card and debit card were valid, that Cain was the \u201ccard holder\u201d on the card, that the cards were issued by an \u201cissuer,\u201d or that the cards were for the use of the card holder in obtaining money, goods, or services. The State contends though the evidence requires inferences be made, it is sufficient to support the jury verdict \u2014 that credit cards and debit cards are used by the card holder to obtain money, goods, or services is common knowledge, and Cain\u2019s testimony that the cards were in his wallet and that when he discovered his wallet was missing he called to cancel his cards leads to a reasonable conclusion that he was the card holder, the cards were issued by an issuer, and that the cards were valid at the time they were taken.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqBp\">We conclude this evidence is such that a reasonable mind could conclude Hickman\u2019s guilt as to obtaining, taking, or withholding a \u201cfinancial transaction card\u201d as defined by statute was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we affirm the jury verdict and the denial of Hickman\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"AGm\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Afo\">We hold that the erroneous jury instructions resulted in harmless error, that there was no impermissible variance between the charging document and the jury instructions, and that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the grand theft conviction. We affirm Hickman\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"AH6\">Chief Justice E ISM ANN and Justices W.

JONES,</author>\n<p id=\"Aks\">concurring in part and</p>\n<p id=\"A98\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AeH\">I concur with the Court\u2019s opinion except for Part II.B.2, which concludes that the defect in Jury Instruction No. 14 was harmless, and Part II.D.2, which holds that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for theft of a financial transaction card. I would vacate the conviction on the ground there was not sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Hickman was guilty of theft of a financial transaction card. I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(l)(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"AdW\">For a relatively short trial, this case seems to have accumulated more than its share of defects. Each of the participants below contributed their part. While I agree with the Court that some of the defects can be overlooked, I can\u2019t conclude that the record supports Hickman\u2019s conviction. The Judgment shows that Hickman was convicted of subsection (1) of I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(l)(b), rather .than subsection (3), and I would concur in treating this as a clerical error, provided that the record would support a conviction for violation of subsection (3). I concur that the defect in Jury Instruction No. 14 \u2014 -failing to say that the property taken was a financial transaction card \u2014 constituted fundamental error and would be inclined to agree that the error was harmless, had the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that valid financial transaction cards were contained in Cain\u2019s wallet. The variance between the Amended Information and the jury instructions did not rise to the level of reversible error. And, while the evidence that Hickman took Cain\u2019s wallet is rather thin \u2014 the less-than-perfect video did not show what the item was that Hickman picked up from the floor but Hickman did tell the casino\u2019s security supervisor it was a wallet (his wallet)\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>there may have been just enough to allow the jury to conclude that it was Cain\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The troublesome part is the scanty evidence in the record that the wallet contained valid financial transaction cards. I have a hard time concluding that the evidence established this element beyond a reasonable doubt. As the Court notes, the only evidence as to the financial transaction cards came in the form of Cain\u2019s few lines of testimony on the matter. With regard to items he had in his wallet, other than cash, Cain testified that he had a credit card. He stated, <em>\u201cI </em>had $15,000 on it.\u201d (emphasis added). Since there was no further testimony regarding the credit card, we don\u2019t know whether it had been activated and, if so, whether it had a $15,000 limit, whether $15,000 worth of charges were on it (which may be the better interpretation since <em>he </em>had $15,000 on it), whether the card was in good standing, whether the card, if valid, was maxed out, or whatever. The Court is correct in concluding that a financial transaction card must be valid in order to fit within the purview of I.C. \u00a7 18-2407(l)(b)(3) but we are left with less than compelling evidence regarding the validity of this card.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">With respect to the debit card, there was no testimony clearly placing it in the wallet. The prosecutor inquired, \u201cOther than the Visa card, did you have any other type of like a credit card or debit card?\u201d The question did not end with the phrase \u201cin your wallet.\u201d The answer was, \u201cI had \u2014 well, actually I <em>have </em>another debit card, a Visa debit card, in there for one of my other accounts.\u201d (emphasis added). Had Mr. Cain not changed \u201cI had\u201d to \u201cI have\u201d another card, it might have been reasonable to infer that the debit card was in the wallet at the time he lost it. It is interesting that the \u201chad\u201d was changed to \u201chave\u201d, which might indicate that he still had it at the time of trial and it wasn\u2019t in the wallet at the time the wallet went missing. Mr. Cain did not explain where \u201cin there\u201d was. Again, there was no inquiry regarding the present validity of the card or anything else about it. If we are going to impose a ten-year sentence (one year fixed) on an individual for depriving another of financial transaction cards, it seems the proof should go somewhat deeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">I.C. \u00a7 18-3122(6) defines a financial transaction card as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">[A]ny instrument or device known as a credit card, credit plate, bank services card, banking card, check guarantee card, debit card, telephone credit card or by any other name issued by the issuer for the use of the card holder in obtaining money, goods, services, or anything else of value on credit, or in certifying or guaranteeing to a person or business the availability to the card holder of the funds on deposit that are equal to or greater than the amount necessary to honor a draft or check payable to the order of such a person or business; or any instrument or device used in providing the card holder access to a demand deposit account or a time deposit account for the purpose of making deposits of money or checks therein, or withdrawing funds in the form of money, money orders, or traveler\u2019s checks or other representative of value therefrom or transferring funds from any demand account or time deposit account to any credit card account in full or partial satisfaction of any outstanding balance existing therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">While it is not necessary for the prosecution to show every particular detail outlined in the definition, it would be handy to at least know the names of the card holder and issuer, whether the card had been activated, and the fact that credit or funds are available to the card holder at the time of its loss (i.e. that the card is not expired, revoked or maxed out). Unfortunately, that information is not in the record with regard to the cards at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">On cross examination, Cain stated that he called and canceled his Visa cards when he found they were missing. This might tend to show that they were valid, although it does not place the debit card in his wallet. On the other hand, it might also show that he was acting prudently, regardless of the validity of the cards. With the present day concern regarding identity theft, it would make sense for a person to call in to report the loss of a financial transaction card even if it is expired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>or revoked. After all, either can be used to commit criminal offenses (I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18-3124 and 18-3125) or to endanger a person\u2019s credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">With the skimpy evidence about the financial transaction cards, compounded by the omission from Jury Instruction No. 14 that the property taken consisted of financial transaction cards, I would vacate the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
