There was a further averment that Mrs. Evoy departed this life in 1868, and that defendants Montgomery and Evoy were the administrators, with the vyill annexed, of her estate, and that the claim had been presented to them and rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">The defendants, the administrators, demurred, upon the ground, among others, that there was a defect of parties plaintiff, because said Woodson was not joined as plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">The Court below sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-8\"><em>E.

In <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>35 Cal. 264, this Court says: \u201cThat an action lies for a false and fraudulent representation, whereby another has suffered damage, may be stated as a general proposition which is too familiar to require comment.\u201d (See <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>2 Caine, 193; <em>Dikes </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>24 Texas, 417; <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>13 Johns. 325.) The deed is not a mere quitclaim; it conveys an estate of inheritance. <em>(Muller </em>v. <em>Boggs, </em>25 Cal. 175; 12 Wend. 91; <em>Deering </em>v. <em>Long Wharf, </em>12 Shepl. 51.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The transfer from Woodson to plaintiff was proper, and assigned the \"cause of action. Every cause of action arising out of tort which survives to the representative is assignable. <em>(Boyd </em>v. <em>Blankman, </em>29 Cal. 19.) Claim for damages caused by trespass to land is assignable. <em>(More </em>v. <em>Massine et al., 32 </em>Cal. 590; <em>Layard </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>22 Cal. 139.) It would not be pretended that in case of Woodson\u2019s death the cause of action for the breach of the covenants, or the action for deceit, would die with him. It would survive to his personal representatives, as in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Blankman. </em>(Voorhees\u2019 N. Y. Code, <em>76a, et seq.; Hodgman </em>v. <em>Western R. R. Co., </em>7 How. Pr. 493; <em>Merchants\u2019 Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Eaton, 11 Leg. </em>Ob. <em>N. </em>Y. 140.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-6\"><em>Z. Montgomery, in pro. per., </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-7\">We contend that the deed set out in plaintiff\u2019s complaint does contain express terms which restrain and limit the meaning which the statute would otherwise give to the words \u201cgrant, bargain, and sell;\u201d for it will be observed that, coupled with these terms, is also the word \u201c quitclaim,\u201d showing that the grantees intended nothing more than a quitclaim deed. It will also be remarked that this deed does not purport to convey the land itself, but only \u201c the right, title, and interest\u201d of the grantors; and this Court has repeatedly recognized the broad distinction between a deed purporting to convey the land itself, and a deed which only purports to convey the \u201cright, title, and interest\u201d of the grantor. <em>(Gee </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>14 Cal. 472.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-8\">There was also a defect of parties plaintiff in the nonjoinder of Woodson, one of the grantees. \u201cA covenant against incumbrances does not run with the land, and an action for a breach thereof cannot be maintained by the assignee of the grantee.\u201d (See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>3 Met. 390; <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Whidden, </em>11 Shep. 383.) \u201cThe covenants of seizin, right to convey, and against incumbrances, are broken, if ever, at the time of making, and cannot pass to the covenantee\u2019s assignee.\u201d <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>17 N. H. 75.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>But even if the covenant had been of a character to run with the land, still, being broken, if at all, at the time of making the deed, and before date of deed from Woodson to Lawrence, Woodson must sue, so far as his interest is concerned, and not his grantee, because the \u201c assignee of a covenant running with the land cannot maintain an action for a breach thereof accruing before the assignment.\u201d <em>(Shelton </em>v. Codman, 3 Cush. 318.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">Again: \u201cThe only covenant implied by the words \u2018grant, \u2018bargain, and sale \u2019 which runs with the land is the covenant of. further assurance; an action does not lie for a breach of the other implied covenants by an assignee.\u201d <em>(Collyer </em>v. Gamble, 10 Miss. 467.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-6\">By the Court, Crockett, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">It is somewhat difficult to determine whether this action is based upon an alleged breach of the implied covenants in the deed from Evoy to Lawrence and Woodson, or upon the alleged fraudulent representations of Evoy as to the title. In one part of the complaint we find an averment \u201cthat by virtue of the covenants of said deed said Bridget M. Evoy covenanted and agreed that she had title to said premises, and the right to convey the same, and that she had not, prior thereto, conveyed the same to any person except to said plaintiff and Woodson.\u201d In another part is an averment that Mrs. Evoy represented to Lawrence and Woodson that she was the owner of the premises described in the deed, and that, \u201crelying solely upon the said representations,\u201d they accepted and received the deed in part payment of an antecedent debt due to them from her, and that they afterwards discovered that she had previously sold and conveyed the premises to her daughter, and knew when she conveyed to them that she had no title; \u201c by means of which false and deceptive representations \u201d they aver that they have suffered damage in the sum of one thousand two hundred dollars, for which amount they pray judgment. If the complaint had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>been demurred to, on the ground that it improperly united two causes of action which could not be joined, or that it was ambiguous and uncertain, we are inclined to think the demurrer on either ground would have, been well taken. But as the demurrer does not specify either of these grounds, they must be deemed to have been waived. If it be treated as a complaint for deceit, the demurrer for a defect of parties plaintiff was well taken. The alleged deceit, if there be any, was practised on Lawrence and Woodson jointly, for which they had only a joint cause of action; and the action is not only brought in the name of Lawrence alone, but there is no averment that he has succeeded to Woodson\u2019s right of action. The only allegation in this respect is that Woodson has \u201c sold, transferred and assigned to plaintiff* all his interest in said premises, acquired by said deed of conveyance from Mrs. Evoy, by a deed of conveyance duly executed and acknowledged;\u201d but the complaint avers that Woodson acquired no title in the land, and of course could convey none to the plaintiff; and the action for deceit is a personal action, founded on fraud, and not upon any covenant in the deed running with the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Even though the implied covenants in the deed be as broad in their legal effect as the plaintiff claims them to be, they amount, at most, only to -a covenant that \u201c the \"grantor has not conveyed the same real estate, or any right, title, or interest therein, to any person other than the grantee;\u201d \u201cand that such real estate is, at the time of the execution of such conveyance, free from incumbrances, done, made or suffered by the grantor, or any person claiming under him; and such covenants may be sued upon in the same manner as if they had been expressly inserted in the conveyance.\u201d (Statutes 1855, p. 171.) But it is well settled that these are only personal covenants, and do not run with the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u201c The covenants of seizin and of a right to convey, and that the land is free from incumbrances, are personal covenants, not running with the land, or passing to the assignee; for, if not true, there is a breach of them as soon as the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>is executed, and they become <em>choses in action </em>which are not technically assignable.\u201d (4 Kent. Com. 471. To the same effect are: <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>3 Met. <em>390; Bickford </em>v. <em>Page, </em>2 Mass. 455; <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Trueman, </em>4 Mass. 627: <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Clemence, </em>22 Pick. 493; <em>Greeby </em>v. <em>Wilcocks, </em>2 Johns. 1; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>4 Johns. 72; <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Sanger, </em>14 Johns. 89; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>5 Halst. 20; <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Sandford, </em>7 Halst. 261; <em>Garfield </em>v. Williams, 2 Vt. 327; <em>Mitchell </em>v. Warner, 5 Conn. 497; <em>Birney </em>v. <em>Hann, </em>3 A. K. Marsh. 324; Innes v. <em>Agnew, </em>1 Ohio, 389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">.. It follows that, whether this action be based on the alleged direct or on the implied covenants in the deed, the cause of action was personal, and does not run with the land. If there was any cause of action, it accrued to Lawrence and Woodson jointly; and the subsequent conveyance from Woodson to Lawrence of whatever interest the former had in the <em>land, </em>does not, of itself, entitle the latter to maintain an action in his own name, either on the direct or for a breach of the implied covenants in the deed. We do not wish to he understood as deciding whether or not the deed in question is of a character .from which such covenants would be implied; but assuming, for the purposes of the argument, that the deed is of that character, we hold that the cause of action, if any, accrued to Lawrence and Wood-son jointly, and the complaint contains no averment that Woodson has assigned to Lawrence his interest in the cause of action. The demurrer to the complaint was, therefore, properly sustained, on the ground that there was a defect of parties plaintiff. This view of the case renders it unnecessary to decide the other points raised by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Judgment affirmed, and remittitur ordered to issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
