Gerhe, 35 Cal. 677, affirmed.)</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b54-8\">Appeal from the District Court, Fifteenth Judicial District, Contra Costa County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-9\">This was an action to recover delinquent taxes.

McCreery, 34 Cal. 433, and <em>People </em>v. Gerke, 35 Cal. 677, and it is unnecessary to repeat the argument here. Either the exemption is void, or all the provisions of the Act levying an ad valorem tax upon property are void. We held the exemptions void, and that it was the duty of the Assessor, notwithstanding the attempted exemption, to assess the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Judgment affirmed, and remittitur directed to-issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
