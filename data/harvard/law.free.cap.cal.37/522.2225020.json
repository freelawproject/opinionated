That the judgment was docketed in the County Court, and on the 17th of October, 1867, an execution was issued on it and placed in the hands of the defendant, who was Sheriff\" of Mendocino County, which execution was returnable in sixty days; and that the Sheriff had collected the money, but had failed to return the execution, to the damage of plaintiff in the sum of five hundred dollars, and interest at five per cent per month until paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-10\">There was a further averment that by reason of the failure of the defendant to make return of the execution, he had become liable to the plaintiff in the penalty and sum of two hundred dollars, according to the provisions of an Act concerning Sheriffs, passed April 29th, 1851. The prayer was for judgment for seven hundred dollars, and interest at five per cent per month as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">The answer failed to deny the allegations of the complaint, and the cause was submitted on the pleadings. The Court gave the plaintiff judgment for two hundred dollars and costs of suit.

S. Long, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b523-7\">By the Court, Sawyer, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We do not see how plaintiff can justly claim that the damages accruing upon what he claims to be his first count (admitting that there are two counts) are fixed by the admitted allegations of the complaint. The <em>gravamen </em>of the action is <em>the failure to return an execution </em>within the priscribed time. It is averred that the money has been collected, and that the defendant (the Sheriff) has failed to return the execution; hut it is nowhere alleged that defendant has not paid over to plaintiff the money collected. Moneys collected on execution are usually paid over by the officer before the return of the writ, and the fact of such payment constitutes a part of the return. In this instance the money, for aught that appears, may have been paid to the plaintiff, notwithstanding the fact that the writ has not been returned. We cannot assume that it has not been paid without any averment on the point. If paid, the amount collected and paid over cannot be the measure of damages for a subsequent failure to return the writ merely.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
