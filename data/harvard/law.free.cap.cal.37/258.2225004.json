At the trial M. B. Tubbs was called as a trial juror, who, after being examined as to his qualifications by the defendant\u2019s counsel, was by him challenged for \u201cimplied bias\u201d merely, without further specification of the grounds for the same. The challenge was overruled, 'and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the counsel for the defendant excepted. The defendant appealed from the judgment, and from an order denying his motion for a new trial,</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-6\"><em>Coffroth &amp; Spaulding, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-7\"><em>Jo Hamilton, Attorney General, </em>for the People.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b259-8\">By the Court, Sanderson, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The question whether the juror, Tubbs, was disqualified by reason of his having formed or expressed an unqualified opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, we are unable to reach. The challenge was for \u201cimplied bias\u201d merely, without specifying any particular cause for which a challenge for implied bias may be interposed. The statute provides that a challenge for implied bias may be taken for nine distinct causes, (Criminal Practice Act, Sec. 347,) and that, in taking it, counsel must allege one or more of the causes so specified. (Sec. 349.) Accordingly, it has been held by this Court that a challenge interposed in general terms \u201cfor implied bias,\u201d without a specification of any cause, may be disregarded, as incomplete, by the Court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>16 Cal. 130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The remaining points are not deemed of sufficient importance to require special notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Judgment and order affirmed, and remittitur allowed forthwith</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
