That about September 1st, 1867, the parties attempted to settle, when .plaintiff gave defendant two accounts\u2014one being a bill of the defendant\u2019s account, and the other the account of Ketcham &amp; Stayton; that in the account against defendant the plaintiff charged the defendant with a balance of nine hundred and twenty-seven dollars due on the note sued on; that by said accounts plaintiff made out that defendant owed him six hundred and seventy-eight dollars and eighty-nine cents, but that plaintiff did not allow defendant anything for three drafts on the Bank of California, amounting to fifteen hundred dollars, which defendant had let plaintiff have, and on which plaintiff had collected the money, and that the plaintiff denied having received the drafts; that for the purpose of settling the dispute as to such credit, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a submission, in writing, to the arbitration of Pleasant Byrd and George S.

The Court denied the motion. The defendant on the trial objected to the reception of the submission and award in evidence, because the submission contained no agreement to arbitrate the question of liability of the defendant on the note, and because the award was not final and did not show whether the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff or he to the defendant. The Court overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">The defendant recovered judgment against the plaintiff for five hundred and ninety-seven dollars and eleven cents and costs.

It does not make a final disposition of the difficulty in the settlement of accounts between the plaintiff and the defendant. It leaves the dispute open to be settled by matter subsequent. (Watson on Arbitration, 216; Billings\u2019 Law of Awards, 132; Kyd on Awards, 208; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>7 Cal. 316.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-11\"><em>P. L. Edwards, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-12\">The award was final and conclusive, because the arbitrators decided all and only all that was submitted to them. The note was a part of the reciprocal accounts. The fifteen hundred dollars was the only matter in controversy and submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-13\">The array of authorities produced by the learned counsel for appellant is upon the erroneous hypothesis that the submission was upon all matters of difference, instead of the particular matter which was in fact submitted. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Van Allen, </em>14 Johns. 96; <em>Wrightson </em>v. <em>Beywater, </em>3 Exch. 199.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-14\">\u201cWhere the submission is with an <em>ita quod, </em>it is requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that all matters should be disposed of by the award; but it the submission is without such a condition, then the whole submission is to be looked to in order to ascertain whether it was the intention of the parties that all matters in difference should be embraced by one award.\u201d <em>(Muldrow </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>12 Cal. 331.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b201-6\">By the Court, Rhodes, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The submission to arbitration recites \u201c that there being a difficulty in settlement of accounts between E. Jacob and L. R. Ketcham,\u201d they have selected certain persons as arbitrators, aud agree to be bound by their award. The award o\u00ed the arbitrators is that \u201cKetcham &amp; Stay ton are entitled to a credit on their account with said E. Jacob of three checks of five hundred dollars each, amounting in the aggregate to fifteen hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">It is essential to the validity of an award that it should be final\u2014that it should finally determine the matters submitted to the arbitrators. The purpose of a submission is to obtain a decision that shall make a final end and determination of the matter in controversy, and thus avoid all further litigation. (Kyd on Awards, 208; Watson on Arbitration, 216; <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>2 Wend. 377.) Awards, as well as submissions, are to be liberally construed; but, giving this award the most liberal construction, it cannot be held to be a decision of the matter submitted to the arbitrators. They were required to make a settlement of the accounts between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2014that is to say, to ascertain and strike a balance between the accounts and declare the amount found due from one party to the other. This they have not done; but, instead of it, they have determined that the defendant <em>and Stayton </em>are entitled to certain credits on their account with the plaintiff\". This is not a final award upon the matter mentioned in the submission. Without regard to the question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the note in suit is included in the term, \u201caccounts,\u201d mentioned in the submission, we are of the opinion that the award was not admissible in evidence, in the action upon the note, for the reasons stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
