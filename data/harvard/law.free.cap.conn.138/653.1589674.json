J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae2\">The plaintiff, who was a second-floor tenant in the defendants\u2019 six-family apartment house in Stamford, brought this action to recover for personal injuries sustained on October 6, 1948, by reason of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>alleged negligent failure of the defendants to keep a porch railing in repair. It is conceded that the porch was in their exclusive control. Judgment was for the plaintiff and the defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The record shows these further undisputed facts: The railing along the outer edge of the porch at the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s apartment extended between two upright posts and consisted of a top rail and a lower stringpiece with perpendicular balusters between. As the plaintiff turned away after throwing a parcel into the rear yard, her right side came in contact with the railing, it collapsed, and she fell to the ground below, suffering serious and painful injuries. When the railing gave way, it became detached at all four of the points where it had been affixed to the two upright posts. The ends of the top rail and the stringpiece, and the posts at the four points where these had been attached, were rotted and decayed. The nails at these four places remained in the posts. They were rusted, corroded and eaten away, and the heads had disintegrated. No inspections to ascertain the condition of the premises had been made either by the defendants or by their employees. Neither of the defendants testified at the trial, and they did not offer evidence that any inspection had ever been made of the premises. There was no claim that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">\u201cThe primary duty of the landlord is to use reasonable care to see that the premises are kept reasonably safe, and his liability can only arise out of a failure in that duty. <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Shimelman, </em>102 Conn. 383, 386, 128 Atl. 705. To give rise to it, however, it must appear that he either knew of a defect or was chargeable with notice of it, because, had he exercised a reasonable inspection of the premises, he would have known of it. <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Shimelman, supra, </em>p. 398.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>Vinci v. O\u2019Neill, </em>103 Conn. 647, 657, 131 A. 408; <em>Laflin </em>v. <em>Lomas &amp; Nettleton Co., </em>127 Conn. 61, 64, 13 A. 2d 760. It is the landlord\u2019s duty to make reasonable inspection of the portion of the premises remaining in his control to discover possible defects therein. <em>Scibek </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>131 Conn. 557, 559, 41 A. 2d 251; <em>Aprile </em>v. <em>Colonial Trust Co., </em>118 Conn. 573, 580, 173 A. 237. The defendants do. not question the correctness of these principles. They attack the court\u2019s conclusions that (1) a reasonable inspection of the premises would have disclosed that they were not in a reasonably safe condition, and (2) the defendants were negligent in not making such an inspection and in not using reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition, when, in the words of the defendants\u2019 brief, \u201cthere was no evidence that [the landlords] knew of a defect or that a reasonable inspection would have disclosed it, so as to charge [them] with notice of its existence.\u201d There is no claim that actual knowledge of the defendants was established. The court\u2019s conclusions are to be tested by the finding and not by the evidence. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Margolis, </em>107 Conn. 417, 422, 140 A. 823; <em>City Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ruthinian Greek Catholic Church, </em>102 Conn. 609, 611, 129 A. 785; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc., \u00a7 96. The only question presented by the defendants\u2019 claim, therefore, is whether the subordinate facts properly found by the court support its conclusion that a reasonable inspection would have disclosed the unsafe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In view of the conceded facts and the unchallenged subordinate facts in the finding, it is manifest that if the defendants were charged with constructive knowledge of the defect the judgment for the plaintiff on the ground of their negligence cannot be disturbed. The question determinative of the appeal, therefore, is whether the court\u2019s conclusion that a reasonable inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>tion of the premises would have disclosed that they were not in a reasonably safe condition can be sustained. The general neglected condition of the premises and the defendants\u2019 long-existent knowledge thereof clearly appear from numerous paragraphs of the finding which are not attacked. The porches were of wood and were very old, and no repairs had been made for many years. The condition of the entire premises was called to the attention of one of the defendants when they purchased the property some three years before the plaintiff\u2019s fall, and monthly thereafter. On each occasion his response was that the rent was too cheap and he could not afford to make repairs. The first place of decay in the porch railings was naturally where they joined the upright posts.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In the light of these facts, four unchallenged paragraphs of the finding afford a short and conclusive answer to the determinative question. These state that under the circumstances a reasonable inspection would have required \u201cthe shaking of the railing to determine its condition\u201d and \u201cthe probing in the joints of the railings by a nail, knife, screwdriver or other tool,\u201d and that either one would have revealed that the railing was in a defective condition and not reasonably safe. Not only was no error assigned in any of these paragraphs but apparently they were properly predicated primarily upon the testimony on cross-examination of the builder called by the defendants as an expert witness. Each of the paragraphs constitutes a finding of fact. Upon this state of the record, the defendants\u2019 contention \u2014 that, because, as they claim, the decayed condition would not have been apparent on visual observation solely, the court\u2019s conclusion that a reasonable inspection of the premises would have disclosed that the railing was not in a reasonably safe condition was unwarranted \u2014 cannot prevail. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>case of <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>D\u2019Agastino, </em>135 Conn. 384, 64 A. 2d 539, relied upon by the defendants in this connection, is clearly distinguishable, as appears by this statement at page 386 of the opinion: \u201cThe plaintiffs offered no evidence that a reasonable inspection of the premises would have disclosed the defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">As is apparent from our view of the case, expressed above, it is unnecessary to discuss the errors assigned seeking changes in the finding. The errors assigned but not pursued in the defendants\u2019 brief require no consideration. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>124 Conn. 664, 665, 2 A. 2d 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
