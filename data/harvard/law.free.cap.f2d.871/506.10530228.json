WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b591-21\">Appellant Benjamin Franklin Pope pleaded guilty to two counts of violating federal firearms statutes. He now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court incorrectly applied the guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission. We affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-22\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-23\">In December, 1981, Benjamin Franklin Pope was convicted of felony theft in Texas state court. He was sentenced to three years in the state penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-24\">In November, 1987, Pope displayed and offered to sell a .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol with a threaded collar and a silencer to an undercover police officer. In April, 1988, Pope waived indictment and pleaded guilty on a two count information resulting from this incident. Count I charged Pope with the unlawful possession of an unregistered firearm, the silencer, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Count II charged Pope as a convicted felon with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 992(g) by possessing the pistol. The latter statutory provision prohibits a convicted felon from possessing or receiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ing any firearm shipped in interstate or foreign commerce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Pope was sentenced to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment on Count I, with a concurrent twenty-four month sentence for Count II. This sentence was imposed under the guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission. On appeal, Pope contends that the district court incorrectly applied the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AgU\">Our review of the sentence imposed by the district court under the sentencing guidelines is governed by statute. 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 3742(d)(2) (Supp. IV 1986) allows us to consider Pope\u2019s contention that his sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines. We are required, however, to give \u201cdue regard\u201d to the district court\u2019s credibility judgments and its factual findings. We must \u201caccept the court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(d). This Court has recently emphasized this principle, noting that the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s fact-finding power is an important guarantor of the practical judgment essential to any just sentencing procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Mejia-Orosco, </em>867 F.2d 216, 219 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 137 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">III. <em>Reduction of Offense Level for Guns Possessed as Part of a Lawful Collection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Pope first argues that the district court erred in failing to reduce his offense level on Count I by six points as directed by \u00a7 2K2.2(b)(3) of the guidelines because the silencer was possessed as part of his gun collection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No evidence was introduced to support Pope\u2019s own assertion that this firearm was part of a larger collection. The district court nevertheless found, in accordance with Pope\u2019s own statements and the presentence report, that Pope had a gun \u201ccollection\u201d at his residence. While the court made an express factual finding that \u201cthe silencer was part of a collection,\u201d it did not reduce the offense level by six points under \u00a7 2K2.2(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">The commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines explains that \u201c[ujnder \u00a7 2K2.2(b)(3), intended <em>lawful </em>use, as determined by the surrounding circumstances, provides a decrease in offense level.\u201d Application Note 1, \u00a7 2K2.2 (emphasis added). Thus, the advisory notes to this section make clear that only a lawful collection of guns can be considered as a mitigating factor under \u00a7 2K2.2(b)(3). The section would apply, for example, when a legitimate gun collector possesses one firearm which has an altered serial number, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(h) (1982). In contrast, it would be contrary to the clear intent of this provision to find that an <em>illegal </em>gun collection, such as one possessed by a convicted felon, should be used to reduce the sentence of a person guilty of violating a firearms statute. Common sense and the commentary to the guidelines preclude this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">In light of the foregoing analysis, the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe silencer was part of a collection\u201d is troubling. As a convicted felon, Pope is not entitled to maintain a gun collection under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1). Virtually all guns have moved in commerce or \u201caffect\u201d commerce. Even a homemade gun could affect the interstate gun market. <em>Cf. Wickard v. Filburn, </em>317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942); <em>Perez v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 146, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971). But, to the extent that the district court\u2019s factual finding is simply a recognition that Pope possessed other guns at home, we cannot dispute its accuracy. We conclude, however, that to the extent the district court determined that Pope\u2019s guns were a collection <em>within the ambit of the sentencing guidelines, </em>this finding is erroneous, because as a matter of law only a gun collection that is not itself unlawful can be used to reduce an offense level under \u00a7 2K2.2(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The district court, without explanation, did not reduce Pope\u2019s sentence by six offense levels under \u00a7 2K2.2(b)(3), despite its explicit finding that the silencer was part of a collection. Since we conclude that Pope\u2019s guns, which he possessed illegally, were not and could not be a collection within the meaning of \u00a7 2K2.2(b)(3), we find that the offense level should not in fact have been reduced. The district court\u2019s original calculation was therefore correct. Pope is not entitled to an offense level reduction for his unlawful accumulation of guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">IV. <em>Grouping Closely-Related Counts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Pope also contends that the district court erred in refusing to group Counts I and II together as closely-related offenses under \u00a7 3D1.2 of the sentencing guidelines. This section provides for the grouping together of \u201call counts involving substantially the same harm.\u201d Under such a grouping, Pope would be sentenced for one aggregate offense with one offense level. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3D1.3. The district court refused to make such a grouping, instead sentencing Pope by determining the combined offense level for two separate offenses pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Guideline 3D1.2 identifies one set of offenses to which \u00a7 3D1.2 specifically applies, and a second set of offenses specifically excluded from the operation of the subsection. Offenses covered by \u00a7 2K2.2 fall into neither category. Instead, they are among a third set of crimes for which \u201cgrouping ... may or may not be appropriate.\u201d The Guideline indicates that for crimes in this middle category \u201ca case-by-case determination must be made based upon the facts of the case and the applicable guidelines (including specific offense characteristics and other adjustments) used to determine the offense level.\u201d This determination is in some parts legal rather than factual, and so is not shielded by the clearly erroneous standard. The determination does, however, depend on factual and case-specific conclusions. A reviewing court must therefore give \u201cdue deference\u201d to the district court, and respect the informed judgments made by that court. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (1989) (as amended); <em>see also United States v. Mejia-Orosco, </em>(on petition for rehearing) 868 F.2d 807, 808 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Pope argues that his offenses should have been combined together under \u00a7 3D1.2 because the silencer and pistol involved in his offenses are necessarily linked: the silencer in Count I screws onto the pistol in Count II. We reject the claim that this physical connection mandates a finding that the two offenses are \u201cclosely related\u201d within the meaning of the guidelines. Instead, we look to the language of the guidelines and the explanatory comments to determine whether the district court correctly decided that Pope\u2019s offenses were not \u201ccounts involving substantially the same harm\u201d under \u00a7 3D1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Pope specifically contends that his offenses should have been grouped together under subsection 3D1.2(d). This provision states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">Counts are to be grouped together if the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of a substance involved, or some other measure of aggregate harm, or if the offense behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The possession of an unregistered silencer and the unlawful possession of a pistol by a convicted felon do not clearly fall under the language of this guideline. Indeed, the \u201ctotal amount of harm or loss\u201d and \u201cthe quantity of the substance involved\u201d are not relevant factors in determining the offense level for the crimes Pope has committed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1; \u00a7 2K2.2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The commentary to the guidelines provides further guidance on this issue. The advisory notes explain that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">Ambiguities should be resolved in accordance with the purpose of this section, ... <em>i.e. </em>to identify and group \u201ccounts involving substantially the same harm.\u201d Thus, for so-called \u201cvictimless\u201d crimes (crimes in which society at large is the victim), the grouping decision must be based primarily upon the nature of the interest invaded by each offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Application Note 2, \u00a7 3D1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We are not persuaded that Pope\u2019s two offenses, possession of an unregistered silencer and possession of a pistol by a convicted felon, should be grouped together under the plain language of \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Even assuming that there is some arguable ambiguity, we find that the district court reached the proper result. The court concluded that the possession of an unregistered silencer and the unlawful possession of a pistol by a felon involve two distinct harms and different societal interest. The court explained: \u201cI believe that [the silencer and the pistol] are two different instruments of danger to the community and need to be treated differently.... The very nature of a silencer requires it to be treated differently even though it is attached to the firearm itself.\u201d We add to this analysis that the second count involved possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The thrust of this offense differs widely from an unregistered firearm offense that has nothing to do with the prior criminal record of the offender. Given the plain language of the relevant provision and the different nature of Pope\u2019s offenses, we find no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that his offenses should not have been grouped together under \u00a7 3D1.2(d) of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">The district court\u2019s finding that the silencer was part of a gun \u201ccollection,\u201d in the sense that Pope possessed more guns than those involved in the charged offenses, is not clearly erroneous. We conclude, however, that as a matter of law Pope\u2019s accumulation of guns cannot be used to reduce his offense level under \u00a7 2K2.2(b)(3) because it was illegal for him to possess any guns. Although the court failed to explain its rationale, it was correct in refusing to reduce Pope\u2019s offense level on account of his unlawful gun collection. In addition, we find no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that Pope\u2019s offenses should not have been grouped together as closely-related counts under \u00a7 3D 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-12\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) (1982) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFC\">It shall be unlawful for any person ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8GA\">(d) to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqF\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) (1982) includes in the definition of firearms covered under this statute \"a muffler or silencer for any firearm whether or not such firearm is included within this definition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Supp. IV 1986) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">It shall be unlawful for any person (1) who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Under this statute, the term firearm includes \"any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(3) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-16\">. Section 2K2.2 of the sentencing guidelines applies when a defendant is convicted of receipt, possession, or transportation of firearms in violation of the National Firearms Act. The district court correctly applied this provision to Pope\u2019s offense under Count I \u2014 possession of an unregistered silencer. Section 2K2.2(b)(3) provides: \"If the defendant obtained or possessed the firearm solely for sport, recreation, or collection, decrease [the offense level] by 6 levels.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\">. Pope emphasizes that the commentary for \u00a7 3D 1.2(d) includes \"firearms offenses\u201d as among those crimes which may be properly grouped together under this subsection. Thus, an example in the commentary explains that \"[if the] defendant is convicted of three counts of unlicensed dealing in firearms],] [a]ll three counts are to be grouped together.\u201d Application Note 6, \u00a7 3D1.2. The fact that firearms dealing is included as one illustration of an appropriate grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(d), however, does not mean that <em>all </em>firearm offenses are to be grouped together under that section. Instead, unlicensed firearms dealing is given as one example of crimes for which the offense level \"is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of a substance involved, or some other measure of aggregate harm_\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.3 (number of firearms sold is relevant factor in determining the offense level for unlicensed firearms dealing).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
