I also concur that the motion to suppress was properly denied. I dissent only from the majority\u2019s affirmance of the conviction for resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The crime of resisting arrest is defined by ORS 162.315(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\"A person commits the crime of resisting arrest if he intentionally resists a person known by him to be a peace officer in making an arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">ORS 162.315(2) defines \"resists\u201d as meaning something more than it means in common parlance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\" 'Resists/ as used in this section, means the use or threatened use of violence, physical force or any other means that creates a substantial risk of physical injury to any person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">There is no evidence in this case that the defendant resisted arrest in the statutory sense of that word. The officers testified that they entered defendant\u2019s house without a warrant to arrest him. Defendant held an inside door closed, but the officers pushed it open. Because they feared that defendant had a weapon, immediately upon entry they grabbed defendant, pushed him against the wall, each taking one arm, tripped him and took him to the floor where they attempted to handcuff him as he was held in a chokehold. Defendant did not submit to arrest. Instead he struggled to avoid being physically subdued. The officers testified that defendant did not direct force against the officers or threaten them, but rather merely used his strength to made it difficult to get the handcuffs on him. It took eight to ten minutes to get him under control.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">There was no evidence of \"the use or threatened use of violence, physical force or any other means that create[d] a substantial risk of physical injury to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>person\u201d as required by ORS 162.315(2). The state argues only that defendant\u2019s action created \"a highly volatile and dangerous situation which could have been avoided if defendant had peaceably complied with the police officers\u2019 demands.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute, however, requires more than a dangerous situation. The Commentary explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\">\"Resisting arrest is usually manifested by physical violence directed at the arresting officer. [This section] is limited therefore to the use, or threatened use, of physical violence or acts producing a 'substantial risk of physical injury.\u2019 * * * 'Neither flight from arrest nor passive resistance should be made crimes in themselves. * * *\u2019 \u201d Commentary, Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, \u00a7 206, p 204 (July 1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Although defendant\u2019s conduct was arguably more than \"passive resistance\u201d in that he used his strength instead of going limp, it was not \"physical violence directed at the arresting officer.\u201d It was therefore not prohibited by this criminal statute and his conviction on Count II should be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-5\"> Defendant\u2019s son spontaneously came to defendant\u2019s assistance with a pop bottle, but was disarmed. He \u00bfso reached toward a gun rack, but was dissuaded. Defendant, of course, is not chargeable with his son\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
