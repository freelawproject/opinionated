The duty imposed by the statute upon the company is, first, that it shall provide proper and suitable wagon ways; and, second, that it shall keep such ways in good repair. The declaration alleges that defendant complied with the first obligation by constructing the overhead bridge, but avers that, having discharged that duty, it violated the second requirement of the statute in failing to keep the bridge in repair, by which breach of duty plaintiff suffered the damages for which he sues. These allegations are substantially in the terms of the statute, and state \u201ca good cause of action. The contention of defendant, that in addition thereto the declaration should allege that defendant failed to provide or to keep up other suitable wagon ways is without merit. It appears that only one suitable way was necessary, and that the defendant supplied in accordance with the statute. But the breach of duty, as we have seen, lay in the failure of defendant to keep the way in good repair. There being none other, the only breach that could be assigned was with reference to the particular way in question. The duty to keep in good repair necessarily began when the duty to construct ended. If defendant had failed to comply with its statutory obligation to construct a sufficient number of wagon ways, plaintiff's remedy would have been to petition the circuit court for the appointment of commissioners to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ascertain whether the additional ways asked for should be constructed, and not by action to recover damages. <em>Lanford </em>v. <em>Va. Air Line Ry. Co., </em>113 Va. 68, 73 S. E. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">If defendant wishes to escape liability <em>for </em>failure to keep the overhead bridge, as originally constructed, in good repair, it must absolve itself from that duty by showing that it has, in some lawful way, been relieved of responsibility by providing other proper and suitable wagon ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The declaration measures up to the requirement of the rule so often announced by this court, viz., that it must state a case, and set forth \u201cthe facts with sufficient certainty to be understood by the defendant who is to answer it, the jury who are to try the issue, and the court which is to render judgment.\u201d Burks\u2019 Pl. &amp; Pr., 346, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Our conclusion is that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the declaration, for which error the judgment must be reversed, the demurrer overruled, and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
