Hurt; my executors are to keep all my real estate rented, except my dwelling, so long as my wife desires to occupy it; they are to keep my houses in good repair, and see that the taxes and insurance are kept paid; they shall take charge of my personal estate, and convert the same into money, except so much as my wife may desire to keep for her use, and shall loan out the same upon proper security. From the income derived from the rental of my real estate and the interest from my personal estate I direct my executors to pay to my beloved wife as she needs it so much as will give her a comfortable support, my wife to be judge of the amount she may need.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u201cThird: After the death of my wife I will and direct that my estate be divided into seven equal parts.

Hurt, one-seventh of my said estate, to my sister Elizabeth Shaffer (wife of John R. Shaffer), one-seventh of my said estate, and to the children of my sister Margaret A.

The testator died on April 20, 1915, and the will was probated on May 8, 1915. The widow was then about sixty-five years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\">At the time of his death the estate of the testator consisted of real estate, tangible and intangible personal property. The real estate consisted of a thirteen-room dwelling house, located on a large lot of two and three quarter acres in the town of Wytheville, Va., where the testator and his wife resided at the time of Ms death, and several other houses and lots \u2014 rented out \u2014 and some vacant land in and near such town which might be cultivated or rented out for cultivation. The tangible personal property consisted of household and kitchen furniture, a Ford automobile and a cow. The intangible personal property consisted of stock in the Wytheville Sanitary Company, money in bank, notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>and bonds for money lent out, accounts of debts due testator, and a life insurance policy of $1,000.00. The appraised value of said property is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\"><em>Real </em>Estate\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">Said residence and lot................. $ 3,500 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">Other improved real estate............. 6,250 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">Unimproved real estate................ 2,450 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-9\">$ 12,200 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-10\"><em>Tangible Personal Property </em>.............. 425 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-11\"><em>Intangible Personal </em>Property\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-12\">Said stock ...................$ 687 50</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-13\">Money in bank................ 855 23</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-14\">Notes, bonds and accounts considered good by executor .... 3,217 56 4,760 29</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-15\">Total estate ......................... $ 17,385 29</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-16\">The testator never had a large income. He was deputy clerk of the circuit court for six years, in the latter part of his life, but for several years before his death he was in bad health and had no income except from his property, which at such time was about the same as when he died. He accumulated his estate in small amounts by careful saving. He had no children. He and his wife lived in the residence above named for a number of years before his death. Their manner of life was comfortable but frugal. The wife did the housework except occasionally she would hire extra help and testator did the most of the work about the home, such as caring for the fires, etc., when not too unwell to do so. They kept no servant regularly. In testator\u2019s life time, when heat was needed, they had fires in grates, as well as in the hot water furnace, because they preferred the open fires. The living expenses of testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>and his wife during the last years of his life were less than fifty dollars per month, including insurance on and up-keep of his property and other expenses incidental thereto, as stated by him, in accordance with the testimony of his widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">Testator and his wife lived for the most part to themselves. The persons entitled in remainder under said will did not live nor were they much with the testator in recent years, some living in remote States \u2014 one nephew not having been heard of by testator for years, as stated in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">The widow had at the death of testator and has still, a small separate estate of about $1,580.00, money lent out at interest, of which $750.00 was derived from sale of a small parcel of land inherited by her, and the residue she accumulated by small savings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">The executors acting under said will have delivered to said widow all of said tangible personal property for her use, but have not delivered to her any of the intangible personal property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-8\">The widow occupies the said dwelling house and lot, in which she and her husband resided at and before his death as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-9\">The executors are paying- over to the widow all of the net income derived from the real estate and intangible personal property aforesaid. From this source the widow received during the first thirteen months after testator\u2019s death $698.12, or an average of $53.70 per month. During the months of May, June and July, 1916, she received $287.03 of the executors, or $71.75 per month. Up to Sep-= temtoer, 1916, a period of seventeen months, she received of 'the executors $985.15, or an average of $57.95 per month, The evidence shows that, as estimated in 1916, the probable net income from such property will be $700.00' or $800.00 per year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Since testator\u2019s death, \u201clittle John Hurt,\u201d a nephew of testator, about twelve years of age, has lived with the widow and a brother of hers, who lives in the same, town, has spent a part of his time with her. With their assistance about caring for the fires and doing chores about the place, the manner of life of the widow has been practically the same as it was before her husband\u2019s death. She does practically the same work now as before the testator\u2019s death and lives practically as comfortably. It is true that she has dispensed with a phone, which was in the house before her husband\u2019s death and that she has not used the automobile since such death, for lack of renewal of the tires to it, and uses the grates for heating the house in winter altogether, instead of making use of the hot water furnace. These changes have been made in order to economize, and in August, 1916, when her deposition was taken the widow found the increased expense of living such that it was difficult for her to live on her said income from his estate in the same way that she and her husband lived. She refers also to having had to borrow money twice to pay her expenses, but this proved to be a trifling matter of $2.50 borrowed from a niece and the same amount borrowed later from another to pay that back. The automobile was used but little in her husband\u2019s lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">The heating the house by the hot water furnace doubtless grew more expensive after the testator\u2019s death and the loss of the use of the phone was to some extent a discomfort. But the preponderance of the evidence shows that as of the time of the death of her husband, even with, the increased cost of living, the whole of said net income since received by the widow would have been sufficient to provide a comfortable support for her in that mode of and situation in life to which she had been accustomed to live.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>W. </em>B. <em>Kegley, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-5\">W. S. <em>Poage </em>and <em>Jos. C.

This claim rests chiefly upon the construction placed upon that portion of the second clause of the will which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthey (the executors) shall take charge of my personal estate and convert the same into money, except so much as my wife may desire to keep for her useand it is contended that by the same clause the wife is to be the judge of the amount she may need. That is to say, it is contended for appellee that the language \u201cpersonal estate\u201d quoted, includes the intangible as well as the tangible personal estate, and that the <em>jus disponendi </em>thereof is in effect given to her by the provisions of the will allowing her \u201cto keep for her use\u201d so much thereof as she \u201cmay desire\u201d and making her \u201cthe judge of the amount she may need,\u201d bringing the case within the familiar rule laid down in the <em>May and Jones Case, </em>20 Grat. (61 Va.) 692, and subsequent Virginia cases applying such rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The position is also taken in behalf of the appellee that when the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the will are examined in the light of the facts and circumstances surrounding the parties at the execution of the will and prior thereto, the will-shows that the testator intended his widow to take and use the personalty (intangible as well as tangible) in such manner as she might elect and that this would give her the absolute title thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>In the view we take of the ease, it will be unnecessary for us to discuss the rule of <em>May and. Joynes, </em>or the affect of the amendment to section 2418 of the Code of Va. (see Acts 1908, p. 187) upon that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Counsel for appellee cite a number of authorities to the effect that the ianguage \u201cpersonal estate\u201d used in the clause of the will under consideration is. broad enough to cover intangible personal property. This is undoubtedly correct. They also cite authority <em>(Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>115 Va. 374, 79 S. E. 343), to the point that such, indeed, is the technical and accurate meaning of the language \u201cpersonal estate\u201d and that \u201cwhen technical words are used they are presumed to be used technically and words of a definite legal signification are to be understood as used in their definite legal' sense, unless the contrary appears on the face of the instrument\u201d \u2014 to quote from the syllabus of the last cited case. This, too, is well settled law. But\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">It is also well settled that while it is true that in the conjstruction of wills, the intention of the testator, if not inconsistant with some established rule of law, must control, yet that intention must be found in the language of the testator used in the will; in the meaning of the words used by the testator, when properly interpreted, rather than his presumed or supposed intention. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">As said in <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>101 Va. 543-4, 44 S. E. 906, 63 L. R. A. 920: \u201cThe object in construing wills is to arrive at the true intent of the testator, but that intent is to be gathered from the language used, for the object of construction is not to ascertain the presumed or supposed, but the expressed intention of the testator; that is, the meaning which the words of the will, correctly interpreted, convey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Another statement of the well settled rule on this subject is contained in the syllabus of the case of <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Eckels, </em>99 Va. 668, 40 S. E. 23, and is as follows\" \u201cIn construing a deed or will, the object is to ascertain the inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tion of the maker as gathered from the language used and the general purpose and scope of the instrument, in the light of surrounding circumstances; and when such intention clearly appears by giving the words their natural and ordinary meaning, technical rules of construction will not be invoked to defeat it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Approaching the will in the case before us, with the guidance of these rules and in the light of the situation and circumstances surrounding the testator, it clearly appears from the language used in the will that he made two provisions \u201cfor and during the life of\u201d his-wife, for \u201cher use\u201d and \u201ccomfortable support.\u201d It will be observed, in the first place, that nowhere is she expressly given any power of disposition of the <em>corpus </em>of any of the property; a clear and definite disposition by the testator himself being made in the will of such <em>corpus </em>in remainder \u201cafter the death of my wife\u201d to certain other persons and their descendants. Secondly: the provisions made for the wife are two-fold\u2014 she is (1) left in possession merely of \u201cso much\u201d (of thte personal estate) as she \u201cmay desire to keep for her use;\u201d (2) certain income derived by the executors from the rental of real estate and the interest from the personal estate is to be paid by the executors to the wife \u201cas she needs it so \u2019much as will give her a comfortable support, my wife to be the judge of the amount she may need.\u201d The executors are directed to \u201ctake charge of\u201d all of the personal estate, except that directed to be left in the possession of the wife, \u201cand convert the same into money * * * and shall loam out the same upon proper security.\u201d It is clear that the provision of the will making the wife \u201cthe judge of the amount she may need\u201d refers, not to the personal estate which is to be left in her possession for \u201cher use,\u201d but to the <em>income from </em>rental and <em>interest </em>the executors are to pay her and to that alone. \u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"A9V\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Now with respect to the personal property to be left in the possession of the wife for \u201cher use\u201d: The word \u201cuse\u201d does not in its ordinary meaning import any power of disposition of the <em>corpus </em>referred to \u2014 the <em>jus disponendi </em>of the corpus \u2014 but the contrary; indeed, only the right to use and enjoy the benefit of the corpus is implied by the word \u201cuse.\u201d <em>In re Moore\u2019s Estate, </em>163 Mich. 353, 128 N. W. lt)9. The only proper \u201cuse\u201d to which the intangible personal estate could be put by the wife would be to enjoy the income from it. This \u201cuse\u201d of it the will itself expressly provides for, if it was not meant by the will that this property should be left in the possession of the wife, in that it directs that the executors shall convert all of the personal estate not left in the possession of the wife into money \u201cand shall loan out the same upon proper security\u201d and pay over the income therefrom-to the wife, \u201cas she needs it,\u201d etc. Hence it was not necessary that the intangible personal property should be left in the possession of the wife in order that she might obtain the use of it. The conversion of it into money and the lending of it out by the executors would not have at all interfered with the only proper \u201cuse\u201d she could have of it. Not so as to the tangible personal estate. The conversion of that into money by the executors would have destroyed the benefit to the wife of the natural use to which such property could and would be put by her if she- retained possession of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">It seems clear therefore that the personal estate design nated by the will as being that of which the executors should not \u201ctake charge,\u201d but should leave the possession thereof in the wife, was tangible personal property only.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Further: It is true that the tangible personal property kept by the widow for her use, because of its perishable nature may be consumed in the use, and if so consumed, her estate will not be responsible therefor to the remainder-men under said will. But the intangible personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>is not of like perishable nature and need not be consumed in ifs <em>use. </em>Hence no logical inference can be drawn from the inherent nature of tangible personalty aforesaid that the testator meant to include intangible personalty in the property of which the executors should not take charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The foregoing conclusions give effect to the whole will, its purposes and intention as expressed therein, in favor both of the life tenant and the remaindermen, and do not allow the technical rule of construction of the language \u201cpersonal estate\u201d to be invoked to defeat the natural and ordinary meaning with which the language is used in the will before us, in so far as it refers to the property of which the widow is to retain possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Again: When it is remembered that the will is to be construed as of the date of the death of the testator, such construction gives effect too to the provision in his will, which the testator then properly regarded as being ample to insure \u201ccomfortable support\u201d for his widow during her life. As noted in the statement of facts above, the preponderance of the proof is that, at the time of testator's death, the provisions made in his will for the support of his widow were sufficient to afford her a comfortable support in that mode <em>of </em>and situation in life to which she had been accustomed to live. If the increased cost of living since that time has rendered such provisions made by express provision of the will inadequate for such comfortable support, or should the future increased cost of living induce that result, it is to be deeply regretted, but we cannot on that account change the provisions of the will to meet a contingency not foreseen by the testator. We are satisfied that had he foreseen such a contingency the testator would have made a more ample provision for his widow, to the extent of allowing her the right to the <em>jus disponendi </em>of a portion, and perhaps all, of the <em>corpus, </em>of his estate, if needed for her com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>fortable support. But clearly he did not do so by his will as he expressed it. We cannot change the expression of it for him, however much we might like to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">For the foregoing reasons we are constrained to the opinion that there was error in the decree complained of, in so far as it adjudged that the appellee was entitled to elect to \u201ckeep for her use\u201d the intangible personal property and estate aforesaid, and hence such decree must to that extent be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>Reversed, in part.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
