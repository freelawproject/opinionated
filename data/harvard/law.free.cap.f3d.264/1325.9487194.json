Employees of TVA are, in accord with the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 831 (1994), paid the prevailing wage rates for work of a similar nature in the community. Plaintiffs allege that, though hired by contractors they perform work similar to or equivalent to that done by TVA employees, and therefore are entitled to be paid the same wages paid to trade and labor employees of TVA itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">Plaintiffs allege a federal jurisdictional question. TVA filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and its interpretation and application of statutory provisions. <em>See JBP Acquisitions, LP v. U.S., </em>224 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-8\">The issue before us is whether the district court correctly interpreted 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 831b. The statute states in relevant part: \u201cIn the event any dispute arises as to what are the prevailing rates of wages, the question shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for determination, and his decision shall be final.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 831b. The statute is clear on its face. In this case there is a dispute. The dispute involves the prevailing rates of wages. The Secretary of Labor has exclusive jurisdiction over disputes involving the prevailing rates of wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
