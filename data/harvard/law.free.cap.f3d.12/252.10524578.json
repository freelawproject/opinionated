Gadd for reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to \u00a7 593(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 <em>et seq. </em>(1988), and it appearing to the Court for the reasons more fully set forth in the opinion filed contemporaneously herewith, that the motion is well taken, in part, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED . and DECREED that the United States reimburse Richard B. Gadd for attorneys\u2019 fees he incurred during the investigation by Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh in the amount of $58,410.74. It is further</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that the fee petitions of American National Management Corporation, Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, and Air-mach are denied, this seventh day of January, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Opinion for the Special Division filed PER CURIAM..</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">PER CURIAM:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Richard B. Gadd, who was a participant in the Contra supply network investigated as part of the independent counsel function in this matter, seeks reimbursement under section 593(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 <em>et seq. </em>(1988) (\u201cthe Act\u201d), for attorneys\u2019 fees expended by him allegedly in defense against that investigation. Jointly with Gadd, American National Management Corporation, Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, and Air-maeh, described in the application as \u201cMr. Gadd\u2019s companies,\u201d petition the Court for fees expended by them on behalf of themselves and two company employees, Cindy Dondlinger and John Cupp. As we find Gadd\u2019s application to have some merit, we allow it in part by order filed simultaneously herewith.. ,By the same order, we deny the application of the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">A. The Companies</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">Because the application of the companies is the more easily determined, we will begin with it. We cannot allow that application. Although there may be multiple reasons, one will suffice. The governing statute provides for award \u201cupon the request of an <em>individual </em>who is the subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel,\u201d and only for reimbursement of \u201creasonable attorney fees incurred by that individual.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f). As we have previously admonished, this provision of,the Ethics in Government Act is a limited\" waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States and as such must be narrowly construed and must not b'e extended beyond the scope reasonably intended by Congress. <em>In re Nofziger (Mark </em>A <em>Bragg), </em>956 F.2d 287, 289 (D.C.Cir.1992); <em>In re Nofziger, </em>938 F.2d 1397, 1403 (D.C.Cir.1991); <em>In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d 1192, 1196 (D.C.Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">While' we have not yet addressed the meaning of the term \u201cindividual\u201d in the context-of the Ethics in Government Act\u2019s fee provision, Congress is normally presumed to afford an undefined term its ordinary meeting. <em>Immigration and Naturalization Serv. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). In common usage, \u201cindividual\u201d describes a natural person. <em>See </em>Websteh\u2019s ThiRD New INTERNATIONAL Dictionary 1152 (1981) (defining \u201cindividual\u201d as \u201ca single human being as contrasted with a social group or institution\u201d). According to <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>the legal definition of the term \u201cindividual,\u201d while not excluding corporations in all cases, \u201cvery commonly\u201d connotes a natural person as opposed to a corporate entity. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 773 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201cvery commonly a private or natural person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>as distinguished from a partnership, corporation, or association\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Ash\">Had Congress intended to allow corporations to seek and obtain fee awards, it could have employed language authorizing application by a \u201csubject\u201d rather than \u201can individual who is the subject.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f). Indeed, to construe the statute to allow recovery by a corporation would deprive words used by Congress of all content. \u201c[Cjourts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language superfluous.\u201d <em>Connecticut Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 1149, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). The prior version of the fee provision in the Act specifically provided that any \u201csubject\u201d of an investigation could apply for fees. Pub.L. No. 97-409, \u00a7 5, 96 Stat. 2041 (1983) (formerly codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(g)). While not at all dispositive, this history tends to shore-up'the already evident conclusion that Congress did not waive the government\u2019s sovereign immunity as to fee liability toward corporations as opposed to individuals. Not only a narrow construction, but any reasonable construction of the words of Congress precludes such award.</p>\n<p id=\"A4U\">Although Donlinger and Cupp have not made applications personally, the fee application before us .would not support an award to them even if we construed it to encompass a request on their behalf. The statute again awards reimbursement only for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by that individual.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). We have interpreted the phrase \u201cincurred by that individual\u201d to mean that an individual seeking fees must have actually paid the fees or be legally liable for them. <em>In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d 1415, 1422 (D.C.Cir.1989); <em>In re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d 982, 991 (D.C.Cir.1989). The fee application before the Court does not disclose that Cupp and Donlinger have incurred any fee liability. Therefore, under any construction of the statute, we award no attorneys\u2019 fees for the alleged defense of the corporation or the employees, Donlinger and Cupp.</p>\n<p id=\"ATP7\">B. The Gadd Application</p>\n<p id=\"Akp\">The application of Richard B. Gadd individually requires more extensive treatment and, as we have already indicated, is not without merit. Though we do not award the full amount prayed, our analysis reveals that Gadd is entitled to some attorneys\u2019 fees under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"ADV\">The relevant statute reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOS\">Upon the request of ah individual who is the subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel pursuant to this chapter, the division of the court may, if no indictment is brought against such individual pursuant to that investigation, award reimbursement for those reasonable attor-. neys\u2019 fees incurred by that individual during that investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbRG\">28 U.S.C: \u00a7 593(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"AVv\">Thus, to meet the statutory standard for a fee award, Gadd must demonstrate that the fees for which he seeks reimbursement were incurred during the investigation; while he was a subject of the investigation, and would not have been incurred but for the requirements of the Act. In addition, he must show that the fees are reasonable. <em>See also In re North (Dutton Fee Application), </em>11 F.3d 1075, (D.C.Cir.1993), and' cases collected therein. We consider these requirements in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"Ats4\">1. Subject</p>\n<p id=\"AqBv\">In <em>Dutton, </em>we considered \u00e1t some length the meaning of the requirement that an individual receiving a fee award must be \u201cthe subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1); <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1077-79. We further discussed this subject in <em>In re North (Shultz Fee Application), </em>8 F.3d 847 (D.C.Cir.1993). Without rehashing the reasoning of those cases, we established in them that for purposes of the fee reimbursement provision, a \u201csubject\u201d is an individual who \u201cat the time of incurring the fees involved in the application, knew that his conduct was within th[e] scope [of an investigation] in such a fashion that \u2018the independent counsel might reasonably be expected to point the finger of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>accusation\u2019 at him.\u201d <em>Shultz, </em>8 F.3d at 850 (quoting <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1078). Gadd meets that requirement for a portion' of the period during which his fees were incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Gadd was most similarly situated to the movant in <em>Dutton, </em>whom we previously determined met the statutory requirement. Each was a principal lieutenant of retired Air Force General Richard V. Secord \u201cin the very enterprise which generated for Secord the status of defendant in an Independent Counsel case.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1079. In <em>Dutton, </em>we ruled that the movant there was a subject where \u201cfrequent indictment references to Secord acting in concert with others cover[ed] the activities and period of. Dut-ton\u2019s employment,\u201d although he was n'ever named in any indictment. <em>Id. </em>Gadd\u2019s claim for the status of \u201csubject\u201d is stronger than that of the <em>Dutton </em>applicant. He was mentioned as a principal actor in an overt act listed in the conspiracy indictments of John M. Poindexter, Oliver L. North and Richard V. Secord, brought by the grand jury in an independent counsel case. While obviously being named in an overt act does not automatically confer on one the status of subject, in this case we are satisfied that Gadd has met the statutory requirement..</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Unfortunately for the complete success of Gadd\u2019s application, his status as \u201csubject\u201d did not continue throughout the period during which he incurred attorneys\u2019 fees. On or about July 29, 1987, Gadd\u2019s counsel was able to secure for him a grant of immunity. Although Gadd claims he remained at risk of criminal prosecution subsequent to receiving immunity, we do not find that he was under such reasonable apprehension of prosecution that he qualified as a \u201csubject\u201d under the fee award statute thereafter. As we noted in <em>Dutton, </em>an individual obtaining immunity does not automatically .lose the status of \u201csubject.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1078. However, the grant of immunity \u201cdoes change the reasonable perception\u201d as to whether the purported \u201csubject\u201d is still acting in defense against the independent counsel\u2019s investigation for attorney\u2019s fees incurred from then on. <em>Id. </em>We will therefore disallow all fees sought for services rendered after the grant of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">2. The \u201cBut For\u201d Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Again, Gadd\u2019s position is directly parallel to that of the Dutton applicant. In <em>Dutton, </em>we reaffirmed that the purpose of the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement in the Act is to ensure that subjects \u201c \u201cwho are investigated by independent counsels will be subject only to paying those attorneys\u2019 fees that would normally be paid by private citizens being investigated for the same offense by\u2019 federal executive .components such as the United States Attorney.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1080 (quoting <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d 451, 452-53 (D.C.Cir.1989)). Like the <em>Dutton </em>applicant, Gadd meets the requirement as his attorneys\u2019 fees were incurred because he was a \u201csubject\u201d principally as a result of \u201cthe decision of the Independent Counsel to treat as a criminal conspiracy efforts to circumvent the Boland Amendments\u201d which were riders to certain defense appropriations acts. <em>Id. </em>at 1080. We determined in <em>Dutton </em>\u201cthat executive branch authorities never treated circumvention of the Boland Amendments as having criminal consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded then and now that fees incurred in defense against such an investigation meet the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The only apparent exceptions to this conclusion are that some fees were incurred before the appointment of-the Independent Counsel and others may have involved representation of Gadd in connection with congressional investigations rather than the Independent Counsel investigation. As to the first of these exceptions, those fees must be disallowed, not only because of the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement but also because the statutory grant of attorneys\u2019 fees limits the award to those incurred \u201cduring [the] investigation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). <em>See also Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1079. In this case, as in other recent fee application cases, we referred the matter for comment to the Department of Justice. In their response, for which we are grateful, they noted this problem. Upon receipt of the Department of Justice\u2019s response, Gadd made a further filing candidly conceding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>$12,000 should be deducted as pre-indepen-dent counsel fees. We will make this adjustment in our final fee award computation. As to the second problem, we will make an appropriate adjustment in our final computation, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">3. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">For several reasons, we conclude that there must be some adjustments to the fees prayed on reasonableness grounds. The hourly rates charged by Gadd\u2019s attorneys, $175 for Kenneth Lazarus and $80 for his associate Daniel Q. Greif, appear to be reasonable and are supported by independent affidavits. <em>Olson, </em>884 F.2d at 1423 n. 14. There are however other items which occasion adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">First, the supporting documentation is inadequately detailed. In other cases in which we were not provided appropriate contemporaneous time records, we have imposed a ten percent reduction on the final fee award. <em>Meese, </em>907 F.2d at 1204-05; <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d at 455-56. In this ease, however, the ten percent reduction is not adequate to correct for the lack of clear documentation. A review of the documentation that is available shows that Gadd\u2019s attorneys repeatedly included within their billings time spent dealing with congressional personnel, apparently with reference to the ongoing congressional investigations, not the Independent Counsel\u2019s. While some of this time may not have been spent \u201cbut for\u201d the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation, we certainly cannot ascertain if this is true of all of it. Similarly, Gadd\u2019s counsel repeatedly billed for time spent with the attorneys representing the corporate employees, Donlinger and Cupp. This also is not compensable time. Given the inherent necessity of a ten percent reduction for inadequately justified fees and the dual additional possibility of unjustifiable time, we have determined that a reduction to fees established as reasonable in this case will require a thirty percent adjustment after all other required deductions have been made. <em>See Donovan, </em>877 F.2d at 997 (ordering one-third reduction in one attorney\u2019s billing).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Additionally, the billing statements offered by Gadd\u2019s attorneys in support of the petition include other items that are not reimbursable. For example, the statements include time spent dealing with news media. Because of the lack of sufficient detail in the documentation, we cannot tell how much, but Attorney Lazarus has offered his credible affidavit that the media-related fees did not exceed $2,500 and this amount we shall deduct from the final award.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Similarly, \u25a0 Gadd\u2019s fee application sought reimbursement for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in preparing the fee application. We hav\u00e9 held that \u201cfees for fees\u201d are not reimbursable under' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). <em>Meese, </em>907 F.2d at 1203; <em>In re Olson (Robert M. Perry), </em>892 F.2d 1073, 1074 (D.C.Cir.1990); <em>Olson, </em>884 F.2d at 1427 &amp; n. 19. Gadd\u2019s final computation sheet, which concedes certain deductions, lists \u201cpost-immunity and fees for fees\u201d as $15,000, then lists \u201cadditional fees for fees at $5,000.\u201d Because the post-immunity fees that we are disallowing by themselves greatly exceed the $15,000 first attributed as post-immunity and fees for fees, and because we cannot ascertain precisely what additional fees for fees' Gadd\u2019s counsel refers to, we cannot be precisely guided by his admissions. However, it appears that he has failed to justify approximately $5,000 worth of the fees on this basis in addition to the $5,000 he concedes. Therefore, we will make a deduction of $10,000 for time spent on fees for fees. We recognize that this amount is possibly larger than the amount actually attributable to that item, but, Gadd' has the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of the fees he seeks. <em>See Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1081. In this case, Gadd has actually had an extra chance to demonstrate this reasonableness. Gadd first filed for fees on January 29, 1988, and we rejected that application as premature. <em>In re North (Gadd Fee Application), </em>842 F.2d 340 (D.C.Cir.1988). As he has not yet adequately shouldered this burden, we do not deem it overly harsh that the resulting possibility of error falls on his side.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Finally, there are certain items of expense that may be billable by a law firm to its clients, but that are not reasonable within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the meaning of the statute. For example, billings for refreshments at conferences and g\u00e9neral \u201cbusiness meals\u201d are not reimbursable under the Act. <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1081; <em>Mee se, </em>907 F.2d at 1204. Neither are expenses merely described as \u201cmiscellaneous.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1081. Again, Gadd\u2019s counsel concedes the presence of $1,500 in disallowable, inadequately justified expenses, which we will deduct in the final computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">4. Final Computation</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Gadd\u2019s submission rests on a \u201ccomputation . sheet\u201d claiming total legal fees and expenses of $124,297.42. From this, he deducts post-immunity\u2019and fees for fees of $15,000, media-related fees of $2,500, pre-independent counsel fees of $12,000, additional fees for fees of $5,000, and miscellaneous fees of $1,500, for a total deduction of $36,000. This would leave $88,297.42. Applying the ten percent penalty further reduces that amount by $8,830 to a total of $79,467.42. We do not entirely agree with this computation. The base figure of $124,297.42 is too high. Review of the billing submitted in support of the application reveals attorneys\u2019 fees of $106,660 and expenses of $2,783.91 for the period of November 1986 through July 1987, which concludes with the immunity ending Gadd\u2019s eligibility for reimbursement. Thus, the proper base figure is $109,443.91. From this, we deduct $10,000 as fees for fees billing, leaving $99,-443.91. A further deduction of $12,000 for fees incurred before commencement of the independent counsel investigation yields $87,-443.91.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Deduction of media-related fees ($2,500) yields $84,943.91. Subtracting the, $1,500 in disallowable, inadequately justified expenses gives a total of $83,443.91 against which we will apply the thirty percent reduction. We do not deduct the $15,000 described by Gadd\u2019s counsel as \u201cpost-immunity and fees for fees\u201d as the reduction for fees for fees accounts for a portion of that, and the use of the original base figure of $106,660 as opposed to the proffered $124,297.42 has eliminated all post-immunity billing, including the balance of the fees for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Thus, in short; Gadd is entitled to reimbursement for seventy percent of $83,443.91, or $58,410.74. By judgment of even date herewith, we award that amount to Richard B. Gadd.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
