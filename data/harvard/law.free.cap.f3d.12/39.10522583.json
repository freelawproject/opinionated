GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b120-24\">Jaime Ortiz-Granados (\u201cOrtiz\u201d) was convicted of possessing, importing, and conspiring to possess and import over 100 kilograms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of marihuana,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was sentenced by the district court to a term of 90 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. Ortiz appeals his sentence, claiming that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level for possession of a firearm, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and for assaulting a law enforcement officer, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b). We affirm the district court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">While on duty along the Rio Grande River, United States Border Patrol agents discovered a group of ten to twelve people at the riverbank unloading large bundles of marihuana from a raft. When one of the agents identified himself, a shot was fired from the middle of the group. During the subsequent exchange of gunfire, the group scattered. Ortiz was pursued and found hiding by the riverbank. When arrested, Ortiz did not possess a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Ortiz was convicted of possessing, importing, and conspiring to possess and import in excess of 100 kilograms of marihuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), 846, 952(a), 960(b)(2), and 963. At sentencing, the district court enhanced Ortiz\u2019s base offense level by two levels for possession of a firearm, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and by 3 more levels for assaulting a law enforcement officer, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b). Ortiz\u2019 punishment range, calculated at an offense level of 29, with a criminal history category of I, was 87-108 months. The district court sentenced Ortiz to a term of 90 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">Ortiz claims that the district court erred by assessing a two level sentencing enhancement for possession of a firearm pursuant to U.S.S.G.'\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). For defendants convicted of certain drug-related offenses, \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) directs: \u201cIf a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed, increase [the defendant\u2019s offense level] by 2 levels.\u201d Application note 3 of the Commentary to that section states that \u201c[t]he adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>comment, (n.' 3). We have held that the \u201cclearly improbable\u201d standard of note 3 governs the application of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ortiz contends, nevertheless, that we should \u201creplace\u201d the \u201cclearly improbable\u201d standard because it violates due process by shifting the burden of proof at sentencing from the government to the defendant. We disagree. \u201c[I]t is the firm rule of this circuit that one panel may not overrule the decisions of another.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>933 F.2d 307, 313 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 235, 116 L.Ed.2d 191 (1991). As a result, we may not, as Ortiz asks, \u201creplace\u201d a standard of law adopted by a prior panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b121-19\">Ortiz further contends that the district court erred by applying the enhancement for assault on a law enforcement officer, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7, 3A1.2(b). Section 3A1.2(b) provides for a three level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cduring the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom, the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is otherwise accountable, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement or corrections officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ortiz argues that \u00a7 3A1.2(b) is inapplicable here because it applies only to offenses having individuals as victims, whereas his offense is a \u201cvictimless\u201d crime. Because Ortiz challenges the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that \u00a7 3A1.2 is applicable, we review the district court\u2019s ruling de novo. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>996 F.2d 88, 91 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions with respect to the guidelines.\u201d (citing <em>United States v. Suarez, </em>911 F.2d 1016, 1018 (5th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Sarasti, </em>869 F.2d 805, 806 (5th Cir.1989))).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Ortiz relies on application note 1 of the commentary to \u00a7 3A1.2, which states, \u201cThis guideline applies when specified individuals are victims of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2, comment, (n. I).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since no \u201cspecified individuals\u201d were victims of Ortiz\u2019 offense<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 possessing, importing, and conspiring to possess and import marihuana \u2014 note 1 would foreclose enhancement of Ortiz\u2019 offense level under \u00a7 3A1.2(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[Cjommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993). We reject Ortiz\u2019 argument, because we conclude that application note 1 represents a plainly erroneous reading of \u00a7 3A1.2(b), and therefore should not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Several factors support our conclusion that application note l\u2019s reading of \u00a7 3A1.2(b) is plainly erroneous. First of all, application note 1 is in direct conflict with application note 5. Under application note 1, the enhancement in subsection (b) would not be imposed unless the victim of the offense were among the individuals specified in subsection (a) \u2014 government officers and employees and their relatives.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(a). Application note 5, however, provides that subsection (b) applies to assaults on law enforcement officers in the course of, or in immediate flight following, an offense such as bank robbery, <em>see id., </em>comment, (n. 5), the victim of which is not necessarily, one of the individuals specified in subsection (a). Note 5 further states that subsection (b) \u201cmay apply in connection with a variety of offenses that are not by nature targeted against official victims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Application notes 1 and 5 are therefore in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">Given the conflict between these two application notes, we conclude for several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>reasons that note 5, rather than note 1, should govern the application of \u00a7 3A1.2(b). First of all, application note 5, on its face, explicitly applies to subsection (b), <em>see id., </em>and was added to the guidelines at the same time as subsection (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Application note 1, by contrast, was part of \u00a7 3A1.2 before the addition of subsection (b), and was not amended when subsection (b) was added.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of this history, the Ninth Circuit recently held that application note 1 was intended by the Sentencing Commission to apply only to \u00a7 3A1.2(a). <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>6 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1993). That court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">In 1988, [\u00a7 3A1.2] was amended and subsection (b) added. The Sentencing Commission did not alter Note 1; however, it added Note 5 to interpret subsection (b). Reading [\u00a7 3A1.2] in conjunction with the Commentary, it appears that the Commission intended that Note 1 would apply only to subdivision (a), as was the situation in the original version. Unfortunately, the Commission did not amend Note 1 when it amended the Guideline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><em>Id. </em>Furthermore, application of note 1 to subsection (b) is intrinsically awkward, since subsection (b), unlike note 1, does not refer to \u201cvictims\u201d of the offense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In light of these factors, we conclude, as did the Ninth Circuit in <em>Powell, </em>that application note 5, rather than application note 1, should govern \u00a7 3A1.2(b). This resolution of the conflict between application notes 1 and 6 is consistent with our prior cases,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and those of other circuits,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> applying \u00a7 3A1.2(b). We therefore reject Ortiz\u2019 arg\u00fament that his offense level should not have been enhanced under \u00a7 3A1.2(b) because the victims of his crime were not specified individuals under application note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Lastly, Ortiz argues that there was no evidence that the assault on the Border Patrol agents was reasonably foreseeable to him, and that enhancement of his sentence under \u00a7 3A1.2(b) is therefore premised on a presumption that assaults on law enforcement officers are reasonably foreseeable in every drug conspiracy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Ortiz contends that such a presumption unconstitutionally shifts the burden of proof at sentencing from the state to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">We have observed that firearms are \u201ctools of the trade\u201d of drug traffickers, and that sentencing courts may therefore \u201cordinarily infer that a defendant should have foreseen a co-defendant\u2019s possession of a dangerous weapon, such as a firearm,\u201d where the government proves the existence of a drug distribution scheme. <em>See United States v. Aguilera-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d 1209, 1215-16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>(5th Cir.1990). Ortiz suggests that a similar inference \u2014 that a defendant engaged in a drug distribution scheme should foresee a co-defendant\u2019s assault on a law enforcement officer \u2014 was drawn by the district court in this case, and that that inference amounts to a presumption that assaults on law enforcement officers are reasonably foreseeable in connection with every drug conspiracy. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court drew such an inference in sentencing Ortiz, we disagree with his argument that such an inference shifts the burden of proof to the defendant at sentencing. While approving a similar inference in the context of possession of firearms, <em>see id., </em>we held that in that context the burden of proof at sentencing was on the government. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe burden of proof in this respect is on the government under a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d); <em>Suarez, </em>911 F.2d at 1019 n. 1 <em>(\u201cAguilera-Zapata </em>clearly places the burden on the government to show that a co-defendant \u2018knowingly possessed\u2019 a weapon.\u201d). The presumption which Ortiz posits has no greater tendency to shift the burden of proof at sentencing from the government to the defendant. We therefore reject Ortiz\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\">. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), 846, 952(a), 960(b)(2), and 963 (1988 &amp; West Supp. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\">.
