Bush alleged that the Philadelphia Police fraudulently concealed exculpatory evidence from the prosecutor, the judge, and defense counsel. According to Bush, the police showed his photograph to eyewitness Darlene Roberts and told her Bush was the person who robbed her. He further alleged that he had suffered \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d from the conviction in that he had lost his job and the right to vote, and he cannot serve on a jury. Bush contended that, because the police fraudulently concealed evidence, the statute of limitations was tolled and res judicata did not apply. He sought $700,000,000 in compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">The District Court granted Bush leave to appeal <em>informa pauperis </em>and dismissed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Bush then submitted an amended complaint, in which he noted that habeas corpus relief was not available to him because he was no longer in custody; a section 1983 complaint was his only chance for relief, and he had filed for habeas relief four times without success while he was still in custody. In an order entered on March 22, 2010, the District Court dismissed the amended complaint \u201cpursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(B)(ii), as barred by the statute of limitations and precluded under the doctrine of res <em>judicata.\u201d </em>In the margin, the court set forth three of Bush\u2019s prior cases: <em>Bush v. City of Philadelphia, </em>D.C. Civ. No. 09-cv-04798; <em>Bush v. City of Philadelphia, </em>D.C. Civ. No. 04-cv-05776; and <em>Bush v. City of Philadelphia, </em>D.C. Civ. No. 10-cv-00640. The court\u2019s order concluded with this injunction: \u201cThe Clerk of Court is directed not to accept any further complaints, motions, letters, memoranda, or any other documents that Plaintiff files against Defendants, except for a Notice of Appeal, unless he secures prior approval from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Bush appeals. Our Clerk advised the parties that we might act summarily to dispose of this appeal, <em>see </em>Third Cir. LAE 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, and asked for responses. Bush has submitted five separate responses, which we have considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court to the extent the court dismissed Bush\u2019s civil complaint under the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute, because it clearly appears that no substantial question is presented by this appeal. Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. <em>See also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) (\u201cNotwithstanding any filing fee, or any portion thereof, that may have been paid, the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that\u2014* * * (B) the action or appeal\u2014* * * (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted\u201d). Bush\u2019s civil complaint addressed his allegedly unfair trial and resulting incarceration, the consequences, he contends, of a tainted photographic identification. He sought explicitly to bring his action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging a malicious prosecution and an unconstitutional conviction and sentence. But <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), holds that a prisoner\u2019s civil rights suit for damages or equitable relief is barred unless he can demonstrate that his conviction or sentence has been invalidated. 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Bush\u2019s conviction has never been invalidated. Heck\u2019s favorable termination rule applies \u201cno matter the target of the prisoner\u2019s suit (state conduct leading to conviction or internal prison proceedings)\u2014if success in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration.\u201d <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). <em>See also Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 646-47, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). Success in the instant action would necessarily demonstrate that Bush\u2019s conviction was not valid. Although Bush is no longer in custody, because he properly could, and previously did, avail himself of the habeas corpus remedy, Heck applies to him even though he has since been released. <em>See Gilles v. Davis, </em>427 F.3d 197, 209-10 (3d Cir.2005) (Heck applies to habeas eligible plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">To the extent Bush intended to raise a claim for false arrest, as explained by the District Court in a prior action, <em>Bush v. City of Philadelphia, </em>D.C. Civ. No. 09-cv-04798, the claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations applicable to torts in Pennsylvania, <em>see </em>42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5524(2), (7); <em>see also Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985) (state statute of limitation applies to actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983), insofar as the instant complaint was filed on March 11, 2010, and Bush alleged that he discovered the factual predicate for his claim on November 28, 2003, <em>see Bush v. City of Philadelphia, </em>367 F.Supp.2d 722, 724 (E.D.Pa.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">We will vacate the order to the extent it bars Bush from filing anything further against these defendants without leave of court, and remand. We review that part of the District Court\u2019s order barring the filing of \u201cany further complaints, motions, letters, memoranda, or any other documents that Plaintiff files against Defendants\u201d for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Abdul-Akbar v. Watson, </em>901 F.2d 329, 331 (3d Cir.1990). District</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>courts in this circuit may issue an injunction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), to require litigants who have engaged in abusive, groundless, and vexatious litigation to obtain approval of the court before filing further complaints. <em>See Chipps v. U.S. District Court for Middle District of Pa., </em>882 F.2d 72 (3d Cir.1989). The <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, provides a tool for clearing the docket of frivolous cases, but \u201ca frivolous complaint is one thing; a continuing abuse of process is another. In the case of the latter, [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915] alone is not an efficacious remedy.\u201d <em>See Abdul-Akbar, </em>901 F.2d at 333. A district court is entitled to resort to its powers of injunction and contempt to protect its process when it is confronted with a pattern of conduct that is abusive and when it believes that the abusive conduct will continue if not restrained. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Here, the District Court found a pattern of vexatious litigation on Bush\u2019s part with respect to his claim of false arrest and malicious prosecution, a finding which is supported by the record. It appears that these lawsuits are likely to continue absent some restriction on Bush. <em>Chipps, </em>882 F.2d at 73; <em>see also In re Oliver, </em>682 F.2d 443, 444 (3d Cir.1982). The District Court did not, however, afford Bush the notice and opportunity to respond that are required when injunctions of this type are entered. <em>See, e.g., Gagliardi v. McWilliams, </em>834 F.2d 81, 83 (3d Cir.1987). Generally, the bar should not be imposed by a court without prior notice and some occasion to respond. <em>See id. </em>An injunction barring litigation without leave of court is an exception to the general rule of free access to the courts and its use against a pro se plaintiff must be approached with caution. <em>See In re Oliver, </em>682 F.2d at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Moreover, to protect a litigious party\u2019s legitimate claims, we have approved of a narrowly tailored order \u201cdirecting that the litigant not file any section 1983 claims without leave of court and that in seeking leave of court, the litigant certify (1) that the claims he wishes to present are new claims never before raised and disposed of on the merits by any federal courts, (2) that he believes the facts alleged in his complaint to be true, and (3) that he knows of no reason to believe his claims are foreclosed by controlling law.\u201d <em>Abdul-Akbar, </em>901 F.2d at 333. The injunction entered against Bush by the District Court is insufficiently narrow in that Bush apparently would be barred from filing even brand new claims against the City of Philadelphia. Unless there is a \u201cpattern of vexatious litigation transcending] a particular dispute,\u201d <em>Chipps, </em>882 F.2d at 73, the District Court must \u201cconsider limiting relief \u2018to the preclusion of future lawsuits arising out of the same matters that were the subject of the [prior] dismissed actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gagliardi, </em>834 F.2d at 83). <em>See also Brow v. Farrely, </em>994 F.2d 1027, 1038 (3d Cir.1993). On remand the District Court should give Bush notice and an opportunity to respond, and consider tailoring the order to permit new claims never before raised and disposed of on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court to the extent the complaint and amended complaint were dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii); and vacate that part of the order enjoining Bush from filing anything further against the defendants, and remand. Bush\u2019s motion requesting the District Court Clerk to forward the Notes of Testimony, etc. is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\">.
