Prior to King\u2019s trial, he submitted proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-18\">20. Would anyone be disappointed if Mr. King chose not to take the stand and testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-21\">21. Does everyone agree that Mr. King is under no obligation to testify?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-23\">The district court, over King\u2019s objection, refused to pose these questions to the venire during jury selection. King asserts the district court abused its discretion by failing to adequately <em>voir dire </em>the venire, resulting in a Sixth Amendment violation. King contends his proposed Questions 20 and 21 were necessary to reveal juror bias, and the district court\u2019s failure to ask them deprived him of information upon which to base his strikes, notwithstanding its other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>questions and instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Among the purposes of <em>voir dire </em>are to: (1) determine if prospective jurors are \u201cwilling and able to properly apply the law,\u201d and (2) reveal potential juror bias or prejudice. <em>United States v. Vera, </em>701 F.2d 1349, 1356 (11th Cir.1983). With respect to the first purpose, a district court \u201cdoes not abuse its discretion in precluding voir dire examination of the prospective jurors\u2019 understanding of the law,\u201d provided that the court\u2019s other <em>voir dire </em>questions and later instructions adequately explain the law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">With respect to the second purpose, because a \u201cjuror is poorly placed to make a determination as to his own impartiality,\u201d it is up to the trial court to make that determination. <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>658 F.2d 279, 285 (5th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, the <em>voir dire </em>must be thorough, competent, and complete in order to reveal past histories and personal prejudices. <em>Vezina v. Theriot Marine Servs., Inc., </em>610 F.2d 251 (5th Cir.1980). A district court does not abuse its discretion unless it fails to reasonably assure prejudice would be discovered if present. <em>Tegzes, </em>715 F.2d at 507. Moreover, a curative instruction ordinarily alleviates any potential prejudice, and a jury is presumed to follow the district court\u2019s instructions. <em>United States v. Mock, </em>523 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Although the district court did not submit King\u2019s proposed questions regarding his right not to testify to the venire, the record convinces us the court\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>adequately presented King with the necessary indicia of bias upon which to base his strikes. Furthermore, any flaw in failing to inform the venire about King\u2019s right not to testify during <em>voir dire </em>was cured by the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, which we presume were followed, to draw no inferences from King\u2019s choice not to testify. The district court did not abuse its discretion during <em>voir dire </em>by refusing to ask prospective jurors questions proposed by King. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-8\">. We review a district court\u2019s conduct of <em>voir dire </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vera, </em>701 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s discretion includes whether or not to submit a party\u2019s proposed questions to the venire. <em>United States v. Tegzes, </em>715 F.2d 505, 507 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b971-21\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
