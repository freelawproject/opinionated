He appeals his sentence of 87 months of imprisonment. Zuniga asserts that the district court abused its discretion when it refused his request that it decrease his offense level on the basis that he was a minimal participant or, alternatively, a minor participant in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-22\">According to the factual basis presented by the Government at rearraignment, Zu-niga, an agent employed by the United States Customs and Border Protection Service, picked up Jose Luis Arteaga-Echazarreta (Arteaga), one of his co-conspirators, near the Texas-Mexico border on the day of the offense. Arteaga was carrying a backpack containing 11 one-kilogram bricks of a white powdery substance, with cocaine later being detected. Zuniga drove Arteaga to a Whatabuger in Hidalgo, Texas, where Arteaga was picked up by another co-conspirator. Arteaga told law enforcement authorities that he had paid Zuniga to pick him up and drive him. Zuniga informed the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>that the factual basis recited by the Government was correct. Additionally, he admitted that he picked up Arteaga knowing that Arteaga had a controlled substance in the backpack. Zuniga told the district court that he did so to help in the distribution of that substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">A district court may grant a defendant a mitigating decrease in his offense level depending on his degree of participation in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The determination whether a defendant was a minor or minimal participant is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">A defendant\u2019s participation in an offense is not evaluated with reference \u201cto the entire criminal enterprise of which [the defendant was] a part\u201d; instead, it is evaluated in relation to the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). This court has consequently held that \u00a7 3B1.2 applies only when a defendant is substantially less culpable than the average participant. <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04. And \u201c[i]t is not enough that a defendant does less than other participants; in order to qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that he merits a \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment. <em>Garcia, </em>242 F.3d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The only evidence concerning Zuniga\u2019s role consisted of the PSR\u2019s account of the conspiracy and the facts acknowledged by Zuniga at rearraignment and at sentencing. In making factual determinations with regard to a sentence, a district court may rely on any information contained in the PSR that has any indicium of reliability. <em>United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1992). The defendant bears the burden of showing that the PSR \u201cis materially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Angulo, </em>927 F.2d 202, 205 (5th Cir.1991). Absent credible rebuttal evidence, the sentencing court may adopt the PSR as its own. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>558 F.3d 371, 376-77 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Zuniga presented no evidence to rebut the PSR. The district court adopted the factual recitations in the PSR. Thus, the uncontradicted evidence is that Zuniga fully participated in the conspiracy and made possible the transportation of the cocaine that was in Arteaga\u2019s backpack. Zuniga\u2019s participation was therefore essential, and not merely peripheral, to the advancement of the illicit activity, see <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204, and was \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>242 F.3d at 598-99. Consequently, the district court did not clearly err in denying Zuniga a mitigating role adjustment. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203 &amp; n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b536-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
