According to Garza, the district court erred by concluding that he had committed a new offense and by using this finding both to cancel his release and as a basis for his sentence. Under Garza\u2019s view, the evidence adduced at the revocation hearing did not establish his commission of a new, marijuana-related offense. The abuse of discretion standard applies to our review of the district court\u2019s decision to rescind Garza\u2019s release. <em>See United States v. McCormick, </em>54 F.3d 214, 219 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-27\">We disagree with Garza\u2019s arguments. Our review of the record shows no error in connection with the district court\u2019s conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>sion that Garza committed the new offense alleged in the Petition For Warrant or Summons because the evidence adduced at the revocation hearing sufficed to show that it was more likely than not that Garza committed the disputed offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>see also United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 117-18 (5th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Barksdale-Contreras, </em>972 F.2d 111, 115 (5th Cir.1992). Because the district court\u2019s conclusion concerning Garza\u2019s commission of the new offense was not erroneous, its use of this conclusion to revoke his release and sentence him likewise was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
