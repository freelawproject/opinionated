The district court gave the <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs petition a liberal interpretation, and viewing the petition in that light considered whether she had stated a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The court concluded that she had not. The district court concluded that even if Willis\u2019 inattention claims were substantiated, such individual behavior did not qualify as a violation of \u00a7 1983. The district court also found that her police inattention and harassment claims did not state a \u00a7 1983 claim either, and thus dismissed all of her related claims. Finding that she had stated no federal claim, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-23\">On appeal, Willis simply repeats her earlier arguments alleging police harassment and inaction. She makes no legal argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ment expressing how the district court erred in dismissing her claims, and offers no substantive argument to challenge the district court\u2019s ruling. To the extent that Willis rephrases her argument, she still fails to take into account the reasoning of the district court. Moreover, even if we construe her brief as \u201cnaked assertion that the district court erred,\u201d that is not enough to form an appeal that can be entertained by this court. <em>American States Ins. Co. v. Bailey, </em>133 F.3d 363, 372 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cFailure to provide any legal or factual analysis of an issue results in waiver\u201d); <em>Brinkmann v. Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). In sum, Willis has raised no issue that can be noticed or entertained by this court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
