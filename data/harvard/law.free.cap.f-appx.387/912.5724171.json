Seeing no error in the district court\u2019s sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">During an investigation of child pornography websites, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) agents discovered that Defendant had made at least five payments to a website containing child pornography. After executing a search of Defendant\u2019s residence and examining a laptop computer he surrendered, agents discovered over a thousand images of child pornography. Defendant admitted all of these facts, and plead guilty to one count of possession of child pornography. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B); \u00a7 2252(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">The probation officer preparing Defendant\u2019s PSI calculated the base offense level to be 18, with the following alterations: a two-level enhancement for any images involving prepubescent minors or minors under the age of twelve, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2); a four-level enhancement for depictions of sadistic, masochistic, or violent conduct, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4); a two-level enhancement because the offense involved the use of a computer, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6); a five-level enhancement for involvement of more than 600 images, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D); and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a)~ (b). The total and adjusted offense level was 28, with a criminal history of I. This equated to a Guidelines range of 78-97 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">Defendant did not object to the calculation of the Guidelines range, but argued to the district court that a downward variance was warranted. The district court rejected Defendant\u2019s arguments for a sentence below the Guidelines and sentenced Defendant to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">Defendant appealed, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in choosing his sentence. Among other things, he suggested that the 18 U.S.C. section 3553(a) sentencing factors militated in favor of a downward variance, that the district court erroneously considered the Guidelines to be mandatory, and that the district court presumed that a within-Guidelines sentence was reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-95 &amp; n. 3, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (noting that the Guidelines are not mandatory and that district judges may not presume that a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable). He also contended that the \u00a7 2G2.2 child pornography Guideline is flawed in general and as applied to him. Defendant specifically argued that the child pornography Guideline does not reflect Congressional intent and that district courts should disregard it as a policy matter: Defendant relied on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575-76, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>that district courts may reject the Guidelines\u2019 craek/powder cocaine sentencing ratio based on a policy disagreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in following U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 is meritless. We explained in <em>United States v. Pugh </em>that the child pornography Guideline does \u201cnot exhibit the deficiencies the Supreme Court identified in <em>Kimbrough.\u201d </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1201 &amp; n. 15 (11th Cir.2008). And even if those deficiencies did exist, <em>Kimbrough </em>merely permits district courts to change sentences; they are not required to do so. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575-76. Here, the district court concluded that Congress intended to punish child pornography offenders harshly and so declined to disagree with the Guidelines. This determination is within the district court\u2019s discretion and constitutes no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Defendant\u2019s challenges to the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence are also without merit. The district court properly calculated the Guidelines range, did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory, considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not rely on clearly erroneous facts in choosing a sentence, and adequately explained the sentence it did choose. It has therefore satisfied all procedural requirements for sentencing. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. And the sentence imposed \u2014 at the low end of the Guidelines range \u2014 was not substantively unreasonable: the district court did not exhibit \u201cunjustified reliance on any one section 3553(a) factor\u201d nor did it lack a reasoned evidentiary basis for its decision. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. The sentence imposed, therefore, was not procedurally or substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
