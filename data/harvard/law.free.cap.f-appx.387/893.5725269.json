Seaborne contracted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Aerotech to repair an airplane, and after Aerotech failed timely to complete those repairs, Seaborne sought and an arbitrator awarded damages against Aerotech. Aer-otech argues that the district court \u201cimproperly and erroneously weighed the material facts\u201d in determining whether the arbitrator acted in \u201cmanifest disregard of the law,\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 9 \u2014 9\u201413(b)(5), and Aerotech argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court terminated discovery prematurely. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The contract between Seaborne and Aerotech provided that Aerotech would return or \u201credeliver\u201d the airplane to Seaborne by January 15, 2008, and the contract provided increased payments for an early delivery and compensation for a late one. Article 4.7 stated, \u201cThe parties agree that if redelivery of the Aircraft does not occur on or before the Redelivery Date, payments made by Seaborne to [Aerotech] prior to the Redelivery Date shall constitute full and final settlement of all claims by either Party arising from this contract or related to the Aircraft in any other way.\u201d Article 6.1 provided, \u201cFor each day before the Redelivery Date that [Aerotech] redelivers the Aircraft, Seaborne shall pay [Aerotech] $9,780.00 above and beyond the Contract Price.\u201d In the event of an untimely return of the airplane, Article 6.2 provided that \u201ceach day after the Redelivery Date that [Aerotech] fails to redeliver the Aircraft, [Aerotech] shall pay Seaborne $8,500.00.\u201d The contract also provided that it was to be \u201cgoverned by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia\u201d and any dispute was to be resolved by arbitration. Seaborne and Aerotech later executed an addendum to the contract, which retained the same redelivery date but provided that the parties \u201cagree that no penalty or incentive payments under Article 6 (\u201cPerformance Incentives\u201d) shall accrue\u201d if Aerotech \u201credelivers the Aircraft on or before February 8, 2008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">After Seaborne received the airplane from Aerotech on April 17, 2008, Seaborne sought to recover damages from Aerotech under Article 6.2 of the contract, and the companies submitted their dispute to arbitration. Aerotech argued that Seaborne was \u201cbarred from seeking liquidated damages\u201d under Article 6.2 \u201cbecause its exclusive remedy [was] the payments made\u201d to Aerotech, as provided in Article 4.7. Seaborne referred to Article 6.2 as a \u201cliquidated damages\u201d provision and argued that Article 6.2 satisfied the \u201cconditions for allowable damages under Georgia law.\u201d Aerotech responded that Article 6.2 provided an \u201cinaccurate measure of [Seaborne\u2019s] alleged damages,\u201d and Aerotech argued that Seaborne had not \u201csuffered any economic damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The arbitrator ruled that Seaborne was entitled to recover damages from Aero-tech. \u201cReading the contract as a whole\u201d to determine the intentions of the parties as required by \u201cGeorgia law,\u201d the arbitrator concluded that \u201cthe dominant purpose of the contract was to perform maintenance, repairs, and overhaul of\u2019 the airplane \u201cso as to return it to revenue service by the Redelivery Date\u201d and the parties had incorporated \u201c[(Incentives ... to carry out [that] purpose.\u201d The arbitrator also ruled that the failure of Aerotech to \u201ccomplete work\u201d on the airplane \u201cby the Redelivery Date authorizes assessment of negative incentives pursuant to Article 6\u201d of the October 2007 addendum to the contract. The arbitrator found that Aerotech exceeded the redelivery date by 54 days, which resulted in a \u201ctotal negative incentive\u201d of $459,000. The arbitrator reduced the total negative incentive by amounts owed by Seaborne to calculate a \u201ctotal amount due\u201d by Aerotech of $335,453.87.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Aeroteeh petitioned the district court to vacate the arbitration award and argued that the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of Georgia law by interpreting Article 6.2 as a liquidated damages provision. Seaborne counter-petitioned to enforce the award and later moved for summary judgment. Aeroteeh filed a preliminary report and discovery plan, which the district court approved. Aeroteeh later moved for partial summary judgment regarding its interpretation of Article 6.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Seaborne and confirmed the arbitration award. The district court ruled that the arbitrator had \u201cclearly considered Georgia law with respect to penalty clauses and liquidated damages\u201d and had \u201cdetermined that the performance incentives negotiated by the two sophisticated corporations ... were not penalties but were in the nature of liquidated damages.\u201d The district court ruled that the arbitrator had \u201cnot ignore[d] Georgia law\u201d in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Our review of a summary judgment seeking vacatur of an arbitration award \u201c \u2018is plenary, and we apply the same legal standards that bound the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bruno\u2019s, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int\u2019l Union, Local 1657, </em>858 F.2d 1529, 1531 (11th Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Am. Ass\u2019n of Christian Sch. v. United States, </em>850 F.2d 1510, 1513 (11th Cir.1988)). Under the Georgia Arbitration Code, which the district court applied, \u201cjudicial review of an arbitration award is limited.\u201d <em>Airtab, Inc. v. Limbach Co., LLC, </em>295 Ga.App. 720, 720, 673 S.E.2d 69, 71 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">An arbitration award in Georgia may be vacated in only five narrowly defined circumstances, one of which is \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s manifest disregard of the law.\u201d Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-9-13(b)(5). As its wording suggests, a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d involves more than a \u201c \u2018misapplication of the law to the facts,\u2019 \u201d <em>Airtab, </em>295 Ga.App. at 722, 673 S.E.2d at 72 (quoting <em>Johnson Real Estate Invs. v. Aqua Indus., </em>282 Ga. App. 638, 640, 639 S.E.2d 589, 593 (2006)), or even an \u201cincorrect interpretation of] the law,\u201d <em>BMW Bank of N. Am. v. Short, </em>300 Ga.App. 430, 431, 685 S.E.2d 390, 391 (2009). To warrant relief, the party contesting the award must produce evidence that the arbitrator knew of and \u201cdeliberately ignore[d] applicable law.\u201d <em>Id.; Airtab, </em>295 Ga.App. at 722, 673 S.E.2d at 72; <em>see also O.R. Sec., Inc. v. Prof'l Planning Assocs., Inc., </em>857 F.2d 742, 747 (11th Cir.1988) (applying same test under the Federal Arbitration Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Aeroteeh argues that the district court \u201cimproperly weighed\u201d evidence that the arbitrator disregarded Georgia law by \u201ccharacteriz[ing] Article 6.2 as a \u2018negative incentive\u2019 \u201d and enforcing it as a liquidated damages provision instead of as an unenforceable penalty, but we disagree. Article 6 of the contract is titled \u201cPerformance Incentives.\u201d The arbitrator reasonably construed Article 6.2 as a liquidated damages provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Aeroteeh offered no evidence that the arbitrator deliberately ignored the law. Georgia law provides that parties may agree to liquidated damages in their contracts, <em>see </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 13-6-1, 13-6-7, and require the payment of daily amounts to compensate an aggrieved party) <em>Joyce\u2019s Submarine Sandwiches, Inc. v. Cal. Public Emps. Ret. Sys., </em>195 Ga.App. 748, 749-50, 395 S.E.2d 257, 258-60 (1990) (clause in lease agreement requiring $50 payment each day lessee remained closed provided liquidated damages instead of a penalty). The district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Seaborne.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">The belated argument of Aeroteeh that the district court should have \u201callow[ed] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>discovery to proceed according to\u201d an order entered after Seaborne moved for summary judgment also fails. \u201cDistrict judges are accorded wide discretion in ruling upon discovery motions, and appellate review is accordingly deferential.\u201d <em>Harris v. Chapman, 97 </em>F.3d 499, 506 (11th Cir.1996). Aerotech stated in its request for discovery its belief \u201cthat limited discovery ... may be needed,\u201d but Aerotech never argued in the district court, nor does it argue in this Court, that additional evidence was required to adjudicate this controversy. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment that confirmed the arbitration award in favor of Seaborne.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
