On appeal, he argues: (1) the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress money and a gun; (2) there was insufficient evidence to establish venue on Count 3; (3) his above-Guidelines sentence is unreasonable; (4) the district court erred by denying his motion to forbid the government from requiring a sentence-appeal waiver as a condition of a plea bargain; and (5) the district court abused its discretion in denying him access to a coconspirator\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSI). After carefully considering Miller\u2019s arguments and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">I. Miller\u2019s Motion to Suppress the Money and Gun</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Miller did not have a subjective expectation of privacy in the rental house.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To prove his unconstitutional-search claim, Miller \u201cmust establish both a subjective and an objective expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>See United States v. Segura-Baltazar, </em>448 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, Miller has the burden of demonstrating \u201can actual expectation of privacy ... that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Further, because Miller was neither the owner nor the lessee of the rental home, he must \u201cdemonstrate a significant and current interest\u201d in the property at the time it was searched. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>741 F.2d 363, 366 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Miller has failed to carry his burden in this case. Miller did not have a possessory interest in the rental home because he was never a tenant. A couple named Julian and Denise signed the lease to the rental home in November 2006 and Denise paid the first and last months\u2019 rent. The lease for the rental home was a month-to-month lease with an understanding that Bassano, the property manager, would give the occupants between two and three weeks to clear out their belongings if the lease concluded as a result of nonpayment. Although Miller did pay rent to Bassano for one month, testimony shows that he did so on behalf of Julian and Denise, not for himself. Moreover, the total rent payments \u2014 three months\u2019 worth \u2014 covered only November, December, and January; no rent was paid in February or March and Bassano was not informed that a rent payment was forthcoming. Because Miller knew that Bassa-no would give him at most three weeks to move his belongings out of the house prior to terminating the lease, Miller could not have had an actual expectation of privacy in the rental home when the gun and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>money were found in March 2007. By that point, rent had been overdue for at least five weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Further, Miller was seen at the property only three times, and Miller could not even identify photos of the home at the suppression hearing. Considering all of this evidence, the district court did not clearly err when it found that Miller lacked a subjective expectation of privacy in the rental home at the time of the March 2007 search. <em>See United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1147-48 (11th Cir.1997) (holding the defendant lacked a subjective expectation of privacy in an apartment because he had failed to show that \u201che was the tenant or had an unrestricted right of occupancy or control in the apartment at the time of the search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence as to Miller\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The Government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to prove that venue was proper in the Northern District of Georgia for the \u00a7 924(c)(1) gun-possession offense (Count 3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has held, \u201c[Wjhere a crime consists of distinct parts which have different localities the whole may be tried where any part can be proved to have been done.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno, </em>526 U.S. 275, 281, 119 S.Ct. 1239, 143 L.Ed.2d 388 (1999). Thus, \u201c[wjhere venue is appropriate for the underlying crime of violence, so too it is for the \u00a7 924(c)(1) offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282, 119 S.Ct. 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">In this case, Tiquila Turner testified at trial that, as part of the ongoing drug-trafficking conspiracy to import drugs into the United States, she had made connecting flights in Atlanta with cocaine stored inside her body. This testimony establishes that a portion of the drug-trafficking conspiracy took place in the Northern District of Georgia. Turner then testified that while in Florida, Miller had used a firearm to intimidate her into keeping quiet if she was ever caught with drugs. Thus, because the government presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that part of the underlying crime took part in Atlanta, the Northern District of Georgia was a proper venue to charge the \u00a7 924(c)(1) offense, even though the gun possession itself occurred in Florida. <em>See Rodriguez-Moreno, </em>526 U.S. at 282, 119 S.Ct. 1239 (holding that venue was proper in New Jersey even though the gun was used in Maryland, when a portion of the underlying offense occurred in New Jersey).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">III. Reasonableness of Miller\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing an above-Guidelines sentence for Miller\u2019s violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Pounds, </em>we held that \u201cevery conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) carries with it a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment, regardless of what subsection the defendant is sentenced under.\u201d 230 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">In this case, the permissible sentencing range was between five years\u2019 and life imprisonment for Miller\u2019s violation of \u00a7 924(c). The district court sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>Miller to 119 months for this count, a sentence that is neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable. The district court did not procedurally err because it correctly calculated Miller\u2019s Guidelines\u2019 range, properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and fully explained its reasoned decision for imposing an above-Guideline\u2019s sentence. Both the 119-month sentence for Count 3 and the 240-month total sentence are substantively reasonable, especially considering that Miller\u2019s criminal history category did not reflect his previous murder conviction in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">IV. Miller\u2019s Motion to Forbid Sentence-Appeal Waivers</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The district court did not err in denying Miller\u2019s motion to forbid the government from seeking a sentence-appeal waiver as a condition to entering into a plea agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sentence-appeal waivers are constitutional, as the right to appeal is not a constitutional right, but is rather statutory in nature. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1347 (11th Cir.1993). As such, a sentence-appeal waiver is enforceable if the defendant knowingly and voluntarily consents. <em>Id. </em>at 1350.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">V. Miller\u2019s Request to Disclose Manning\u2019s PSI</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Miller\u2019s request to disclose coconspirator India Manning\u2019s PSI.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Generally, it is presumed that courts will not disclose the contents of the PSI of another individual because routinely doing so would have a \u201cchilling effect on the willingness of various individuals to contribute information that will be incorporated into the report.\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>323 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, a party who requests another\u2019s PSI must \u201cdemonstrate a compelling, particularized need for disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying access to Manning\u2019s PSI because Miller failed to articulate with particularity any compelling need for the information contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-10\">. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review: we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Ramirez, </em>476 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir.2007). We construe all facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, in this case the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1236. Whether a claimant has a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the search is a question of fact that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. McBean, </em>861 F.2d 1570, 1573 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b974-8\">. We review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the government. <em>United States v.

Additionally, as the district court explained, the ripeness doctrine prevented the district court from considering the merits of Miller\u2019s motion because, at the time Miller filed his motion, there was no pending plea agreement between the parties. <em>See Nat'l Adver.
