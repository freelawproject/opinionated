Estrada\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that <em>In re Romalez-Alcaide, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 423, 424-29 (BIA 2002), was decided incorrectly, that this court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>opinion in <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 217-19 (5th Cir.2003), upholding that decision should be reversed, and that his case should be remanded for consideration of his eligibility for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The Respondent argues correctly that a panel of this court may not reverse <em>Mireles-Valdez </em>absence circumstances that are not present, <em>see United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.1993), and moves for summary affirmance. Estrada\u2019s argument that his voluntary departure to Mexico did not break his continuous physical presence in the United States is foreclosed. <em>See Mireles-Valdez, </em>349 F.3d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; MOTION FOR SUMMARY AFFIR-MANCE GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b520-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
