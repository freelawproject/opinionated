However, we withdraw our prior opinion, <em>Al-Mousa v. Holder, </em>No. 07-61003, 2010 WL 1141567 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2010), and substitute the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Abd Alrahman Al-Mousa, a native and citizen of Syria, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denial of his 2007 motion to reopen his removal proceedings. Al-Mousa was removed to Syria in 2005. The BIA rejected his motion to reopen based upon 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] motion to reopen ... shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of ... removal proceedings subsequent to his ... departure from the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Al-Mousa argues that the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen based upon 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d) was contrary to the language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), which provides: \u201cAn alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section....\u201d In support of his argument, he relies in part on the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>William v. </em>Gonzales, 499 F.3d 329, 331-32 (4th Cir.2007), and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinions in <em>Lin v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 979, 981-82 (9th Cir.2007), and <em>Rey-noso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 1001, 1002 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">We find that Al-Mousa\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely; accordingly, we do not reach the issue of whether 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d) is contrary to \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A). Generally, a petitioner must file a motion to reopen within ninety days of the BIA\u2019s decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). It is undisputed that Al-Mousa did not file his motion within this ninety-day period. Al-Mousa argues that his motion to reopen was not untimely because, under \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), \u201c[t]here is no time limit on the filing of a motion to reopen if the ... motion ... is based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality ..., if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">Al-Mousa tries to establish changed country conditions by asserting that after his return to Syria, he was imprisoned, tortured, held incommunicado, and sentenced to death, although his death sentence later was commuted. While Al-Mousa\u2019s experiences since his return truly are deplorable, they do not amount to changed country conditions. In his initial application for withholding of removal, Al-Mousa asserted that he would be arrested and tortured if returned to Syria. In his motion to reopen, Al-Mousa argues that events have unfolded \u201cexactly as he had feared and previously expressed.\u201d Al-Mousa\u2019s assertions describe an ongoing repressive governmental policy which has become more relevant to him since his return to Syria. This does not constitute a \u201cchange\u201d as we have defined that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">The instant case is similar to <em>Keivani v. Gonzales, </em>where we found that Keivani had failed to establish changed country conditions under \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). 214 Fed.Appx. 469, 470 (5th Cir.2007) (per cu-riam) (unpublished). Keivani, a citizen of Iran, contended that her conversion to Christianity constituted changed country conditions. <em>Id. </em>We disagreed, noting that \u201c[ejvidence presented by Keivani estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>lishes that any policy of torturing or persecuting Christians in Iran preceded her initial hearing before the BIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that \u201c[t]he fact that Keivanfs conversion made this fact more relevant to her case\u201d did not indicate a changed country condition. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, in <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>Zhang argued that changed country conditions existed because of new government threats against him due to his Falun Gong activities. 210 Fed.Appx. 438, 439 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (unpublished). We disagreed, explaining that \u201cthe policy at issue here was discoverable prior to Zhang\u2019s first hearing even if it only became material for the first time at a later date.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005) (affirming denial of motion to reopen when the birth of a second child raised for the first time the possibility of persecution under China\u2019s preexisting \u201cone child\u201d policy). Here, the policy at issue was discoverable prior to Al-Mousa\u2019s first hearing. Accordingly, simply because the policy is now being applied to Al-Mousa does not constitute changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Because \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) does not apply, Al-Mousa is subject to the ninety-day limitations period of \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). However, Al-Mousa\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely under \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), and our decision in <em>Ovalles v. Holder </em>bars his arguments. In <em>Ovalles, </em>we first concluded that because \u00a7 1229a(c) did not grant Ovalles the right to file an untimely motion to reconsider or reopen, he could not rely on that statute to challenge the validity of the post-departure bar in \u00a7 1003.2(d). 577 F.3d 288, 296, 299-300 (5th Cir.2009). Similarly, in this case, Al-Mousa cannot rely on \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(A) to challenge the post-departure bar in \u00a7 1003.2(d) because his motion to reopen, which was filed in 2007, more than ninety days after the 2003 final order of removal, was untimely. <em>See id.; </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In <em>Ovalles, </em>we also rejected Ovalles\u2019s reliance on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinions in <em>Lin </em>and <em>Reynoso-Cisneros </em>for the proposition that \u00a7 1003.2(d) did not apply to his case because he was no longer the subject of a removal proceeding. <em>Ovalles, </em>577 F.3d at 297-98. We concluded that the post-departure bar on motions to reconsider and reopen applied and was intended to apply to aliens who departed the country following the termination of their removal proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Because of our holding in <em>Ovalles </em>and Al-Mousa\u2019s failure to establish changed country conditions, Al-Mousa\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
