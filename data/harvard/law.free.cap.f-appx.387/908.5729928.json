Lopez argues that the district court erred by failing to fulfill the requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 because, during the plea colloquy at his change-of-plea hearing, the district court misstated an element of one of the offenses to which he was pleading guilty and did not expressly inform him that he faced a total mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment. Lopez also argues that the district court erred by imposing mandatory minimum sentences on the drug and firearm charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">When, as here, a Rule 11 objection is not raised before the district court, we review it only for plain error. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir.2005). A defendant seeking to establish plain error \u201cmust show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1019. Also, \u201ca defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004); <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1020. Once the defendant has made those required showings, \u201cwe may exercise our discretion to recognize a forfeited error, but only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">Rule 11 requires that, before accepting a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, the district \u201ccourt must inform the defendant of, and ensure that the defendant understands ... the nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(G). Lopez argues that the district court\u2019s plea colloquy was defec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>tive because the district court failed to properly explain the nature of the charges against him as required by Rule 11. He relies on the fact that the district court stated that, if the case were to go to trial, the government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-4\">That from on or about December 2008 continuing through on or about February sixth, 2009 ... you came to a mutual understanding or agreement with at least one other person <em>to attempt </em>to possess five kilograms or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine with the intent to distribute that substance, and knowing the unlawful purpose of that plan you joined in that plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">(emphasis added). As Lopez notes, the district court\u2019s statement in that passage diverged from the language of the indictment, which charged a conspiracy to possess, rather than to attempt to possess, with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Lopez also argues that the district court failed to inform him of, and determine that he understood, \u201cany mandatory minimum penalty\u201d as required by Rule ll(b)(l)(I). The district court explained that the drug conspiracy charge carried a mandatory \u201cminimum sentence of not less than ten years ... imprisonment,\u201d and Lopez stated that he understood that fact. Lopez acknowledges that the district court also explained that the firearm charge \u201ccarries with it a minimum sentence of five years ... imprisonment, which term must run consecutively to any other sentence imposed\u201d for the drug conspiracy charge and the Hobbs Act conspiracy charge. Again, Lopez stated during the change-of-plea hearing that he understood that fact. Lopez argues on appeal that the district court failed to live up to the requirements of Rule 11 because it did not do the math for him and expressly state that, considering the charges to which he was pleading guilty together, he faced a total mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Even assuming that Lopez has established that the district court committed error that is plain, <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019, he has not met the other two requirements for plain error review. Lopez has not established that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the alleged errors, \u201che would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. at 83, 124 S.Ct. at 2340; <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1020. In fact, he has not attempted to make that showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Instead, Lopez admits that \u201cthe record is particularly wanting in regards to what the defendant\u2019s attitude toward the plea would have been had he received complete and adequate information.\u201d He argues that this state of affairs is due to the fact that the court reporter did not identify each of the four defendants by name when identifying the speaker in the transcript of the group change-of-plea hearing, instead referring to each of them as \u201cTHE DEFENDANT.\u201d He then argues that we should accept the alleged ambiguity in the record as a substitute for the required showing that there is a reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded guilty but for the district court\u2019s alleged Rule 11 errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">That argument is meritless. Lopez agreed to the joint change-of-plea colloquy. While the transcript of the hearing does identify each of the defendants as \u201cTHE DEFENDANT,\u201d there is no ambiguity. Except when addressed by name by the district court, each of the four defendants gave the same answers to the district court\u2019s questions. We therefore know exactly how Lopez responded to the district court\u2019s questions. Furthermore, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>outset of the plea colloquy, the district court identified the defendants by name and stated the order in which the defendants were to answer the district court\u2019s questions. Lopez\u2019s specific responses are therefore identifiable. Because the record is not ambiguous, Lopez\u2019s argument that record ambiguity somehow suffices to replace the showing of prejudice required by <em>Dominguez Benitez </em>and <em>Moriarty </em>necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Lopez also challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of mandatory minimum sentences on the drug and firearm charges. Before addressing his arguments, we must determine whether the sentence appeal waiver contained in Lopez\u2019s plea agreement forecloses his effort to contest his sentences. \u201c[T]he determination of whether a defendant effectively \u2014 that is knowingly and voluntarily \u2014 waived his right to appeal his sentence is a question of law that this court reviews <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">We will enforce a sentence appeal waiver \u201cif the government demonstrates <em>either: </em>(1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver during the plea colloquy, or (2) the record clearly shows that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Benitez-Zapata, </em>131 F.3d 1444, 1446 (11th Cir.1997). The district court specifically questioned Lopez about the sentence appeal waiver. In response, Lopez confirmed his understanding of that provision of his plea agreement. He also agreed that he had discussed that provision with his attorney before signing his plea agreement and that he had no questions for the court or his attorney about that provision of the plea agreement. Lopez\u2019s sentence appeal waiver is therefore valid and enforceable. <em>See United States v. Weaver, </em>275 F.3d 1320, 1333 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Howle, </em>166 F.3d 1166, 1168 (11th Cir.1999). Because Lopez\u2019s fifteen year sentence does not fall into the exceptions in the valid sentence appeal waiver, Lopez is precluded from challenging his sentence in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Lopez\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED, and his appeal of his sentence is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
