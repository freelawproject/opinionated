Creed argues that he was deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel because counsel introduced evidence establishing Creed\u2019s guilt. He contends that counsel\u2019s error failed to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing and that prejudice should be presumed under <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Creed\u2019s challenge to counsel\u2019s effective assistance will not be reviewed by this court. Generally, this court addresses claims on direct appeal of inadequate representation only in cases where the record is adequate to allow the court to consider the claim\u2019s merits. <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>882 F.2d 312, 318-14 (5th Cir.1987). In the instant case, the record is not sufficiently developed. Therefore, this court declines to consider this claim without prejudice to Creed\u2019s right to raise it in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 502-06, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (noting that habeas proceedings are the preferred method for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
