Costa Cruise Lines, N.V., LLC, </em>330 Fed.Appx. 892, 895 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant Costa Crociere, S.p.A., finding that Plaintiff Wanda Krupski\u2019s amended complaint did not relate back under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), and was therefore untimely. Specifically, we found that under Rule 15(c)(l)(C)(ii),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Krupski knew or should have known that Costa Crociere was a potential party because Krupski\u2019s passenger ticket identified Costa Crociere as the carrier. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we held that there was no \u201cmistake\u201d because \u201cKrupski chose to sue one potential party and not another even though the identity of both was known to her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Alternatively, we held, Krupski\u2019s delay in seeking leave to amend her original complaint and in filing an amended complaint demonstrated that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying Rule 15(c). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-20\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. A., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2485, 2487, 177 L.Ed.2d 48 (2010), reversed our decision and held that the proper inquiry for relation back under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(l)(C)(ii) \u201cdepends on what the party to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending party\u2019s knowledge or its timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading.\u201d Thus, the question is \u201cwhether Costa Crociere knew or should have known that it would have been named as a defendant but for an error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2493. The Supreme Court made clear that a plaintiffs knowledge of a party\u2019s existence does not automatically equate to absence of mistake. <em>Id. </em>at 2493-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-23\">Here, the Supreme Court found that the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(l)(C)(ii) were met because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>\u201cCosta Crociere should have known that Krupski\u2019s failure to name it as a defendant in her original complaint was due to a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2498. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to Defendant Costa Crociere, and remand for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-18\">. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(l)(C)(ii) states that in order to permit relation back, the newly named defendant must have \u201c[known] or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
