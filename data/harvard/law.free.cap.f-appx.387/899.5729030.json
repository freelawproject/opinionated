She has therefore abandoned any argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her Title VII claims. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhile we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d (citations omitted)). Instead, she argues only that her involuntary transfer to a \u201csurplus\u201d position without notice violated the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between her union and employer. Even broadly construed, however, neither her <em>pro se </em>complaint nor her response to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment fairly raise this issue. This being the case, the issue she now raises was never presented to the district court so that court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the defendants does not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">We have \u201crepeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). We will not allow a plaintiff \u201cto argue a different case from the case she presented to the district court.\u201d <em>Irving v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>136 F.3d 764, 769 (11th Cir.1998). So we decline to address the validity of the defendants\u2019 actions under the collective bargaining agreement here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-7\">. Wallace says we may properly address the issue because she raised it in her trial brief, which was filed more than four months after the defendants filed their motion for summary judgment and three days before the district court entered its order granting that motion. We have carefully reviewed that filing and readily conclude that it was insufficient to place the issue before the district court or to avoid summary judgment on the claims actually presented in Wallace's complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
