California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). King appeals the district court\u2019s revocation of his supervised release and subsequent imposition of a ten month sentence. In her <em>Anders </em>brief, Miller raised four possible issues for appeal, although after an independent review of the record we agree with her conclusion that the appeal lacks merit. Miller\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the revocation of King\u2019s supervised release and his sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
