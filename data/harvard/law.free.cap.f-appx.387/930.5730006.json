Lomax brought suit against Harvey Ruvin, Clerk of Courts for Miami-Dade County, and several other court employees alleging that they conspired to falsely accuse her of removing an original document from a court file, which resulted in a state trial judge issuing her an order to show cause why she should not be held in contempt. It is unclear from the record whether Lomax was actually held in contempt, or if so, whether she appealed that ruling in the state courts. The district court dismissed her action as barred under the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine and therefore frivolous, but did not make any other findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), taking the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). The district court must dismiss an action brought in forma pauperis upon determining that the action: (1) is frivolous or malicious; (2) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (8) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). For \u00a7 1915 purposes, a claim is frivolous when it is \u201cwithout arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The district court\u2019s sole reason for dismissing Lomax\u2019s complaint as frivolous was that it was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Under that doctrine, federal district courts lack jurisdiction to review final state court judgments because \u201cthat task is reserved for state appellate courts or, as a last resort, the United States Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Traditionally, <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>applied when: \u201c(1) the party in federal court is the same as the party in state court; (2) the prior state court ruling was a final or conclusive judgment on the merits, (3) the party seeking relief in federal court had a reasonable opportunity to raise its federal claims in the state court proceeding, and (4) the issue before the federal court was either adjudicated by the state court or was inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Amos v. Glynn County Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>347 F.3d 1249, 1266 n. 11 (11th Cir.2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Recently, however, the Supreme Court admonished lower federal courts for construing <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine too broadly, and held it should be confined only to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). This Court has since recognized that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine should be applied only within the limits set by <em>Exxon. See Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1274 (11th Cir.2009) <em>(Exxon </em>\u201ccasts doubt on the continued viability of the <em>Amos </em>test\u201d); <em>cf. Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1261 <em>(Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine continues to apply with \u201cfull force\u201d under circumstances delineated by <em>Exxon).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">With respect to <em>Exxon\u2019s </em>requirement that the plaintiff be a \u201closer\u201d in state court, we held that a plaintiff who tried to use federal courts to enjoin his ex-wife from enforcing several state-court contempt orders was \u201cjust the sort of \u2018state-court loser\u2019 the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>was designed to turn aside,\u201d because the suit was essentially based on a challenge to the state court\u2019s legal reasoning. <em>Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1261 (alteration omitted). In such cases the plaintiffs proper remedy was a direct appeal in state court, not an attack in federal court. <em>See id. </em>We noted that a federal court is \u201cnot a clearinghouse for [plaintiffs] overstock arguments; if he did not offer them to the state courts \u2014 or if the state courts did not buy them \u2014 he cannot unload them by attempting to sell them to us.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">With respect to the requirement that the state court proceeding must have ended before the federal suit commenced, the Supreme Court clarified that <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>is not triggered \u201csimply by the entry of judgment in state court,\u201d but rather, only when state court adjudication is complete. <em>Exxon, </em>544 U.S. at 292-93, 125 S.Ct. at 1526-27. Further, the challenged state court judgment must be final. <em>Lance v. Dennis, </em>546 U.S. 459, 463, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 1201, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2009). We recently construed this requirement to mean that a state court action is not \u201ccomplete\u201d if the federal action is filed while appeal is still pending in the state courts. <em>Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Here, the record is unclear as to whether the state court actually issued a contempt order, and if so whether Lomax appealed it and what the outcome was on appeal. We cannot tell whether Lomax is a \u201cstate-court loser\u201d within the meaning of <em>Exxon. </em>Accordingly, the district court erred in applying <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>without making factual findings necessary to support its applicability. <em>See also Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1070-71 &amp; n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Given the early stage at which the district court dismissed the suit, before any defendants answered or were even served, there is not enough information in the record for us to determine whether dismissal might have been appropriate on the alternative ground of immunity. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii) (dismissal mandatory if action seeks money damages against defendant who is immune). More facts about the challenged actions are needed to determine whether the defendants, as court employees, would be entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity. <em>Compare Scott v. Dixon, </em>720 F.2d 1542, 1545 (11th Cir.1983) (clerk of court has absolute immunity when performing discretionary functions) <em>and Williams v. Wood, </em>612 F.2d 982, 985 (5th Cir.1980)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (per curiam) (clerk has absolute immunity when carrying out judge\u2019s explicit instructions) <em>with Williams, </em>612 F.2d at 984 (clerk has only qualified immunity when performing routine ministerial duties); <em>cf. Roland v. Phillips, </em>19 F.3d 552, 555-56 (11th Cir.1994) (whether non-judicial officials can claim absolute quasi-judicial immunity depends on \u201cfunctional analysis\u201d of the official\u2019s action in relation to the judicial process). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-7\">. <em>Rooker v.
