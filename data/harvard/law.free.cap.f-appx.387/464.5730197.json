Campos, a citizen and native of the Dominican Republic, petitions this court for review of the order issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) determination that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-22\">Relying on <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263 (5th Cir.2009), <em>reversed, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010); <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333 (5th Cir.2008), and <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572 (2005), <em>abrogated in part by Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 58-60, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), the BIA held that Campos\u2019s second misdemeanor criminal possession of cocaine constituted an aggravated felony because it corresponded to the recidivist provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). The Supreme Court has since reversed <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>rejecting this court\u2019s \u201chypothetical approach\u201d and holding that \u201cthe defendant must ... have been <em>actually convicted </em>of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under federal law.\u201d <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2589. As in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>Campos was not actually convicted under the state recidivist statute. In accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Campos\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>petition for review is GRANTED and the order of the BIA is VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
