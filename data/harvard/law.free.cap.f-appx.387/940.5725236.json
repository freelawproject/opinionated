Rainbow Air\u2019s sole shareholder, Robert Krilich, was named as an additional insured on the policy. New Hampshire sought a declaratory judgment on whether it was liable to Rainbow Air and Krilich (collectively, Krilich) for the loss of the vessel, which partially sank at her berth in clear weather and calm seas. After a five-day bench trial, the district court issued a declaratory judgment in favor of New Hampshire and dismissed with prejudice Krilieh\u2019s breach of contract counterclaim, which had alleged that the vessel was well-maintained and that a rupture in her keel had caused her to sink.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Krilich appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">The maritime insurance policy on the yacht excluded from coverage \u201cany loss or damage arising out of ... lack of reasonable care or due diligence ... in the operation or maintenance\u201d of the vessel. Doc. 158 at 8. The evidence at trial showed that the vessel had developed a fracture in its fiberglass keel, which allowed seawater to pass into the 700 gallon \u201cblack water\u201d sewage holding tank. <em>Id. </em>at 3, 10. The cause of that fracture was undetermined. <em>Id. </em>at 10. The watertight cover for the blackwater tank was unsecured, and water overflowed the tank and filled the bilges and the surrounding engine room space. <em>Id. </em>The vessel\u2019s static water line rose to the height of the sea chests, and their covers were not fastened securely, so water flooded the engine room. <em>Id. </em>at 11. The engine room bilge pumps were either turned off or inoperable, and the bilge alarms did not work. <em>Id. </em>at 12,13.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">After hearing testimony at trial, including that of experts for both sides, the district court found that the fracture in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>keel did not cause the vessel to sink. <em>Id. </em>at 22. Instead, the court concluded that \u201cthe failure to properly maintain\u201d the vessel \u201cby securing the watertight tops on the sea chests and maintaining operational bilge pumps and alarms ... was the proximate, efficient cause of the vessel\u2019s submersion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. The court observed that all of the experts agreed that the vessel \u201cwould not have sunk as quickly or in the manner that it did if the sea chests had been secured watertight.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The court also found that the conditions that led to the vessel\u2019s submersion \u201cwere all detectable through the exercise of due diligence and the implementation of a regularly scheduled inspection and maintenance program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. The unsecured black water tank cover and sea chest covers presented an \u201copen and obvious\u201d condition \u201chad anyone bothered to look.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that Krilich was responsible for the actions of his agent, who was in charge of the vessel\u2019s maintenance, and because the agent did not exercise due diligence in the maintenance of the vessel, it sank. <em>See id. </em>at 24, 28-29. Thus, the court concluded that New Hampshire\u2019s policy provided no coverage for the resulting damage. <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">After trial both sides filed proposed findings and conclusions of law, and Krilich argued that Florida\u2019s concurrent cause doctrine should apply to determine whether the New Hampshire policy covered the loss. The district court found that Kri-lich\u2019s argument was beyond the scope of the parties\u2019 pre-trial stipulation. That stipulation stated that the insurance contract was governed by federal maritime law and/or Florida law, and it did not identify the applicable proximate cause standard. Krilich contends that the district court abused its discretion when it did not consider whether the Florida concurrent cause doctrine instead of the federal maritime proximate cause doctrine could apply to determine causation under the maritime insurance contract. <em>See Hunt v. Marchetti, </em>824 F.2d 916, 918 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201c[A] district court has \u2018wide latitude\u2019 in determining whether a party is bound by a [Fed.] Rule [Civ. P.] 16 pre-trial order, and decisions regarding the effect of pre-trial stipulations will not be disturbed on appeal unless the court\u201d \u201chas clearly abused the broad discretion vested in it by Rule 16.\u201d (brackets and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Under federal maritime law \u201cthe proximate cause is the efficient cause and not a merely incidental cause which may be nearer in time to the result.\u201d <em>Lanasa Fruit S.S. &amp; Imp. Co. v. Universal Ins. Co., </em>302 U.S. 556, 562, 58 S.Ct. 371, 374, 82 L.Ed. 422 (1938); <em>see also Standard Oil Co. v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 54, 58, 71 S.Ct. 135, 137, 95 L.Ed. 68 (1950) (stating that proximate cause is the \u201ccause which is most nearly and essentially connected with the loss as its efficient cause\u201d); <em>Tillery v. Hull &amp; Co., </em>876 F.2d 1517, 1519 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201c[C]ourts seeking to determine the cause of a vessel\u2019s damage assign greater weight to the ultimate, efficient cause than to the temporally remote causes.\u201d); <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Cavanaugh, </em>732 F.2d 832, 835 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cIn admiralty cases the cause which is truly proximate is that which is proximate in efficiency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Florida law has a concurrent cause doctrine. <em>Hrynkiw v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>844 So.2d 739, 745 (Fla. 5th DCA 2003) (\u201cUnder Florida law, the issue of multiple causes in cases involving coverage disputes is usually decided by application of the concurrent cause doctrine.\u201d). That doctrine \u201cpermits coverage when the injury is caused by multiple causes and one of the causes is an insured risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The problem for Krilich, however, is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>Florida doctrine \u201conly applies when the causes are not related and dependent, but rather involve separate and distinct risks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>All of the experts at trial agreed that Krilich\u2019s yacht \u201cwould not have sunk as quickly or in the manner that it did if the sea chests had been secured watertight.\u201d Doc. 158 at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The undisputed evidence showed that keel fracture was not a separate and distinct risk. Instead, it was a link in the chain of related and dependent causes, and at the end of the chain the unsecured sea chests sunk the yacht. <em>See Hrynkiw, </em>844 So.2d at 745. Thus, under Florida law the fracture in the keel was not a concurrent cause. <em>See id. </em>Applying either the federal or the Florida version of the proximate cause doctrine, Krilich loses. It makes no difference, therefore, which one the district court decided to apply. <em>See Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., </em>602 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cThis court may affirm a decision of the district court on any ground supported by the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-15\">.
