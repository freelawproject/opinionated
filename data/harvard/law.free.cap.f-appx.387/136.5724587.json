Aliaj fears persecution in Albania based on his past political activities. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>found no clear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding, and it denied all relief. The Government has moved for summary affirmance of the BIA\u2019s decision. For the reasons that follow, we grant the motion and will deny Aliaj\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Aliaj entered the United States in November 2006, when he was eighteen years old. At a hearing before the Immigration Judge, Aliaj testified that he was born in an Albanian concentration camp.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Aliaj testified that several members of his family \u2014 including his grandfather, father, uncle, and sister \u2014 were persecuted for their anti-Communist/Socialist beliefs. Specifically, Aliaj received anonymous death threats after campaigning for the Democratic Party in a local election. In addition, Aliaj\u2019s sister was arrested on three separate occasions \u201cbecause she was working for the Christian Democratic Party.\u201d While in detention following her third arrest, Aliaj\u2019s sister was raped by police officers. Aliaj testified that he fears removal because the Socialists \u201cknow that I ... worked for the Democratic Party ... [s]o if I am to return, they will target me again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The Immigration Judge found Aliaj\u2019s testimony to lack credibility and denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The BIA dismissed Aliaj\u2019s appeal. In upholding the adverse credibility finding, the BIA relied on four distinct inconsistencies and/or omissions identified by the Immigration Judge: (1) \u201cwhile the respondent testified that his sister had been raped in November or December 2006 because of her political involvement, he did not describe this matter in his asylum application at all\u201d; (2) \u201ccompared with the respondent\u2019s credible fear interview and asylum application, the respondent testified differently about when he received threats\u201d; (3) \u201c[the respondent] did not mention going into hiding in his personal statement\u201d; and (4) \u201c[there was] a discrepancy as to whether the threats were directed to the respondent\u2019s father, or whether they were directed to him.\u201d Furthermore, the BIA found no clear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse corroboration finding, and it determined that Aliaj had not met his burden in demonstrating eligibility for protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Aliaj petitioned for our review. The Government moved for summary affir-mance of the BIA\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aliaj has not filed an opposition to that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Summary action is appropriate when \u201cno substantial question\u201d is presented by an appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6; <em>see also Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">We will grant the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance because this appeal presents no \u201csubstantial question.\u201d The heart of the BIA\u2019s decision is its conclusion that the Immigration Judge\u2019s ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>verse credibility finding is not clearly erroneous. Nevertheless, Aliaj uses only seven sentences of his briefs argument section to address the credibility issue. And none of those sentences mounts a challenge to three of the four ineonsisten-cies/omissions identified by the Immigration Judge and relied upon by the BIA in dismissing the appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aliaj does not direct our attention to portions of the administrative record in order to explain or contest the apparent inconsistencies/omissions. He cites no relevant statutes or case law to support the few, generalized points that he does make.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Our role is not to make arguments for the parties, especially those represented by counsel. We deem Aliaj\u2019s spare briefing to have effectively waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s ruling concerning the Immigration Judge\u2019s credibility finding. <em>See Hoxha v. Holder, </em>559 F.3d 157, 162 (3d Cir.2009); <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 221, 235 (3d Cir.2004). As a result, and because Aliaj does not contest the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT protection, this appeal presents \u201cno substantial question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion is granted, and we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\">. According to the State Department\u2019s 2006 Asylum Profile for Albania, \"during the Communist reign from 1945 to 1990 ... most Albanians suffered under a regime characterized by police brutality and concentration and labor camps.\" (A.R. 188.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-16\">. While the Government asks for \"summary affirmance,\" we understand it to be asking for summary denial of the petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">. Aliaj does argue, without explanation, that he \u201cremained consistent in the chronology of events.\u201d By itself, this contention is grossly insufficient to demonstrate that the credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. In addition, we note that Aliaj uses the majority of his brief to argue for the propriety of \"surprise witnesses\u201d in removal proceedings. This argument is impertinent. Aliaj was not prevented from having his sister, or any other witness, testify before the Immigration Judge. Rather, Aliaj's trial counsel and the Government agreed, for reasons unknown, that Aliaj\u2019s sister would not testify. In any event, it appears that this line of argument was not properly exhausted before the BIA. <em>See Hoxha v. Holder, </em>559 F.3d 157, 159 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
