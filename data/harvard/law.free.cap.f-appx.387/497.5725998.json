California, </em>386 U.S. 788, 87 S.Ct. 1896, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Bryan has filed a response and motion for the appointment of substitute counsel. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Bryan\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. The judgment should be corrected to reflect that Bryan was convicted and sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) and 846 rather than \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Bryan\u2019s motion for the appointment of substitute counsel is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998). This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
