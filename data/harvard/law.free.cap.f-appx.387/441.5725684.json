We DENY the request, because Ceja cannot show the documents to be \u201cmaterial.\u201d He has, in fact, waived his <em>Batson </em>claim. We have held that \u201ca defendant waives objection to a peremptory challenge by failing to dispute the prosecutor\u2019s explanations.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ceja questioned the prosecution\u2019s striking of a man and a woman venireperson, each a minority. The prosecution explained it struck the woman for falling asleep and the man for working a similar job as the defendant. The prosecution, of its own initiative and by way of comparative analysis, noted four other venirepersons (presumably not minorities) struck for the same work-related reason. Ceja did not challenge these race-neutral explanations,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> appearing to acquiesce in them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The jury notes here are similarly immaterial. The government concedes that a defendant has the right to be notified when the court receives communications from the jury so that he can be afforded the opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record reflects that the jury sent three notes to the judge, and the parties agree it is unclear whether the defendant ever knew about the notes. This court, in the interest of judicial economy, has looked at the sealed jury notes, which: (1) ask for a smoke break; (2) request lunch; and (3) inform the judge they have reached a verdict. None of these communications plausibly affect Ceja\u2019s appeal, so we DENY the request to supplement. We also DENY as moot Ceja\u2019s alternative motion to file supplemental briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Moving to the substance of Ceja\u2019s appeal, he argues that\u2014after he did not testify at trial\u2014-the district court erred in failing to give a no adverse inference instruction to the jury. Ceja concedes that plain-error review applies. \u201cA criminal defendant has a Fifth Amendment right for a judge, <em>upon the defendant\u2019s request, </em>to instruct a jury not to make any adverse inferences based on the defendant\u2019s elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>tion not to testify.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ceja did not request the instruction, so it is hard to see how he could show any error to be \u201cplain.\u201d In any event, he cannot meet plain-error review\u2019s third prong, which \u201crequires the defendant to show that the error \u2018affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">In <em>United States v. Percel, </em>this court refused to find plain error where the district judge gave the wrong no adverse inference jury instruction, because \u201cthere [wa]s not a reasonable likelihood that the jury would have applied the judge\u2019s erroneous oral instructions unconstitutionally.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Key to the court\u2019s analysis was that the district judge had given the proper instruction during voir dire.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Flores, </em>this court concluded that the district court\u2019s failure spontaneously to give the no adverse inference instruction did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, based in part on the overwhelming evidence against him.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Ramirez </em>came out the same way.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The district judge here gave the proper instruction several times at voir dire and\u2014 immediately before reading the final instructions \u2014 explained to the jury that for hundreds of years juries have not been allowed to consider the fact that the defendant did not testify. The evidence against Ceja was overwhelming, including half-a-dozen witnesses consistently describing how Ceja ran a drug distribution ring. In short, we are not persuaded that the district court\u2019s omission resulted in a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The district court committed no reversible error.

The Supreme Court has long interpreted <em>Carter </em>to require the no adverse inference instruction only when the defendant requests it. <em>See, e.g., Portuondo v.
