Gohil originally appealed the district court\u2019s order under the collateral order doctrine, pursuant to which we have allowed interlocutory appeals of discovery orders that require disclosure of privileged or confidential information. <em>See In re Ford Motor Co., </em>110 F.3d 954, 964 (3d Cir.1997); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). However, while that appeal was pending, the Supreme Court held that we do not have jurisdiction to review such orders under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 599, 609, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gohil now asks us to exercise our mandamus jurisdiction and vacate the district court\u2019s order. For the reasons that follow, we decline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Gohil\u2019s request to exercise mandamus jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we will recite only as much of the facts and history of this case as is helpful to our brief decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Soon after filing his amended <em>qui tam </em>complaint in federal court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gohil filed an action in state court against Aventis seeking recovery under New Jersey law for constructive termination and retaliation. That case was settled in October of 2005 after three years of litigation, including discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">While that case was pending, Gohil continued to communicate with government attorneys in an effort to have the federal government intervene under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730. On February 9, 2007, after the government refused to intervene, Gohil filed a second amended <em>qui tam </em>complaint in federal court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Since the federal court would not have had jurisdiction over Gohil\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>suit under the FCA if the underlying allegations in that suit were based on information that had been publicly disclosed, Aventis moved for discovery on the issue of the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (2009).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That jurisdictional bar is only lifted if the plaintiff can show that, even if the information had been disclosed publicly, the plaintiff is an \u201coriginal source of the information.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(B) (2009).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Aventis sought discovery because it claimed that it would establish that the information Gohil\u2019s suit was based upon had been publicly disclosed in the course of the employment suit he had brought in state court in New Jersey and that the suit under the FCA was therefore barred under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4) (2009). The district court granted Aventis\u2019s motion and allowed Aventis to \u201ctake discovery relevant to subject matter jurisdiction of the Court over Plaintiff/Relator\u2019s Second Amended Complaint.\u201d J.A. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Thereafter, Aventis requested production of Gohil\u2019s communications with the government. However, Gohil resisted, asserting that those communications were privileged. Aventis insisted that it needed those communications to determine whether Gohil had first-hand knowledge of the facts alleged in his second FCA complaint and moved to compel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">By order dated July 2, 2008, the district court denied Aventis\u2019s motion to compel. However, the court allowed Aventis to proceed with deposing Gohil. It appears that that deposition was particularly contentious. After deposing Gohil, Aventis renewed its motion. The court responded by reviewing the Disclosure Statements \u201cto determine if Defendants should be permitted to re-depose Plaintiff/Relator, and/or if Defendants should be provided with a redacted version of the Disclosure Statements.\u201d J.A. 22</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">After reviewing those documents, the district court concluded that the requested information was not protected by any privilege and granted Aventis\u2019s motion to compel and ordered Gohil to respond to Aven-tis\u2019s discovery requests on December 22, 2008. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In <em>Mohawk, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe collateral order doctrine does not extend to disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 609. However, the Court in <em>Mohawk </em>also made clear that \u201cin extraordinary circumstances-! <em>e., </em>when a disclosure order \u2018amount[s] to a judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion,\u2019 or otherwise works a manifest injustice-a party may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607 (quoting <em>Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for D.C., </em>542 U.S. 367, 390, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004)). Accordingly, Gohil asks that we now exercise mandamus jurisdiction and issue a writ under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, reversing the district court\u2019s order compelling him to respond to Aventis\u2019s discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">As the Supreme Court reiterated: \u201cMandamus is a \u2018drastic and extraordinary\u2019 remedy \u2018reserved for really extraordinary causes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cheney, 542 U.S. </em>at 369, 124 S.Ct. 2576 (quoting <em>Ex parte Fahey, </em>332 U.S. 258, 259-60, 67 S.Ct. 1558, 91 L.Ed. 2041 (1947)). We have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANT\">Three conditions must be satisfied for the issuance of a writ of mandamus: (1) there must be no other adequate means to attain the relief sought; (2) the right to issuance of the writ must be clear and indisputable; and (3) the issuing court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-11\"><em>In re Pressman-Gutman Co., Inc., </em>459 F.3d 383, 399 (3d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Cheney, </em>542 U.S. at 380-81, 124 S.Ct. 2576. In weighing the interests of litigants, the Court in <em>Mohawk </em>explained that \u201cpostjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants and assure the vitality of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 606. Moreover, the Court concluded that \u201cdeferring review until final judgment does not meaningfully reduce the <em>ex ante </em>incentives for full and frank consultations between clients and counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607. The Court also noted that \u201c[w]e routinely require litigants to wait until after final judgment to vindicate valuable rights, including rights central to our adversarial system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that it is \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d that parts of the Disclosure Statements are protected, as Gohil claims, we nevertheless remain far from convinced that there is no other adequate means for him to obtain relief, or that the writ is an appropriate remedy in this case. <em>See In re Pressman-Gutman, </em>459 F.3d at 399. Gohil\u2019s only argument to the contrary is that Aventis will gain insight into his litigation strategy from the documents he would be forced to produce. Appellant\u2019s Suppl. Br. at 5. We are not convinced. The documents or statements that Gohil argues require redaction as \u201ccore work-product\u201d in the sealed appendices by no means reveal a complete litigation strategy. For example, while words like \u201ckey\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d are used to describe potential witnesses, the labels are not explained in detail. That this \u201corder adverse to ... privilege may ... harm [Gohil] in ways that are only imperfectly reparable\u201d is neither a basis for collateral appeal of this order nor the issuance of a writ. <em>Mohawk, </em>130 S.Ct. at 608 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Moreover, the \u201cdistrict judge can better exercise [his or her] responsibility [to police the prejudgment tactics of litigants] if the appellate courts do not repeatedly intervene to second-guess prejudgment rulings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>130 S.Ct. at 605 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, </em>472 U.S. 424, 436, 105 S.Ct. 2757, 86 L.Ed.2d 340 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Accordingly, we are not convinced that the extraordinary relief afforded by mandamus is appropriate and we will therefore refuse to exercise mandamus jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mohawk </em>addressed orders compelling disclosure of information that was allegedly protected by the attorney-client privilege. <em>Mohawk, </em>130 S.Ct. at 609. Gohil acknowledges the Court\u2019s holding also applies to interlocutory appeals of orders requiring production of material alleged to be attorney work product. <em>See </em>Appellant Suppl. Br. at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">.
