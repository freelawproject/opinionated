On appeal, Den-son argues that: (1) his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adjust his guideline range based on the government\u2019s alleged sentencing manipulation; and (2) his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">We review the ultimate sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of [a] sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and a sentence within the guideline range is ordinarily expected to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and brackets omitted). We will remand for resentenc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>ing only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and internal quotation omitted). The burden is on the defendant to show that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">First, we are unpersuaded by Den-son\u2019s claim that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adjust his guideline range based on the government\u2019s alleged sentencing manipulation. \u201cSentencing factor manipulation occurs when the government\u2019s manipulation of a sting operation, even if insufficient to support a due process claim, requires that the manipulation be filtered out of the sentencing calculus.\u201d <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1097 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation and brackets omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2342, 176 L.Ed.2d 564 (2010). \u201cSentencing factor manipulation focuses on the government\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). The defendant bears the high burden of proving that the government\u2019s conduct was sufficiently reprehensible. <em>Id. </em>To prevail on a sentencing factor manipulation claim based on the government\u2019s sting operation, the government must have engaged in \u201cextraordinary misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">We have previously held that the use of a large amount of fictitious drugs by the government in a sting operation did not result in sentencing factor manipulation. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d 1410, 1413-14 (11th Cir.1998). We have also held that the government\u2019s purchase of crack cocaine, rather than powder cocaine, from a defendant was not sentencing manipulation, even though the decision resulted in a longer sentence for the defendant. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1370-71 (11th Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 93, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Further, we have rejected a defendant\u2019s claim of sentencing manipulation where a confidential informant provided the defendant with a firearm equipped with a silencer, the possession of which triggered a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1269-71 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">Denson has not shown that the government\u2019s conduct rose to the level of extraordinary misconduct. The evidence shows that a confidential source (\u201cCS\u201d) bought crack cocaine from Denson three times, each time buying an increased amount. Our previous holdings show that it will not recognize sentencing manipulation based on the government\u2019s decision to purchase a certain substance from a defendant or its decisions that affect the amount of drugs that are involved in a defendant\u2019s offense. <em>See Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d at 1413-14; <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1370-71. In addition, we have held that the government\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level of extraordinary misconduct when it provided the contraband that resulted in the sentencing enhancement, and here, the government did not even provide Denson with the crack cocaine that resulted in his enhanced sentence. <em>See Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d at 1271. We will not infer extraordinary governmental misconduct based on the government\u2019s decision to purchase crack cocaine from Denson on three occasions, even if this decision did result in Denson receiving a longer sentence. <em>See Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1371. Because the district court did not err in rejecting Den-son\u2019s sentencing manipulation argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>correctly calculated Denson\u2019s guideline range and, as discussed below, properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, his sentence was proeedurally reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">We also reject Denson\u2019s claim that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. As previously discussed, the district court did not err in failing to consider the government\u2019s allegedly improper conduct in buying drugs from Denson on several occasions. Furthermore, the district court\u2019s sentence of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment was on the low end of the applicable guideline imprisonment range of 262 to 327 months, and we would ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. In addition, his sentence of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment was well below the statutory maximum term of life imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">The district court, moreover, expressly said that it considered all of the factors contained within \u00a7 3553(a) and that it had given \u201ca lot of thought\u201d to Denson\u2019s argument for a below-guideline sentence. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. The district court also discussed, in depth, the application of several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Denson\u2019s familial circumstances, his past criminal conduct, and the circumstances of the offenses that led to Denson being classified as a career offender. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court further noted that the sentence avoided unwarranted sentencing disparities with the sentences of other defendants who were classified as career criminals. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). The court acknowledged that it could sentence Denson below the applicable guideline range, but found that a within-guideline sentence was appropriate given the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3). Given the due consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors demonstrated by the district court and the discretion the court is afforded in evaluating and weighing those factors, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a low-end guideline range sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-9\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\">. The state court case Denson cites in support of his sentencing manipulation argument is irrelevant because federal law, not state law, controls Denson\u2019s sentencing under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1231 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003) (\"Federal law, not state law, controls the application of the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d). As for Denson\u2019s argument that the government engaged in sentencing manipulation by holding him accountable for marijuana and powder cocaine that he was twice observed with, that also fails since the government did not hold Denson accountable for these drugs. Rather, it was the probation officer in the PSI and the court at sentencing that determined the amount of drugs attributable to Denson. Because a claim of sentencing factor manipulation focuses on the <em>government's </em>conduct, Denson has failed to show that the government engaged in extraordinary misconduct in this regard. <em>See Docampo, </em>573 F.3d at 1097.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
