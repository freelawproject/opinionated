The issues raised on the appeal from the order are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the judgment <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim that the jury verdict should have been set aside as contrary to the weight of the credible evidence is without merit. The operative factor in the court\u2019s determination as to whether to set aside a jury verdict is a finding that the jury could not have reached its verdict on any fair interpretation of the evidence <em>(see, Lolik v Big V Supermarkets, </em>86 NY2d 744).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Here, the defendant nursing home presented evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s hospital release form listed her as \u201cable to ambulate\u201d, her doctor did not order that she be restrained during the day, and the defendant\u2019s policy was that residents were not to be restrained without a doctor\u2019s order. Moreover, the plaintiff did not produce any meaningful evidence showing that the defendant was negligent in its supervision of the decedent. Therefore, the jury could reasonably have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>reached the conclusion it did, and the trial court correctly denied the plaintiffs motion to set aside the verdict.
