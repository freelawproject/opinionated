The clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of defendant-appellant dismissing the complaint. Plaintiff waived the right to payment, based on <em>quantum, meruit, </em>alleged in the first cause of action. A presumption that a contingency fee was chosen instead arises from plaintiff\u2019s failure to elect a fixed payment at the time of its discharge. Such a presumption is also consistent with plaintiffs conduct after being discharged <em>(Matter of Cohen v Grainger, Tesoriero &amp; Bell, </em>81 NY2d 655, 660).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The second cause of action fails to plead a cognizable claim for an account stated and we decline to extend leave to amend the complaint. Concur\u2014Murphy, P. J., Wallach, Nardelli, Tom and Colabella, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
