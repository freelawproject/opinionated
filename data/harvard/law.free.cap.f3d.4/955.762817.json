(Lockheed), appeals from the decision of the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (board) denying Lockheed\u2019s bid protest in connection with the Treasury Multi-User Acquisition Contract (TMAC) awarded by appellee Department of the Treasury<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to intervenor AT &amp; T Federal Systems (AT &amp; T). We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">On January 4,1989, a Request for Proposals (RFP), Solicitation No. IRS-88-079, was issued in connection with TMAC, a contract for the procurement of office automation systems, software, and maintenance/support services for use by the IRS. The goods and services supplied by TMAC would directly affect approximately 130,000 IRS employees. Section M of the RFP stated that award would be made to the vendor whose proposal offers \u201cthe best overall value to the Government\u201d as determined by \u201ccomparing differences in the value of technical features with difference in overall cost to the Government.\u201d Section M stressed technical factors over price but also indicated that the IRS would not award the contract at a significantly higher cost to achieve slightly superior technical features.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Section M.3 of the RFP divided the technical factor into two major features each worth 100 points. The features were in turn divided into subfactors of equal \u201cpoint value\u201d within their respective feature groups. Cost/ price was assigned a value of zero points. Section M.4 of the RFP explained the technical evaluation methodology. To select the winning proposal, the IRS created a formal source selection structure. The structure contained the following entities: (1) a Source Selection Official (SSO) to make the source selection decision; (2) a Source Evaluation Board (SEB) to make recommendations to the SSO; (3) a Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) to perform the technical evaluations of proposals; and (4) a Business Management Evaluation Panel (BMEP) to evaluate the price proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">In response to the IRS solicitation, proposals were submitted in confidence by various vendors including AT &amp; T, Lockheed and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Each submitted proposal contained a recommended system/software/services package and its estimated cost to the government. The cost of the IBM proposal was approximately $700 million while the cost of the Lockheed proposal was about $900 million. In comparison, AT &amp; T\u2019s proposal would cost the government approximately $1.4 billion. Nevertheless, AT &amp; T was awarded the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">Thereafter, IBM and Lockheed protested the nonselection of their proposals. In a hearing before the board <em>(TMAC I), </em>both protestors asserted that the IRS: (1) conducted an improper price evaluation; (2) failed to follow the evaluation scheme stated in the RFP; and (3) misevaluated the protestors\u2019 proposals. In a decision dated September 25, 1991, the board granted the bid protests. In its opinion, the board stated that although the RFP placed technical factors above price, the IRS evaluation scheme had improperly \u201cdiscount[ed] price as a factor almost entirely.\u201d Slip op. at 28. In support of its conclusion, the board noted that there was no analysis explaining why the government would receive benefits commensurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>with the excessive price charged by AT &amp; T.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">The board\u2019s <em>TMAC I </em>decision was also critical of the RFP. \u201c[N]othing in the RFP justified the overwhelming priority that the IRS accorded technical factors over price. The mere statement that technical was more important than cost in no way communicated the degree to which the IRS emphasized the former.\u201d Slip op. at 29. Accordingly, the board instructed the IRS as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">If the agency believes a suitable price/technical tradeoff analysis can be prepared that would comply with the RFP, it may proceed to make one and either confirm the previous award or make a new selection determination as appropriate. Alternatively, based on the award decision that the agency made, if it appears possible that the RFP, as written, will not permit an award in conformance with the Government\u2019s needs, respondent retains discretion to amend the RFP to provide a clear statement of its intention to emphasize technical over cost to the degree it believes necessary, and reopen negotiations or take other appropriate actions in accordance with statute and regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Slip op. at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">After the board\u2019s decision in <em>TMAC I, </em>the IRS formed a \u201cworking group\u201d to advise the SEB and the SSO on how best to proceed. The working group produced a report which concluded that: (1) a price/technical tradeoff could be performed in accordance with the RFP and (2) the tradeoff supported the award to AT &amp; T. The working group report served as the basis for the decision to award AT &amp; T the contract a second time. Once again, Lockheed and IBM protested, and the action was ultimately brought before the board.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-17\">(3) <em>Protests. </em>A protest will be considered by the Board if it includes the information required by 6101.7(b)(2) and is timely filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-18\">(i) A protest based upon alleged improprieties in any type of solicitation which are apparent before bid opening or the closing time for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed before bid opening or the closing time for receipt of initial proposals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">In <em>TMAC II, </em>the board found that the selection of AT &amp; T was consistent with the RFP solicitation and was the most advantageous choice for the government, price and other factors considered. The board noted that because no vendor had timely protested the RFP\u2019s evaluation provisions, the IRS was left with considerable discretion in conducting its analysis. Accordingly, the board denied the bid protests stating that the IRS decision was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion. Lockheed now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">The parties do not dispute the board\u2019s findings of fact. The decision of the board on any question of law is neither final nor conclusive and is reviewed de novo by this court. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(b) (1988); <em>Planning Research Carp. v. United States, </em>971 F.2d 736, 740 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">As an initial matter, we note that in its arguments before this court, Lockheed did not protest alleged improprieties in the RFP. Moreover, because Lockheed failed to timely file a protest with the board based upon alleged improprieties in the RFP\u2019s proposal evaluation provisions, <em>see </em>GSBCA Rules of Practice 5(b)(3)(i),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the board did not address that issue and it cannot be raised now on appeal. <em>Broughton Lumber Co. v.

Hughes Aircraft Co., </em>926 F.2d 1574, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">Effective contracting demands broad discretion. <em>Burroughs Carp. v.

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 558, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1219, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978) (holding that administrative decisions may not be set aside \u201csimply because the court is unhappy with the result reached.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA), which governs this case, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">If the board determines that a challenged agency action <em>violates a statute or regulation </em>or the conditions of any delegation of any procurement authority issued pursuant to this section, the board may suspend, revoke or revise the procurement authority of the Administrator or the Administrator\u2019s delegation of procurement authority applicable to the challenged procurement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">40 U.S.C. \u00a7 759(f)(5)(B) (1988) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">Lockheed argues that the IRS violated applicable statute and regulation by reducing price as a factor in its decision to award the TMAC contract to such an extent that price was effectively eliminated as a consideration. Price (or cost) must always be a \u201cfactor\u201d in an agency\u2019s decision to award a contract. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305(b)(4)(B); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253a(b)(l)(A) (1988); FAR \u00a7 15.-605(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the importance of price in a priee/technical tradeoff must not be discounted to such a degree that it effectively renders the price factor meaningless. <em>See Grumman Data Sys. Corp., </em>GSBCA No. 11635-P, 92-1 BCA CCH f 24,700 at 123,721.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">At first glance, Lockheed\u2019s argument appears persuasive. For example, Lockheed points out that the AT &amp; T proposal costs 100% more than the IBM proposal and one-half billion dollars more than Lockheed\u2019s. Lockheed further notes that, despite the huge difference in price, the board found only two quantified technical subfactors representing less than 15% of all available technical points in which the higher priced AT &amp; T proposal was technologically superior to the Lockheed proposal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, Lockheed asserts that under the IRS\u2019s method of evaluation, Lockheed would not have been awarded the contract even if elements of its proposal were given away for free. Accordingly, Lockheed argues that the IRS would have paid almost any amount to acquire the most technically advantageous package.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">In <em>TMAC I, </em>the board properly found that the price/technical tradeoff analysis presented by the IRS was deficient because it failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>to indicate whether the government would receive benefits commensurate with the price premium it proposed to pay. Without that missing information, the board could not confirm that price had been a factor in the award decision. Similarly, we cannot determine whether the IRS effectively discounted price as a factor without first ascertaining whether the technical advantages of the AT &amp; T proposal were worth their additional cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The board in <em>TMACII </em>found, based upon the IRS\u2019s price/technical tradeoff analysis, that the AT &amp; T technical advantages were worth the extra cost. For example, the board found that the Lockheed software would not increase productivity as much as the AT &amp; T software because Lockheed\u2019s software required users to memorize various operating system commands. While such a small software advantage may have only resulted in a few extra points for the AT &amp; T proposal in the overall evaluation, the board found that the actual dollar value of the software advantage to the IRS was significant. The total productivity value of the AT &amp; T software solution was calculated to be $467 million as compared to $80 million for Lockheed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In addition, the board found that AT &amp; T\u2019s models 2 and 3 multi-user systems (MUSs) significantly outperformed their Lockheed counterparts diming the \u201cFunctional Workload Demonstrations.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The IRS quantified this advantage and calculated productivity values of $500,720,221 for the AT &amp; T MUS models and $35,295,084 for the Lockheed devices. Finally, the board considered the impact of the nonqualified discriminators and found that the AT &amp; T proposal offered substantially more value to the government than the other proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Accordingly, the findings of the board indicate that the IRS, through its price/technical tradeoff analysis, neither disregarded price nor discounted it to such a degree that it was effectively rendered meaningless. The actual productivity values may vary slightly from the IRS estimates. However, Lockheed does not object to the board\u2019s findings, and small or immaterial errors are generally not adequate grounds for a successful protest. <em>See Andersen Consulting, </em>959 F.2d at 932-33; <em>SMS Data Prods. Group, Inc. v. United States, </em>900 F.2d 1553, 1557 (Fed.Cir. 1990); <em>Excavation Constr., Inc. v. United States, </em>494 F.2d 1289, 1293, 204 Ct.Cl. 299 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Lockheed raises a second argument in its brief when it asserts that the IRS abused its discretion by skewing the importance of the two aforementioned technical subfactors, software and MUS productivity, beyond the limits established by the RFP. Lockheed argues that although the two sub-factors represented less than 15% of all available technical points, those subfactors provided the IRS\u2019s main justification for spending millions of additional dollars for the AT &amp; T proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">Section M.3 of the RFP identifies and assigns point values to the technical subfactors considered important by the IRS. The IRS used the assigned point values to evaluate and compare the technical strengths of the different proposals. Cost/price considerations did not enter into this part of the analysis since <em>cost was assigned a value of zero points. </em>After the AT &amp; T proposal\u2019s technical strengths were determined, the IRS then went on to decide whether the value of those technical strengths was worth the higher price.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">Neither the FAR nor the broad language of the RFP requires that evaluation points be proportional to cost. Accordingly, a proposal which is one point better than another but costs millions of dollars more may be selected if the agency can demonstrate within a reasonable certainty that <em>the added value of the proposal is worth the higher price. </em>Here, as we have already noted, the IRS tradeoff analysis revealed that the dollar value of the two technical subfactors together with the value of the nonquantified discriminators justified the additional price of the AT &amp; T proposal. Thus, use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>the IRS\u2019s evaluation method did not constitute an abuse of discretion because the method did not skew the importance of the two technical subfactors.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Government agencies are accorded a good deal of deference in awarding contracts. FAR \u00a7 15.605(b) (1992). Here, the IRS has sufficiently demonstrated that price was a factor in the final decision to award the TMAC contract. The decision of the board is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-12\">. <em>Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. and International Business Machs.
