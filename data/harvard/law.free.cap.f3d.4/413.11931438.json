We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-30\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b474-31\">In 1948 and 1950 Besman and John Lee Hooker wrote a song entitled \u201cBoogie Chil-len\u201d and a derivative work entitled \u201cBoogie Chillen No. 2.\u201d In 1970, Hooker recorded and released a second derivative with the musical group Canned Heat. Besman registered the three works with the United States Copyright Office and, through La Cienega, holds the copyrights. In 1973 Billy Gibbons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Joe Hill, and Frank Beard \u2014 popularly known as the rock band ZZ Top \u2014 authored a song entitled \u201cLa Grange\u201d and registered it as an unpublished work. That song appeared on ZZ Top\u2019s 1973 hit album \u201cTres Hombres.\u201d Ham, doing business as Hamstein Music Company, acquired the rights to \u201cLa Grange\u201d in 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">On July 8,1991, Besman wrote Ham claiming that \u201cLa Grange\u201d infringed the copyrights on \u201cBoogie Chillen\u201d and its derivatives. Ham denied any infringement and, alternatively, asserted various defenses. After an exchange of conflicting expert musicology reports, on April 27, 1992 Ham filed the instant declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bes-man moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. In support of jurisdiction, Ham pointed to Besman\u2019s exploitation of his rights in \u201cBoogie Chillen\u201d nationwide, and the exploitation in Texas through an affiliation agreement with Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the sale of recordings, and the mailing of the 1991 demand letter. Adopting the recommendation of a magistrate judge, the district court granted Besman\u2019s motion; Ham timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">On appeal Ham faults the district court\u2019s personal jurisdiction ruling. Absent any dispute as to the relevant facts, we review such determinations <em>de </em>novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs typically carry the burden of proof on personal jurisdiction by making a <em>prima far cie </em>showing. The district court usually resolves the jurisdictional issue without conducting a hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">A two-step analysis governs the inquiry into personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants. Absent a controlling federal statute regarding service of process, we first determine whether the long arm statute of the forum state permits exercise of jurisdiction. We then determine whether such exercise comports with due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the Texas Supreme Court has interpreted the Texas long arm provisions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as conferring personal jurisdiction over nonresidents whenever consistent with constitutional due process,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we need now answer only the latter inquiry. Due process requires that (1) the defendant have established \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the forum state; and (2) the exercise of personal jurisdiction does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">A defendant has the minimum contacts required by due process where his purposeful activities directed at the forum state have invoked the benefits of that state\u2019s laws, so that he reasonably could anticipate being hauled into court there.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Purposeful forum-directed activity \u2014 even if only a single substantial act \u2014 may permit the exercise of specific jurisdiction in an action arising from or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>related to such acts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ham relies heavily on our eases recognizing that placement of products into the stream of commerce may satisfy the minimum contacts prong of the due process analysis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find those cases distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Clearly, through his affiliation agreement with BMI and distribution of recordings, Besman and La Cienega sought to exploit \u201cBoogie Chillen\u201d and its derivatives on the broadest possible geographical basis. Ham presented evidence that these efforts have borne fruit in Texas. Besman\u2019s activities connect him to Texas within the meaning of our stream of commerce cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Ham, however, has demonstrated at best a highly attenuated relationship between the subject matter of the instant declaratory judgment action and distribution of music in Texas by Besman and La Cienega. Ham alleges no injury flowing from that distribution. Rather, resolution of this action depends solely upon whether \u201cLa Grange\u201d infringed copyrights owned by Besman and La Cienega. Exploitation of the \u201cBoogie Chillen\u201d copyrights by the defendants in no way relates to the merits of that question.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Likewise, Bes-man\u2019s July 8 letter, although it forms the basis for Ham\u2019s allegations about the existence of a live controversy, in no way relates to the merits of the copyright question and thus does not support personal jurisdiction in Texas.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that the instant action does not arise from contacts of Besman and La Cienega with Texas. Exercise of personal jurisdiction over them in the instant action would thus offend due process.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-10\">. On June 10, 1992 Besman filed suit against Ham in federal court in California asserting an identical claim. After denying Ham's motion to transfer that action to Texas, that court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. That ruling is pending appeal before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-11\">. BMI operates as a non-profit performing rights society, obtaining exclusive public performance rights to songs and, in turn, licensing them on a non-exclusive basis to radio stations and other users throughout the United States. Each use of a work from the BMI catalog generates a royalty, which BMI passes on to the copyright owner, net of expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\">. <em>E.g., Bullion v.
