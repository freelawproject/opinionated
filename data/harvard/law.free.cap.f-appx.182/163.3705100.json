Hall disputes the sentencing court\u2019s factual finding regarding the drug quantity attributable to him. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s quantity determination because it was adequately supported by Hall\u2019s own admissions and by the other evidence presented at trial. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999). Hall also asserts the sentencing court erred in declining to award him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. We find no clear error in this respect, especially given that Hall proceeded to a jury trial after he absconded from custody for over a year. <em>See United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 383 (4th Cir.1999). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm Hall\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
