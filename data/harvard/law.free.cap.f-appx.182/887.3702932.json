Arroyo argues that the district court clearly erred when it found Arroyo was not a minor participant in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">On February 17, 2005, the U.S. Coast Guard stopped the fishing vessel <em>Ranger Yacht </em>with Arroyo and several other crew members on board. The Coast Guard discovered approximately 4309 kilograms of cocaine in a hidden compartment. Each crew member was arrested and charged with conspiracy to possess and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a), (g), (j); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">Arroyo pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment. At his sentencing hearing, Arroyo admitted that he knew he would be participating in illegal activity when he boarded the boat, he helped load cocaine onto the boat, and he was promised payment of 35 million pesos for his participation. The Presentence Investigation Report calculated a base offense level of 38, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), and recommended a decrease of two levels under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(7) (2005), and a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Arroyo\u2019s total offense level was 33, with a criminal history category of I; his guidelines sentencing range was 135 to 168 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">Arroyo admitted the factual account of the Presentence Investigation Report, but he argued that he was entitled to a two-level decrease for having a minor role in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The district court disagreed and found that Arroyo \u201cplayed more than a minor role in the offense and is therefore not entitled to the two-level reduction.\u201d The district court sentenced Arroyo to 135 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The guidelines define \u201cminor participant\u201d as one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. \u201cThe defendant bears the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>den of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [ ]he played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which []he has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Arroyo admitted that he was a crew member on the <em>Ranger Yacht, </em>and he presented no evidence that the other crew members had a more active role in the criminal activity than Arroyo. Arroyo\u2019s argument in favor of the departure for being a minor participant was limited to the comments of his counsel, which is insufficient to support a departure. <em>See United States v. Kapelushnik, </em>306 F.3d 1090, 1095 (11th Cir.2002). The district court did not clearly err when it found Arroyo was not a minor participant in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
