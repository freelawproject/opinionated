Roberts appeals the order of the district court dismissing his suit against the Maine Department of Human Services and several current and former state officials (collectively \u201cMDHS\u201d) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This lawsuit arose out of attempts by MDHS to enforce a Maine state court child support order. Roberts sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), alleging that MDHS\u2019s enforcement efforts violated his constitutional rights. The district court held that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred Roberts\u2019s suit. <em>See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">Subsequent to the district court\u2019s dismissal of Roberts\u2019s complaint, the Supreme Court clarified the scope of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine in <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-17\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine ... is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 1521-22; <em>see also Davani v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>434 F.3d 712, 713 (2006) <em>(\u201cExxon </em>requires us to examine whether the state-court loser who files suit in federal district court seeks redress for an injury caused by the state-court decision itself. If he is not challenging the state-court decision, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-19\">Roberts\u2019s complaint alleges a constitutional injury arising not expressly from the state court judgment itself, but rather from MDHS\u2019s post-judgment collection efforts. The district court did not have the benefit of <em>Exxon </em>and <em>Davani </em>in its assessment of the applicability of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Moreover, assuming that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine no longer precludes Roberts\u2019s suit from going forward, the district court has not had an opportunity to address either the merits of Robert\u2019s complaint, or the other defenses raised by MDHS. Because the district court is in the best position to evaluate these matters in the first instance, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand the case for further consideration.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-17\"> Our disposition should not be read as indicating any view regarding the applicability of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine or the other defenses asserted by MDHS, on the merits. We leave these matters for plenary resolution by the district court, as that court deems appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
