He was sentenced to the statutory maximum term of five years imprisonment. Roy appeals his sentence, arguing that the court erred in giving him the maximum sentence without considering the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or the need to avoid disparity in sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-25\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness. Roy contends that the district court failed to explain adequately its reasons for imposing the maximum statutory sentence. He argues that it was error for the district court not to address the mitigating evidence about his offense that he presented to the court, and not to address the principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>proportionality and avoidance of disparity in sentencing. However, this court has held that a sentencing court is presumed to have considered the factors set out in \u00a7 3558(a) unless the record indicates otherwise, and that it need not specifically address each factor. <em>United States v. Legree, </em>205 F.3d 724, 728-29 (4th Cir.2000) (dealing with denial of motion to reduce sentence); <em>see also United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). We have reviewed the court\u2019s statement of its reasons for imposing the maximum sentence and conclude that it adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We find no merit in Roy\u2019s claim that his sentence is unreasonable, disparate, or greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing because Virginia has \u201celiminated adjudication of habitual offenders.\u201d The 1999 change to the Va.Code altered, but did not eliminate, Virginia\u2019s policy of prosecuting those who commit serious traffic violations, and the legislation provided saving provisions for the penalties to be imposed on those previously convicted as habitual offenders for having accumulated such violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-16\"> 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) provides in part that in determining the sentence the court shall consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-17\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-18\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-19\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-26\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-27\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-28\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-29\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
