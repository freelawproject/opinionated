We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we <em>affirm for </em>the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Hobby v. Beneficial Household </em>No. CA-05-238-JBF-TEM; <em>Hobby v. First Baptist Church, </em>No. CA-05-247-JBF-TEM, <em>Hobby v. Beneficial, </em>No. CA-05-274-JBF-FBS (E.D.Va. Aug. 12, 2005). We grant Hobby\u2019s motions to amend and file her informal brief out of time and deny her motion to transfer and for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
