He challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Sanchez-Lopez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Sanchez-Lopez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-19\">Sanchez-Lopez also argues that the district court erred in imposing his sentence when it classified his state conviction as a drug trafficking offense that warranted a 12-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B). Sanchez-Lopez is correct. North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 90-95, the state statute under which Sanchez-Lopez was convicted, is worded so that some, but not all, violations of the statute constitute a drug trafficking offense consistent with the guidelines definition. The offense for which Sanchez-Lopez was convicted, attempted conspiracy to traffic marihuana by possession, is not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as that term is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>defined for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B). <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273-74; <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 352-60, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 217, 163 L.Ed.2d 198 (2005); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Duberney, </em>326 F.3d 613, 617 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Meabe-Morales, </em>165 Fed.Appx. 347, 349 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">We accordingly VACATE Sanchez-Lopez\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
