On appeal, Petitioners argue that substantial evidence did not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination or the IJ\u2019s denial of their asylum application under the INA, in which they claimed Gjekaj was persecuted in Albania because of his membership in Albania\u2019s Democratic Party (\u201cDP\u201d) and participation in the October 1, 2000 local elections there.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mazariegos v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). Under this highly deferential standard of review, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d). A finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.... \u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Petitioners argue that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence because any inconsistencies between Gjekkaj\u2019s testimony and his asylum application were not material. Like other factual findings, credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, meaning that the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-1287 (11th Cir.2005). And \u201can adverse credibility determination <em>alone </em>may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application\u201d when there is no other evidence of persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (emphasis added). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Although minor inconsistencies will not support an adverse credibility finding, inconsistencies that go \u201cto the heart of [the] asylum claim\u201d are sufficient to support such a finding. <em>See Chebchoub v. I.N.S., </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Petitioners have failed to meet their burden to show that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination must be overturned. This is so because substantial evidence supports the determination including inconsistencies (1) between Gjekaj\u2019s statements on his asylum application and his testimony; (2) between Gjekaj\u2019s testimony and his corroborating evidence; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>on the face of his corroborating evidence; and (4) within his testimony. Even if, as Gjekaj argues, some of his testimony at the asylum hearing was <em>roughly </em>consistent with the statements he made in his asylum application, during his testimony, he expanded on his claims, and the underlying facts, thus diminishing the credibility of his testimony. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255 (indicating that \u201cthe absence of embellishments\u201d is one indicator of reliable testimony). Moreover, his testimony, particularly when taken in combination with his corroborating evidence, caused the IJ to question his credibility. The IJ also considered the 2001 Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions on Albania, which stated that claims by Albanian nationals based on political grounds are likely to be incredible, and that the October 2000 elections, upon which Gjekaj\u2019s asylum application partially relied to establish persecution, were tainted by \u201conly minor discrepancies,\u201d with \u201cvery few incidents of violence.\u201d Indeed, the Profile cautions adjudicators to look closely at claims such as Gjekaj\u2019s, and explore other motivations that the claimant may have, including family members already present in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">On this record, based on the inconsistencies between Gjekaj\u2019s asylum application and testimony, as well as the other evidence before the IJ casting doubt on the credibility of Gjekaj\u2019s claim, we cannot say that the record compels reversal of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-6\">. Because we find that Petitioners have not established a case for asylum under the INA, we do not address their arguments that they also satisfied the higher standards for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
