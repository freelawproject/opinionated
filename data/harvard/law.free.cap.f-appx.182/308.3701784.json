He argues that the district court erred by failing to award him a safety-valve adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The district court did not err in determining that \u00a7 5C1.2 was not applicable to Little\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">Little also contends that the district court clearly erred by attributing to him an amount of pseudoephedrine that belonged to his codefendant. The district court\u2019s finding that Little and his codefendant were engaged in jointly undertaken criminal activity was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Ayala, </em>47 F.3d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
