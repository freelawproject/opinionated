We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, the transcript of the district court\u2019s ruling from the bench, and the court\u2019s order partially denying the suppression motion. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The record provides sufficient support for the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hawkins voluntarily consented to the search of his hotel room and vehicle. <em>See United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 558, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (finding that courts should consider age, maturity, and intelligence of defendant in determining whether consent to search was voluntary); <em>United States v. Lattimore, </em>87 F.3d 647, 650 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (noting that \u201cconditions under which the consent to search was given\u201d are relevant). We reject Hawkins\u2019 argument that his encounter with law enforcement officials amounted to a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (stating standard of review for denial of motion to suppress); <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 436-37, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991) (providing standard to determine whether police-citizen encounter amounts to seizure); <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>282 F.3d 302, 309-10 (4th Cir.2002) (same). Finally, as to the storage facility, the court granted the motion to suppress the firearm found during the search. Hawkins points to no other incriminating evidence that was found during the search of the storage facility. We thus conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Hawkins voluntarily consented to the search of his hotel room and automobile, and in denying in part his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Hawkins\u2019 conviction. We deny Hawkins\u2019 motion for substitute counsel, and his request to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> Hawkins apparently waived his right to challenge his sentence on appeal. J.A. 120.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
