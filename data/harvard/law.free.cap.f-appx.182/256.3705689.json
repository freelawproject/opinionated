Hart appeals his sentence, contending that, under <em>United States v. Booker, 543 </em>U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the sentence was imposed in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Hart\u2019s criminal record included felony convictions for multiple incidents of breaking and entering and arson committed in 1997; breaking and entering in 2003; and both kidnaping and assault with a deadly weapon in 2004. Hart does not dispute that he qualified for sentencing as an armed career criminal, but asserts that the sentence is unconstitutional because the indictment did not charge that he had three qualifying prior convictions committed on occasions different from one other, and because the necessary facts were neither proved by the government beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by him. Hart acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 281-83 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that judicial armed career criminal designation does not violate Fifth or Sixth Amendment under <em>Booker </em>or <em>Shepard </em>if \u201cthe facts necessary to support the enhancement inhere in the fact of [the] conviction[s]\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">We therefore conclude that no error occurred and that the sentence was reasonable. We affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
