Montgomery argues (1) that the district court\u2019s factual finding that Montgomery\u2019s offense involved \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d was clearly erroneous, (2) that the district court committed Blakely<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> error in increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2 for \u201cmore than minimal planning,\u201d and (3) that the career-offender enhancement of Montgomery\u2019s sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi</em><footnotemark><em>***</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-21\">Montgomery and his three cell mates were members of the Black Gangster Disciples (BGD). Montgomery and two of his cell mates fashioned weapons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>from razors provided to them for shaving. Montgomery then obtained permission from a BGD board member to attack Lucius Allen, the fourth cell mate. Montgomery and the two other attackers admitted that they attacked Allen with weapons made from the razors. These factual findings were sufficient to support the two-level adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(1) for \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, comment. (n.3). The district court did not clearly err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">For the first time on appeal, Montgomery asserts a <em>Blakely </em>challenge to the two-level adjustment for \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d Although the first two prongs of the plain-error standard are satisfied, Montgomery cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cThe judge imposed a sentence in the middle of the properly determined Guidelines range, and there is no indication in the record from the judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise that the judge would have reached a different conclusion in an advisory regime.\u201d <em>United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 395 (5th Cir.2005). Montgomery is not entitled to resentencing under <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Finally, Montgomery\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>challenge to the district court\u2019s use of the career-offender guideline has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1080, 163 L.Ed.2d 898 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
