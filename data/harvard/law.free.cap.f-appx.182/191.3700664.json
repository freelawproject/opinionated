On appeal he raises two issues, whether: (1) the district court erred by holding him accountable at sentencing for approximately 670 grams of methamphetamine and (2) his sentence was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-20\">First, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in its factual determination that Wishon should be held accountable for approximately 670 grams of methamphetamine at sentencing. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989) (giving review standard). Second, we conclude that Wishon\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (stating review standard); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (same). Indeed, Wishon\u2019s 100-month sentence was below his properly calculated Sentencing Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-21\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
