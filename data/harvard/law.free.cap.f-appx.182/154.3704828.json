Counsel for Louthian filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, in which he states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggests that the district court erred in departing upward from the Guideline<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> range in sentencing Louthian. Louthian was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The probation officer concluded that Louthian qualified for sentencing as a career offender and an armed career criminal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and calculated a Guideline range of 272 to 319 months of imprisonment. The probation officer also recommended an upward departure from the Guideline range based upon Louthian\u2019s prior convictions and the nature of those crimes. Louthian objected to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation for an upward departure, contending that the calculated Guideline range provided adequate punishment options for the district court in his case. The district court concluded that an upward departure was warranted, determined that a departure to offense level thirty-six in criminal history category VI was appropriate, and sentenced Louthian to 360 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">On appeal, Louthian repeats his arguments that an upward departure was not warranted in this case, and that even if a departure was appropriate, the district court erred in determining the extent of the departure. \u201cIf reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). We have noted that \u201c[s]ection 4A1.3 was drafted in classic catch-all terms for the unusual but serious situation where the criminal history category does not adequately reflect past criminal conduct or predict future criminal behavior.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>349 F.3d 724, 730 (4th Cir.2003). \u201cIn determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal record.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 comment. (n.2(B)). In deciding the extent of a departure in the case of a defendant who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>already in criminal history category six, \u201cthe court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Our review of the record reveals that the district court explained in great detail its decision that an upward departure was appropriate in this case, as well as its reasoning supporting a conclusion that the intervening offense level of thirty-five did not adequately address the inadequacy of Louthiaris criminal history. We conclude that, under either a de novo or abuse of discretion standard of review, the district court did not err in its decision to upwardly depart, or its selection of the ultimate sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have thoroughly examined the entire record, including the transcripts of the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 and sentencing hearings, for any other potentially meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Louthiaris convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">. <em>Anders v.
