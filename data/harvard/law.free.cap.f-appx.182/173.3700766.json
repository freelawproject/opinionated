Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006). We therefore deny both petitions for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In Re: Okello, </em>No. A75843-249 (B.I.A. Oct. 8, 2004 &amp; Feb. 9, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
