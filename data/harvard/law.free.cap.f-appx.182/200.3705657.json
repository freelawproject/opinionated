Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.2005) (finding 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(c)(8) (2006), which provides that an arriving alien who is in removal proceedings is ineligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident alien, invalid under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) (2000)), and other cases construing \u00a7 1245.1(c)(8). However, the decision of the Board in this case is based on 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1) (2006), which applies when an alien attempts to renew a request for adjustment of status after a denial by the District Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Under \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1), Ore-Jimenez is not eligible to reapply for adjustment of status because he has had no \u201cearlier inspection and admission to the United States.\u201d <em>See Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 649, 652-53 (9th Cir.2005) (holding arriving alien who has received advance parole is \u201cnot eligible to renew his application for adjustment of status during removal proceedings\u201d under \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1); regulation does not violate 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-10\">.
