Wright alleged that defendants, the Sheriff of the Newport News City Jail and members of the medical staff at the jail, violated his Eighth Amendment rights through deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. We vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>A pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings should be construed liberally to avoid inequity. <em>Gordon v. Leeke, 574 F.2d 1147, 1151 (4th </em>Cir.1978). However, the district court \u201cshall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that the action ... fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We review de novo dismissals for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), to determine whether dismissal would be appropriate under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>See De\u2019Lonta v. Angelone, </em>330 F.3d 630, 633 (4th Cir.2003). \u201c[A] district court may dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Lambeth v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>407 F.3d 266, 268 (4th Cir.2005). In evaluating such a dismissal, we accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint, viewing those allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and decide whether the pleadings allege facts that, if proved to be true, would entitle the plaintiff to relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">A prison official unnecessarily and wantonly inflicts pain proscribed by the Eighth Amendment by acting with deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). In order to support such a claim, a prisoner \u201cmust allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 97 S.Ct. 285. We conclude that Wright sufficiently stated such a claim of deliberate indifference to his medical need regarding his cancer treatment. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-24\">. No part of this opinion should be read as an indication of our assessment of the merits of Wright\u2019s claims, as we conclude only that they were prematurely dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
