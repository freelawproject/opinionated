The district court sentenced McElveen to an aggregate sentence of 476 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years total term of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $500 statutory assessment and restitution of $8421. McElveen\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising three issues, but stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. McElveen has filed a <em>pro se </em>brief raising a number of additional issues for this court\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">McElveen, by counsel, first asserts error in the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for acquittal based on lack of proof of interference with interstate commerce. We find sufficient to establish the requisite nexus the Government\u2019s evidence that the crime constituted the taking of money that could have been used to purchase out-of-state supplies and resulted in the closing of the bank for business for a day following the robbery. <em>See e.g., United States v. Buffey, </em>899 F.2d 1402, 1404 (4th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Elders, </em>569 F.2d 1020, 1023-24 (7th Cir.1978)) (holding <em>de minimis </em>nexus sufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Next, McElveen and his counsel challenge the identification testimony before the grand jury and at trial, and the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion on the same basis. We find this claim unavailing because the district court properly followed the two-step analysis to determine whether the challenged identification was admissible, and McElveen has not met his burden of proof in challenging the identification testimony. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>114 F.3d 435, 441 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">By counsel, McElveen asserts error in the district court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement to his sentence pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B) (2003). A careful review of the sentencing transcript reveals that the district court ultimately chose not to apply this enhancement to McElveen\u2019s guideline calculation, and further reveals that McElveen was sentenced within a properly calculated Guidelines range under an advisory sentencing scheme, in compliance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">After careful consideration, we find to be without merit the additional issues McElveen raises <em>pro se.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>McElveen\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not cognizable on direct appeal, as the record does not conclusively establish such ineffectiveness. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this ease and have found no meritorious issues for ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>peal. We therefore affirm McElveen\u2019s conviction and sentence. At this juncture, we deny McElveen\u2019s motion to relieve his attorney. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"><em> </em>Specifically, McElveen challenges the credibility of the testimony of his co-Defendant, asserts his conviction violates the prohibition against double jeopardy, challenges the court\u2019s denial of his requests to attend attorney bench conferences, and seeks to assert a claim under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
