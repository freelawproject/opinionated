Ponce-Sanchez, </em>115 Fed.Appx. 741 (5th Cir.2004), <em>cert. granted, </em>544 U.S. 996, 125 S.Ct. 1952, 161 L.Ed.2d 767 (2005). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-19\">Ponce-Sanchez acknowledges that he challenged the constitutionality of his sentence on the principles of <em>Booker </em>for the first time in his petition for writ of certiorari. Absent extraordinary circumstances, we will not consider a defendant\u2019s <em>Booker-related </em>claim presented for the first time in a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Had Ponce-Sanchez raised his <em>Booker </em>argument in his initial appellate brief, this court would have reviewed the argument for plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 677. Ponce-Sanchez concedes he cannot show that any error affected his substantial rights, as is required under our circuit\u2019s plain error review. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Because Ponce-Sanchez fails plain error review, he also fails to show extraordinary circumstances, which is a more demanding standard. <em>Taylor, </em>409 F.3d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-22\">For the first time in his supplemental brief following the Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>remand, Ponce-Sanchez argues that the district court erred in applying a sentencing enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(B)(1)(A)(ii), for a prior conviction for a crime of violence, based on his Washington state conviction of third-degree assault of a child. When a case is remanded to this court from the Supreme Court in limited terms, as was this one, we must confine our review to matters within the remand order. <em>United States v. Duarte-Juarez, </em>441 F.3d 336, 340 (5th Cir.2006). <em>Booker </em>does not implicate the district court\u2019s application of the crime-of-violenee enhancement at issue here. Accordingly, we will not consider Ponce-Sanchez\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Each of Ponce-Sanchez\u2019s other contentions is foreclosed. His claim that the remedial portion of <em>Booker </em>should not be given retroactive effect is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 575-77 (5th Cir.2005). His claim that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\"><em>Booker </em>does not require this court to change the prior affirmance in Ponce-Sanchez\u2019s case. Accordingly, we REINSTATE our judgment affirming Ponce-Sanchez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\">. Ponce-Sanchez\u2019s argument that an intervening change in law requires us to review the enhancement is meritless. The case which he claims constitutes intervening law, <em>United States v. Vasquez-Torres, </em>134 Fed.Appx. 648 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 289, 163 L.Ed.2d 254 (2005), not only is non-binding but also does not represent an intervening change in law, as it relies on this circuit\u2019s established precedent in <em>United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 312-13 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
