He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of relief on his 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motion challenging his life sentence for the drug offense. Lewis has moved to stay his appeal pending Supreme Court decisions in two unrelated cases. Because <em>Mayle v. Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2562, 162 L.Ed.2d 582 (2005), has been decided, this motion is DENIED as unnecessary. Lewis\u2019s motion for a stay pending a decision in <em>Washington v. Recuenco, </em>154 Wash.2d 156, 110 P.3d 188, <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 478, 163 L.Ed.2d 362 (2005), is also DENIED. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>367 F.3d 278, 285-86 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1005, 125 S.Ct. 623, 160 L.Ed.2d 466 (2004); <em>cf. Wicker v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 155, 157-58 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) as to four issues. Lewis moves for a supplemental COA on his assertion that his enhanced sentence violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Lewis, however, has not shown \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Accordingly, COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Lewis contends that his appellate attorney rendered ineffective assistance by not raising a claim pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He has not established a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of \u201ca different outcome if the attorney [had] adequately addressed the issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Dovalina, </em>262 F.3d 472, 474-75 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Lewis argues that his sentence violated due process under <em>Apprendi </em>because the jury had not made a finding of the requisite drug quantity to support his life sentence. He maintains that he has established cause and prejudice for failing to raise the claim on direct appeal, allowing him to present it in his \u00a7 2255 motion. Because Lewis has not established the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel, he has not shown cause to overcome the procedural default. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>68 F.3d 931, 934 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">Lewis asserts that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion to add a claim that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not raising at sentencing a challenge to his life sentence pursuant to <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999). Even if it is assumed that the amendment would relate back to the time of Lewis\u2019s original pleading under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(2), Lewis is not entitled to relief on this ground. He has not established that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Rios-Quintero, </em>204 F.3d 214, 215 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Lucas v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 1069, 1078-79 (5th Cir.1998). The judgment of the district court denying Lewis\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
