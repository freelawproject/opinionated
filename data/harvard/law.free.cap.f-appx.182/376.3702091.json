He argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-28\">Luevano-Orozco\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Although Luevano-Orozco contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Luevano-Orozco properly concedes that this argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Luevano-Orozco also argues that the district court erred in departing upward based on improper factors not permitted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2). A post-<em>Booker </em>discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006). If the district court imposed a sentence outside of the guideline range, it must give specific reasons so that we can ascertain the reasonableness of the sentence. <em>United States v. Hardin, </em>437 F.3d 463, 470-71 (5th Cir.2006). The effect of <em>Booker </em>is \u201cto return essentially to the abuse-of-discretion standard [for upward departures] employed prior to 2003.\u201d <em>United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 416 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 25, 2006) (No. 05-948).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Luevano-Orzoco has not shown that the district court\u2019s upward departure was an abuse of discretion or unreasonable. The district court properly considered factors that are permissible under \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2), including Luevano-Orozco\u2019s old convictions involving similar or serious dissimilar conduct, <em>see </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.8); his juvenile adjudications, <em>see United States v. Hawkins, </em>87 F.3d 722, 730 (5th Cir.1996); and lenient sentences for prior convictions. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004). The district court did not base its decision to depart upward on his arrest record. The district court did not err in considering California criminal record printouts of his prior convictions as these records established the offenses, and he does not argue on appeal that he was not previously convicted of these offenses. Further, Luevano-Orozco had been deported seven times, and he returned to commit additional crimes upon each reentry. The district court\u2019s decision to depart based on his likelihood to recidivate was warranted and proper. <em>See United States v. McDowell, </em>109 F.3d 214, 218 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, the 120-month sentence imposed by the district court was well below the 240-month statutory maximum sentence for the offense and was reasonable, given Luevano-Orozco\u2019s lengthy criminal history, his seven previous deportations, the likelihood of recidivism, and the need to protect the public. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 489-91 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 713, 163 L.Ed.2d 543 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-08 (5th Cir.2006). The district court provided sufficient, valid reasons for its decision to depart upward and, therefore, the sentence was reasonable. <em>See Hardin, </em>437 F.3d at 470-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
