Caldwell, and Horry County Police Officers Charles McClendon, Jay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Brantley, and Andy Christensen appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying, in part, their motion for summary judgment in Appellees\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) civil suit. On appeal, Appellants assert that they are entitled to qualified immunity. Appellees argue that this court lacks jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. We agree with the Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Interlocutory orders ordinarily are not appealable. An exception to this general rule is recognized with respect to orders rejecting a defendant\u2019s claim of qualified immunity, but only if the denial of qualified immunity rests on a purely legal determination that the facts alleged, if found to be true, demonstrate a violation of clearly established law. <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 316-17, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995); <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). However, \u201cto the extent that the appealing official seeks to argue the insufficiency of the evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact \u2014 for example, that the evidence presented was insufficient to support a conclusion that the official engaged in the particular conduct alleged \u2014 we do not possess jurisdiction ... to consider the claim.\u201d <em>Winfield v. Bass, </em>106 F.3d 525, 529-30 (4th Cir. 1997). \u201c[W]hile the purely legal question of whether the constitutional.right at issue was clearly established \u2018is always capable of decision at the summary judgment stage,\u2019 a genuine question of material fact regarding \u2018[w]hether the conduct allegedly violative of the right actually occurred ... must be reserved for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willingham v. Crooke, </em>412 F.3d 553, 559 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Pritchett v. Alford, </em>973 F.2d 307, 313 (4th Cir.1992)). Here, the district court determined that the constitutional right alleged to have been infringed was clearly established, but it determined that several genuine issues of material fact remained concerning whether the conduct alleged to violate that right had actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">We therefore dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We deny Appellees\u2019 motion for leave to file a surreply as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
