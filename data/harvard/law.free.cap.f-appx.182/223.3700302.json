This opinion is filed by a quorum of the panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b249-23\">Following a bench trial, Jacqueline Quantella Fowler was convicted of one count of possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924 (2000). Fowler was sentenced to twenty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. We find no error and affirm Fowler\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-24\">Fowler first contends that her predicate state conviction did not satisfy \u00a7 922(g)(1) as a matter of law. She reasons that, under North Carolina law, her maximum sentence was twelve months because no aggravating factors were admitted to or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See North Carolina v. Allen, </em>359 N.C. 425, 615 S.E.2d 256, 265 (2005) (holding, after <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), statutory maximum is the maximum that a particular defendant can face in light of her criminal history and the facts found by a jury or admitted by defendant). However, as Fowler conceded at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>trial, her argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246-47 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005), which holds that <em>United States v. Jones, </em>195 F.3d 205 (4th Cir.1999), is still viable after <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and reaffirms that a prior North Carolina conviction satisfies \u00a7 922(g)(1) if any defendant charged with that crime could receive a sentence in excess of one year. Thus, because it is undisputed that a sentence of over twelve months could be imposed on a defendant convicted of felony possession of cocaine in North Carolina, Fowler\u2019s prior conviction was properly considered a predicate felony under \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Fowler also contends that her sentence is unreasonable. After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006) (No. 05-10474). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we conclude Fowler\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Fowler\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
