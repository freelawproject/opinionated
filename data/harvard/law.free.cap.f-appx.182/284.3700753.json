He contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial when it enhanced his sentence based on the district judge\u2019s finding that a threat of death was made because this finding was neither admitted by him nor made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The district court erred when it enhanced Eads\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) because the court\u2019s factual finding that Eads told the bank teller he had a gun was neither admitted by Eads nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Eads preserved his Sixth Amendment argument in the district court by raising an objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), we review for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1444, 164 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006). The Government bears the burden of demonstrating that the <em>Booker </em>error did not affect Eads\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The mere fact that the district court sentenced Eads in the middle of the applicable guidelines range, standing alone, fails to satisfy the Government\u2019s burden of proving harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Garza, </em>429 F.3d at 170-171. Further, the sentencing transcript is silent with regard to whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the <em>Booker </em>error. Therefore, the Government has failed to carry its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect Eads\u2019s sentence. <em>See Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 287. We therefore vacate Eads\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
