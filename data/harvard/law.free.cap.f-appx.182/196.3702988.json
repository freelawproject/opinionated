The Board adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s discretionary denial of adjustment of status, denied Azo\u2019s motion to reopen and reconsider his asylum claim, and rejected his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">First, we have considered Azo\u2019s challenge to the discretionary denial of adjustment of status and conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), (D) (West 2005); <em>Higuit v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 417, 419-20 (4th Cir.2006). Next, we have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Azo\u2019s motion to reopen and reconsider. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006). We thus affirm the denial of the motion for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re Azo, </em>Nos. A76-418-281, A76-418-282, A76-418-284, A76-418-285 (B.I.A. Aug. 24, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">We accordingly dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
