The plaintiffs sought equitable and monetary relief on the grounds that the defendants failed to provide I.B. with a free appropriate public education for the 2003-2004 school year. The district court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs appeal. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and the district court\u2019s thorough ruling from the bench, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court for the reasons stated from the bench. <em>See Baron v. Weast, </em>Civil No. 04-3308 (D.Md. filed September 12, 2005 &amp; entered September 13, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
