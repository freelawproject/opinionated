Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court construed the \u00a7 2241 petition as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Lindsey asserts that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of his detention and contends that his claims should be considered under \u00a7 2241 pursuant to the savings clause in \u00a7 2255. Because Lindsey does not meet the standard set forth in <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir.2000) for application of the savings clause, we affirm the denial of relief. We deny as unnecessary Lindsey\u2019s \u201cMotion for Leave to File a Formal Brief,\u201d as no leave is required; we have fully considered the brief proffered with Lindsey\u2019s motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
