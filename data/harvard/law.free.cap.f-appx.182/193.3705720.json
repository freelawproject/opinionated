Reynolds moved for an extension of time to file his notice of appeal as to his criminal judgment, which the district court denied. Reynolds then appealed the district court\u2019s order denying his motion. We dismiss the appeal to the extent Reynolds seeks to appeal his criminal judgment, and we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Reynolds\u2019s motion for an extension to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-22\">In a criminal case, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days from the entry of the order or judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). When the notice of appeal is filed more than thirty days after expiration of the appeal period, neither the district court nor this court may grant an extension. <em>United States v. Schuchardt, </em>685 F.2d 901, 902 (4th Cir.1982). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-23\">The district court entered the criminal judgment on June 22, 2005; the ten-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>appeal period expired on July 7, 2005. Reynolds filed his pro se motion for an extension of time to file his appeal on October 14, 2005. On January 31, 2006, the district court properly denied Reynolds\u2019s motion because it was well beyond the excusable neglect period. On February 10, 2006, Reynolds noted an appeal from the January 31, 2006 order \u201cdenying the motion to restore appellate rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Reynolds\u2019s motion, and we dismiss the appeal as to Reynolds\u2019s underlying criminal judgment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-15\"> Any claim Reynolds may have regarding ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to timely note a requested appeal from his criminal judgment should be brought in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
