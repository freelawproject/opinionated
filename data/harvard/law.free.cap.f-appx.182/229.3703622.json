Lepe-Rodriguez challenges the reasonableness of his sentence, asserting that the district court erred in sentencing him in four ways: 1) the court failed to adequately explain its sentencing determination; 2) the court failed to consider all 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005) factors in determining the sentence; 3) the court gave exclusive consideration to the Guideline <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> range, effectively rendering it mandatory; and 4) the court imposed a sentence greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing. We find, however, that the district court sentenced Lepe-Rodriguez only after appropriately considering and examining the Sentencing Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as instructed by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\u201cThe district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u2018in checklist fashion\u2019; \u2018it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005)). The district court sentenced Lepe-Rodriguez within the applicable advisory Guideline range and well below the twenty-year statutory maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). We cannot conclude that, under these circumstances, Lepe-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006) (finding that sentence imposed within properly calculated advisory guidelines range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006) (No. 05-10474).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-10\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
