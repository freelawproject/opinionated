See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b195-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Roland Frank Hall pled guilty to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(1) (2000) and was sentenced to twenty months\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals, contending the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court sustained Hall\u2019s objections to the calculations contained in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and granted the Government\u2019s <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2004) motion for downward departure, based on Hall\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities. Following these adjustments to the PSR, the advisory guidelines provided for 4 to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court, commenting on Hall\u2019s history of thievery of various kinds and previous \u201cextremely lenient[ ]\u201d treatment by the courts, regarded the range of imprisonment as insufficient to provide adequate deterrence and provide protection for the public from future crimes by Hall. Thus, the court sentenced Hall to a twenty-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">In imposing a sentence <em>post-United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts must (1) properly calculate the sentence range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines; (2) determine whether a sentence within that range and within statutory limits serves the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005) , and, if not, select a sentence that does serve those factors; (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) articulate the reasons for selecting the particular sentence, especially explaining why a sentence outside of the Sentencing Guideline range better serves the relevant sentencing purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">We find that the district court complied with these directives in imposing Hall\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
