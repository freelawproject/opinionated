In denying the claim, the ALJ questioned the credibility of Moore\u2019s statements and found that, although Moore suffered severe impairments limiting him to sedentary work, Moore was <em>not </em>disabled. The Appeals Council affirmed. The district court held the claim properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">Our review of Moore\u2019s challenges to the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that he was <em>not </em>disabled is limited to whether: (1) substantial evidence supports the decision; and (2) correct legal standards were used to evaluate the evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>e.g., Brown v. Apfel, </em>192 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.1999). Substantial evidence requires \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d. <em>Watson v. Barnhart, </em>288 F.3d 212, 215 (5th Cir.2002). It is the role of the Commissioner, not our court, to weigh the evidence. <em>Brown, </em>192 F.3d at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-16\">First, Moore contends the burden of proving he would be unable to engage in either his past work, or other gainful employment, was placed improperly on him. As the court stated, a \u201cclaimant has the initial burden of establishing a disability in the first four steps of this analysis. The burden then shifts to the Commissioner to show that the claimant is capable of performing work in the national economy.\u201d (Internal citation omitted.) The proper burden-shifting was applied. <em>Bowen v. Yuckert, </em>482 U.S. 137, 146 n. 5, 107 S.Ct. 2287, 96 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987); <em>Myers v. Apfel, </em>238 F.3d 617, 619-20 (5th Cir.2001). Next, Moore contends the ALJ\u2019s finding of residual functional capacity, despite his severe impairment, difficulty in concentrating, and anxiety attacks, was not supported by substantial evidence. Residual functional capacity concerns Moore\u2019s ability to perform work despite his physical or mental impairments. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a). As the Commissioner notes, Moore was seen by two examining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>physicians, both of whom stated he retained sufficient physical capacity to perform sustained work activity. The ALJ was responsible for determining Moore\u2019s residual functional capacity. <em>Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 557 (5th Cir.1995); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1546. Although the opinions and diagnosis of a treating physician are to be accorded considerable weight, the ALJ is permitted to reject a physician\u2019s opinion when the overall evidence supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Martinez v. Chater, </em>64 F.3d 172, 175-76 (5th Cir.1995). The ALJ properly relied on \u201cmore than a scintilla\u201d of evidence that he could reasonably \u201caccept as adequate to support [his] conclusion\u201d. <em>Watson, </em>288 F.3d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Moore maintains the ALJ failed to properly evaluate his credibility and failed to consider and explain the weight given to his statements. An ALJ must explain his reasons for rejecting a disability applicant\u2019s complaints of pain, <em>Falco v. Shalala, </em>27 F.3d 160, 164 (5th Cir.1994), and evaluates the credibility of witness testimony, <em>Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs v. Vessel Repair, Inc., </em>168 F.3d 190, 195 (5th Cir.1999). We are to give his determinations considerable deference. <em>Harrell v. Bowen, </em>862 F.2d 471, 480 (5th Cir.1988). As the Commissioner notes, the ALJ considered Moore\u2019s subjective complaints of pain and cited the requirement that he do so in his decision; and the ALJ found Moore\u2019s claims lacking in credibility, based on his review of the evidence and testimony from treating and examining physicians. Pursuant to our deferential review, we cannot say the ALJ erred in deeming Moore\u2019s statements lacking in credibility; substantial evidence supports this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Moore also claims the ALJ improperly rejected the medical opinion of Moore\u2019s treating physicians and instead relied upon testimony of a medical expert witness, without providing a detailed analysis of his reasoning for doing so. Contrary to Moore\u2019s interpretation, this detailed analysis is required only <em>\u201cabsent reliable medical evidence from a treating or examining physician controverting the claimant\u2019s treating specialist Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir.2000) (emphasis added). The opinion of a treating physician is <em>not </em>given controlling weight when it is inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record. <em>Spellman v. Shalala, </em>1 F.3d 357, 364-65 (5th Cir.1993). Because contrary reliable evidence existed in opposition to Moore\u2019s claims, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to rely on Moore\u2019s treating physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Finally, Moore contends the ALJ and district court failed to consider his ability to maintain and perform tasks needed for employment, in the light of his many limitations. Moore cites <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296 (5th Cir.1987), for the proposition that the ALJ and district court failed to consider \u201cboth the disabling effect of each of [his] ailments and the combined effect of all of these impairments\u201d on his ability to obtain and maintain employment. <em>Id. </em>at 1305 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Where the record reasonably shows a disability claimant has the capacity to work, however, such a discussion of the claimant\u2019s ability to maintain employment is not needed. <em>Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 619 (5th Cir.2003). Both treating and examining doctors found Moore capable of performing sedentary work. Based on this substantial evidence, no further discussion was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
