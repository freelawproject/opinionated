EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"AqE\">Plaintiff Yolanda Merla appeals the dismissal on motion for summary judgment of her employment related claims against the San Antonio Independent School District and two of its employees. Merla\u2019s case arises from the termination of her employment after she exhausted the school district\u2019s two year disability limit and failed to return to work. Based on our review of the district court\u2019s opinion, the briefs and the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants and dismissing Merla\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-21\">Assuming Merla\u2019s termination was an adverse employment action, Merla failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of Title VII gender discrimination or retaliation, age discrimination under the ADEA, or \u00a7 1983 violation of due process in relation to handling of six grievances Merla filed with the Texas Education Agency. The district court also did not err in dismissing Merla\u2019s pendant state claims without prejudice. Merla raised no objections to dismissal of her other claims against the defendants. In summary, the district court properly concluded that Merla failed to established that the termination of her employment was based on anything other than a neutral, non-discriminatory policy of limiting disability leave. Nothing in Merla\u2019s Rule 59 motion undermines that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-22\">Merla\u2019s pro se briefs raise numerous complaints about the deficiency of her attorney\u2019s representation. However, this appeal is not the appropriate forum to address those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-23\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated above and in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion filed July 21, 2004 and Memorandum Opinion and order filed February 14, 2005, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
