Thompson contends that the sentence was \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d because he committed only technical violations of supervised release and because the district court failed to provide reasons for its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201cIn the absence of its being raised by a party, this court is obliged to raise the subject of mootness sua sponte.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987). Inmate records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons reflect that Thompson was released from federal custody on October 28, 2005, and he was not ordered to serve another term of supervised release. Accordingly, this court cannot provide Thompson with relief, and his APPEAL IS DISMISSED AS MOOT. <em>See Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
