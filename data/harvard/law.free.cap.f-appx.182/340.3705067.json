He argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the instant case because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce. He also argues that his conviction should be reversed because the indictment does not allege that the offense had a substantial impact on interstate commerce. He acknowledges that these arguments are foreclosed by precedent, but raises them to preserve them for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-21\">We have repeatedly held that \u201cthe constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question.\u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Evidence that a weapon was manufactured in one state and possessed in another is sufficient to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 922(g). <em>See Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d at 518 <em>&amp; </em>n. 12; <em>United States v. Kuban, </em>94 F.3d 971, 973 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242-43 (5th Cir.1996). Additionally, in <em>United States v. Gresham, </em>118 F.3d 258, 264-65 (5th Cir.1997), we rejected a challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment under \u00a7 922(g)(1) that was identical to the one raised by Gipson in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-22\">Gipson further argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) unconstitutionally infringes on his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. He maintains that the statute is overbroad, it violates the Tenth Amendment, and it violates the principles of equal protection. He acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Darrington, </em>351 F.3d 632, 633-35 (5th Cir.2003), but has raised the issue to preserve it for possible review by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, Gipson\u2019s challenges to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) and to the indictment are foreclosed by circuit precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-23\">Gipson also argues that the district court erred by refusing to give his requested jury instruction on constructive possession and joint occupancy. The refusal to give a particular instruction is error only if the instruction \u201c(1) was substantially cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>rect, (2) was not substantially covered in the charge delivered to the jury, and (3) concerned an important issue so that the failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present a given defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Pennington, </em>20 F.3d 593, 600 (5th Cir.1994). Gipson\u2019s argument fails because the district court\u2019s instruction substantially covered the issue raised by Gipson and the district court\u2019s decision not to give the requested charge did not seriously impair Gipson\u2019s defense. <em>See id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
