This opinion is filed by quorum of the panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b261-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Antonio Hood appeals his conviction and sentence imposed after he pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base or crack cocaine and five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 846 (2000). On appeal, Hood\u2019s counsel filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there were no meritorious issues, but raising the issue of whether the district court complied with Rule 11 in accepting Hood\u2019s guilty plea and whether the life sentence was required. Hood filed a pro se supplemental brief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">We find no error with respect to either the Rule 11 proceeding or the statutory mandatory life sentence. Hood contends counsel was ineffective on a number of counts. Insofar as Hood claims counsel was ineffective for not challenging the drug quantity in the presentence investigation report, this claim is without merit because Hood was sentenced to a statutory sentence. The recommended sentence under the guidelines was not relevant. With respect to his other challenges to counsel\u2019s effectiveness, the proper proceeding in which to pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not a direct appeal but a collateral proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120 (4th Cir.1991). We will entertain such a claim on direct appeal only if it \u201cconclusively appears\u201d from the record that the defendant\u2019s counsel was ineffective. <em>United States v. Russell, </em>221 F.3d 615, 619 n. 5 (4th Cir.2000). Because the record is incomplete in this regard, the claim will not be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hood\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
