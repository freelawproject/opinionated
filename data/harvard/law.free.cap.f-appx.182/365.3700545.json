Wong-Rodriguez challenges his sentence, raising several arguments that are barred by the appeal-waiver provision of his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450-51 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Wong-Rodriguez contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in several respects, but the record is not sufficiently developed for us to address any of those ineffective-assistance contentions. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir. 1987). Finally, Wong-Rodriguez contends that his indictment was duplicitous, and he raises a claim based on a typographical error in counts of the indictment to which he did not plead guilty. Wong-Rodriguez\u2019s guilty plea waived his non-jurisdictional contentions regarding his indictment. <em>See United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
