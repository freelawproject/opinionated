He contends that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the conspiracy charge because the prosecution violated double jeopardy and due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He, then, asserts that the district court erred in denying him credit for time served, in failing to articulate its consideration of the sentencing factors enu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>merated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), in failing to comport with <em>United States v. </em>Booker,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and in relying on unproved prior convictions to calculate his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Dunn first argues that we must dismiss his conspiracy conviction because he pleaded guilty to the same crime in Arkansas<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2014the Texas conviction, thus, repugnant to the principles of double jeopardy and due process. We review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In order to establish double jeopardy, the defendant bears the initial burden of demonstrating a <em>prima facie </em>claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Once satisfied, the burden shifts to the government to show by a preponderance of the evidence that double jeopardy principles do not bar the later criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the critical issue concerning double jeopardy in the instant matter, the government must prove that separate agreements formed the basis of each conspiracy conviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In evaluating whether one or more agreements existed, we consider, as to each charged conspiracy: (1) the time span, (2) the persons acting as co-conspirators, (3) the statutory offenses charged in the indictments, (4) the overt acts charged by the government or any other description of the offense charged which indicates the nature and scope of the illicit activity, and (5) the places where the related events transpired.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">The Arkansas indictment charged that the prior conspiracy spanned from May 18, 1999 through October 21, 1999, whereas the Texas indictment alleged that the conspiracy began in June 1997 and ended July 29, 2000. While the statutory offenses are identical, the conspiracies, as alleged in the indictments, involve different persons;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Dunn remains the only commonality.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The conspiracies do not share common overt acts or other similar facts, as both the banks and the checks used in each scheme differed, for example. Lastly, the events revealed in the Arkansas indictment are geographically limited to Arkansas, whereas, the Texas indictment includes acts which occurred in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Florida \u2014 only one of the 32 overt acts charged in the Texas indictment occurring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>in Arkansas.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Tellingly, according to the testimony of an investigating agent, Dunn stated that he \u201chated\u201d the two men named as co-conspirators in the Texas indictment and admitted that he \u201cwent to Arkansas and started his own separate scheme,\u201d \u201cto go on his own to work with other people.\u201d The government has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the conspiracies involved separate agreements. Thus, the prosecution for conspiracy in the Western District of Texas does not violate the principles of double jeopardy. Although Dunn argues the due process claim separately, this argument rests and falls on the same logical framework; the two convictions involved separate conspiracies and are factually distinct. Consequently, Dunn\u2019s due process argument that facts pertinent to the Arkansas conviction were impermissibly relitigated also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Dunn\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver provision in which he forfeited his statutory right to appeal the sentence, except in the event of an upward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines. The government, therefore, urges that we dismiss Dunn\u2019s assertions of error because he knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence and since the challenge does not fall within the reserved exception.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">A defendant may waive his statutory right to appeal as a condition of a valid plea agreement, if the waiver is both knowing and voluntary and applies to the instant circumstances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since the district court did not upwardly depart from the Guidelines, Dunn\u2019s knowing and voluntary acceptance of the plea agreement, which contained the explicit and unambiguous appeal-waiver provision \u2014 reinforced by the magistrate judge\u2019s admonitions during the arraignment hearings \u2014 bars his assertions of sentencing error.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We AFFIRM the judgment of conviction and DISMISS the sentencing objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>AFFIRMED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-14\"> Pursuant to the 5TH CIR.

In his reply brief, Dunn argues for the first time that the government waived its right to rely on the appeal-waiver provision contained in the plea agreement, for failure to raise the objection below.

Dunn also argues that he did not waive the right to appeal a sentence above the statutory maximum, as defined in <em>Blakely v. Washington. </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (The \"statutory maximum ... is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d).

Dunn\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
