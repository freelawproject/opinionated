Barnes argues that the district court failed to consider Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines before imposing sentence. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Barnes failed to object in the district court on the ground he presents on appeal. We, thus, review for plain error. <em>United States v. Gresham, </em>325 F.3d 1262, 1265 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">After determining that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a district court may revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). The district court also must consider the Guidelines Chapter 7 policy statements. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1301-02 (11th Cir.2002). But the Chapter 7 policy statements merely are advisory and, thus, nonbinding. <em>See United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 360 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">Here, some of the violations of Barnes\u2019s supervised release involved incidents of alleged new criminal conduct: specifically, domestic violence offenses. At the revocation hearing, witnesses testified about the domestic violence offenses; and the parties referenced the Guidelines. The district court then stated that it was imposing a 24-month sentence (above the recommended Guidelines range, but below the statutory maximum) because it was concerned about Barnes\u2019s violent temper and his need for mental health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">The district court may not have referred specifically to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. But it was not required to. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The record here is enough to satisfy us that the district court implicitly considered at least some of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors (such as Barnes\u2019s characteristics, the need to protect the public, and the need to provide treatment) in deciding that it needed to craft a sentence longer than the recommended Guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Aguillard) </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s statements, combined with the parties\u2019 sentencing arguments, also shows that the court was aware of and considered \u2014 but rejected \u2014 the Chapter 7 range. The district court did not plainly err in sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>Barnes to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment after revoking his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\">. On plain error review, a defendant must show \u201cerror\u201d that is \"plain\u201d and that \"affect[s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). It is only after these conditions have been satisfied that an appellate court then may exercise its discretion and correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b966-10\">.
