He argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew 167 pounds of marijuana had been hidden in his tractor-trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Assuming arguendo that the marijuana was indeed \u201chidden\u201d in Salguero\u2019s tractor-trailer, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, <em>United States v. Ivy, </em>973 F.2d 1184, 1188 (5th Cir.1992), we hold that the following nonexclusive list of circumstantial evidence established Salguero\u2019s guilty knowledge: (1) Salguero gave inconsistent statements to authorities about his citizenship and claimed to have lost his permanent resident card, which was later found in his wallet; (2) Salguero appeared nervous when asked to produce the load\u2019s manifest; (3) neither Salguero nor his co-defendant ever produced the manifest; (4) the men were not taking the most direct route to their purported destination; (5) Salguero used a suitcase full of marijuana as a pillow while purportedly sleeping in the cab\u2019s sleeper compartment; (6) Salguero was found in possession of a large amount of cash, for which no COMcheck receipt was produced and to which a canine alerted; and (7) Salguero made a spontaneous statement during his fingerprinting suggesting that he knew the source of the marijuana. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 599 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The jury was free to discredit Salguero\u2019s co-defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>990 F.2d 171, 174 (5th Cir.1993). In light of the foregoing, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established Salguero\u2019s guilty knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Jaramillo, </em>42 F.3d 920, 922-23 (5th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
