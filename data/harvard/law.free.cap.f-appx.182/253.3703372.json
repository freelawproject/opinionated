Anderson was sentenced to a 135-month term of imprisonment. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Because the district court determined Anderson was responsible for 1.67 kilograms of cocaine base, Anderson was assigned a base offense level of thirty-eight. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2003). The district court applied a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, thereby giving Anderson an adjusted offense level of thirty-five. An additional two-level adjustment was applied because the Government stipulated that Anderson had satisfied the criteria set forth in \u00a7 5C1.2(a). <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6). Anderson was assessed one criminal history point, which placed him in criminal history category I. The resulting advisory guideline range was 135 to 168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">As Anderson did not object, the district court adopted the findings in the Presentence Investigation Report. Anderson\u2019s counsel moved the district court for a downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5H1.4, alleging Anderson\u2019s renal disease and congestive heart failure constituted \u201cextraordinary physical impairment.\u201d The district court, noting it had \u201cthe authority to exercise [its] discretion ... to decide to depart,\u201d determined Anderson\u2019s physical impairments were \u201c[s]erious [and] significant, but not extraordinary.\u201d Consequently, the court denied the motion for downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Similarly, counsel moved for a variance pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). In support, counsel once again urged consideration of Anderson\u2019s physical condition as well as his de minimis criminal past. The district court denied the motion for variance based on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d In response, Anderson\u2019s counsel requested that the court sentence Anderson \u201cat the very bottom of [the guideline] range in light of his condition.... \u201d The district court, noting it was persuaded by counsel\u2019s argument, sentenced Anderson to imprisonment for 135 months. The court concluded that \u201c[i]t\u2019s not often that for this kind of conduct [it would] sentence at the bottom of the guidelines. But[,] ... under all of the circumstances[,] this is one of the cases where the sentence at the bottom of the guidelines would be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the district court erred in its denial of Anderson\u2019s motions for downward departure and variance. Although Anderson was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u201cA district court\u2019s decision not to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines is not reviewable unless the court mistakenly believed it lacked authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Carr, </em>271 F.3d 172, 176 (4th Cir.2001). The district court unequivocally acknowledged its authority to exercise its discretion to depart. Before making its decision, the district court noted it had reviewed Anderson\u2019s medical records, the deposition testimony of his treating physicians, and heard from the Bureau of Prisons regarding the availability of treatment. Though the district court acknowledged Anderson\u2019s condition was \u201cserious\u201d and \u201csignificant,\u201d it determined it was not of such a level as to warrant either a departure or a variance. Accordingly, we conclude the district court\u2019s decisions to not depart or vary are not subject to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In accordance with Anders, we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly we affirm Anderson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
