We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Chaudhary v. Stevens, </em>No. CA-05-382-3 (E.D.Va. Sept. 7, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
