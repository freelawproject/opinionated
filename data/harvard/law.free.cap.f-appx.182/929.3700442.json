No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-22\">On 29 March 2003, a Friday night, Plaintiffs, seven members of a group of five Hispanics and four African-Americans, went to Fulton\u2019s Crab House for dinner. They arrived between 9:00 pm and 9:30 pm. The hostess informed Plaintiffs that there would be an hour wait for dining room seating, but if Plaintiffs could find open seating in the lounge area, they probably would not have to wait as long. Plaintiffs chose to go to the lounge.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-23\">As Plaintiffs entered the lounge, they saw a group of eight<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Caucasian patrons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>get up from a table and leave the lounge. Plaintiffs claimed their table. Plaintiffs did not notice any other racial minorities or parties of a size similar to their own seated in the lounge area.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Only one server, a Caucasian man named Jeff Verberg, was attending to the lounge area. Plaintiffs observed Verberg serving other patrons in the lounge area, but he did not come to Plaintiffs\u2019 table to bring them menus or take their orders. After waiting around fifteen to thirty minutes, one Plaintiff left the table to learn who their server was; she learned it was Verberg. After waiting about another fifteen to thirty minutes, a Plaintiff left the table and returned with a busboy, who said that he would find a waiter or manager to come to Plaintiffs\u2019 table. After waiting about fifteen to thirty more minutes, a Plaintiff left the table to find the manager on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Another server, Christopher Chalange, told Plaintiffs he would serve their table, apologized for the wait, and took Plaintiffs\u2019 drink orders. Chalange returned with Plaintiffs\u2019 drinks and the manager on duty. The manager apologized for the wait, told Plaintiffs their first round of drinks was free, and said that someone would take their dinner orders soon.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Plaintiffs say they waited between two and three hours at the restaurant, never placed a dinner order, and finally left the restaurant. Plaintiffs say that they left the restaurant because no one brought them menus and that Chalange suggested alternate, more affordable, restaurants for Plaintiffs to go to. Defendant claims that the waiter returned to Plaintiffs\u2019 table; but before he could take their dinner orders, Plaintiffs informed him they had decided not to dine at the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">\n<em>Disc\u00f1mination Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing all evidence and making all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Whatley v. CNA Ins. Co., </em>189 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants because the Plaintiffs could not identify a similarly situated group of Caucasian patrons who were treated better than Plaintiffs. Thus, Plaintiffs did not establish a prima facie case of accommodations discrimination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">Plaintiffs argue that the group of eight Caucasians Plaintiffs saw leaving the lounge was a similarly situated group and that because restaurants usually serve people promptly and because Fulton\u2019s prided itself on \u201cexcellent customer service,\u201d this Court should infer that the group of eight was served promptly. But Plaintiffs only saw this group leaving and thus present no evidence that the group was served in a timely fashion. Although we view all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, given the lack of any evidence about the earlier Caucasian group\u2019s service, we cannot make an inference about how promptly the group was served. Therefore, Plaintiffs do not establish this earlier group of Caucasian patrons was a similarly situated group that received better treatment. The district court properly found that Plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie case of public accommodations discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">The district court dismissed the state claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, based on Plaintiffs\u2019 earlier election of an administrative hearing. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. 760.11(4) (saying civil rights claimant\u2019s \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d is the elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>tion of either an administrative hearing or a civil action). We find it unnecessary to discuss whether or not the district court had subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to establish a prima facie federal case of public accommodations discrimination also applies to their state-law claims under Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 509.092, 760.11. <em>See Stevens v. Steak n Shake, Inc., </em>35 F.Supp.2d 882 (M.D.Fla.1998) (applying elements of federal Title VII claim to claim under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 509.092); <em>The Florida State Univ. v. Sondel, </em>685 So.2d 923, 925 n. 1 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996) (saying the Florida Civil Rights Act was patterned after Title VII and federal case law interpreting Title VII is applicable to cases arising under the Florida Act). Because Plaintiffs\u2019 failed to present a prima facie case of public accommodations discrimination, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">\n<em>Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to award costs. <em>Mutual Service Ins. Co. v. Frit Industries, Inc., </em>358 F.3d 1312, 1326 (11th Cir.2004). Plaintiffs argue that Defendants should not recover costs for court reporter fees and copies because Defendants did not present itemized invoices of their expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The magistrate determined that, although invoices would have been preferable to establish for what the amounts charged for the court reporter\u2019s services were used, it was sufficient that the \u201cDeclaration on the Bill of Costs submitted includes a statement by counsel, under penalty of perjury, that the costs are correct and that services charged are properly taxable.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion in adopting this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Plaintiffs object to the $1,500.00 in copying costs the district court awarded Defendants because Defendants did not submit invoices of what was copied and how many copies were made. Defendants claimed that over nineteen thousand copies were made for this case, and Plaintiffs objected before the Magistrate that this number was excessive and unsupported. The Magistrate determined that nineteen thousand copies was excessive because that number included multiple copies made for the client; therefore, the Magistrate recommended that the costs award be reduced from the $2,945.23 Defendants requested to $1,500.00 to cover the copies the Magistrate determined were necessary for this case. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the reduced award is excessive because the factual foundation of the case was not complicated and did not involve \u201cmedical records, employment records and/or other documents requested from third parties\u201d does not demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in adopting this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-14\">. One Plaintiff testified that this party consisted of about eight patrons, but was not definite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>about the number. For this analysis, we assume there were eight people.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
