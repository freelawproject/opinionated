Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Ball\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court preserved whether Ball\u2019s sentence violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), for appeal. Accordingly, we review for harmless error, which requires a showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence if it had been operating under an advisory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-20\">Our review of the record convinces us that the error in this case cannot be considered harmless. Although the district court sentenced Ball at the top of the guideline range authorized by the then-mandatory guidelines range, that fact is insufficient, standing alone, to satisfy the Government\u2019s burden. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>440 F.3d 255, 258-59 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s comments about the seriousness of Ball\u2019s offense and the impact of his offense shed no additional light on what the court would have done if the Guidelines had been advisory; they may simply reflect why the court believed the sentence was appropriate within the mandatory guidelines framework. <em>Cf. United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1444, 164 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Ball has abandoned on appeal his challenge to the district court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history score. <em>See United States v.
