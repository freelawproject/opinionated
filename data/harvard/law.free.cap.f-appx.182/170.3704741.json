Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 425, 429 (4th Cir.2002). The Supreme Court has held that asserting a protected interest in a process itself, in the absence of any substantive interest, is not a cognizable claim. <em>Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard, </em>523 U.S. 272, 280 n. 2, 118 S.Ct. 1244, 140 L.Ed.2d 387 (1998); <em>Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 250, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983); <em>see also Harvey v. Horan, </em>285 F.3d 298, 315 n. 5 (4th Cir.2002). We have held there is no liberty or property interest in discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c). <em>Smith, </em>295 F.3d at 429. Hence, it follows there is no liberty or property interest in being considered for full relief. <em>United States v. Torres, </em>383 F.3d 92 (3d Cir.2004). Accordingly, as there is no liberty interest at stake with regard to Solomon\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) application, he cannot state a cognizable due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Solomon next argues that his equal protection rights were violated because the Government\u2019s delay in commencing removal proceedings led him to be treated differently than similarly situated aliens applying for the \u00a7 212(c) waiver. We note that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider claims challenging the Government\u2019s decision to initiate removal proceedings. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(g), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g). Moreover, the disparate treatment of which Solomon complains was not wholly irrational. <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 83, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">Finally, Solomon asserts that he is eligible for the \u00a7 212(c) waiver. Solomon does not dispute that he served over five years in prison for his 1992 aggravated felony conviction. Therefore, we find that he is ineligible for the waiver under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(4)(I) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
