Barton was sentenced to a term of seventy-eight months imprisonment, with a consecutive five year sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) offense. He argues on appeal that his sentence violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because the district court assessed criminal history points for certain prior criminal sentences, and another two points because he was on probation when he committed the instance offenses, although the supporting facts were not charged in the indictment or admitted by him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Barton did not dispute the fact of his prior convictions or the sentences he received, nor the fact that he was on probation when he committed the instant offenses. The fact of a prior conviction need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United </em>States, 523 U.S. 224, 233-36, 243-44, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 351-54 (4th Cir.) (reaffirming continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). Thus the district court was not required to make any factual findings concerning Barton\u2019s prior record or his status at the time of the instant offenses, but could rely on \u201cthe conclusive significance\u201d of his record, <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), as set out in the presentence report. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 285 (4th Cir.2005) (sentencing judge entitled to rely on undisputed information in presentence report that \u201cbears the earmarks of derivation from Shepard-approved sources such as the indictments and state-court judgments from [defendant\u2019s] prior convictions\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006). Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not violate Barton\u2019s Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights when it considered his legal status and prior convictions in determining his sentence and that the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
