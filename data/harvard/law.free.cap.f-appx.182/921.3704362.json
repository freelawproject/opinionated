The Government alleged in its complaint that the property had been used to commit or facilitate the commission of a violation of the Controlled Substances Act. Police officers investigating a marijuana-growing operation conducted a warrantless search of Haban\u2019s residence and located 84 marijuana plants, 767 grams of marijuana, and $45,000 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">On appeal, Haban first argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that he voluntarily consented to the search of his house and seeks suppression of the marijuana evidence found therein. \u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir.1999). We accept the district court\u2019s factual findings as true unless the findings are shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A]ll facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts is reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">\u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). We have held that a \u201ctrial judge\u2019s choice of whom to believe is conclusive on the appellate court unless the judge credits <em>exceedingly </em>improbable testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and punctuation omitted) (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">In this case, the magistrate found that the testimony of Haban and his girlfriend was not credible, in light of their denials and minimizations of their participation in any illegal activity. Specifically, among other things, the court noted that they claimed that much of the marijuana was for personal use and denied any prior knowledge about the marijuana, but that (1) Haban had admitted to growing 36 pounds of marijuana over 9 months, worth $216,000, and it would have been \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d for him to consume that amount of marijuana, (2) the residence smelled of marijuana, and (3) there were marijuana and growing apparatuses throughout the house. Conversely, the magistrate judge credited the testimony of the police officers and, based on the totality of the circumstances, ultimately found that Haban had given voluntarily consented to the search and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Because the police officer\u2019s testimony was not exceedingly improbable, the district court did not err in finding her credible, and, thus, did not err by finding that Haban voluntarily consented to the search of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">Haban next argues that the district court erred in denying him a <em>de novo </em>evidentiary hearing on his motions to suppress the physical evidence and his confession. He concedes that the Supreme Court has held that a district court is not required to conduct a <em>de novo </em>evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress when a magistrate judge has conducted an evidentiary hearing, but he asserts that the instant case is distinguishable. He asserts that the Supreme Court only has considered this question in relation to a confession, whereas, here he seeks to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>physical evidence. Alternatively, he argues that the Supreme Court should overrule the existing precedent. Finally, Haban contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions without a hearing because the police officers\u2019 testimony was contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">A district court judge may designate a magistrate to conduct suppression hearings, but must \u201cmake a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). The Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe statute calls for a <em>de novo </em>determination, not a <em>de novo </em>hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 674, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 2411, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980). The Court noted that the district court may, in its discretion, opt to conduct a <em>de novo </em>evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 676, 100 S.Ct. at 2413. We have recognized that holding, noting that the district court\u2019s statutory obligation is satisfied \u201cas long as the judge, rather than the magistrate, exercises \u2018ultimate adjudicatory power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Proffitt v. Wainwright, </em>685 F.2d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.1982). Because the Supreme Court has held that a district court is not required to conduct a <em>de novo </em>evidentiary hearing when a party objects to a magistrate\u2019s recommendations, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Haban a <em>de novo </em>evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Finally, Haban filed a motion in the district court for leave to file a supplemental answer to the complaint, asserting that collateral estoppel was an affirmative defense that had not been available at the time when he filed his initial answer. Specifically, he argued that, since the time when he filed his initial answer, the Florida state court had granted his motions to suppress the same evidence in a criminal proceeding stemming from the same activity. Consequently, Haban sought, essentially, to enforce the state court ruling in the federal proceedings. The district court denied the motion, and, on appeal, Haban argues that we have accepted a policy of liberal amendments in regard to supplemental pleading, and thus, because there was no good reason for denying leave to supplement a pleading, the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion. He asserts that there would have been no prejudice to the government due to the amended pleading, and a supplemental pleading was the appropriate vehicle for asserting the defense of collateral estoppel. Next, he argues that he only needed to show that the claim was potentially meritorious, or not futile, and that a claim that may survive a motion to dismiss is not futile. He states that the district court appeared to find that his claim was futile, but the case to which it cited did not stand for the proposition for which it was offered. Finally, he argues, applying Florida law, all the elements of collateral estoppel are present in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-8\">Upon motion of a party the court may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, permit the party to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented. Permission may be granted even though the original pleading is defective in its statement of a claim for relief or defense. If the court deems it advisable that the adverse party plead to the supplemental pleading, it shall so order, specifying the time therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_y0\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(d). The district court\u2019s application of Rule 15 is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Davenport v. United States, </em>217 F.3d 1341, 1343 n. 4 (11th Cir.2000). We have accepted a policy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>liberal amendments and supplements to the pleadings under Rule 15. <em>See Harris v. Garner, </em>216 F.3d 970, 984 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">However, there is no error here. Because this Court held, in an earlier appeal in this case, that a state court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress was not binding on the federal court, the law-of-the-case doctrine barred the district court from reconsidering the issue. Upon careful review of the record on appeal and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error in any of the claims asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
