Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">Borden appears to raise a <em>pre-Booker </em>sentencing challenge that he was sentenced pursuant to a mandatory guideline scheme. Borden, however, was sentenced in May 2005, four months after <em>Booker </em>was issued. WE reject Borden\u2019s argument that the district court felt that it did not have the discretion to sentence outside of the guidelines. The district court followed <em>Booker </em>by indicating at sentencing that it would first determine an advisory guideline range, then ask the parties to call attention to any matters under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that should be considered in sentencing. The court later stated that it would sentence Borden pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act, to the extent that it was applicable after <em>Booker, </em>and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In short, based on the totality of the sentencing transcript, we are satisfied that the district court properly understood that the guidelines were advisory and followed the <em>post-Booker </em>procedures at sentencing. Thus, there is no error in the district court\u2019s treatment of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
