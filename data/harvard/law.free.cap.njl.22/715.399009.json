The replication \u2014 1, denies that he is heir; 2, avers that husband died seized; and 3, avers <em>a demand </em>on April 6, 1846. On special demurrer it might have been bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>for duplicity, but if defendant rejoins he must answer the whole of it. The rejoinder is <em>tout temps prist, </em>no averment that he is heir or denial of the demand ; this is clearly bad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-5\">The plea of <em>tout temps prist </em>may be a good plea in Yew Jersey when pleaded by alienee of the <em>husbaud; he is </em>only liable for damages from demand : and as this <em>plea </em>was according to the precedents (as remarked by Justice Carpenter), it was necessary to show, by averments in the rejoinder, that the defendant was neither an alienee who, by our statute, nor an heir, who by the decisions on the statute of Merton, was entitled to plead <em>tout temps prist.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-6\">But the chief ground relied upon for reversal is, that by the statute of Yew Jersey, no demand is necessary where the husband died seised to entitle the husband to damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-7\">We hold that ibis question was not settled by the court in <em>Woodruff v. Brown, </em>2 <em>Harr. </em>246.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-8\">Horn blower and Dayton, Justices, held a demand necessary. Ford and Yevius, Justices, held it unnecessary. White, J., concurred with Hornblower in his decision, and so did all the judges, but, on another ground, in which all agreed. That opinion has never been reviewed; the judgment was in demandant\u2019s favor. She could not bring error, and in <em>this eourt, </em>at least, the question is open.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-9\">All agree that, by the <em>words </em>of the statute of Yew Jersey, <em>(Rev. Laics </em>397, <em>Rev. Stat. </em>72, \u00a7 3,) the widow is entitled to damages without demand. The language is, \u201c if she be deforced of her dower,\u201d <em>or </em>\u201ccannot have it without suit,\u201d or \u201c if it be not assigned to her in forty days from the death of her husband,\u201d she may sue for and recover the same, with damages from the death of her husband. In either of these two cases her right is absolute to recover, not one word to require demand expressly or by implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-10\">But it is said that the statute of Merton did not, by words, require a demand, and yet the English courts have held a demand necessary. To this the answer is \u2014 1, that the words of the statute of Merton are different, \u201cif a widow be deforced of her dower, <em>and </em>cannot have it without suit,\u201d she must not only be kept out, but <em>also </em>put to her suit, which would not he the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>fact if she could have it on demand; and 2, that however authority might settle the meaning of a statute against the plain meaning of the words, when they were, the same, the authority ceases when the words are changed, as in -this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-5\">There was an intention, by this statute, to change the English law of dower. The quarantine is extended from mansion house to whole farm, and from forty days until dower is assigned, and the alienee pays damages from demand. Why must the <em>intention </em>to change be denied in another case where the words are changed and the meaning unambiguous..</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-6\">When a statute is re-enacted whose construction is settled, and the w'ords are changed so as to alter the meaning, the inference is that a change was intended. 1 <em>Pick. </em>43, <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Paige; </em>10 <em>Wend. </em>528, <em>Tates </em>v. <em>Paddock; </em>1 <em>Pick. </em>155; <em>Rutland </em>v. <em>Mehan.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-7\">Had the old statute been proposed for re-enactment, and any legislator desired to amend it, so as to make the heir liable for damages if he did not assign dower within forty days, whether demanded or not, could he have done so more effectually, as far as language is concerned, than by interlining the words' \u201c or if not assigned within forty days after the death of her husband ?\u201d Besides, else the forty days have no significancy in the statute; they do not limit quarantine, and dower and damages are now due upon demand, whether before or after the death of the husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-8\">But this judgment is wrongly entered in two other particulars. 1. .It is that she take nothing by her writ; it denies dower as well as damages, and all agree that <em>tout temps prist </em>is only a defence to the damages. 2. This plea only protects from damages until suit brought. From the issuing of the writ damages are recovered when the plea is allowed. So are all the authorities. 1 <em>Lilly Ent. </em>189, <em>Spiller </em>v. <em>Andrews; Parke </em>298, 308, 303, 304, and 139; <em>Cases Temp. Hard. </em>19, <em>Dobson </em>v. <em>Dobson; 1 Rich.

I see no reason for denying effect' to them, or for construing ihem away. The peace of families will be much better promoted by making it the duty of the devisee or heir to assign dower within the forty days, and subjecting him to the payment of the value of it if he does not, than by furnishing him with a motive to neglect it until demand be made, by allowing him the use of it for nothing until the widow shall learn that a demand is necessary, and make demand. The plain reading of the act imposes this duty, and there is nothing in the nature of the requirement to induce us to doubt that it was the intention of the legislature. No sufficient reason can be assigned, in my judgment, why the devisee or the heir should occupy land to which the widow is entitled for her dower without compensating her for the use of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Instead of resorting to the decisions in England, or their statute, it seems to me we are required to say, that our legislature, by the different structure and language of our act, intended to introduce a different rule. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">X concur in the reversal of the judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Randolph, J. The question in this case is, whether, under our statute, <em>tout temps prist </em>is a good plea in an action of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>dower brought against the devisee. Under the English statute of Merton it is well eatablished that the heir might appear in an action of dower, and plead that he <em>was always ready (\u00a1tout temps prist) </em>to assign the dower, and thus prevent any damages being recovered against him, unless demandant replied, and proved that she had demanded her dower, and it had not been assigned to her; in which case, or in case of recovery on any other plea than <em>tout temps prist, </em>she recovered damages from the death of her husb\u00e1nd, he dying seized. Upon the death of the ancestor the lands went directly to the heir or devisee, and not to the widow, and she had not even a right of entry for her dower, but only a right to remain in the mausion house and appurtenances for forty days, in order that the heir might, during that time, assign her dower, which she forfeited, however, if she married during the <em>quarantine </em>(forty days) ; but if no dower was assigned to her, or improperly assigned, then she was deforced of her dower, that is, the land which she was entitled to have in dower was withheld from her (3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>172; <em>Co. Lit. </em>277,) and then she was compelled to bring her action to recover her dower; but until the statute of Merton, 20 <em>Hen. </em>3, she recovered no damages. That act gave her damages from the death of her husband, if he died, seized, but never if he did not die seized. Now, inasmuch as the plea of <em>tout temps prist </em>is a good plea under the statute of Merton, it seems conceded that, if our statute be the same, it must be good under that also. It always appeared to me that our statute was different from the English act, and that it gave damages in all cases, from the death of the husband when he died seized, and from demand made when he did not die seized ; and this view of the case was not entirely changed by the argument in this cause, though the question was very fully and ably argued. On examining the argument and matters more fully, however, in vacation, I feel perfectly satisfied that our statute and the English act are substantially the same, and that the former was not intended to, nor does in fact, introduce any new rule as to damages. The action of dower lies in two cases, when the husband dies seized of the lands in question., or when he was seized during coverture, but did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>die seized of them, they having passed in his lifetime over to another. At common law no damages were recoverable in either case, which was considered exceedingly hard where the husband died seized, and the heir refused to assign dower within the forty days, during which the wife was privileged to remain in the mansion house, and after which she was compelled to leave and sue for her dower. To remedy this special grievance the statute of Merton was passed, giving to widows who were \u201c deforced of their dowers, and cannot have their dower or quarantine without plea\u201d in the lauds whereof their husbands died seized, damages to the fall value of their dower from the time of the death of their husbands. Judge Paterson, in revising the statutes of New Jersey, thought proper, in reenacting the statute of Merton, to provide for damages in the case not provided for in the English act, <em>viz. </em>when the husband did not die seized, and in that case damages were given from the lime demand was made of the tenant, because he came rightfully into possession during the life of the husband, and was entitled to notice of his death and demand of dower before be could be made liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">It is said, in argument, that our statute provides for four cases, <em>viz: </em>1, when deforced; 2,suit brought; 3, when dower is unfairly assigned; 4, or is not assigned within forty days ; and that the statute of Merton ouly provides for two cases \u2014 1, where deforced; 2, suit brought. But the object of both acts is the same, <em>vis. </em>when dower is withheld, to enable the widow to recover damages, if her husband died seized of the lands. The operative word of both is the word \u201cdeforced,\u201d so that suit has to be brought; and our act is only a little more specific as to what may be a deforcement, adding the cases when the dower is unfairly assigned or not assigned within forty days, to obviate any doubt that may have arisen whether these eases amounted to a deforcement. In order to recover damages under either act, the widow must be deforced, that is, her just dower withheld from her over forty days from the death of her husband, and she compelled to bring suit therefor, then she recovered damages under either act. But suppose our aet did not give damages in any case where the husband did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>not die seized, and the statute had terminated with damages \u201cfrom the time of her husband\u2019s death, if he died or shall die seized,\u201d and the last lines providing for the other case had been omitted, could any one then have doubted that our statute and the statute of Merton were identical, or that the connection of four causes for damages, instead of two, with the disjunctive conjunction only, would have made our act different? A widow, as before stated, can only bring her writ of dower for lands that her husband either died seized of or did not die seized of; if the latter, she recovers no damages in England, but under our act she recovers damages from the time demand made; if the former, she recovers from the death of the husband under the statutes of both countries. Under the English act, the heir could plead <em>tout temps prist, </em>because he was in by right of law, as the owner of the inheritance, from the death of the ancestor, and he was not compelled to assign dower till demand made, for the widow had not the right of entry on him, but might have her quarantine. Under our act, passed for the same purpose in substantially the same terms, the demandant can have no greater rights, and the defendant is entitled to equal privileges. That this was the intention of the legislature is the more apparent from the fact that, in the preceding section, they have extended the widow\u2019s quarantine from forty days \u201c until such dower be assigned,\u201d thus giving ample protection to the rights of the widow and a severe penalty for the negligence of the heir. The alienee cannot plead <em>tout temps prist, </em>because he cannot say he was always ready to assign dower, he must therefore abide by his covenant; but a devisee can say so, and can therefore plead the same plea, and for the same reason that the heir can. In discussing this matter, I have not considered the policy of the English rule on the questions of convenience, or otherwise, arising therefrom, but have merely endeavored to show that the two statutes are identical, and therefore that the construction placed on each should be the same. As the widow, under our act, may remain in the mansion house till dower is assigned, she may demand it when she pleases, and if removed by the heir or devisee, may maintain trespass, ejectment, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>dower against liim, no great inconvenience can result to the widow ; but if the husband die abroad, or not in the actual occupancy, it seems reasonable that the heir or devisee, who came in by right, and against whom no entry lies by the widow, should have notice of the demand, if she insists on damages, else he might be mulcted in damages for not assigning dower to one he could not find. Demand may be on the premises, and is binding on the owner, but dower can only be assigned to the widow herself; and if she presents herself in a situation <em>to </em>receive <em>it, </em>that is, demands it, and it is not assigned to her, she recovers damages not from such demand but from the husband\u2019s death.

In England, the practice is to move for leave to withdraw before judgment is <em>pronounced, \u201c </em>we will give judgment for the plaintiff, unless defendant asks for leave to withdraw plea.\u201d Here the practice is more liberal, but there is no case where a new plea has ever been allowed to be put in after the judgment was entered or after the term in which judgment is given. \u201c Let judgment be entered for the plaintiff, unless defendant plead anew in thirty days,\u201d is the usual rule for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Again, if the intimation in <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Brown </em>is law, <em>(Zabriskie </em>contended it was not) that the plea is not only useless but bad.</p>\n<p id=\"ABc\">The court, without assigning any reason, refused to grant leave to plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Cited <em>in Rogers </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>3 <em>Vr. </em>86; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>5 <em>C.
