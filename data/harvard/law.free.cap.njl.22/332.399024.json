The condition is, that the goods shall be returned, if judgment should be rendered for the plaintiff. It does not appear that any judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff in the attachment. Although the bond is taken for the benefit of all creditors, the sujt can only be maintained in case the plaintiff should recover. The court will not resort to construction for the purpose of charging a surety. As in Other cases, the rights of the other creditors are staked ou the success of the plaintiff in attachment, who may fail in his action or be non-prossed. The 28th section <em>(Rev. Slat. </em>54) guards against a- discontinuance, but not against a non-pros.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\">2. It does not appear that Hanness filed his claim, or that Smith appeared prior to setting aside the writ of attachment. The time is not stated when Hanness filed his claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\">3. It does not appear that any execution was ever issued, or any legal demand made for the property before this suit was brought. There is no breach until a delivery has been refused to an officer entitled to receive them, under and by virtue of a writ of execution. Until such writ issues upon the judgment, there is no possibility of a return, for there is no one entitled to receive them. They could not be tendered to the creditor. The bond was for a return of the. goods to the officer to satisfy an ascertained claim, of which the officer could know nothing until the writ was first placed in his hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">4. There were two writs of attachment issued, and it does not appear under which Hanness filed his claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\">5. It does not appear what creditors presented their claims, or what action was had on them, if presented. This is necessaiy, because there can be but one breach, and the whole damages must be at one time assigned. There can be but one recovery for the benefit of all the creditors. There can be but one breach, failure to return the goods, and the damages cannot exc\u00e9ed the appraised, or at any rate the real value of the goods. Until judgment in any suit, the bond cannot be prosecuted, because there is no way of ascertaining how much is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>due to each creditor but by the judgment. Is the money to be had, and the court then to appropriate?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-4\">There is serious embarrassment in this case, from one bond having been given upon two different writs, but no question is now intended to be raised upon this point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-5\"><em>J. Wilson, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">At the April term, 1847, of the Supreme Court, two writs of attachment were returned : 1st, <em>O\u2019Iiagan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>and 2d, <em>Oondit </em>v. <em>Smith and O\u2019Hagan. </em>At that term several creditors applied and liled claims, among them was James Hanness. At the same term Charles Smith appeared, and desired to have the attachment against him set aside. He tendered a bond, which the court approved, and the property attached was ordered to be delivered up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\">Ilanness came in and filed his declaration, which Smith accepted and pleaded to. O\u2019Hagan did not come in, and no notice was taken of him. <em>\\Scofidd. </em>The declaration shows that O\u2019Hagan\u2019s property was gi.ven up.] There was no property of O\u2019Hagan\u2019s to be given up, unless his rights under the first writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\">The suit upon the issue between Hanuess and Smith went down to the circuit for trial, when Smith gave a <em>relicta, </em>damages to be assessed at bar, which was accordingly done. Upon the judgment thereupon rendered an execution issued, directed to the coroners, to which a return <em>nulla bona </em>was made. Application was then made to this court to qrder the bond to be assigned for the benefit of the creditors, it being shown, by affidavit, that a notice had been served on Bonnel, reciting the judgment and execution, and requiring a redelivery of the property, and his refusal. The bond was tendered by the defendants without the knowledge of the creditors, and approved by the court. If objectionable in form, or because it recites two writs, still the defendants ought not to be permitted to object to its validity. The creditor was appointed assignee by the. court, for the purpose of bringing this suit. Judgment was taken by default against Smith at the last term. The surety has hied a general demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>1. I deny the narrow construction contended for. The last section of the act <em>(Rev. Stat. </em>63) says, it shall be construed in the most liberal manner, for the detection of fraud, the advancement of justice, and the benefit of the creditors. The writ is issued for the benefit of all the creditors. The bond is taken for the benefit of all the creditors, the property being given up, and it is for their return in case judgment should be given for any plaintiff who, having first duly applied, files his declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">2. It does appear that ITanness had applied prior to setting aside the writ; certainly it sufficiently appears upon general dem urrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">3. As to the third ground, the breach is laid as broad as the condition, and according to the terms of the statute. The matter, if necessary, is matter of evidence at the trial. But the parties are bound to take notice of the judgment. The condition <em>of </em>the bond was to return the goods, if judgment should be rendered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-7\">4. It is not necessary that it should appear in which writ the appearance was made. Perhaps it does appear in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-8\">5. It is attempted to be urged, that each and every creditor must wait for all the other creditors. But the condition of the bond is broken, and the bond is forfeited, and consequently an aetion may be maintained as soon as a recovery has been had by any one creditor. The court will hold the fund for the benefit of all the creditors.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b346-9\">Carpenter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AfR\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The declaration in this ease is upon an attachment bond given by Smith and his surety, Bonnel, upon the appearance by the former to two several writs of attachment issued out of this court, one against Smith alone, the other against Smith and one O\u2019Hagan. The proceeding undoubtedly was not a little irregular. A bond should have been given in each suit, and the appearance in the second suit should regularly have been by both defendants in the writ of attachment, and not by Smith alone. The second writ of attachment must necessarily have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>proceeded upon the ground of a joint indebtedness by Smith and O\u2019Hagan to the plaintiff in that writ, and the writ should have been dissolved upon the appearance of both defendants, and after giving such bond, as is prescribed by the statute. But by some oversight, upon the <em>ex paite </em>application of Smith, this bond was accepted and approved by the court, and the property attached was ordered to be delivered up. We do not, however, see why it may not be considered as a valid bond, at any rate under the first writ against Smith alone. The bond having been so imposed upon the creditors of Smith, who have applied under that writ, certainly the court will not permit him or his surety to dispute its validity, if, upon any reasonable construction, it can be sustained. If the condition be within the provisions of the statute, it will not be vitiated because of the unnecessary or improper recital of another writ, or because it also contains provisions applicable to such writ. Surplusage will not vitiate.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">If the bond be good, and indeed its validity has not been questioned, then the inquiry is, has it been forfeited ? One Hanness, a creditor of Smith, applied to this court, at the same term of April, to have his claim audited and adjusted. It is said it does not appear under which writ he applied. We apprehend that it does appear. The writs of attachment were dissolved, upon the condition that the defendant, Smith, would appear and accept a declaration at the suit of each applying creditor. He did in fact appear and accept a declaration of Hanness, who had previously applied to have his demand audited and adjusted. Demand against whom ? Not against Smith and O\u2019Hagan, but against Smith alone, and therefore necessarily under the first writ of attachment issued against Smith. The declaration (as well as the recitals in the bond) is encumbered by irrelevant and improper statements in regard to the second writ of attachment, but we are disposed to consider these statements as surplusage, and the declaration in this respect good on general demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">There is nothing in the objection taken, that it does not appear when Hanness applied, or that it was before the giving of the bond. Smith, the defendant, according to the condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of the bond, accepted a declaration at his suit, and it is too late now to raise any objection as to the time and mode of the application. If, however', any objection could be taken to the averment in the declaration, it is merely formal, and cannot be raised on general demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The act is to be construed liberally. The bond was taken, not for the security only of the plaintiff named in the writ, but of all the applying creditors. Such construction is to be adopted as will effectuate the object of the statute, if consistent with its terms. The condition is for the return of the goods, &amp;e., seized under the writ, in case judgment should be rendered for the plaintiff. Upon the obvious intent of the statute, it may reasonably be held to mean any plaintiff, who, as an applying creditor, may have tiled his declaration, and whose suit has proceeded to judgment. The objection, therefore, will not avail, that it does not appear that the plaintiff named in the writ of attachment had recovered a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Nor is the objection valid, that it does not appear what creditors have applied, or what action was had on their claims. The suit, it is true, is brought for the benefit of all the creditors, the bond being sued upon for their use by such person as the court may have directed, and to whom the bond is assigned for that purpose. The recovery of the damages is of course limited to the value of the goods, &amp;c., to secure the return of which the bond was given. The bond is forfeited if the goods are not returned, judgment having been secured in any one suit. The recovery being had, the appropriation will be a matter for the court in some subsequent proceeding, upon application by those creditors who may be entitled to share the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The breach laid in the declaration is in the words of the condition, and sufficient as a question of pleading. If it is necessary to issue an execution before the return of the goods can be legally demanded, it seems, as urged by the counsel of the plaintiff, to be a matter of evidence, and not of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The demurrer must be overruled, and judgment for the plaintiff, unless the defendant shall ask leave to withdraw the demurrer on the usual terms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
