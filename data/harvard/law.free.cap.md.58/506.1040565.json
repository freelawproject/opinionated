By deed dated the 10th of December, 1811, for the consideration of $2150, Bau conveyed to William Schluderberg, subject to the aforegoing mortgage to the Building Association, the mortgaged premises. On the 21st of August, 1880, The Harrison Building Association assigned the foregoing mortgage to Alexander H. Bobertson, the appellee. On the 21st of August, 1880, under Art. 4, secs. 182 to 192 of the Code of Public Local Laws, Bobertson obtained a decree for the sale of the mortgaged premises. On the 21th of October, 1880, on the petition of Schluderberg, and payment by him into Court of a certain sum, the sale was suspended, and the papers in the cause were referred to the auditor, to state an account of the claim under the mortgage. An account was thereupon stated, to which Bau and Schluderberg excepted. These exceptions were overruled by the Court, (Dobbin, J.,) and the account was finally ratified, and the case again referred to the auditor to state a further final account. On the 9th of June, 1881, the auditor filed a further account; to this account Bau and Schluderberg excepted. On the 1th of October, 1881, the Court passed an order finally ratifying the account of the auditor; and from this order the present appeal has been taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b519-7\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C.
