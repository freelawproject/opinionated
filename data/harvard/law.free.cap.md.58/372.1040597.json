The plaintiff has proved contributory negligence on the part of said Samuel Bitzer in this, that he cut off or detached the horses drawing the car in question from said car, at a point which involved increased and unnecessary danger to himself; that cutting off or detaching said horses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>from said car at or east of Albemarle Street, would have been less dangerous, and cause of reason has been .shown by the proof, of which prevented him from continuing to drive said car to or east of Albemarle Street, before cutting off <em>or </em>detaching said horses therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">3.

Ins. Co., </em>2 <em>Cranch, </em>127.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-11\">This principle must be applied to this action, for it is brought under a statute, (Article 65 of the Code) which confers a right before unknown. The author above cited goes on to say, \u201cSo if the liberty of appealing from a decision is given subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions, such as giying notice of appeal, and entering into recognizances, or transmitting documents within a certain time,-a strict compliance with these provisions would be imperative, and non-compliance fatal to the right of appeal.\u201d <em>R. vs. Oxfordshire, </em>1 M. <em>&amp; S., </em>446; <em>R. vs. Carnarvon, </em>4 <em>B. &amp; A., </em>86; <em>R. vs. Bond, </em>6 <em>A. &amp; E., </em>905 ; <em>R. vs. Lancashire, </em>8 <em>E. &amp; B., </em>563; <em>R. vs. Lancashire, </em>27 <em>L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>J.

For the conduct of this it was as essential that appellant\u2019s servants should keep in order the track where the accident occurred, as that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company should have drivers and teams to deliver the cars to appellant. All those who were so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>engaged in furthering the objects of this common enterprise, were servants of the partnership,' and hence coemploy\u00e9s. Even though their wages were paid in the first instance by the several companies engaging them, yet they were in the result paid by the partnership in the mileage allowed to each Company. <em>Waland vs. </em>Elkins, 1 <em>Starkie, </em>272; <em>Fremont vs. Coupland, </em>2 <em>Bing., </em>170; <em>G.

So here, deceased, while on defendant\u2019s track, driving this car to its place, was the servant of the partnership or of the defendant, and not of his general employer, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. But the rule is not confined to those who are in strictness co-employ\u00e9s, but applies to any one who enters upon and continues in an occupation which he must know will expose him to such a. risk. <em>Illinois, &amp;c.

How it was usual to do it is fully sho-wn by the testimony in the record, and the prudent course is shown by the testimony of Mullen. The course taken by deceased clearly brings the case within the principle decided by this Court. <em>Lewis vs. B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>38 <em>Md., </em>392. See also <em>Williams vs. Iowa Cent.

Under this, then, there arise three questions, viz., <em>(a.) </em>Were those prayersof the defendant objectionable ? (b.) If not, does the Court\u2019s instruction cover the same ground? And (c.) Is it good law ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-8\"><em>a. </em>The defendant\u2019s third prayer simply states, as matter of law, that if the duty was, dangerous, deceased took upon himself all the <em>natural </em>risks and perils incident to its performance; and if his death occurred owing to an accident <em>incident </em>to that employment, there can be no recovery. It certainly seems impossible to state the law with regard to dangerous employments more accurately. It will be observed that the prayer does not undertake to discharge the defendant from liability for injury caused by its negligence. <em>Gibson vs. Erie R. R. Co., </em>63 <em>N. Y., </em>449; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. vs. Stricker, </em>51 <em>Md., </em>47; <em>Owen vs. R. R. Co., </em>1 <em>Lans., </em>108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">The defendant\u2019s fourth prayer presents the question of contributory negligence in not being aware of the defective condition of the track, if it had existed for three or four days previous to the accident, or if he was aware of it, in not using his knowledge for' his own protection. This prayer correctly states the law as laid down by this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-6\">Those who come, whether in the course of duty or otherwise, into dangerous places, are bound to use their senses. <em>State, use Foy vs. P., W. &amp; B. R. R.

If the jury so found, his acquaintance was so much the more thorough with its risks; and if the third prayer was good law, so <em>a fortiori </em>was the eleventh. <em>Woodley vs. Metrop. &amp;c. Rw., </em>2 <em>Exch. Div., </em>384.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-9\">These prayers then present four utterly distinct questions of law. Are they all raised by the Court\u2019s instruction? It would seem to raise the question presented by the defendant\u2019s third prayer, and, possibly that contained in the fourth, though it cannot be said to cover it because it omits important facts appearing in the record, (and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the fourth prayer,) going to deceased\u2019s means and opportunities of knowledge, and hence could not furnish as clear a guide to the jury. It does not cover the defendant\u2019s tenth prayer, as it leaves out the question of continuous user <em>without </em>complaintr. Further, it does not cover defendant\u2019s eleventh prayer, because it leaves out the fact that deceased had, for several months before the accident, continuously performed this duty\u2014a fact going most materially to the question of his knowledge, and hence to the defendant\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-5\">If any of the defendant\u2019s rejected prayers, other than the third and fourth, tenth and eleventh, are good law, the Court\u2019s instruction should not have been given. It is further defective in that the latter part of it goes merely to the question of deceased\u2019s seeing and avoiding the defects in the roadway, if such existed at the time of the accident. It therefore raises the question of contributory negligence, apparently only in the fact of the accident, or at least is open to that construction by the jury, and so objectionable as misleading. In conclusion, if it does not cover the questions, or leave the jury to find the facts recited in the defendant\u2019s third and fourth, tenth and eleventh prayers, and those prayers are good law, the Court\u2019s instruction is not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s first prayer falls, of course, if the defendant\u2019s prayers with regard to lack of evidence, co-employment, the voluntary assumption of the risk of negligence of defendant\u2019s servants, the continued use of the track without complaint and contributory negligence in law, or any of them, should have been granted. The prayer goes to the whole case, and is misleading as not putting to the jury some of the most material facts and circumstances <em>proved\u2014e. g. </em>the length of deceased\u2019s employment in this duty; its danger; that there were safer ways of performing it, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and there is nothing-in any of the prayers that were granted on either side, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>remedy the omissions, or to qualify the too broad statement of the law contained in this prayer. It is further misleading, in that it does not require the jury to find that deceased was employed by a third outside party\u2014e. <em>g. </em>the B. &amp; O. R. R. Oo. It merely says, \u201cif they shall find from the evidence that Samuel Bitzer was the driver of a car in use on the road of defendant, in pursuance of the written agreement given in evidence.\u201d These facts, if found, are perfectly consistent with his being the directly employed and paid servant of the <em>defendant, </em>or of the \u201cNew York and Washington Through Line\u201d partnership, or a volunteer\u2014-in none of which cases could there be a recovery for negligence of defendant\u2019s servants. It states no facts jrom which a duty can be raised from defendant to deceased to keep the track in repair. <em>Winterbottom vs. Wright, </em>10 <em>M. &amp; W., </em>109 <em>Seymour vs. Maddox, </em>16 <em>A. &amp; E., N.

The Maryland Act, is in this respect, an exact copy of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, (9 and 10 Victoria, ch. 93,) and has been fully construed in <em>Murphy vs. Logan, </em>10 <em>Irish Law R., N.

It has been well settled, in the cases which have construed the Act, that this provision of it, is simply directory, and not mandatory; and similar to bills of particulars in all other cases; when furnished, its only office and effect is to restrict the plaintiff\u2019s proof, and limit his recovery to the claim as therein stated. <em>B. &amp; O.

It is well settled law, that if the defendant pleads to the declaration, he will be held to have waived his right to the particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s demand. <em>Randall vs. Glenn, 2 Gill, </em>430; <em>Poe\u2019s Pleading, </em>88. It is equally well settled, that a bill of particulars does not constitute a part of the record. <em>Murphy vs. Logan, (supra,) </em>and as a motion in arrest of judgment lies only for matters apparent on the face of the record, it is manifest that the absence of a bill of particulars cannot be taken advantage of in this way. <em>Poes Pleading, </em>658.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">There is nothing in the record that would justify the \u25a0Court in finding that no full particular, as required by the statute, had been furnished the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s first prayer is a plain legal statement of the facts of the case, unobjectionable on any grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-8\">The second prayer of the plaintiff, is a substantial copy of that granted in the case of the <em>Balto. &amp; O.

It is submitted, that with this evidence before it, it would have been a glaring error in the Court to grant these instructions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-6\">Eor the same reason that it would' have been equally an error for the Court to have granted the second and third portion of the defendant\u2019s second prayer, as there was evidence to show that the place where deceased cut off the horses from the car, was a usual and customary place, and was perfectly consistent with the use of ordinary care and prudence upon his part; but in any event the full amount of law to which the defendant was entitled upon this point, was contained in its .seventeenth prayer,, which was granted by the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-7\">As regards the last two sections of the second prayer, and the tenth prayer, it is submitted that they contain grave errors, and were properly refused by the Court. There was no eviden\u00f3e that the deceased was ever aware of any defects in the track or road-bed, and, it is submitted that it would be most extraordinary and unreasonable to require the driver of the car, who is already engaged in a most dangerous occupation, to still further augment his danger by being required to be constantly on the watch to see that the road-bed was in perfect order; the deceased certainly had the right to presume and expect that the track of the defendant was in a proper condition, situated as it was in its depot. The effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>granting this instruction would have been to make the deceased responsible for the negligence of the defendant\u2014 a monstrous doctrine, utterly unsupported by authority. The instruction, in fact, virtually asked the Court to-instruct the jury as a matter of law, that the defendant was guilty of want of ordinary care and prudence. <em>Snow vs. Housatonic R. R.

They are not fellow-servants unless they are all under the control of a common master. Wherefore a servant of a railroad company employed in its service upon a section of road used by it in common with another corporation, under a mutual contract between the companies, may recover damages against that corporation for injuries sustained by reason of the negligence of its servant. And where one corporation hires from another the use of its track, a servant of the former can recover from the latter for any injury caused by defects in the track.\u201d <em>Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, page 130, sec. </em>101; <em>Snow vs. Housatonic R.

The rule which exempts a master <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>from liability for an injury inflicted by one of his servants upon another, is based upon an implied contract, between a servant and his master, that the former will accept all the natural and ordinary risks incident to the business in which he is engaged, which include the negligence of those whom the master may associate with him. In this view of the reason of the rule, it is a rule based upon a privity of contract. A, when he enters into the service of B, impliedly says to B, \u201c you having selected fit and competent servants to work with me, I assume the risk of injuries from their negligence.\u201d But he does not say, \u201cI assume the risk of injuries from the negligence of the servants of C, D, or E, in connection with whom I may be obliged to work.\u201d Again, if the rule is not supposed to rest in an implied contract, but to be one founded solely in public policy, the object being to make all fellow-servants interested in watching over each other, how can it be applied to the servants of different masters ? What possible duty can the servant of A be under to watch over the servant of B, to intermeddle with his work and report his delinquencies ? Undoubtedly he owes such duty to his own master, but upon what principle can he be charged with such a duty to a stranger ? <em>Thompson on Negligence, page </em>1043, <em>note; Smith vs. New York &amp;c.

Co., </em>3 G. &amp; <em>J., </em>450.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b409-4\">Gjelason, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7L\">delivered tlie opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">At the trial of this caso, in the Circuit Court for Carroll County, exceptions were taken by the appellant, to the granting of the three prayers of the appellee, as well as to the rejection of all its prayers, except the seventh, thirteenth, fourteenth and seventeenth, as also to the instruction given by the Court in lieu of the third, fourth, tenth, and eleventh. A motion in arrest of judgment was also filed, which was overruled, and we will dispose of that before considering the prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The motion is based on twelve reasons, which are especially assigned in the motion filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The first and second reasons assigned are, that the appellee did not comply with the third section of Article 65 of the Code, under which the suit is brought, by delivering, with the declaration, to the defendant, or its attorney, a full particular of the persons for whom and in whose behalf the action was brought, and the nature of the claim in respect of which damages were sought to be recovered. The object of this section of the Code was to have the defendant furnished with information, which would enable it to plead to the declaration and make its defence to the suit. In the case of <em>The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company vs. The State, use of Woodward, </em>41 <em>M.d., </em>297, this Court has said that the particular, when furnished, is intended for the same purpose and has the same effect as a bill of particulars in other cases, and restricts the plaintiff\u2019s proof and limits his recovery to the claim therein stated. The particular is to be given to the defendant for his own benefit, and, as the defendant in this case did not demand it, but filed its pleas without it, it may be considered as having waived its right to have it. But we do not think that this section is mandatory. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>right of action existed before the declaration was filed, and, in this case, the declaration, when filed, stated the names of the parties for whose use the suit was brought, and described them as the widow and children of Samuel Bitzer, deceased; stated particularly the injury to, and consequent death of, Samuel Bitz\u00e9r, \"and the nature and amount of their claim, and it is difficult to conceive what more particular statement could have been furnished to the defendant. The 65th Article of our Code seems to have been copied from Lord Campbell\u2019s Act of 9 and 10 Victoria, ch. 93, and sec. 4 of that Act has been construed in the case of <em>Murphy vs. Logan, </em>10 <em>Irish Com. Law, </em>87. In that case no particular had . been furnished or delivered to the defendant, and that fact was pleaded in bar of the action. To this plea a demurrer was interposed and Perrin, Judge, in delivering the opinion of the Court, said, that the delivery of a particular to the defendant was \u201c a requirement merely in accordance with the rules and practice of the Court in which the action may be depending. But the right of action accrues prior to the issuing of the declaration, and exists altogether independently of the fact of the -declaration being issued or not. If the defendant require particulars, he should call upon the plaintiff to furnish them; or, in case of his refusal, apply to the Court to compel him to do so and the demurrer was sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The requirement to deliver a \u201cparticular,\u201d as provided by sec. 3 of the Code, is merely directory, and in nowise affects the right of the plaintiff to maintain the suit. It is no part of the record; is not even required to be filed, but merely delivered to the defendant or its attorney. Motions in arrest are for matters apparent on the face of the record, and for this reason, as well as for those before stated, the first and second causes assigned, furnish no ground for sustaining the motion. The declaration alleges that Sarah Bitzer is the widow, and the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>equitable plaintiffs are the children of Samuel Bitzer, that his foot was caught in the imperfect track of the defendant through the wrongful act, default or neglect of the defendant, and not through his own default or negligence, that he was thereby thrown down and the car crushed beneath its wheel truck and body, the left leg and body of said Samuel Bitzer in a horrible manner, thereby causing his death, and the plaintiff claims ten thousand dollars. The declaration, therefore, contains sufficient averments in substance that Samuel Bitzer was rightfully on the defendant\u2019s road in his lawful employment; that the latter\u2019s road was imperfect through its negligence, and that said Bitzer though not negligent himself had his foot caught in the imperfect track of the defendant, and that in consequence thereof the cars which he had in charge, ran over him, and caused his death, 'for which the equitable plaintiffe claim ten thousand dollars damages for the loss sustained by them, in consequence of his, the said Samuel Bitzer\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">It was not necessary to allege that the defendant\u2019s negligence was such that, if death had not ensued, Samuel Bitzer himself would have been entitled to recover for the injury done him. There was nothing therefore in any of the other reasons assigned, which furnished any ground for sustaining the motion in arrest, and it was therefore properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The three prayers granted at the instance of the appellee, state the law with respect to negligence and the measure of damages, as it has often been heretofore announced by this Court, in cases arising under the 65th Article of the Code, and no valid objection can be urged against them, and there is evidence in the record to support them, and which was properly submitted to the jury, and they were rightly granted. There was no evidence of any such gross or glaring neglect on the part of Samuel Bitzer, as would justify the Court in saying that it amounted in law to contributory negligence. The evidence of negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>on the part of the appellee as well as on the part of the appellant was conflicting, and it was properly left to the jury whose peculiar province it was to consider, and pass upon it. The appellant\u2019s first prayer was, therefore, properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The appellant\u2019s second prayer seeks an instruction that the appellee was not entitled to recover for the various reasons especially assigned therefor. All these reasons* except the fourth, have been disposed of in what we have said with respect to the reasons assigned in the motion in' arrest and the appellant\u2019s first prayer. The fourth will he disposed of in connection with the appellant\u2019s eighth* ninth, twelfth, fifteenth and sixteenth prayers. They are all based on the theory, that if the appellant\u2019s track was out of repair and imperfect through its own neglect, and that in consequence of such imperfect condition of its track, Samuel Bitzer lost his life, that still the appellee was not entitled to recover, because the said Bitzer was a coemploy\u00e9 of the appellant\u2019s employes. This theory is based upon the agreement, set out in the record, between the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company, the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Transportation Company, the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad Company, parties of the first part, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, the appellant, of the second part, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company of the third part. \u2022 This agreement was entered into for the purpose of securing comfort, speed and safety in the through passenger travel between New York and Washington, and to secure harmony of action between said parties to accomplish that object. Whatever effect this agreement might have upon the parties to it, it could not have any upon strangers to it, nor alter nor change the relations of either _ of them towards third parties, nor have the effect of making those, who were employed and paid wages by either of the contracting parties, the co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>employ\u00e9s of the agents and workmen of the other parties, nor make the others liable, either severally or jointly, for any loss or damage caused by the neglect of any one of them, even had the agreement been silent in this respect. But in order to guard against any such result the agreement itself expressly provides, that \u201cif an accident shall happen whereby damages to persons or property shall be incurred, the party on whose road the same shall happen shall alone be responsible.\u201d The road on which the accident, which is the cause of this suit, happened, is admitted to be the road 'of the appellant. The principle invoked in favor of the fourth reason, assigned in support of the first prayer and also in support of the eighth, ninth, twelfth, fifteenth and sixteenth prayers is, that every employe assumes the risk of the negligence of his co-employ\u00e9s. Samuel Bitzer was not employed or paid by the appellant, but was employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, and therefore this principle is not applicable to him, and, consequently, the fourth reason assigned in support of the first prayer cannot be maintained, and that prayer, as well as the eighth, ninth, twelfth, fifteenth and sixteenth prayers were properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The fifth prayer was rightly refused for the same reason we have assigned for affirming the Court\u2019s ruling upon the first prayer, and that is, that there was evidence from which the jury were at liberty to find that the death of Samuel Bitzer was caused by the negligence of the appellant\u2019s agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The jury had been instructed by the appellee\u2019s first prayer that they must find negligence on the part of the appellant, or its agents, in order to find a verdict for the appellee, and therefore the appellant had, under that instruction, obtained all that was asked by its sixth prayer, and there was therefore no error in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The third, fourth, tenth and eleventh prayers, we think, were well calculated to mislead the jury. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>contain the proposition that if Samuel Bitzer had been in the habit of driving cars over the track of the appellant for some time before his injury, and that, if that business was dangerous, and that part of his duty was to cut off or detach the cars at a point where the same could be properly done, and had done so without complaint of the condition or construction of the road or track, and that with the use of ordinary observation he could have been aware of its condition and construction, he took on himself the risk of such employment, and the appellee was not entitled to recover. If these prayers had been granted, the jury, although they may have believed from the evidence that Bitzer came to his death by having had his foot caught by a spike, or his heel fastened in a hole, in the appellant\u2019s road, which it was its duty to keep in good condition, might have supposed that such accident was a risk incident to the employment in which he was engaged. The Court did right in refusing these prayers; and the appellant has no just cause to complain of their rejection, because the Court, by the instruction given in lieu of them, told the 'jury, if they found substantially all the facts enumerated in those prayers, that then \u201cthe plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this case, if the jury shall find that the accident which caused his (Bitzer\u2019s) death, occurred in consequence of said risk, and not in consequence of a defect or defects in the defendant\u2019s track or road-bed, which the said Bitzer. could not, by the use of ordinary care on his part, have seen and avoided.\u201d This instruction placed all the facts fairly before the jury from which they were at liberty to find either for the appellee or the appellant, as they might find that either the appellant or Bitzer had been guilty of negligence.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b414-7\">(Decided 11th July, 1882.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Finding no error in the rulings of the Circuit Court, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
