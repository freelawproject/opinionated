It required the jury to find that the <em>specific claim </em>sued for had been disputed and rejected, whereas, the rejection of the whole claim, as passed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, without a special designation of the item embraced in this suit, was sufficient to entitle the appellant to the benefit of the statute. <em>Section </em>108, <em>of Art. </em>93, <em>of the Code.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-9\">The prayer is also bad, because it requires the jury to find that the claim was presented \u201c <em>to the administrators </em>for payment, and was <em>by them </em>disputed or rejected:\u201d whereas a presentation to the appellant <em>alone, </em>as one of the administrators, and the rejection by <em>him, </em>was sufficient to let in the bar of the statute. <em>Coburn vs. Harris, </em>53 <em>Md., </em>373; <em>Toller on Ex\u2019rs, </em>360; <em>Watkins vs. State, 2 G. &amp; J., </em>226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-10\">The appellant\u2019s first, second and sixth prayers should have been granted. They present the appellant\u2019s theory of the case. The claim, including the item now sued on, was presented, and payment demanded on the 28th of March, 1818.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-11\">As presented, it was disputed and rejected at that time. Suit was brought to the September Term, 1818, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>.whole claim. Again the whole claim was disputed and rejected, and in June, 1819, the item now sued for was abandoned and withdrawn from that action, and this suit was not brought until March 4th, 1880\u2014nearly two years after the first dispute and rejection-\u2014eighteen months after the second rejection, and nine months after the claim for the sum now sued for was abandoned in order that a new- suit might be brought. Surely this was a \u25a0sufficient dispute and rejection-to entitle the appellant to the benefit of the statute. \u2022 It is difficult to imagine what more he could have done to demonstrate his rejection of the claim.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-5\">The disputing.of the bill, as presented, was a disputing of the whole bill, and each and every item of it, and it was accordingly error \u2022 to refuse the appellant\u2019s first prayer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-6\">The disputing by way of plea in the first suit, of the whole claim, as set out in the bill of particulars, was, in like manner a disputing and rejection of each and every item of it; and the second and sixth prayers of the appellant were, for this reason, improperly refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-7\">The abandonment\u2019 of the item now sued tor, and its withdrawal from the first action did not make it any the less the claim originally attempted to be recovered in that action, nor relieve it from the dispute and rejection which had already taken place, both on the 28th of March, 1818, when the whole claim was presented to the appellant by Mr. Stewart, -and on the 3rd of September, 1818, and up to June, 1819, when the whole claim, as set out in, the bill of particulars, including the very item .now in question, was denied by the pleas of the administrators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-8\">It is apparent, therefore, that the jury were not properly instructed, nor was the. law given to them as the appellant was entitled to have it declared. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>William A.

The only claims that it is necessary to have passed, are claims \u201cagainst his decedent,\u201d (Article 93, section 83,) that is, claims which are complete at the death of the decedent, or which will become complete by the lapse of time, or happening of some contingency. Authentication is required because the executor is not presumed to have any personal knowledge of the claims, but section 108 does not apply to claims which are only completed by the personal act, and with the full knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>executor. The oath required of the creditor is that he \u201chath not received any part of the money stated to be due, or any security,\u201d &amp;c. <em>Article </em>93, <em>sec. </em>92.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-5\">The executor cannot need the information, or sanction of this oath, in the case of claims which have, accrued by his own act, and of which he has full knowledge. Moreover, this claim is one that did not exist, and could not have been passed at the time of Thomas Coburn\u2019s death. Had the administrators failed to complete the wall, this claim never would have arisen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-6\">Section 100, Article 93, shows that the claims subject to dispute or rejection are those which the administrator has. \u201creason to believe that the deceased never owed.\u201d See <em>Smith vs. Patton, </em>9 <em>Abb. Pr., N. S., </em>205, 208.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">It cannot be that an administrator can be allowed to avail of this section to defeat a recovery for materials, which, under the contract of his intestate, he himself has demanded and received and converted into assets, which he proposes to divide among distributees, of which he himself is one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">If this claim be within section 108, it is not barred, because the appellee <em>did, </em>within nine months after the alleged rejection, \u201ccommence a suit for recovery,\u201d viz., September, 3rd, 1878. That suit remained j&gt;ending until June, 1879. The bill of particulars shows beyond question that that suit was commenced in part for the recovery of this very claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">On the objection of the appellant, evidence relating to it was excluded, and the Court held it to be not covered by the issues on the pleadings, but it nevertheless- was a suit brought in part for recovery of this claim. That suit not only complied literally with the statute, but answered its practical purposes. To hold appellee to the rigid, technical rules of pleading, under this section; to say that, although in perfect good faith he does commence his suit, if any mischance happens, his claim is lost, is to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>make this penal law a snare and a trap, and to give it a construction unwarranted by the authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">When several distinct claims, arising under separate contracts, happen to be passed in one account, a dispute of one is not a rejection of all. A refusal to pay the cutir\u00e9 aggregate, because one disputed claim is embraced in the account, is not a \u201crejection\" of others, which are impliedly or expressly admitted to be correct. The only rejection recognized is one based on the belief that the decedent did not owe the particular claim in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">Though George Coburn\u2019s rejection be taken to include this claim, it was not final and unqualified. He testifies that he refused to pay <em>\u201cunless the proper corrections were made.\u201d </em>The rejection must be filial, absolute and unqualified. See <em>Hoyt vs. </em>Bonnett, 50 <em>N. Y., </em>538.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">In <em>Elliott vs. Cronk's Adm'rs, </em>13 <em>Wend., </em>35, the administrator refused to pay, on the ground that he had not had time to examine affairs, and did not know whether the claim was just or not; held, not sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-8\">What has been said covers the refusal of appellant\u2019s first and second prayers, and the same considerations should have caused the refusal of his third and fourth. In fact, however, under those prayers he got the benefit of having the claim construed, as being within section 108, of his point on the rejection by one administrator, on his point that a refusal to pay the aggregate account was a rejection of this claim, although no mention was made of it at the time, and indeed of every one of his defences.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-9\">In respect to the appellant\u2019s sixth prayer, there is no evidence that the appellee, at the first trial, \u201cabandoned the item now sued for in this case,\u201d to say nothing of its leaving to the jury the legal question of what constitutes an abandonment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-10\">The instruction given by the Court is fully sustained, and is more liberal to appellant than is warranted, by the cases of <em>Hoyt vs. Bonnett, </em>and <em>Elliott vs. Cronk\u2019s Adm\u2019rs.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u25a0 Irving, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4o\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">This is an action of assumpsit brought by the appellee, against the appellant, in the Baltimore City Court, on the 4th of March, 1880. The declaration in a single count, claims for money payable to plaintiff for goods bargained and sold by the plaintiff to the defendant's intestate, in his life-time, and delivered since his death to George Coburn aforesaid, and John Coburn, administrators of said Thomas Coburn, the said John Coburn having since said delivery been relieved and discharged by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Baltimore City, from his office of co-administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">' The following bill of particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was filed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">Estate of Thomas Coburn, dec\u2019d, (George Coburn, Adm\u2019r,)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">Dr. To John Harris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">To 415 perches of stone, furnished for construction of wall at Greenmount Cemetery, from the date of the death of Thomas Coburn in Sept., 1811, to Dec\u2019r 11th, 1811, at $2.00 per perch, $880.00 Interest from Dec\u2019r 11, 1811.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The case was defended on plea of non-assumpsit, and that suit was not brought within nine months after the rejection of the claim by administrator, under sec. 108, of Art. 93, of the Code of Public General Laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">It appears that. Thomas Coburn was in his life-time under a contract with Greenmount Cemetery Company to build. a certain wall; and that he contracted with the plaintiff to furnish him all the stone he needed for the construction of the wall, at two dollars per perch; and that Thomas Coburn having died without completing the wall, the administrators after his death proceeded to finish the work. This suit is to recover for the stone alleged to have been delivered the administrators, after the death of their intestate, for the completion of the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>A judgment has already been obtained in another suit against this appellant for the stone delivered the intestate in his life-time. The bill of particulars in that suit included tire stone which is the subject -of this action, but under the pleadings in that case, recovery for the stone furnished the administrators after the death of the intestate, was denied; and this suit has been instituted for it. In the other suit the <em>whole </em>claim was resisted by plea of <em>never promised as alleged, </em>and other pleas not necessary to be referred to for the purposes of this case. The record of that case was offered in evidence in this case, and evidence tending to prove the indebtedness now sued for. \u00edt also was in evidence that this claim with others, duly authenticated, and passed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, was exhibited, on or about the 28th of March, 1878, to the appellant lor payment, by the attorney of the appellee, and was objected to, and was not paid; that the suit already mentioned was then instituted, and that claim or right, to recover the amount now claimed in that suit under its pleadings, was abandoned in Court, on the 12th day of June, 1879. In the former suit the pleas of nonassumpsit were interposed as early as September 3rd, 1878. The pleadings were subsequently amended, and issue was joined on May 30th, 1879. Upon these facts the appellant framed prayers in the present case, invoking the protection of the 108th sec. of Art. 93, of the Code of Public General Laws, because the suit had not been bi-ought within nine months after the exhibition to, and rejection of the claim by him. The Court adopting the theory that sec. 108, of Art. 93, did apply, and barred the suit, if the jury should find the facts enumerated, granted the third and fourth prayers of the appellant, but refused the sixth prayer. This refusal is one of the grounds of error relied on by the appellant. In addition to the facts set out in the fourth prayer, the sixth prayer also contained the following: \u201cand that subsequently a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>suit was brought therefor, by the plaintiff in the Baltimore City Court on the third day of September, 1818, against George Coburn and John Coburn, the joint administrators of said Thomas Coburn, and the said defendants in said suit pleaded, that they never were indebted as alleged; and that they never promised as alleged, and if the jury shall further find, that at the trial of said case, the plaintiff amended the pleadings, and struck out John Coburn as one of the defendants, and prosecuted the case against George Coburn alone; and that in said case the plaintiff abandoned the item now sued for in this case, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant, even although the jury may further find, that after the death of Thomas Coburn, the plaintiff delivered to John Coburn as one of the administrators of said Thomas Coburn, the stone mentioned in the bill of particulars in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The manifest object of this prayer was to get the Court\u2019s instruction as to the effect of the former suit; as a demand of payment on the part of the plaintiff for his claim; and of the defendant\u2019s plea of non-assumpsit to the claim made in the declaration, (which included the item now sued for,) that is to say, whether such pleading amounted to a rejection of the claim by the defendant, so as to entitle him to the protection of sec. 108 of Art. 93, as an entire bar, because this suit was not brought within nine months from the defence so. made by him to that suit. A more formal demand than by suit could not be made, and a rejection of and refusal to pay could not be more solemnly and formally made than was made by pleas, such as were interposed, denying the plaintiff\u2019s claim <em>in tato; </em>and if the statute was applicable to such a claim as this is, we think that this prayer of the defendant ought to have been granted. In our opinion, however, the claim sued on in this case is not within the meaning or contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>plation of sec. 108 of Art. 93 of the Code. That section \u25a0refers to such claims against the decedent as imperatively require both authentication and passage by the Orphans\u2019 Court before the administrator would be protected in paying. Such claims as are referred to in secs. 92 and 93 of the same Article are intended by sec. 108, to be barred if the suit is not brought within nine months after exhibition to the administrator and rejection by him. In 53 <em>Md., </em>367, on an appeal between these same parties, in the suit which resulted in judgment for the plaintiff for that portion of the stone which was delivered in the intestate\u2019s life-time, this Court said, with respect to claims upon contracts with the decedent, that to entitle the administrator to plead sec. 108 of Art. 93, in bar, such claim when exhibited to or demanded of the administrator must have been legally authenticated, and also be passed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, so that he would he justified in paying it if he had chosen, instead of repudiating and rejecting it. This claim differs, we think, essentially, from the one there passed upon; for although it resulted from a contract with the intestate in his life-time, it was completed with the administrator ; and the Court ruled in the former case, on the trial below, that a count charging the contract with the intestate in his life-time would not admit proof, and justify recovery for such of the stone as was delivered alter his death to his administrator. The claim now sued for is not within the meaning of the section nor \u2022of that decision ; nor is it within the contemplation of the decision of <em>Zollickoffer\u2019s (Jase, </em>so far as that case refers to this sec. 108. It is without doubt a claim against the estate of the decedent; but it was not a wholly executed contract, so as to be within the contemplation of the law we are discussing. The decedent\u2019s contract was supposed to make it the duty of the administrator to complete the wall. The appellee\u2019s contract with decedent to furnish the stone, was also supposed to bind the administrator to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>take from him the stone necessary to complete the work,, and the stone was delivered to the administrator accordingly. The law provided for proof of claims against the , deceased, and passage hy the Orphans\u2019 Court to justify the administrator in paying, because the administrator was supposed to he ignorant of the character of such claims; hut where the claim arises on direct contract with the administrator; or, as this claim did, from dealing with the administrator, and delivery of the material to him, and he knows all about it; because he incurred the obligation ; or, as in this case, received the stone, the creditor need not get his claim proved and passed, before the administrator would he justified in paying -it. In thus-dealing with the creditor on behalf of the estate the administrator makes himself liable as such administrator, and he gets his allowance of the claim thus paid, according as the Orphans\u2019 Court may he satisfied he has acted fairly in the matter. But as a matter of practice, the administrator ought to fortify himself hy procuring the creditor\u2019s probate-. Whether such claim as this must he presented within any particular time or he barred, is not now before-us. The only question is, can the administrator plead the I08th sec. of Art. 93, which this Court said in <em>Zollickoffer\u2019s </em>Case, (44 <em>Md., </em>359,) was not intended as hare protection to the executor, or exoneration of him, hut operated to-forever bar the creditor who was in the default designated in it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We are clearly of opinion that this- claim is not within the reason of the law, and that the section invoked has no application, and could not he pleaded in bar to such claim. Entertaining this view, it follows that the appellant obtained from the Court in the instructions granted him even more than he was entitled to. The pleadings present no question of <em>plene administravit </em>or <em>res adjudicaba. </em>In fact, the appellant\u2019s counsel stated he had not made the point below, that the former suit concluded this. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>one, and did not claim that it could properly be pressed in-this Court.
