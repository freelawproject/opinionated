The real intent of a statute, when ascertained, will always prevail over the literal sense of the terms. If the words do not exclude doubt, the intention is to be collected from the occasion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>necessity' of the law. <em>State vs. Milburn, et al., </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>118; <em>Frazier vs. Warfield, </em>13 <em>Md., </em>279; <em>Cearfoss vs. The State, </em>42 <em>Md., </em>408.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Looking to the scope and purposes of the two Acts under consideration, their manifest relations do not bring them into conflict. Both were designed to expedite the acquisition of the fruits of a judgment. The Act of 1818 applies generally to the subject of executions, is evidently in contemplation of judgments as ordinarily obtained, and relieves the judgment creditor of the useless and hazardous delay incident to the issue of an execution, whose return it can be seen in advance must be \u201c <em>nulla bona,\u201d </em>before sending his writ to another county, where the debtor is known to have property; the proviso simply requiring an affidavit that no property can be found in the county where the judgment or decree has been obtained. This affidavit is required because the defendant is sued in the county where he resides, and where the trial is commonly had; and the presumption being that his property attends his residence, he should not be vexed with process distant from his | home when he has available assets at hand. This statute was plainly intended to apply to and facilitate executions incident to the usual and general course of obtaining judgments, which is in the county where the defendant resides. When, however, a case is removed, it is an- exceptional procedure, and it is for this special contingency that provisions such as. those contained in sections 115, 116, became necessary and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">To compel a judgment creditor in such a case to first issue an execution in the county to which the trial was removed, or to make affidavit that no property' of the -defendant can be there found, would be in the face of the legal presumption, which makes such an affidavit proper \u2022when the judgment is obtained in the debtor\u2019s own county; would as a rule be an empty and idle proceeding, and furnish, besides, the inducement of a greater delay in execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tion bv removing the case than the party could enjoy at home. In providing that execution may he issued in a removed case at once to the county where it originated, the losing party is placed exactly on the same footing as if the trial had proceeded to judgment in his own county. He suffers no hardship in this, and equality and uniformity in the process of satisfaction is preserved. The purpose of the legislative mind in providing for the removal of cases, was only to secure fairness in their trial, and not to alter or impede the mere satisfying of the judgment. Ho discrimination was meant to he made in this respect in favor of transmitted cases, the mere fruits of the litigation not entering into the policy underlying a change of venue.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b539-8\">(Decided 12th July, 1882.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Concurring with the Circuit Court, its order must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
