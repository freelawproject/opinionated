It contained the number of shares issued to him, and the entries of the payments made by him to the company, and had been produced by him at the request of the plaintiffs, and was offered in connection with the evidence of a witness, who proved, that the by-laws contained in it were the only by-laws the company ever had; that the company acted under said by-laws, and its business had been transacted in accordance with their provisions.

The only appointment of receivers contemplated by the Code is upon a bill filed for the dissolution of the corporation. Secs. 185 to 19T inclusive, all relate to proceedings instituted for the dissolution of corporations. The bill of complaint in this cause, in which the appellees were appointed, was filed for no such jrarpose. Sec. 190 provides that the receivers \u201cshall be vested with all the estate and assets of every kind belonging to such corporation . . . and they shall proceed to wind up the affairs of <em>such </em>corporation.\u201d The power \u201cto wind up \u201d clearly demonstrates that the Code contemplates only proceedings for dissolution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-5\">The case of <em>Hayes vs. </em>Brotzman, 46 <em>Md., </em>524, is not an authority here. That case was decided upon the \u201cdecree\u201d alone. The bill of complaint and the other proceedings were not in evidence. The decree provided that the corporation should bo wound up, &amp;c., and this Court assumed, in the absence of any proof to the contrary, that the appointment of the receivers was under the provision of A.rt. 26, <em>upon a proper bill filed for a dissolution.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-6\">In the present case the entire equity proceedings are produced, and they show that the bill was not filed under the Act of Assembly. The second prayer of the appellant should therefore have been granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-7\">The Circuit Court of Baltimore City has no jurisdiction over corporations for the |)urpose of dissolving, independently of the statute, and the bill of complaint did not present a case under the statute. Equity has no such jurisdiction in the absence of express statutory authority. <em>High on Receivers, secs. </em>287, 289. And whore the statute gives the right, the statute is strictly construed. <em>High on Receivers, secs. </em>287, 289.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Sec. 185, of Art. 26, <em>(Maryland Code, Supplement </em>1868,) provides that \u201cwhenever any corporation in this State shall have been determined hy legal proceedings to he insolvent, ... it may he adjudged to he dissolved after a hearing according to the practice of Courts of equity in this State, upon a hill filed for that purpose hy any creditor,\u201d &amp;c. The Article contains no other provision for dissolution upon the application of a creditor. In order to have given the Circuit Court jurisdiction under that Section, it was absolutely necessary that the determination of <em>insolvency by legal proceedings </em>should have been alleged in the bill of complaint. <em>Banks vs. McIntosh, </em>23 <em>Barb., </em>591.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\">The hill of .complaint in the Citizens National Bank case contained no such allegation, \u25a0 and the averments of the bill show that there had been no such determination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-6\">The appellant's third and fourth prayers should therefore have been granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-7\">The decree appointing the receivers was without authority in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">Because the hill of complaint did not give the Court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">Because the decree recites that it was passed, <em>\u201cby and with the consent of all parties.\u201d </em>The record contains no other proof of consent. The parties to the cause, besides the complainant, were the corporation and the purchasers of certain property sold by the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\">The decree was passed not hy the determination of the Circuit Court that the complainant was under the allegations of its hill entitled to any relief, hut hy virtue of and with the consent of the corporation. A corporation can he dissolved in equity, only in the mode prescribed by statute. There is hut one way provided hy Article 26 for a dissolution hy the consent of the corporation, and that is in accordance with secs. 186,187, &amp;c., and these sections require the bill to he filed <em>\u201cin the name of said corporation and on its behalf.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The decree was therefore a nullity and the appellant's fifth prayer should have been granted ; and his objection to the admission of the decree in evidence, sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-5\">The fifth count sets forth a contract \u201cto take five shares of the stock of the Franklin Land and Loan Company of Baltimore City, and <em>to pay </em>$400 <em>therefor </em>in weekly instalments of $1.00 per share, in each and every week until the full payment therefor.\u201d The by-law offered in evidence was to pay $400 for each share. The by-law was inadmissible under the state of the pleadings, and the appellant's objection thereto should have been sustained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-6\"><em>Samuel Snowden, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">The prayers of the plaintiff were properly granted\u2014 - they being identical with the prayers heretofore approved by this Court in the cases heretofore decided, upon the same state of facts. <em>Dorsey vs. Morrison, et al., </em>48 <em>Md., </em>461; <em>Musgrave vs. Morrison, et al., </em>54 <em>Md., </em>161; <em>Rider vs. Morrison, et al., </em>54 <em>Md., </em>429; <em>Frank vs. Morrison, et al., </em>55 <em>Md., </em>299.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-8\">The appellant was a member of the corporation. The book containing its by-laws was in his possession, and also the receipts for the payment of the instalments, and the same was therefore properly admitted in evidence, as was also the third article of said by-laws. The same question was in fact involved in the former appeal in this case under the sixth prayer, but the action of the Court below was sustained by this Court. The two exceptions seem to be taken, and the prayer offered, upon the ground that there is a variance between the by-law as offered and the contract set out in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-9\">There is no substantial variance between tire count in the declaration and the by-law offered in evidence. The omission of the words <em>\u201cfor each share\u201d </em>in the first part of the count, is not material, as in the allegation of the default, it is alleged that the instalments are due on <em>each </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>of said </em>shares. So that taking the first part of the count in connection with the allegation of the failure to pay, it can only mean that he had contracted to pay $400 for each share, and had failed to.pay the weekly instalments of one dollar for \u201c <em>each share.\u201d </em>The latter part in fact states what constituted the ground or gravamen of the action, and also the consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise, which is all that is required hy the rules of pleading, and the case comes clearly within the decisions of this Court. <em>Borden Mining Co. vs. Barry, </em>17 <em>Md., </em>419, 430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASKe\">The appellees were appointed receivers of the assets, &amp;c., of the corporation, by a Court of competent jurisdiction; and all the proof necessary, in order to enable them to maintain a suit, was a decree of the Court appointing them such receivers; and being thus appointed they were entitled, under the statute, to bring suits in their own names as such receivers, without any special order of the Coxrrt authorizing them. <em>Act of </em>1868, <em>ch. </em>471, <em>sec. </em>195; <em>Hayes vs. Brotzman, </em>46 <em>Md., </em>519.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">There was, however, a special* order authorizing the bringing of this suit against a stockholder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-7\">Clearly, for the purpose of proving their appointment, the certified copy of the decree appointing them was admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aza\">The winding up and distributing the assets of corporations when they become insolvent, at the instance of a creditor, is a jurisdiction that has been exercised by Courts of equity from the earliest times, and has long since become a settled head of that jurisdiction. The exercise \u00f3f such jurisdiction has been frequent in this State. <em>Hall vs. U. S. Ins. Co., </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>484, 497; <em>Ellicott vs. Same, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>307.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">The power to wind up a corporation and distribute its assets is very distinct from the power to dissolve the corporation. The latter cannot be done by a Court of equity except under the authority of the statute. <em>Angell &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Ames on Corporations, sec. </em>774. But the passing of the Act authorizing a dissolution does not take away the jurisdiction exercised by the Court before the passing of the statute. It having been decided that a corporation may convey away all its assets for the benefit of its creditors, and yet continue its existence, no reason can be given why a Court of equity may not wind it up and distribute its assets without dissolving it. <em>State vs. Bank of Md., </em>6 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">The bill under which the appellees were appointed shows upon its face a case within the jurisdiction of the Court. It alleges that the complainant is a creditor of the corporation to a large amount; that sales were being made of the property of the corporation upon terms injurious to the creditors; that it was hopelessly insolvent, &amp;c. These assets, which were trust property for the payment of the debts of the corporation, were being wasted, and the Court therefore, having the jurisdiction arising from the trust nature of the property, liad the power to apply that property to the payment of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>who were the creditors and stockholders of the corporation ; and the doing so was but the exercise of the ordinary jurisdiction of the Court, which was not interfered with by the statute conferring another power not before possessed by the Court. <em>Cockey vs. Cole, </em>28 <em>Md., </em>276; <em>Wright vs. Freeman, </em>5 <em>H. &amp; </em>J., 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">When the Court has jurisdiction it can only be taken away by express terms. <em>Tomlinson vs. Dunn, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>345.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">It thus appearing from the record that the subject-matter of the bill was within the jurisdiction of the Court of equity, the Court below, in a collateral proceeding, could not inquire into the mode and manner of the exercise of that jurisdiction, but was bound by the decree appointing the receivers and directing a winding up of the affairs of the corporation. <em>Raborg vs. Hammond, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>42, 49; <em>Ellicott vs. U. S. Ins.

The declaration contains five counts, the first four being common counts, and the fifth being a special count on the .contract, and it alleges that the defendant, prior to the first day of April, 1876, subscribed for, and agreed to take five shares of the stock of the Franklin Land and Loan Company, of Baltimore City, and to pay four hundred dollars therefor, in weekly instalments of one dollar per share, in each and every week, till the full payment therefor, and that the said defendant has failed to pay the weekly instalments of one dollar on each of said shares, for more than one hundred and fifty weeks past, and although demanded, he has not paid the same and the plaintiffs claim eight hundred and fifty dollars. To this declaration five pleas were filed, and the cause was tried by the Court, without a jury, and four exceptions were taken, three to the admission of evidence, to the admissibility of which objection had been made, and the fourth to the granting of the plaintiffs\u2019 three prayers, and to the rejection of the defendant\u2019s last five prayers, his first having been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The first and second exceptions were taken to the admission of the book of by-laws of the Franklin Land and Loan Company, and Article 3 of said by-laws in evidence. This book had been issued to the appellant by the secretary of the Franklin Land and Loan Company, and had been in his possession ever since it was so issued, and it contained the number of shares issued to him, and the entries of the payments made by him to the Company, and it had been produced by him at the request of the appellees, and it was offered in connection with the evidence of Charles G. Wilson, who proved that the by-laws contained in it were the only by-laws the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>company ever had; that the company acted under said bylaws, and its business had been transacted in accordance with their provisions. In addition to this proof, the appellant was a member of the company, and we cannot perceive any objection whatever to the admissibility of tlie evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The third exception was taken to the admission in evidence of the decree of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, appointing the appellees receivers to wind up the affairs of the Franklin Land and Loan Company, and directing them, among other tilings, to make all collections of outstanding indebtedness to the corporation, and to institute all such proceedings at law and in equity, as might be necessary for the purpose of enforcing its rights. This decree had been passed with the consent of all the parties to the suit, and was clearly admissible to prove the due appointment of the appellees as receivers, and their authority to institute and conduct this suit. The appellant then offered in evidence the entire record of said equity proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Wliat we have said in disposing of the third exception applies to the appellant\u2019s fifth prayer, which asked an instruction that the decree, offered in evidence, was without authority in law, and the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover in this action. The Circuit Court of Baltimore City had jurisdiction of the matter in controversy, and of tlie parties, and its decree was passed with the consent of all the parties to the proceeding, and is perfectly valid and binding upon them. The fifth prayer was therefore properly' rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The second, third and fourth prayers, are based upon the theory that the appellees are not entitled to bring and maintain this suit in their own names, and the second and third assign as a reason why they cannot, that the hill in the equity suit was not filed for the. purpose of winding up the affairs of the corporation and dissolving the same. It is true that there are authorities which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>assert that receivers are mere stakeholders, who merely hold the property for the time being, for the benefit of those who may he entitled thereto; that the title to the property is not in them, arid that all suits brought by them must he instituted in the name of the parties who are entitled to the property. But in this State this question has never been raised or decided in any case until 1877, when it was raised in the case of <em>Hayes, Receiver, vs. Brotzman, </em>46 <em>Md., </em>521. In that case, as in this, the hill was filed to wind up the affairs of the corporation through the hands of a receiver, and it was objected that the receiver could not sue in his own name, and this Court said: \u201cAs the cause of action in this case arose before the appointment of' the receiver, it is necessary, in order to maintain the action, <em>in Ms own name, </em>that it should he made to appear he has had conferred upon him the power and authority to sue.\u201d In that case, as in this, the decree authorized the receiver to prosecute suits at law and in equity, and it was held that this was sufficient authority for him to sue in his own name. In the case now before us the receivers have had conferred upon them express authority to sue, as appears in the record of this case when before this Court at October term, 1880, 55 <em>Md., </em>399. It was then held' by this Court that the receiver could sue in his own name independently of the Act of 1868, ch. 471, secs. 185 to 195. And such has been the uniform practice in this State, without the right to sue having been questioned until the case of <em>Hayes vs. Brotzman, </em>46 <em>Md., </em>524, 525. See <em>Dorsey\u2019s Case, </em>48 <em>Md., </em>461; <em>Musgrave\u2019s Case, </em>54 <em>Md., </em>161; <em>Rider\u2019s Case, </em>54 <em>Md., </em>429; <em>Frank\u2019s Case, </em>when before this Court before, 55 <em>Md., </em>399. The second, third and fourth prayers were, therefore, properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The sixth prayer asked an instruction that there was no evidence in the cause of a contract of a subscription as set forth in the fifth count of the declaration, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>under the pleadings, the verdict must he for the defendant. The declaration alleges that the appellant \u201csubscribed for and agreed to take five shares of the stock of the said Franklin Land and Loan Company, of Baltimore City, and to pay four hundred dollars therefor, in weekly instalments of one dollar per share, in each and every week,\u201d &amp;c., when the contract offered in evidence is that the defendant agreed to take five shares of stock, and pay therefor four hundred dollars <em>per share, </em>and pay therefor in weekly instalments, &amp;c. The contract provided that the appellant should pay instalments weekly on each of said shares, and the <em>non-payment of the instalments, dec. </em>was the gravamen of the complaint, and we are of opinion that there was no substantial variance between the fifth count of the <em>narr., </em>and the contract. See <em>Borden Mining Co. vs. Barry, </em>17 <em>Md., </em>419. In that case this Court said, quoting the language of Chief Justice Marshall, in <em>Sheeby vs. Mandeville, 7 </em>Cranch, <em>21</em>7, \u201cCourts being established for the purpose of administering real justice to individuals, will feel much reluctance at the necessity of deciding a cause on a slip in pleading, or on the inadvertence of counsel. They can permit a cause to go off on such point, only when some rule of law, the observance of which is deemed essential to the general administration of justice, peremptorily requires it.'\" The Court then says, with reference to the case before it, that the variance was not fatal nor even material; that the rate of freight to be paid need not have been set out in the <em>narr. </em>as the suit was not brought to recover freight earned, but damages on account of the failure of the defendant to load and unload the plaintiff\u2019s boats. So in this suit, the price to be paid for the shares of stock was not sought to be recovered ; but only weekly instalments for dues and interest and fines, until the company should have money enough in the treasury to pay every shareholder four hundred dollars for <em>each share </em>he held of the company\u2019s stock. The failure to pay such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>instalments and fines, being the gravamen of the complaint from which this suit arises. The sixth prayer was, therefore, also properly refused.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b454-8\">(Decided 11th July, 1882.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The three prayers offered by the appellees, and granted by the Court, are almost exact copies of prayers in other cases, which have heretofore been before and received the sanction of this Court. See <em>Dorsey\u2019s Case, </em>48 <em>Md., </em>461; <em>Musgrave\u2019s Case, </em>54 <em>Md., </em>161; <em>Reeder\u2019s Case, </em>54 <em>Md., </em>429, and <em>Frank\u2019s Case, </em>55 <em>Md., </em>399. These prayers stated correctly the law of the case and were properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Finding no error in the rulings of the Court below, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
