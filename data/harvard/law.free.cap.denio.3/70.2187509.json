Judge. The plaintiffs gave in evidence a promissory note with a guaranty written under it, signed by the defendant, in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-10\">\u201cNew-York, 30th June, 1841.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-11\">\u201c Sixty days after date the North American Trust and Banking Co. promise to pay to <em>the </em>order of Messrs. Swift &amp; Co. thirty-seven hundred dollars, for value received, with interest, having deposited with them as collateral security seven bonds of this company, secured under the Yates trust\u2014three for one thousand dollars,\u201d [giving the amounts and numbers of the bonds.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-12\">\u201c Thomas G. Talmage, Pres\u2019t.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-13\">\u201c For value received, I guarantee the payment of the above note at the time mentioned. J. D. Beers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>It was admitted that the North American Trust and Banking Company was a banking association, organized under the general banking law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, insisting that the note and guaranty were illegal and void: and the circuit judge being of that opinion, directed a nonsuit to be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-6\"><em>D. Graham, Jr., </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8V\">now moved to set aside the nonsuit, and for a new trial. He denied that by the true construction of the 4th section of the act of May 14,1840, amendatory of the general banking law, <em>(Stat. </em>1840, <em>p. </em>306,) all notes on time or on interest, were forbidden to be issued by the banking associations\u2014but only such as were intended to be issued or put into circulation as money. He referred to <em>Stat. </em>1838, <em>p. </em>246, \u00a7 3; <em>Safford </em>v. Wyckoff, (1 <em>Hill, </em>11;) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>(2 <em>id. </em>241;) <em>and Safford </em>v. <em>Wyckoff, </em>(4 <em>id. </em>442.) He also insisted that if the note were void, the guaranty was valid : and that a recovery could be had against the defendant either as a sole or a joint maker; and cited 17 <em>Wend. </em>40; 19 <em>John. </em>60; 1 <em>Hill, </em>256; 4 <em>id. </em>420; 19 <em>Wend. </em>202; 17 <em>id. </em>214.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-7\">S. <em>Sherwood, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3E\">The note is illegal and void\u2014being in direct violation of the act of 1840; and the defendant\u2019s guaranty being incidental and auxiliary to the principal contract, is also void. <em>(Story on Bills, ch. </em>6, \u00a7 187, <em>p. </em>277, <em>note </em>1; <em>Nellis </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>20 <em>Wend. </em>27; 4 <em>Pick. </em>314; 4 <em>Peters, </em>184.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-8\">The case was decided at the close of the argument.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-9\"><em>By the Court, </em>Bronson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnQ\">We have no doubt about this case. The note is directly within the terms of the prohibition of the act of 1840; and we do not doubt but that it was equally within the intention of the legislature. That act has no reference to the circulation of such notes as money, but was designed to prohibit them altogether for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The guaranty partakes of the character of the principal contract. It was intended to reinforce and secure it\u2014and is equally illegal. The circuit judge was right in nonsuiting the plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"ARL\">New trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
