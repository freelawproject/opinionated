The bond and warrant were executed, and the papers for the pui\u2019pose of entering the judgment were prepared and the record was signed on the <em>15th </em>of May. The papers were sent <em>from </em>Schenectzidy to the clerk\u2019s office in Albany by the nine o\u2019clock morning train of cars on the 16th; and should, in the usual course of things, have been received at the clerk\u2019s office by or before noon. But for some reason the judgment was not docketed until three o\u2019clock P. M. At two o\u2019clock P. M. of that day the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, supposing the judgment had been perfected, issued a <em>fi.fa. </em>to the sheriff of Schenectady county, who went to the defendant\u2019s store about ten minutes after receiving the execution ; but made no levy at that time. At eight o\u2019clock in the evening the sheriff returned, made a levy, and closed the store. About two hours afterwards the defendant executed a general assignment of his property for the benefit of creditors. There was a great number of affidavits in relation to the time of making the levy.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-7\"><em>F. S. Edwards &amp; M.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">On looking into the papers I am satisfied that at the time the judgment was confessed, and for several days afterwards, the defendant intended to give the plaintiffs a preference over his other creditors. His mind has changed since that time. If the execution stands, the intention of the parties will be carried into effect: if set aside, their intention will be defeated. Although in consequence of some accident the execution was issued too soon by an hour, it was not levied nor was any thing done under it until several hours after the judgment had been perfected. As a general rule the court does not inquire into the fractions of a day, except for the purpose of guarding against injustice; and that rule has been applied in a case like this. <em>(Small </em>v. <em>McChesney, </em>3 <em>Cowen, </em>19.) No injustice will be done by allowing the execution to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
