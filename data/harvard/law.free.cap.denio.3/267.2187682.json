The plaintiffs for whose benefit the precept was issued, took an assignment of the bond and commenced this action in January, 1845, and in their declaration alleged for a breach of the condition of the bond that Rogers did not remain a true and faithful prisoner, but escaped. The suit was defended .on the ground that there had been no escape. After the cause had been several times upon the circuit calendar, it was referred to a sole referee, who, after twenty meetings, reported in favor of the plaintiffs, on the 18th of July last, and assessed their damages at $47,32. The plaintiffs\u2019 costs in the suit by this time amounted to about $200. On the 25th of July, the defendants tendered the plaintiffs $47,50 in full settlement and discharge of the action; but the tender was refused.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>I.

He cited 2 <em>R. S. </em>616, \u00a7 21; <em>Wells </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdZ\">The question is, whether the plaintiffs must accept the damages and lose the costs; or whether they are at liberty to proceed and enter judgment for the penally of the bond, which will carry costs. The statute only denies costs when a suit upon contract \u201cis <em>settled </em>before judgment, and the sum actually due and <em>admitted </em>is not sufficient to carry costs. This language plainly imports the assent of both parties. But proceeding on the equity of the statute, the plaintiff has sometimes been compelled, in actions upon penal bonds, to accept the amount due by the condition, without costs. But it has been in cases where the amount could be ascertained by mere computation; and where the plaintiffs' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>right to recover had not been litigated before the tender was made. In this case the defendants have contested the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover for a year and a half: and now, after a report against them, and on the eve of a judgment, they propose to pay the damages assessed by the referee, and leave the plaintiffs to bear the costs of the litigation. The case is neither within the letter nor the equity of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
