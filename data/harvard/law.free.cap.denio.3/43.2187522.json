Ladue and Nelson, as overseers of the poor of Phillipstown, sued Nevin before a justice of the peace in debt, to recover a penalty of ,$25 for selling-strong or spirituous liquors in a less quantity than five gallons at a time without having a license therefor, contrary to 1 <em>R. S. </em>680, \u00a7 15. The declaration was in the form allowed in declaring upon penal statutes. The defendant pleaded the general issue. On the trial the defendant, as the return states, \u201c being charged by the plaintiffs with the sale of ale, strong beer or fermented beer, without a license therefor, confesses the charge in person, and claims it is not prohibited by statute.\u201d The cause was ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>gued by counsel, and the justice rendered judgment for the plaintiffs for the penalty, with costs, whereupon the defendant brought a <em>certiorari </em>to the common pleas, where the judgment was affirmed, and he then brought error to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-5\"><em>Fullerton &amp; Fowler, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As9M\">maintained that ale, beer and other fermented liquors were not included within the terms \u201c strong or spirituous liquors,\u201d as used in the statute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-6\"><em>E.

S. </em>680, \u00a7 15.) It is in these words, <em>\u201c </em>Whoever shall sell any strong or spirituous liquors, or any wines, in any quantity less than five gallons at a time, without having a license therefor, granted as herein directed, shall forfeit twenty-five dollars.\u201d If ale or strong beer answers the description of strong or spirituous liquors, the action was well sustained. I am unable to entertain a doubt but that both come within the definition of <em>strong </em>or <em>spirituous </em>liquors. <em>Beer </em>is defined by Webster to be <em>\u201c </em>a spirituous liquor made from any farinaceous grain, but generally from barley, which is first malted and ground, and its fermentable substance extracted by hot water. This extract or infusion is evaporated by boiling in caldrons, and hops or some other plant of an agreeable bitterness added. The liquor is then suffered to ferment in vats.\u201d <em>Ale </em>is a liquor made from an infusion of malt by fermentation; it chiefly differs from beer, in having a smaller proportion of hops\u2014and both are intoxicating liquors. The manufacture of beer and its use as an intoxicating drink, are of very high antiquity. <em>Herodotus </em>tells us, that owing to the want of wine, the Egyptians drank a liquor fermented from barley. <em>(Lib. 2, chap. 77.) </em>Ale or beer was in common use, in Germany, in the time of Tacitus. \u201c All the nations,\u201d says Pliny, \u201c who inhabit the west of Europe, have a liquor with which they intoxicate, themselves, made of corn and water. The manufacture of ale was early introduced into England. It is mentioned in the laws of Ina, king of Wes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>sex; and is particularly specified among the liquors provided for a royal banquet in the reign of Edward the Confessor, <em>(McCulloch\u2019s Com. Dic., vol. 1, p. </em>9.) That the legislature intended to prohibit the sale, under the regulations mentioned in the 15th section, of all intoxicating liquors, I think is strongly indicated by the provision of the 29th section of the same statute. It enacts that \u201c No person shall be subject to be prosecuted by virtue of the provisions of this title, for selling metheglin, currant wine, cherry wine, or cider.\u201d This operates as an exception to the prohibition which I think is manifestly contained in the former section. Each is strong liquor, intoxicating in its nature. It is urged by the counsel for the defendant that the legislature, by the use of the words <em>\u201c </em>strong or spirituous,\u201d meant to include only such liquors as are produced by distillation. It is quite pertinent to ask why, if this were so, it was necessary to insert the 29th section, as neither of the kinds of liquor there specified are thus produced. I think this a plain case, and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
