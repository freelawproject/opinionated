(2 <em>R. S. </em>576, \u00a7 1; <em>id. </em>612, \u00a7 3.) It is, in strictness, a judgment for execution according to the first recovery, and for costs. <em>(Philipson </em>v. Mangles, 11 <em>East, </em>516.) The execution must issue upon the judgment on the <em>scire facias, </em>and not on the original judgment. <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>1 <em>Bing. </em>133.) The case is within the act of 1840, and a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>cannot regularly issue, until after the expiration of thirty days from the entry of the judgment. <em>(Laws </em>1840, <em>p. </em>334, \u00a7 24.) This execution must be set aside, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
