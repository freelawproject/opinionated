In calculating the advisory Sentencing Guideline range of imprisonment, the district court applied a 16-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), concluding that Gutierrez-Bautista had previously been convicted in Georgia of a drug trafficking offense, within the meaning of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gutierrez-Baustista asserts that the Georgia conviction was not for such an offense and therefore that the enhancement was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">He further contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are facially unconstitutional because these provisions treat prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than elements of a crime requiring a finding of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He additionally contends that these provisions are unconstitutional as applied to him because even if a prior conviction had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the indictment did not allege that he was deported after he was convicted of a felony or an aggravated felony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">As indicated, Gutierrez-Bautista entered a guilty plea to being unlawfully present in this country after he had been deported. The Presentence Report (PSR) assigned Gutierrez-Bautista a base offense level of eight pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a); a 16-level increase under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i), concluding that a prior 1999 Georgia conviction was for trafficking in methamphetamine; and a three-level decrease pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b) for acceptance of responsibility. Gutierrez-Bautista\u2019s criminal history of five resulted in a criminal history category of IV. The PSR calculated an advisory guideline sentencing range of 57 to 71 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">Gutierrez-Bautista filed two objections to the PSR, contending that (1) the enhancement of his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) was unconstitutional in view of <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) the 16-level enhancement was improper, because his prior Georgia conviction was not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i). The district court overruled Gutierrez-Bautista\u2019s objections and sentenced him to 60 months of imprisonment. Gutierrez-Bautista timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">Gutierrez-Bautista was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. </em>Booker.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He challenged the enhancement of his sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) in the district court. Accordingly, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A 16-level enhancement is imposed under the Sentencing Guidelines when a person convicted of being unlawfully present in the United States has a prior felony conviction that is \u201ca drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commentary to the Guidelines defines \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cDrug trafficking offense\u201d means an offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In considering whether a prior conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense, we look to the statutory definition and elements of the offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We may look beyond the statute if the fact-finder \u201cnecessarily had to find\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the elements of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d If a statute permits a conviction for conduct that is a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d and conduct that is not, a court may consider the charging papers, a written plea agreement, a guilty-plea transcript, jury instructions, and factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">The Georgia statute under which Gutierrez-Bautista was convicted provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-15\"><em>16-13-31 </em>Trafficking in cocaine, illegal drugs, marijuana, or methamphetamine; penalties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-16\">(e) Any person who knowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, or brings into this state or has possession of 28 grams or more of methamphetamine, amphetamine, or any mixture containing either methamphetamine or amphetamine, as described in Schedule II, in violation of this article commits the felony offense of trafficking in methamphetamine or amphetamine ____<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">Gutierrez-Bautista pleaded guilty in Georgia state court to a count in an indictment which charged that he \u201ccommitted the offense of TRAFFICKING IN METHAMPHETAMINE\u201d in that he \u201cdid ... knowingly sell and possess a quantity of a mixture containing methamphetamine exceeding 28 grams.\u201d It is undisputed that this indictment charged a violation of \u00a7 16-13-31(e) and that he was sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and five years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">Gutierrez-Bautista argues that the Georgia statute may be violated by proof of either selling or merely possessing methamphetamine and therefore that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>1999 conviction does not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). He further urges that the district court erred in determining that he admitted both selling and possessing methamphetamine when he entered a guilty plea to the Georgia offense. The government states in its briefing in this court that \u201cthe pertinent statute alleged ways of committing the crime that do not fall within the Guidelines\u2019 definition of \u2018drug trafficking offense,\u2019 \u201d but maintains that Gutierrez-Bautista pleaded guilty to both selling and possessing. We do not decide whether an admission to possessing more than 28 grams of methamphetamine in violation of Georgia law constitutes a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of the Guidelines because Gutierrez-Baustista\u2019s guilty plea admitted both selling and possessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We look to Georgia law to determine the effect of Gutierrez-Bautista\u2019s guilty plea.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Gutierrez-Bautista argues that under Georgia law, an indictment may charge an offense in the conjunctive, such as \u201cselling and possessing,\u201d even if the statute creating the offense is in the disjunctive, such as \u201cselling or possessing,\u201d but that proof of either will suffice to support a conviction. Therefore, he contends, a guilty plea admits only the minimal facts necessary to support a conviction. This may be the case in some jurisdictions,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but Georgia is not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">It is true that when a Georgia statute may be violated in more than one way, Georgia state courts will sustain a conviction based on proof of one act, even if the indictment is in the conjunctive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But Georgia law establishes that a guilty plea admits all averments of fact in the indictment or accusation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> After a guilty plea, the defendant\u2019s only available substantive defense is that the indictment does not allege a crime.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Georgia appellate court has routinely denied attempts by defendants to later allege that, despite a guilty plea, certain factual averments are untrue.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">Gutierrez-Bautista\u2019s indictment makes both a factual averment that he knowingly sold methamphetamine and a factual averment that he possessed methamphetamine. Under Georgia law, his guilty plea admits that he both sold and possessed the drug. Moreover, in his guilty plea, Gutierrez-Bautista acknowledged he had read and understood the indictment and \u201cwas guilty as charged in the indictment.\u201d Thus, Gutierrez-Bautista\u2019s conviction under the Georgia drug trafficking statute<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>constitutes a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as defined by the commentary to the Guidelines<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> because he admitted selling methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Gutierrez-Bautista also contends that \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than as elements of the offense that must be found by a jury, is unconstitutional, both facially and as applied, in light of <em>Apprendi. </em>This contention is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which the Supreme Court held that treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors in \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) was constitutional. Although Gutierrez-Bautista asserts that a majority of the Supreme Court would now consider <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to be incorrectly decided in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>this argument is undercut by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent reaffirmation of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in <em>James v. United States.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Since <em>James, </em>this court has said that arguments like Gutierrez-Bautista\u2019s \u201cwill be viewed with skepticism, much like arguments challenging the constitutionality of the federal income tax\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that \u201cthis issue is \u2018fully foreclosed from further debate.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Gutierrez-Bautista concedes as much, raising this claim to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The conviction and sentence imposed by the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\">.
