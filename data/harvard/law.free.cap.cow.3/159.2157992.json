O. <em>Hoffman, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az4\">said, the main question arises upon the insolvent discharge. The \u201c act for the benefit of insolvent debtors and their creditors,\u201d' <em>(sess. </em>34, <em>ch. </em>123) of <em>April </em>3, .1811, was in force at the date of the note. This act authorized the defendant to apply for and obtain a discharge of equal efficacy with the one. under consideration, on his own petition merely ; and according to the doctrine laid down in <em>Mather v. Bush, </em>16 <em>John. </em>233,) the statute of 1811 was a part of the contract. The qualification of the defendant\u2019s promise was, then, that he should pay the debt unless he should become insolvent, and be duly discharged upon a surrender of his property for the benefit of his creditors. Then came the act of <em>April </em>12, 1813, by which a new condition was imposed, the assent of creditors, | in amount. The defendant complied with this added condition, and was discharged. Now the single question is, whether such a law can be said to impair the obligation of the original contract; and surely this cannot be pretended. The demand of the plaintiff was rather fortified by this farther condition. The case of <em>Wendell, </em>(19 <em>John. </em>153) in effect, disposes of this question. It was there held that a coqtvapt made in <em>October, </em>1812, being after the repeal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the act of 1811 ; and, therefore, in reference to the act of the <em>3d April, </em>1801, (l <em>K. &amp; R. </em>428) was not discharged by the act of the <em>12th April, </em>1813 ; and this upon the express ground that when the contract was made the f- act was in force ; and the \u00a7 act narrowed the rights of the creditor and impaired his contract. The converse of the proposition follows, in ibis case, throughout, and we ask the corresponding conclusion. This Court have repeatedly declared that they will not go beyond the spirit of the United States\u2019 decisions, which are founded upon the idea of impairing contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-4\">Again ; the plaintiff is concluded by receiving the dividend. He has himself taken the benefit of the statute by a very deliberate act. Notice is given : he proves his debt and is paid. This is an acquiescence in the proceedings by which the creditor should be concluded. He stands in the light of an ordinary petitioning creditor. The only difference is, that the plaintiff consented <em>after </em>the discharge; whereas the petitioning creditor does the same thing <em>before. </em>This case is certainly much stronger than that of <em>Field </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>(17 <em>John. </em>85.) The plaintiff\u2019s acts of acquiesence are much less equivocal here than in that case. The ground of a discharge under the English bankrupt law, is similar to that which we take here. The receiving a dividend, and signing a certificate, are deemed an election of the creditor by which he is concluded. <em>(Ex parte Freeman, 4 Ves. </em>836. <em>Grosvenor, Ex parte,14 Ves. </em>587.) After the creditor has proved his debt and received a dividend, he is never permitted to proceed, until he first refunds what he lias received ; (1 <em>Cooke\u2019s B. L. </em>127, <em>and the cases there cited ;) </em>not a case can be found'to the contrary ; and it is a fatal objection to this action, that the plaintiff has not refunded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-5\">The statute of limitations has been so nearly explained away, that Courts feel a disinclination to multiply exceptions to it beyond what has been done already. <em>(Clementson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>8 <em>Cranch, </em>72.) It is now well settled by the decisions of this Court, that the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>wh\u00e1t will constitute a debt, but at the same time claiming a discharge from it, will not prevent its being barred, <em>(Sands </em>v. <em>Gelston, </em>15 <em>John. </em>511.) The admission insisted on here, depends upon the same principle. It was for the purpose of obtaining a discharge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-4\"><em>Emmet, </em>in reply. The objection that the dividend should be refunded, was not made at the trial ; and it is, therefore, too late to raise that point here. But the English doctrine relied upon does not apply. It is for the benefit of the creditor, who may, by the act of refunding, avoid the discharge, and proceed at law ; but will not be permitted to do this till he places every thing <em>in statu quo, </em>Accordingly, if he elect to withhold his sanction to the proceedings under the commission, he must refund his dividend for the benefit of the other creditors. His remedy depends upon his own choice. The law there has full power to discharge; and the doctrine goes upon that ground. With us, th\u00e9 discharge does not affect the contract, The election which the plaintiff sets up against us as conclusive, is merely an election to give the discharge its true operation, which does not affect the contract beyond the amount of the dividend, <em>Sturges v. Crowninshield, </em>(4 <em>Wheat, </em>122,) gives us a right to proceed against the property acquired after the assignment, for the balance beyond the dividend ; though it protects the person of the debtor 5 a case very different from the English bankrupt discharge, whose clear operation is to take away all liability, both from property \"and person. We are bound so far as the law is valid ; but no farther. The case of <em>Field </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>does not apply. All the Court say in that case is, that where they would have granted a dis continuance at a previous stage of the action, they will stay execution perpetually, if the application to discontinue is delayed and lost by suffering final judgment. The appeal comes, in such a case, to the equitable powers of the Court. The doctrine of election was not, perhaps, sufficiently considered in that case ; for, surely, nothing is plainer than that election should never bind any farther than the statu tecan legally operate ; and the withdrawing all opposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u00bfion to the discharge in that case was, in law, and, probably, in fact, merely saying, \u201c I will suffer the law to take its course, and discharge the person.\u201d It could operate in that way only ; and why should an abandonment of opposition, and even the receiving a dividend, or taking that which the creditor cannot have in any other way, bind him to all intents 7</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-4\">As to the question whether the discharge affects the contract, what are the circumstances 7 The note was given <em>February, </em>6, 1812. It may more properly be said to have been made in reference to the law which had then probably passed both houses of the legislature ; and was merely awaiting the sanction of the council of revision, the act of <em>February 14th, </em>1812, which finally passed only 8 days after the date of the note, repealing the act \u00f3f 1811, and leaving the contract to the operation of the act of 1801\u00bb Yet we are told that the law of 1811, interweaves itself in the contract. This should be qualified with the provision that the law continues. Taking the reasoning of the'other party, without this qualification, the defendant may say, \u201c I will still have the benefit of the act of 1811, though repealed. It was a part of my contract; and the repeal impairs the obligation of the contract on my side, and for my benefit.\u201d But this will not be contended. The act of 1811 rs put out of the way by the repeal. It is as if it had never been; and the note stood subject to be discharged by the s act only. Then the act of 1813 attempts to impair the contract by granting greater facilities of discharge. If the act of 1813 had repealed the act of 1811, so that the one system had passed smoothly and unbroken into the other, there might be plausibility in the opposite argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">[Woodworth, J. The length you go would make if out that the <em>new </em>insolvent act, though it recognize the principle of the old one existing at the time of the contract, and narrow the facility of discharge, would be inoperative, because a <em>new </em>and <em>distinct </em>act.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Emmet. </em>Certainly. Upon any other principle, the debt- or could never be deprived of the benefit of the insolvent law, as it existed at the time of the contract.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b160-3\">Curia,</p>\n<author id=\"A8O\"><em>per </em>Savage, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah4\">(after stating the case.) The first question is, whether the inventory and affidavit of the defendant is a sufficient acknowledgment to take the debt out of the statute of limitations. It is certainly an admission that the note was due and unpaid, and that will authorize us to presume \u00e1 promise, unless the acknowledgment is accompanied with expressions which negative that idea. <em>(Sands </em>v. <em>Gelston, </em>15 <em>John. </em>511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">2. Was the defendant\u2019s discharge a bar ? The note was given before the repeal of the act of 1811.; and,.according to the decision of this Court, in <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Bush, (16 John. </em>246, 251,) the contract between the parties was, that the n\u00f3te should be paid, unless the defendant became \u00e1n insolvent debtor within the meaning of the act of 1811, and was duly discharged from his debts according to its provisions. By that act, he was entitled to his discharge on his own petition, and on surrendering his property for the benefit of his creditors. By the repeal of the law of 1811, which' took place a few days after the date of the note, the law of 1801 was revived, w'hich requires the assent of <em>\u00a7 </em>of the creditors of the insolvent, before he can be discharged. The repeal of the law, <em>therefore, </em>was favourable <em>to the </em>plaintiff. The act of 1813, materially varied the principle of the law of 1801, in as much as it rerhoved some of the difficulties in the way of obtaining a discharge by substituting the assent of \u00a7 instead of <em>l </em>of the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">It cannot be denied, that according to the decisions of this Court, a discharge under the act of 1811, which did not require the assent of any one creditor of the defendant, would, had that act continued in force, have discharged the defendant from the payment of the note in question. Had the law of 1811 been immediately followed by that of 1813-, the provisions of which are so much more unfavourable for the defendant, the validity of the discharge would not be disputed; for it is distinctly admitted by the reasoning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the Court, in the matter of Wendell, (19 <em>John. </em>153,) that had theprovisions of 1801 been continued in force, the law of 1813 would have been valid as to contracts entered into under the law of 1801, notwithstanding any revision or re-enactment of those provisions. Does, then, the fact that the law of 1801 was in force for about one year after the date of the note, alter the rights of the parties ? The act of 1801 was not in the contemplation of the parties when they entered into this contract. It is true, that while that act was in force, the defendant could not have obtained his discharge without the assent of f <em>of </em>his creditor\u00ae. But had the legislature, on the <em>12th April, </em>1813, re-enacted the act of 1811, instead of the \u00a7\u25a0 act, would not a discharge under the former be valid, as being the precise terms on which it was originally agreed, that the defendant should be absolved from his contract ? Most certainly. If, then, the defendant has done all which his contract required, to absolve him from it, and something more, shall the additional difficulties, the assent of | of his crediors, imposed on him by the act of 1813, operate to his prejudice, and invalidate a discharge which, without such assent, would have been valid between these parties ? I think not; and am, accordingly, of opinion, that the defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
