She married, and an order of the court was made to pay the dividends of the stock to the husband. Within a year after the marriage, and while she was an infant, she and her husband transferred the stock for a valuable consideration, the assignee knowing at the same time of the deed of settlement and the infancy of the wife; whereupon an order was made, that the dividends should thereafter be \u25a0paid to the assignee till the wife came of age, or the further order of the court. On a bill filed, by the wife, against the husband and assignee, the court of chancery declared the assignment null and void, so far as it respected the wife\u2019s equity; and decreed that the assignee should account for the dividends received by him under the order. And, the husband having misbehaved himself, the dividends were directed to he paid to the wife, until she came of age, with liberty for her then to apply for such suitable provision, out of the property, as might be determnied on the usual reference to a master. On appeal to the -court of errors, the decree was affirmed, except so much as directed the assignee to account for dividends received anterior to the decree; and the wife in the mean time having come of age, the record was remitted with directions to the court below to make the proper reference, and determine what would be a suitable provision ; the overplus, if any, to be paid to the assignee. And the chief justice intimated, in delivering the opinion of the court, that if the wife had no fortune beside the stock, which was $8000, the whole would not exceed a reasonable provision.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-12\">Appeal from the Court of Chancery. The pleadings and proofs with the decree, and the late Chancellor\u2019s reasons in its support, are stated in the report of the same case, as it stood in the Court below, under title of <em>E. S. Kenney </em>v. <em>Udall &amp; Kenney, </em>(5 <em>John. Ch. Rep. </em>464.) All the facts material to the view taken of the case here, will be found in the opinion of Savage, Chief Justice, who delivered the opinion of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>J. V. Henry, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYMV\">premised, that under the impression of duty which the Chancellor felt to protect this young married woman, he had gone very great lengths; and had cut down every thing, even <em>his own order </em>for the payment of the dividends. He contended that the case of <em>The Earl of Salisbury </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>(1 <em>Eden\u2019s Rep. </em>370,) cited by, the Chancellor, was distinguishable from the present. Notwithstanding <em>Like </em>v. <em>Beresford, </em>(3 <em>Ves. </em>506,) which he considers as settling the question of the wife\u2019s right to her equity against a particular assignee, for valuable consideration,-he admits that it was a litigated point in <em>Wright v. Morley, </em>(11 <em>Ves. </em>12.) In <em>Jewson </em>v. <em>Moulson, </em>(2 <em>Atk. </em>417,) the wife had never been in the receipt of the fund. The cases cited by the Chancellor of a claim to the wife\u2019s equity by the assignees of a bankrupt husband, will of course not be relied on, as they go upon the ground that the assignment is general, and by operation of law. <em>Beresford </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>(1 <em>Madd. Ch. Rep. </em>262) goes farther for the wife than any other case ; but even there she did not get the whole; whereas all is here declared void by the Chancellor, in the face both of the assignment and bis own order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-8\">That this assignment cannot be rescinded for inadequacy of price, or as a fraudulent, or unconscionable bargain, he cited <em>Newland on Contracts, </em>357-8, and 360-5 ; <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>14 <em>John. </em>559, <em>per Platt, J.; </em>1 <em>Fonbl. B. </em>1, <em>ch. </em>2, <em>s. </em>9 ; 1 <em>Mad. Ch. </em>98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-9\">He then stated the following points; and cited and commented upon the authorities which follow them respectively :</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-10\">1. That the stock in question was a vested interest in the wife, subject to the limitation over on the contingency of her dying without issue before 21. And the husband having, at law, an absolute right to all the wife\u2019s personal estate in possession, and a qualified right to her choses in action, had therefore power to dispose of the stock. (1 Roper on Legacies, 182,183, 184, 203. <em>Lumb </em>v. <em>Milnes, 5 Ves. </em>517, 519. <em>Com. Dig. Baron and Feme, (E. </em>3.) <em>Sir Edward Turner\u2019s case, </em>1 <em>Vern. </em>7. <em>Pitt </em>v. <em>Hunt, id. </em>18. <em>Tudor </em>v. <em>Samyne, </em>2 <em>Vern. </em>270. <em>Duke of Chandos </em>v. <em>Tal</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>bot, </em>2 <em>P. Wms. </em>608. <em>Lord Carteret </em>v. Paschal, 3 P. <em>Wms. </em>199. Bates v. <em>Dandy, </em>2 <em>Atk. </em>207. <em>Jewson </em>v. <em>Moulson, id. 417. Hawkyns v. Obin, id. </em>549. Grey v. <em>Kentish, 1 Atk. </em>280. <em>Countess of Strathmore </em>v. <em>Bowes. </em>1 <em>Ves. Jun. </em>28.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-5\">2. Such disposition being made by the husband, the wife cannot be admitted to impeach it, on the ground that it was unfairly or improperly obtained. That right belongs to the husband only, or those claiming under him ; and as he does not seek to do this, nor even unite with his wife as complainant in the cause, the Court ought not to interfere to set it aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-6\">3. The Court does not interfere with the legal rights of the husband, but will suffer him, if he can without its aid, to obtain at law the possession of her estate. The stock in question was legal property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-7\">An action would have lain against the husband for its value, had he refused to complete the transfer. <em>(Matter of Morris </em>v. <em>The Mechanic\u2019s </em>Bank, 10 <em>John. </em>484-5. <em>The King </em>v. <em>The Bank of England, Doug. </em>523.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-9\">4. The objection that the wife is a ward of the Court, is unfounded ; the wardship having ceased on her marriage; and the Court below having even acted on that principle, by directing the dividends to be paid to <em>Kenney </em>in his character of husband. <em>(Mendes </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>1 <em>Ves. Sen. </em>89, <em>91, per Lord Hardwicke, C.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-10\">5. That even if the stock was equitable property, yet a specific assignment of it, by contract, for a valuable consideration is valid, and not subject to an equity of the wife, for a provision. <em>(Sir Edward Turner\u2019s case, </em>1 <em>Vern. </em>7. 1 <em>Eq.

But if otherwise, the equity is only to part and not to the whole ; and the full amount of the principal advanced \"by the appellant, with the interest thereon, ought, at least, to be re-imbursed him. <em>(Packer </em>v. <em>Wyndham, Prec. in Ch. </em>412. <em>Squib </em>v. <em>Wyn, </em>1 <em>P.

The counsel said, that these cases shew, not only the rights of the husband in the wife\u2019s property generally, but also as to the wife\u2019s equity, from them it would appear never to have been doubted, either in the case of general or particular assignees of {he husband, that they shall hold subject only to a reasonable provision for the wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGIA\">7- That the appellant is, at any rate, entitled to the dividends on the stock which were directed to be paid to the husband, free of all her claims until she attained 21.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ASDZ\"><em>Talcolt, </em>(Attorney General) <em>B. F. Butler, </em>for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afed\">insisted upon the following points in support of ' the decree, and cited and commented upon the authorities following them respectively:</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ2\">I. The deed of settlement executed by <em>Hewitt, </em>the father of the respondent, directing the dividends as they accrued to be paid to her during her minority and the stock to be transferred to her at the age of 21, clearly contemplated a personal enjoyment by her of the stock; and, therefore, the assignment was in direct violation of the trusts declared by the deed of settlement, and consequently void. <em>(Hyde </em>v. <em>Price, </em>3 <em>Ves. </em>437 ; recognized\" as never having been questioned in <em>Meth. Epis. Church </em>v. <em>Jaques, </em>3 <em>John. Ch. Rep. </em>103. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Lidderdale </em>&amp; <em>others, </em>2 <em>Anstruther, </em>533, where the assignment of an officer\u2019s half pay was held void both in Equi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>&lt;:y and at law. <em>Sugden on Powers, </em>111, 112. <em>Clancy\u2019s Rights of Women. </em>52, 53, 382, 383, 384. <em>Roper on Revocations, .pc. with Tracts upon the law of Baron and Feme, </em>230. 301 \u201e) The case of <em>Jaques </em>v. <em>Methodist Episcopal Church, </em>(17 <em>John. Rep. </em>548) Ihe counsel said, merely sets up the general power of the wife to dispose of her sepaiate property, without denying that a trust may be limited to her in such terms as to take away that right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">II. The assignment was also void, as against the equitable right of the respondent to have the stock secured for her separate use. This right, usually called <em>the wife\u2019s equity, </em>is perfectly reasonable and just; is w-ell understood in Courts of Equity ; and has been uniformly admitted and administered by them for more than a century-.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">The counsel said there w-ere four classes of cases in support of this point :</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-7\">1.

The equity of the respondent is mate-ially fortified by the circumstance, that her marriage was clandestine, at a time when she vvas of \u00e1 very tender age, a ward of the Court of Chancery, and her husband a bankrupt. <em>(Butler </em>v.

The case is fortified still farther by the facts, that the consideration actually paid by the appellant for the assignment was neither meritorious nor fair ; hut grossly inadequate ; and that in procuring it, a most oppressive advantage was taken of the husband\u2019s pecuniary distresses and necessities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>V. On the whole, the decree is warranted by the pleadings and proofs in the cause, and is in conformity to the settled law of a Court of Equity, on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-4\"><em>Henry, </em>in reply, reviewed the cases cited for the respondent, and remarked, that the whole class of cases which went to deny the husband a right to dispose of the wife\u2019s equity, proceeded upon the ground that it could not be reached at law, but only by the aid of this Court. They were English cases, and, therefore, went upon the law as it stood there. It is otherwise in this country as to legacies which, in whatever shape they may be devised, are recoverable by an action at law. The statute (l <em>R. L. </em>315-16, s. 19) which gives this right, has been in existence ever since 1743, (1 <em>S. &amp; L. </em>315 ; <em>V. S. </em>229 ; 2 <em>J.

To reverse this decree is the object of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The determination of this cause, independent of the fair-1 ness or unfairness of the transaction, must depend upon the extent of the marital rights. The signature of the wife to the Assignment gave it no additional validity. She was, on account of her infancy; incapable of doing any act, disposing of her property, or dispensing with her rights ; and, on ac- ,, , . , , , , count of her coverture, she is presumed to have acted under the coercion of her husband.

And the authorities go 1 e \u00b0 so far as to say, that if the husband can obtain possession of the wife\u2019s choses in action, without the aid of a Court of Chancery, he will be permitted to do so; and then to dispose of them at his discretion. But where the property of the wife is under the care of the Court, and the husband cannot enjoy it without the authority of the Court, care will be taken that before it is placed at the husband\u2019s disposal a suitable provision shall be made out of it for the wife\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"A1-k\">Husband becomes absowife\u2019s\u00b0W choses possession. choses in act,10D\u2019 \u2122hen reducedmto possession.</p>\n<p id=\"AZJ\">ifAhe \u2019 can\u2122Sta\u2122 possession aid of chance-he cannot be restrained as to the dispooMhenf.

This claim was denied as to the principal sum, upon the ground that they stood in no better situation than the bankrupt himself, to whom the Court would not have allowed it without a provision for the wife and children. For the same reason, it was said, the assignees had a right to the interest during the husband\u2019s life. But, at a subsequent day, the Chancellor dismissed the bill, upon the ground that the legacy depending on a contingency which had not ceased when the assignment was executed by the commissioners, therefore nothing passed, not even the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"AWk\"><em>Bosvil </em>v. <em>Brander, </em>1 P.

Then the husband died, and his widow filed her bill to have the benefit of the mortgage. But the Master of the Rolls decreed against her, on the ground that, as there was a covenant to pay the money, the legal estate was vested in the assignees. It was said, however, that if the husband or the assignees had asked the aid of Equity, to enforce the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>gage, the Court would have refused this, unless some provision had been made for the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\">In <em>Duke of Chandas </em>v.

But dying <em>without </em>having made the assignment, Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>held, that the husband\u2019s promise to assign amounted, in equity, to an assignment <em>pro tanto, </em>the residue belonging to the wife. And it is then declared, that the husband may assign the wife\u2019s chose in action, or a possibility that the wife is entitled to, as well as her term, if the assignment be for valuable consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"AoB\"><em>Bates </em>v. Danly, <em>2 </em>Atk. 207. A. D. 1741</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">In little more than a year afterwards, came the case of <em>Jewson </em>v. <em>Moulson, </em>(2 <em>Atk. </em>417) which has been fully stated by his Honor the Chancellor, in his opinion. The husband assigned to the defendant, for an honest debt, the share of his wife in her father\u2019s estate, which depended on the contingency of her arriving at 21 years of age. He afterwards assigned the same to trustees, for the benefit of all his creditors. Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>said, that the equity was extremely plain against the husband and his general assignees ; that the Court will not suffer the husband to take the wife\u2019s portion, till he makes a reasonable provision for her ; and he dates this doctrine as far back as the 14Z/t of <em>Charles </em>the first. He further remarked, that if the husband could obtain possession of his wife\u2019s chattels without the aid of the Court, he knew of no instance in which it had interfered ; but he expressed a doubt whether an injunction would not be grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ed, at the wife\u2019s request, to stay execution till provision be made for her. He then refers to several previous cases, and mentions <em>Tudor </em>v. <em>Samyne, Bosvill </em>v. Brander, and <em>Bates </em>v. Dandy, in wb/ch, he observes, the assignee for valuable consideration had got the better of the wife\u2019s equity. The circumstances of the case were much relied on, the wife\u2019s infancy ; that the assignment was not of a particular thing, but her whole fortune ; .the clause of survivorship ; the requisite aid of the Court to obtain possession of her fortune ; and the presumed knowledge of <em>Moulson, </em>the creditor of all these facts, as wellas of the rule in Equity as to making provision for the wife out of her own fortune. He lays great weight upon several Lets which were parallel wilh those in this case\u2014that the wife\u2019s whole fortune was assigned\u2014that the husband was in debt before he married\u2014ran away with his wife clandestinely. And he says, if an assignee for valuable consideration is to be protected, all the care and guardianship which the Court extends to infants would be entirely defeated. He, therefore, determined not to allow the whole to the creditor, without making provision for the wife. The parties settled, by dividing the fund, and Lord <em>Hardwicks </em>confirmed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"AfHe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>Jewson </em>v. Moulson. 2 Atk. 414, <em>A. D. 1742.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In these cases the doctrine is, that when the husband or his assignees come into Equity to obtain possession of the wife\u2019s dioses in action, the Court will compel (hem to do equity. It seems, however, that if the wife\u2019s fortune is the subject of equitable cognizance, it is immaterial, in this view, who asks the aid of the Court. The same consequences follow, in whatever shape the matter is brought forward. Accordingly, in <em>Grey </em>v. Kentish, (1 <em>Atk. </em>280 ; 1 P. <em>Wms. </em>459, <em>n. S. C. corrected) </em>the wife\u2019s property was, by a decree of Chancery, vested in <em>South Sea </em>annuities. The husband assigned it as security for \u00a3(50, and became bankrupt. The wife petitioned that the annuities might be transferred to her. Lord <em>Hardzoicke </em>said, that a husband cannot assign a possibility in law, but Equity will support such an assignment for valuable consideration. This was not an assignment, but a pledge, and as the particular and general as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>signees took with notice of the equity of the wife, it was decreed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">In <em>Saddinglon </em>v. <em>Kinsman, </em>(1 <em>Br. Ch. Cas. </em>51-2) Lord <em>Thnrlow </em>said, that in the case of an assignment for valuable consideration, no provision is made for the wife ; but the cause was never decided. He referred to <em>Gayer </em>v. <em>Wilkin</em>son., (1 <em>Br. C. C. 50, </em>note) which denied that a wife\u2019s equity passed by a bankrupt assignment, and asked the counsel whether they knew of any case in point which contradicted it?</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\"><em>Saddington </em>v. <em>Kinsman, </em>1 <em>Br. Ch. Cas. </em>51-2, <em>A. D. </em>1779.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">In <em>Worrall </em>v. <em>Marlar, </em>and <em>Bushnan </em>v. <em>Pell, (1 P. Wms. </em>459, <em>note) Sarah Worrall, </em>the wife of an insolvent debtor, was entitled, by bond from her father, to a share of his estate. The father, by will, after the insolvency of her husband, gave her \u00a38000, in lieu of her claim by virtue of the bond. She filed her bill, praying that the \u00a38000 might be settled upon her, to her separate use, and the use of her children. <em>Bitshnan, </em>her husband\u2019s assignee, filed his bill, praying for an account under the bond, and to elect as the husband might if he had not become insolvent. Lord <em>Thurlow </em>was clearly of opinion, that the interest of the wife was assignable, but that the claim of the creditors extended only to the interest taken under the bond ; and as to that under the will, the assignee should make proposals for a settlement on the wife and children. His Lordship added, that he had considered the several cases on the subject, and did not find it any where decided, that if the husband make an actual assignment, by contract, for a valuable consideration, the assignee should be bound to make any provision for the wife out of the property assigned ; but that a Court of Equity has much greater consideration for an assignment actually made by contract, than for an assignment by mere operation of law. In the latter case, the creditor stood in the place of the husband, as respects the wife\u2019s equity. After proposals had been made, one half the amount due on the bond was decreed to the creditors, and the res. idue of the \u00a38000 to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar1\"><em>Worrall </em>v, <em>^^hnan </em>\u00b0v? <em>Pefh p\u2022 </em>4, <em>\u00bf. </em>x784. 5</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">It will be seen, that the decision of this case did not require the observations of Lord Thurlow, relative to assignees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>for valuable consideration. What be said on that subject was, therefore, altogether <em>obiter\u2022 </em>At all events, he was mistaken in supposing that there were no cases establishing thg wifels equity, as against assignees for valuable consideration.

Lord <em>Bathurst </em>remarked, that there is a difference between an assignee for a consideration, and the assignees of a bankrupt, because a general assignee must sue in his own name, but a particular assignee must sue in the name of the husband. He adds, that if the husband dies before the subject of the assignment is recovered, the assignee will lose all legal remedy, and must co.me into Chancery for its assistance ; that particular assignments have been sometimes supported, hut not generally; that the Coqrt will not strip a widow and children ; that the interest of the wife was not such a legal interest as the husband could assign ; and he dismissed the bill. He cited <em>IVenman </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>where the wife had joined her husband in the assignment, and yet she was allowed a settlemept of \u00a3300.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\"><em>Pope </em>v. <em>Crashaw, </em>4 <em>Br. </em>Ch.

The wife was entitled to a legacy, in bank stock, on the day of her marriage. She eloped with <em>Beresford, </em>in October, 1780, and about the same time a bill .was filed in her name, against the trustee, and the stock was transferred to the name of the Accountant General. The real object of the bill was, to make the wife a ward of the Court of Chancery. <em>Beresford </em>filed his bill to obtain the stock ; and during the pendency of the suit borrowed money of one <em>Roberts, </em>and conveyed the stock to him in trust to sell and pay himself, and to pay over the residue to <em>Beresford. Beresford </em>also became indebted to <em>Like, </em>the plaintiff, for money and necessaries furnished to him and his wife; in consideration of which, and of moneys to be advanced by <em>Like, Beresford, </em>by deed of assignment of <em>March, </em>1783, conveyed the stock to <em>Like, </em>subject to <em>Roberts\u2019 </em>claim. The whole, being upwards of \u00a35000, was decreed to trustees, for\" Mrs. <em>Beresford </em>; and the object of <em>Like\u2019s </em>bill was, <em>to </em>obtain payment of his demand, out of the dividends accrued subsequent to the marriage\". It was insisted, for the plaintiff, that whatever is the rule as to the husband\u2019s right to assign his wife\u2019s fortune for valuable consideration, at least, he should be allowed the dividends accrued, and that he might, for valuable consideration, assign an equitable estate in the wife\u2019s property. But the Master of the Rolls decreed against the plaintiff, relying on the declaration of Lord <em>Hardwiclce, </em>in <em>Jezuson </em>v. <em>Moulson, </em>that the right of the husband <em>to. </em>assign would put an end to the equity of the wife. Much weight was placed on the fact that the wife was a ward of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A46d\">Like <em>v. </em>Beresford, 3 <em>Ves. </em>506, <em>A.

Walk. Rep. </em>456) the doctrine of the two last cases is adhered to. The Master of the Rolls admits, that an assignment for a valuable consideration is sufficient to bar the right of the wife, surviving ; but that it does not, however, take away her equity. All this, he adds., is too clear to admit of any doubt. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\"Wife's equity cannot be taken from her, except by her consent in open court, o.r ty a suitable provision, tor her.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Rule is the same as to busba\u2018i i and his qs.sigae.e, gen. eral or special, in law or in fact, voluntary pr for a valuable, consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">It appears, therefore, to b.e established beyond all dispute, that the personal property of a <em>feme covert </em>.which, is under the protection and control of the Court of Chancery, cannot be taken from her without her consent in open Court, or by a suitable provision being made for her out of the property. And it matters not whether (be application for the property be made by the husband, or his assignee in law, or his assignee for a valuable consideration.

And, on the whol.e, I fully concur with his Honor the. late Chancellor, when he says, \u201c I consider the wife\u2019s equity, as against any assignment whatsoever and to whomsoever, to. be now too well settled to be sh.^cen.\u201d-</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Tire extent of pro.vision for the wife is a subject of reference to a master, and must, from its nature, depend on the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">As to the amount of the wife\u2019s estate, which-shall be seem red to her, that is a proper subject of reference to a Master, and must necessarily be determined by the circumstances of each particular case. The rule is, that a.n. <em>adequate </em>provision be made for the wife, and the children if there are any. What shall be considered <em>adequate </em>must depend entirely on circumstances. In some cases the whole has been allowed the wife\u2014in one case an annuity of \u00a340 <em>per </em>annum\u2014in another the interest of \u00a33000. In other cases, the half has been assigned, by agreement, and sanctioned by the Court \u2022, and, again, \u00a3100, out of an annuity of \u00a3260, was decreed to the assignee of the husband. This part of the subject is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>here in no wise important, except so far as relates to that part of the decree of his Honor the Chancellor which rescinds the previous orders of the Court, allowing the dividends of the stock in question to be paid first to <em>Kenney </em>and afterwards to <em>XJdall, </em>and di ects those accruing subsequent to filing the bill to be paid to Mrs. <em>Kenney </em>herself, after payment of the costs, till the further order of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The general rule undoubtedly is, that the interest of the wife\u2019s property may be received by the husband, where he lives with and maintains her. but not when he leaves her unprovided. (Watkyns <em>v. Watkyns, </em>2 <em>Atk. </em>96. <em>Sleech </em>v. <em>Thorington, </em>2 <em>Ves. Sen. </em>562. <em>Wright </em>v. Morley, 11 <em>Ves. </em>12.)</p>\n<p id=\"AH0O\">interest to be ^hoiiveTwiih and maintains exceptions to tbis rule-</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">In <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>(3 <em>Atk. </em>20) Lord <em>Hardwicke. </em>said, that when a husband has received a great part of his wife\u2019s portion, and only a small part remains, and the husband is so perverse that he will not make a competent settlement on the wife, the Court will not only stop the payment of the residue, but will even prevent his receiving the interest of that residue, that it may accumulate for the \u2022 benefit of the wife, unless he is starving for want of maintenance. And in <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Menzies, </em>(4 <em>Ves. </em>799) the Court refused to give the wife any part of the interest of her otvn properly, because she refused to live with her husband, when he was willing to receive and provide for her.</p>\n<p id=\"AnS\">3 <em>Atk. </em>20.</p>\n<p id=\"Asr\">4 <em>Ves. </em>799.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">In some cases a reference has been directed, to ascertain the fact of the husband\u2019s providing for his wife. If that fact be material in this case, it is pretty clear, from the pleadings and proofs, that the husband has totally neglected his duty in this respect. So far from providing for his wife, it appears to have been his object to squander the whole of her patrimony as fast as possible. He, therefore, does not come recommended to the favor of the Court, and in justice to the wife, it ought to direct the payment of the dividends either to her or to some trustee for her benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">But the question here is not between the husband and wife. The appellant claims to be a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, by contract, for valuable consideration. Admit, for the present, that he is so. What did he purchase \u25a0? Clearly, nothing but the right to be substituted for the husband, as to bis inte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>rest in the wife\u2019s property. In <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>Sir <em>William Grant, </em>reasoning on the subject, asks, \u201cIf the husband has but the right of reducing the wife\u2019s interest into possession, how can he, for valuable consideration or otherwise, convey more than he has ? If he parts with it for valuable consideration, and the assignee acquires a right different from that which the husband had, he parts with something different from what he has and he might have said <em>more than he has. </em>And in this instance,-if the claim of the appellant be allowed on account of his character of <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for valuable consideration from the husband, by that very purchase he has, in connexion with the husband, stripped this infant wife, probably, of her whole fortune, and reduced her to beggary\u2014 from competence, if not affluence, to absolute penury. But he has chosen to put himself in the situation of the husband. The Court will leave him there-</p>\n<p id=\"ANp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Question here husband^aM wife\u2019 but be-ole who claims /\u00bfebpUrohasen</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>He can,- as such, claim no greater rights than the husband, but stands in husband's place, taking subject to wife\u2019s equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">And that he is a <em>bonajide </em>purchaser is questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">It seems, inadequacy of price, alone, is not a ground for setting contract aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">.Advantage was taken of husband\u2019s pecuniary distresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Purchaser had notice of wife\u2019s claim ;</p>\n<p id=\"A-l\">That the appellant is a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for valuable consideration, is at least questionable- It is not necessary to impute to him absolute fraud ; but ,the facts in the case shew that an unconscientious advantage was taken of <em>Kenney'1 s </em>situation. The stock was offered to him at a bargain ; and had he contracted with persons on an equal footing with himself, notwithstanding the enormous speculation, the inadequacy alone would not induce the interference of the Court, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nor is it necessary now to interfere solely on that ground. But it is certainly true, from his own shewing, that he took at least $2000, from these poor, distressed, and improvident people ; making due allowance for every risk he run, with the exception of the claim of the wife\u2019s equity. By advancing money before the terms were absolutely settled between him and <em>Kenney, </em>he placed him in a situation which compelled him afterwards to submit to such conditions as might be imposed. The appellant entered into the purchase after an examination of the deed of settlement. He acted against the advice of counsel, and, as must be presumed, whatever may be the fact, with a full knowledge of the wife\u2019s rights. His subsequent .purchase of his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>bond, for half the amount secured by it, as the Chancellor justly observes, marks the character of the whole transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\">The appellant has, however, actually patted with his rtioney, to a certain amount, and justice requires that it should be refunded to him by the husband ; and this may be done out of the wife\u2019s property, provided there is sufficient, after making an adequate settlement upon the wife. To discuss this subject farther might be premature. 1 have no hesitancy, however, in saying, that if the stock in question is her whole fortune, it is not too much for her support ; and it should he settled upon her, for the support of herself and children, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">But he is entitled to what may remain after provision for wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The result of my researches and rejection on this cas\u00e9 is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">1. That the wife has an undoubted right to an adequate provision for her, and her children, if any, out of her equitable property, as against h\u00e9r husband, or ahy assignee of the husband. And when it is necessary to come into a Court of Equity, for its aid in obtaining possession of such property, the Court will see that proper provision shall be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">Wife has . right to provision Out of her equitable property, againsl husband Or any of his assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">2. That though, in general, a husband who lives with and maintains his wife is entitled to receive the dividends or interest of her estate, yet when the husband deserts his wife, or neglects or refuses to provide for and maintain her, or when he has misbehaved himself, and ran away with a ward of the Court, and, I would add, when he has shown a total incapacity to manage his concerns, ora disposition wantonly to waste his wife\u2019s property, in such cases the Court ought to direct the interest to be paid, either to the wife, or to a trustee for her benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">Though husband who lives with and maintains his wife is entitled to the interest of such property, yet if he neglect to do this, or has ran away with and married a ward of the court, or has shewn incapacity to manage hia concerns, or a disposition to waste his wife\u2019s property, court should direct the interest to be paid to her, or to some trustee for her benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the decree of his honour the late Chancellor be affirmed, except so far as it rescinds the former orders of the Court of Chancery, directing the dividends to be paid first to <em>Kenney, </em>and afterwards to <em>TJdall, </em>and that part directing the dividends which accrued before the decree to be paid to Mrs. <em>Kenney. </em>By the order.of the <em>9tk February, </em>1818, the dividends were directed to be paid to <em>Kenney </em>till the further order of the Court; and by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>order of <em>June </em>1th, 1819, the dividends which accrued after the IsZ <em>January, </em>1819, until Mrs. <em>Kenney </em>should arrive at the age of 21 years, or till the further order of the Court in the premises, were to be paid ever to <em>Udall. </em>It seems to me just, therefore, that the appellant should have received the dividends until the 10Z\u00c1 day of <em>August, </em>1821, when the decree was made.'</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Question as provi\u00bbon,Utdef pending on cir-be referred to * master.</p>\n<p id=\"AlNV\">Overplus to bint!aid appel*</p>\n<p id=\"AWy\">The amount which will be an adequate settlement for the w\u00a1fe must, of course, be ascertained by a Master of the Court of Chancery.

And on the coming in of his report, sho.uld there be any thing left after making a competent provision for the wife, it is perfectly equitable and proper that the surplus be applied to the reimbursement of the amount actually advanced by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">For affirmance, sal7\u00cd\u00b0r reTer*</p>\n<p id=\"AL1F\">WOODWORTH, J. and BoWNB, BrONSON, B\u00fcRROWS,\u2019B\u00fcRT, Clark, Cramer, Dudley, E\u00e1rll, Gardiner, Green, Haight, Lynde, Mallory, M\u2019Intyre, Morgan, Nelson, Redfield, Sudam, Thorn, Ward, Wheeler and Wright, Senators, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Bowman, M\u2019Call and Wooster, Senators, dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"AZa\">A majority of the Court concurring in the opinion of Savage, Ch.
