He requested time to look at his minutes, which he said he had not with him, promised to amend the bill the first opportunity, and retained it for that purpose. He was repeatedly solicited to propose amendments, which he omitted to do, and ruled the plaintiffs to assign errors while he had possession of the draft.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-4\">In neither of the causes were the exceptions reduced to writing on the trial, and both bills were finally settled and signed by three of the Judges, after they had gone out of office, and without giving any notice of the time and place of their being so settled to the attorneys of <em>White </em>and <em>Schult </em>respectively.

The defendants in error should, at least, have had notice of the time and place when and where the bills would have been submitted to the Judges for their sanction. This should always be so ; more especially qt such a distance of time from the trial. We would not have compelled the Judges, by mandamus, to seal the bills, without such notice ; and when bill? of exception are signed under sue!] circumstances as would not call for our interference by mandamus, we will, on application, set them aside, as improvidently executed, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>rule is applicable here upon another ground : In neither of these causes were the exceptions reduced to writing upon the trial, or during the term. <em>(Midberry </em>v.
