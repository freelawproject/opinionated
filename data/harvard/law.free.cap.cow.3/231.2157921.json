In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Buckdon,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant and another, having some speech about the death of a child of one <em>Dowland, </em>the defendant said that the plaintiff was the cause of the death of the child, and that he (the defendant) would swear it upon a book. On verdict for the plaintiff, a motion was made in arrest; and the Court held the words not actionable for want of a colloquium, pointing them to a case of poisoning, murdering or some other untimely death. Without this, they were pronounced too general; that the plaintiff <em>caused </em>the death, was not enough; and the Court put a case by way of illustration, that one may be the cause of another\u2019s death, and yet be perfectly innocent; as where it is caused by lawful imprisonment. In <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Kins, </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>on error to the exchequer chamber, the words in one count were, \u201c I will take him to <em>Bow-street </em>on a charge of forgery;\u201d <em>inuendo, </em>that the plaintiff had been guilty of forgery. On verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, generally, upon all the counts, the error assigned was, \u201c that the words did not import any express or precise imputation of the plaintiff below having committed forgery ; but only an intention of the defendant below to take the plaintiff to <em>Bow street </em>(without shewing where, in that street, or for what purpose, upon a charge of forgery, without stating by or against whom made, or of what forgery,) and which words of themselves constituted no cause of action, although they were laid in a separate count, as a separate cause of action, without any special damage.\u201d .Apd for these causes, the judgment was reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>Peake </em>v. <em>Oldham </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> will probably be relied on for the plaintiff; and is undoubtedly the strongest case against us. There the defendant told the plaintiff he was <em>guilty </em>of the death of a person. This was charged in the 4th count; the others being sufficient. Ld. <em>Mansfield </em>lays much stress upon the word <em>guilty, </em>which is wanting here, as showing from the whole frame of the words, that they imported a charge of murder. Upon the same principle, in <em>Carpenter v. Tarrant,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>these words were holden actionable :\" Robert <em>Carpenter </em>was in <em>Winchester </em>gaol, and tried for his life, and would have been banged, had it not been for <em>Leggat, </em>for breaking open the granary of farmer A, and stealing his bacon.\u201d So in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Camden,</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c He was under a charge of prosecution for perjury, and <em>G. W. </em>an had the Attorney General\u2019s directions to prosecute him for perjury,\u201d were holden actionable. Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>says, \u201c the words must mean that he was ordered by the Attorney General <em>to </em>be prosecuted, either for a perjury which he had committed, or which he had not committed ; or which he was supposed only to have committed. In the first sense, they are clearly actionable. In the they cannot possibly be understood consistently with the context. He concludes upon the whole matter, that these words must fairly be understood in the first of the three senses, and refers to <em>Carpenter </em>v. Tarrant. The words should convey a charge directly ; not merely by way of inference.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> They should not be doubtful or equivocal <footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> Within this rule, saying of the plaintiff he is forsworn, is not slanderous, unless it be said of some judicial Proceeding in which he had been sworn.<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> The rule, as laid down by Ld. <em>Kenyon, </em>is, that \u201c either the words themselves must be such as can only be understood in a criminal sense, or it must be shewn by a colloquium in the part, that they have that meaning, otherwise they are not actionable.\u201d<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> \u201c You swore to a lie, for which you stand indicted,\u201d were holden actionable by this Court, on the ground that the concluding words, \u201c <em>you stand </em>indicted,\u201d imply that the false oath could have been none other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>perjury ; otherwise an indictment would not lie.<footnotemark>(j)</footnotemark> Independent of such an explanation, most clearly the words wouldnot have been actionable.<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> <em>Brooker </em>v. <em>Coffin,</em><footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was strikingly analagous to the present case. The frame of the words imported perjury, much more directly than those in the present case import the crime against nature or any other crime ; yet they were holden not actionable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-4\">Suppose it asserted of a man that he was with a woman, would it imply an illicit connexion ? A charge of <em>hooking, </em>or of being a <em>cow-boy, </em>have been holden not actionable. There should be a fixed legal sense to words, by which their quality can be certainly determined. General understanding would pronounce a charge of swearing false to import perjury ; yet, in themselves, these words are clearly not so. It is, therefore, no argument for sustaining this eount, that by-slanders may have understood the words charged to import the crime of bestiality.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-10\"><em>S. M. Hopkins, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYyJ\">Is it true, that, in order to maintain an action of slander, the crime imputed must be charged in legal terms ? Is it true, that the slanderer shall\u2019 escape, if he evades the use of technical or legal terms, although he utier those which all mankind understand to import an abominable crime ? Take the words \u201c hooking,\u201d or \u201ccow-bow,\u201d put by the gentleman ; is there no way in which a pleader may so frame a declaration as to reach the real intent of the speaker, and make them a slander upon record ? How the declaration should be drawn, in such cases, I do not undertake to say ; but it would be a' libel upon the law, and a still greater one upon counsel, to say that it could not be done. Take the case put, of \u201c being with a woman might not such a charge be preceded or followed by such explanations, as to make it convey a charge of adultery ? The law says that a man may be libelled by paintings or pictures ; and yet is there no mode of declaring by which he can reach the offence ? Certainly he may do this, no matter how equivocal the slander.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-11\">As to cases; we rely principally upon <em>Peake </em>v. Oldham, already cited from <em>Cowper, </em>and two cases in East, <em>Woolnoth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>v. <em>Meadows ;</em><footnotemark><em>(m)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Camden,</em><footnotemark><em>(n)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the latter alsd cited on the .Other side. <em>Woolnoth </em>v. <em>Meadows </em>will be found a precedent for most of the count in question. Th\u00e9 same introductory matter, and the same concluding averments and innendos, almost word for word, will be found there ; and the words charged were certainly not more definite than here, in fixing the crime. They were these ; \u201c His character is infa.mous. He would be disgraceful to any society. Whoever proposed him must have intended it as an insult. 1 will pursue him, and hunt him\" from all society. If his name is enrolled in the royal academy, \u00cd will cause it to he erased, and will not leave a stone unturned, to publish his shame and infamy ; delicacy forbids me from bringing a direct charge ; but it was a male child of nine years old, who complained <em>to </em>me.\u201d Such\u2019words, accompanied with our averments, were held actionable. This is after verdict. The jury have passed upon the case j and where words are equivocal, it is the province of the jury to determine their import.<footnotemark>(o)</footnotemark> They have declared that the words intended to convey the imputation averred. If it be said that the declaration here varies from that in <em>Woolnoth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>in not naming the crime, we answer, that it is enough to follow the statute, which also for-bears to name it :<footnotemark>(p)</footnotemark> whereas the statute of <em>Henry </em>8, .does give the crime a name. This accounts for its being named by the English pleader. That it was not named in this in-1 stance, arose from a delicate and accurate distinction between the English act and ours ; and the Court will the more readily countenance this general form to avoid offensiveness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ-\">In the language of Ld. <em>Mansfield, </em>then, in <em>Peake </em>v. <em>Oldham, </em>will the Court, after the jury have found the fact, \u201c be guessing and inventing a mode in which it may be barely possible for these words to be spoken by the defendant, without meaning to charge a crime ?\u201d That case is full to our purpose. \u201c The jury,\u201d says he, \u201c have found the fact, namely, that such was the meaning of the defendant.\u201d And he also cites and comments upon the manu-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Bcr\u00edp\u00ed case of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>which is still more strongly in point. The defendant said to the plaintiff, \u201c I know you very well ; how did your husband die ?\u201d The plaintiff answered, \u201c As you may, if it please God.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201c No ; he died of a wound you gave him.\u201d On not guilty, there was a verdict for the plaintiff; and on motion in arrest of judgment, the Court held the words actionable ; because, <em>from the whole frame of </em>them, <em>they were spoken by way of </em>imputation.\u201d And Ld. Ch. Justice <em>Parker </em>said, \u201c It is very odd that, after verdict, a Court of Justice should be trying whether there may not be a possible case, in which words spoken by way of scandal, might not be innocently said. Whereas, if that were, in truth, the case, the defendant might have justified, or the verdict would have been otherwise.\u201d After citing that case, Ld. <em>Mansfield </em>remarks, \u201c So here, if found to be innocently spoken, the jury might have found a verdict for the defendant; but they have put a contrary construction, &amp;c.\u201d <em>Poturite </em>v. <em>Barrel,</em><footnotemark><em>(q)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was not stronger against the defendant than the present; and <em>Comyn, (in his Digest, action upon the case for Defamation, (E.) </em>&amp;c.) refers to scores of cases, which are less so, and yet the action was held to lie. But <em>Peake </em>v. <em>Oldham, </em>is a sufficient authority, and cannot be shaken. That case begun in the Common Pleas, where the questions first came up on a motion in arrest, which was denied ;<footnotemark>(r)</footnotemark> whence it was carried to the King\u2019s Bench ; and the report in <em>Cowper </em>is on error. It was a case strongly litigated, and underwent very great examination by the ablest Judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-15\"><em>Roberts </em>v. Cambden,<footnotemark>(s)</footnotemark> is our last case. There the charge was, that the plaintiff was under a prosecution for perjury. Now this may be consistent with the plaintiff s perfect innocence ; yet the Court were unanimous that the action lay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKS\"><em>Leland, </em>in reply. The case of <em>Woolnorth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>bears no analogy to the one under consideration. The words there alleged to have been spoken, conveyed a clear charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>of the crime to the understanding of every body. Taking' the whole together, there was no room to suppose any other intent than to charge the plaintiff directly with a crime. It is evident, that nothing could have been made, out of the words in <em>Peake </em>v. Oldham, had it not been for the word\" <em>guilty, </em>used by the defendant, which was the only word the Court could find to support the record. As Ld. <em>Mansfield </em>objects, after verdict, fo guessing <em>oat </em>innocence, may we not, at least, with equal propriety, respond by asking, will the Court set themselves about guessing or Hunting.oufr guilt <em>? </em>What is called an averment in this case, and is relied on to help the defect in the naked words, is no more than. a*mere inuendo, and if not warranted by the words, it goes for nothing. This is-now Ihe settled doctrine, and was applied by <em>Spencer, </em>J. in <em>Brooker </em>v. <em>Coffin,</em><footnotemark><em>(t)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to a case in principle precisely like the present. He. says the averment is not warranted by the words. So here, there must be premises to. warrant the inuendo, which is no more than a necessary conclusion, following the words themselves. This is not the case of \u00e1 colloquium about the oflence set forth in the declaration, and the words applied to it. That would have been a different thing. The apology is, that the words are offensive. Lad counsel thought of tins when pleading, it was easy to have helped it by a colloquium, which should have been as modest as the <em>inuendo.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-4\">There is no ambiguity in this case to be helped by a verdict. The full force of the expression comes out in the declaration and must be tortured to make out an imputation of guilt. They are simply, \u201c he has been With the animal.\u201d This is the whole ; and there is nothing on the record, which can be legally called in as controlling the import. In the eye of the Jaw, it is the same as if the recital and inuendo were stricken out; and it is hardly possible to conceive that they could impute a crime. Delicacy,, either in the statute or counsel, would not forbid his pursuing the words of the act, by alleging that the defendant asserted, in substance, that the plaintiff had committed the. crime against nature ; and then it would have been for the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>jury to say whether the words proved were tantamount to those complained of by the plaintiff</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AJk\"> 2 <em>Bulstr </em>10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AFZ\"> 7 <em>Taunt, 431.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> Cowp. 275</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\"> Rep.
