Clark </em>tendered him the amount of interest and principal, after the premises were sold to <em>Worden, </em>the lessor of the plaintiff, and after he had executed the deed to <em>Worden; </em>that the offer of <em>Clark </em>was made sometime in the winter after the sale. The sum of about 15 dollars, being the surplus for which the land sold to <em>Worden, </em>over and above what was due on the mortgage, and which was due to <em>Wolverion, </em>remained sometime in the hands of <em>Worden, </em>after sale ; the commissioners of loans not wishing to receive it until it could be paid to <em>Walverton, </em>who had removed from the state. The defendant\u2019s counsel then called <em>Daniel Avery, </em>the other commissioner of loans, who testified, that -no particular arrangement was made with <em>Worden, </em>as to the overplus money going to <em>Wolverton, </em>and that there was no condition, that the deed was given to be held by the commissioners until the overplus was paid. He further testified, that he thought he saw the notice of sale posted up in a publick house in <em>Aurora. </em>The plaintiff, by consent, took a verdict, subject to the opinion of the Supreme Court on a case to be made.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-4\"><em>J.

The regularity of the proceed*nSs dePcnds upon the construction of the various sections \u2019 in relation to this subject. The 11th section<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> fixes the time for paying the interest of the loan annually on the ls\u00a3 <em>Tuesday </em>of <em>May. </em>By the 15th section, if not paid within 22 days after, the borrower is forever foreclosed ; and the commissioners are to advertise and sell as directed in the 17th section. The provisions of this section have been complied with, in terms, as to time. As to description, they are te <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>^cause advertisements to be fixed up at not less than three of the most publick places in the county where the premises are situate, describing the quantity and situation of the lands mentioned in the several mortgages foreclosed as aforesaid, and giving notice, &amp;c.\u201d They are also to advertise in one of the publick papers of the county. In this case, advertisements were fixed up in 4 or 5 different places, beside being published in the newspapers</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-3\">The counsel here read the advertisement; and insisted that it was a substantial compliance with the act, in point of description. He said the act evidently contemplated a very brief notice ; for section 20, which determines the expense of proceeding, allows but <em>$3 </em>for all the services and expenses of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-4\">The tender of the money by <em>Clark, </em>being after the sale, was too late ; besides, he established no right to make the tender. He assumed to be an assignee of the mortgagor, but, by the 20th section, the commissioners were not bound to recognize him in this character, unless he had been recorded as such in their books. .</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-5\"><em>D. Cady, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_A\">submitted the following points or propositions, in writing :</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">I. The sale by the loan officers was void, and no title passed to the lessor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">1. Because the advertisement did not contain a sufficient description of the situation of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">2. Because the advertisements were not put up and continued in the proper places.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-9\">3. Because the sale was, in part, at least, upon credit, and the deed not executed in the presence of two witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-10\"><em>4. </em>Because the sale was not on the day prescribed by law; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-11\">5. Because the loan officers had no power, by law, to sell the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-12\">II. There having been no regular sale of the premises1,</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-13\">and the person under whom the defendant holds having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tendered to the loan officers the whole sum due upon the mortgage,- he is entitled to retain the possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-4\">He added, that it is for the Court to say what degree of particularity in the description is required by the statute. There certainly may be a description which is insufficient; and we think the legislature intended it should be enough, at \u25a0all events, to put the possessor of the land on his guard ; as well as to enable those who attend the sale to find the land, acquaint themselves with its value, and be prepared to bid. \u201cLot-No. 1, in <em>Brulus,r&gt;' </em>would enable any one to examine <em>f </em>but an advertisement by the commissioners, that they would-sell \u201c one of the lots in Brutus, would not enable a purchaser to bid understandingiy, without examining every lot in-the town. It is matter of publick law, that <em>Brutus </em>was divided into lots of 600 acres. Now, the commissi aiers say, that they will sell 100 acres of a certain lot. Who, from' this, could say what part of the 600 acres were to be sold ? It may be said, that the name of the mortgagor was mentioned, and that an examination of the commissioners\u2019 files would be a guide; but this is not enough. One carmot know through whose hands the land may have passed. Neither <em>name </em>nor <em>record </em>would, therefore, guide him ; and he must examine 600 acres instead of one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">Again: the premises lie 14 or <em>15 </em>miles north of (he court house; yet all the advertisements are fixed up from 8 to 16-miles south- of that place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">Fifteen dollars yet remain unpaid by the purchaser. The' law is express that money must be paid, on a sale of this description. . The commissioners have no power to sell on credit ; and they must exact and receive the whole money. If they may give day for the <em>15 </em>dollars, they may do the same with $15,000. The rul\u00e9is, in its nature, inflexible, and cannot accommodate itself to the amount. There is no title in-the purchaser, till the money is, in fact, paid to the utmost farthing. _ _. - - .....</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-7\">___It is conceded that the commissioners acted under a limited authority. Then, we say again, the sale was void, as not being made on the day required by the statute. Previous-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>to the day of sale, 3 years interest had been suffered to accumulate. By the 18th section, the commissioners are directed to sell on the third <em>Tuesday </em>of <em>September, </em>annually, all the lands mortgaged. in respect to which there shall have been a default in not paying the interest ; and by the 19th section, if no purchaser will bid to the principal and interest, they are to enter upon, and lease the lands for the benefit of the state. They are then to offer the land for sale, again, at the <em>nextulprit </em>; and if there is then no purchaser for an .adequate sum. the state become seized of the lands, subject to a right of redemption in the mortgagor. Now it is fairly to be presumed, that ail these steps were taken. It was the duty of the commissioners to set about them immediately on the mortgagor\u2019s default. Whether they did so or not, their poweis of sale, in the ordinary way, ceased ; and a tender was made before they had regularly sold. The proceeding was void\u2014it was as no sale\u2014and the tender in season.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-3\">It is said, that on default of payment, the commissioners were, by the 15th section, seized of an absolute estate in the lands ; but though this be so, they held it for certain specified purposes. They cannot sit down and dispose of the land in any manner (hey choose, but must be guided by the statute. <em>(Denning v. </em>Smith, 3 <em>John. Ch. Rep. </em>332.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-4\"><em>Richardson, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEx\">cited <em>King </em>v. <em>Stow, </em>(6 <em>John. Ch. Rep. </em>323) as in point, to shew that any irregularity in the proceedings of the commissioners in relation to fixing up advertisements, or making entries, &amp;c. could not be objected against a <em>bo-,a fide </em>purchaser at the sale. The description was sufficient-</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">[Woodworth, J.

No one could be deceived who lived on <em>Wohertords </em>land. This is a declaration to the possessor, and to purchasers, that <em>JVoherioids </em>land, to the extent of 100 acres, would be sold. Nor does it lie in the mouth of the defendant to say, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>that because the commissioners have indulged him three years, they must, therefore, relinquish the whole amount, This was a matter which lay exclusively between them and the publick. The same ansxyer applies to the objection, that the whole purchase money was not paid. The commissioners had a right to make the purchaser a depositary of the 15 dollars, or any larger amount, if they chose. They have done no more. The money remained with him, waiting a chance to be sent to the mortgagor,</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-4\">Beside, though the commissioners gave credit for the whole, it is not for the defendant to object.

(5 <em>vol. Laws, by W. &amp; </em>S. 392.) The premises were mortgaged to the commissioners by one <em>Peter IVolverton, </em>on the ISiAday of July, 1808; and default having been made by him in the payment of the interest, the commissioners, in pursuance of the directions of the act, sold them at publick auction, and the lessor of the plaintiff became the purchaser. The defendant derivestitle, also, from <em>Peter IVolverton, </em>by a conveyance subsequent to the mortgage ; and after the sale to the lessor of the plaintiff, he. offered, by the hand of <em>Clark, </em>to redeem, by paying the amount due.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The only question in the case is, whether the sale by the commissioners was in conformity to the provisions of the act ? The principal objections are\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">1. That the advertisements did not contain a sufficiently minute description of the situation of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">2. That they were not put up in the proper places.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">3. That the purchase money ivas not all paid on the day <em>\u00a1o\u00ed </em>sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">There is no pretence of fraud on the part of the commissioners. They are admitted to have acted in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>faith, and the lessor of the plaintiff is a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for a valuable consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">1. The 17thsection of the act directs, \u201cthat the commissioners shall cause advertisements to be fixed up at ,not less than three of the iqost publick places of the county where the premises are situate, describing the quantity and situation of the land, &amp;c. and shall also cause such notice to be given in, at least, one of .the publick newspapers in the county, if any such there be.\u201d The advertisement, in this case, contained the name of the mortgagor\u2014the date and number of the mortgage\u2014the number of the lot\u2014the town in which it was situated, when the mortgage was given\u2014and the quantity of acres mortgaged. It could not have been more particular, without giving a description of the premises by metes and bounds, as contained in the mortgage. The act does not require such particularity. It contemplates only a general description, sufficient to apprize the mortgagor that his land is to be sold, and to enable any persons who may wish to purchase, or who may be interested in the premises, by subsequent liens, to locate and identify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In <em>Denning </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(3 <em>John. Ch. Rep. </em>332) one of the advertisements neither contained the name of the mortgagor, nor the number of one of the lots ; and these omissions were held to be fatal. But the Chancellor seems to admit, that if the name of the mortgagor, and the number of the lot, had been inserted, the advertisement would have been good. He says, the \u201c omission of the mortgagor\u2019s name, and of the number of the lot, in the advertisement in <em>Cattskill, </em>where the agent of the owner resided, was a most unfortunate circumstance, &amp;c. It was also an omission fatal, in any view, to the legality of the notice.\u201d The other notices, the sufficiency of which, in point of form, was not questioned, were not as particular in their description as the advertisement in this case. They described the premises as being in the town of <em>Cairo, </em>and as being \u201c lot No. 11, and part of lot No. 14, near Perce\u2019s mill, containing 126 acres, mortgaged by <em>Henry </em>Persenwithout designating what part or portion of the mortgaged premises was in each or either of the lots,. The first objection, therefore, is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"A6KZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>2. The second objection appears to be founded on the fact t^e advertisements were put up in places remote from the mortgaged premises ; for there is nothing in the case t\u00b0 show that the places where they were put up, <em>were not three of the most publick places in the county. </em>This is alt that the act requires. It is not necessary that one of the advertisements should be upon or near the premises; and unless <em>one </em>of the three most publick places in the county was near the premises, an advertisement there would not be a compliance with the act. In <em>Denning v. Smith, </em>the omission to put up an advertisement in <em>Cairo, </em>which was in the neighbourhood of the premises, and was one of the most publick and central places in the county, was held by the Chancellor to be a circumstance which, in conjunction with other facts, tended to shew a fraudulent intent on the part of the commissioners. But, in this case, it does not ap-. pear that there was any publick place near the mortgaged premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In <em>King v. Stow, </em>(6 <em>John. Ch. Rep. </em>323) all the advertise- . ments were put up in the village of <em>Elizabethtown, </em>twenty miles distant from the mortgaged premises ; and although it appeared that a publick road passed through the premises, and that two publick ferries were maintained within two miles and a half of them, the notices were held to be good ; there being no evidence of a fraudulent intent, and <em>Elizabethtown </em>being, in fact, the most publick place in the county. The notices in this case were, therefore, regular.</p>\n<p id=\"Aob\">3. The reason why the surplus, beyond the amount due to the state, was not immediately exacted from the purchaser, is stated by the commissioners to have been, because the mortgagor, to whom it was to be paid, had left the state, and the commissioners did not want the money until they could pay it over. They state expressly, in their testimony, that there was no agreement for a credit. The surplus was only $15, and there is nothing to show that it was not paid on demand. But this is an objection which, if it can be raised at all, can be urged only by the mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">. Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
