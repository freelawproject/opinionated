They profess to give judgment of reversal as to the proceedings of the Justice, whereas they have no power even to reverse their own judgments. At most, this was an arbitration\u2014a reference by consent, without any agreement that the Court should give judgment, which is void, within the cases of <em>Camp v. Root, </em>(18 <em>John. </em>22) and <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>(17 <em>id, </em>461.) The Court were bound to proceed upon this appeal, according <em>to the </em>course \u00aef the common law, which ties them to a trial by jury,</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-10\">[1 lere <em>Wait </em>was stopped by the Court, who desired to hear the other side.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-11\"><em>R.

The election spoken of in the record, implies an agreement that the act of the Court should be equivalent to the finding of the jury.
