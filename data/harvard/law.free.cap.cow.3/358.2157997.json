It is almost a matter of course for a Circuit Judge to grant leave to turn a contemplated case into a special verdict or bill of excepiions, if requested by either party, at the trial; but this should appear, by stipulation, in the case, or in some other way. A bill of exceptions, or special verdict, is a part of the business of the trial ; and if not sought for in any way there, it cannot be obtained afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
