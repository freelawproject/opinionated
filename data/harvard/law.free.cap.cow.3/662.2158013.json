Rep. </em>377 <em>lo </em>385, <em>S. C. </em>v/hcre the evidence necessary to sustain these counts was very fully considered by Woodworth, J. who delivered the opinion of the Court upon a case made. There being no special verdict or bill of exceptions, the evidence was not before this Court ; but the cause went entirely upon the sufficiency of the declaration. Much of Judge <em>Wood-worth's </em>opinion will, however, be found applicable to the questions raised here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b665-6\"><em>P. S. </em>Parker, for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFiR\">remarked, generally, that where there is a substantial defect in a declaration, the defendant may avail himself of it by demurrer, motion in arrest, or writ of error. The verdict in this case is general, upon all the counts, three of which are special ; and if either be defective in substance, our writ of error is sustained. It is true, Courts have gone as far as possible in the amendment of the proceedings below, by entering the verdict upon the good counts, if warranted by the minutes of the Circuit Judge. Nothing of that kind, was, however, done in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b666-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>1. There does not appear, in any part of the declaration, an authority in the defendants below to transact banking business at <em>Canandaigua. </em>There is no statute recited or set forth, giving them such authority, and there is no public act to that effect. It will hardly be contended, that a bank has an incidental-right to establish offices of discount and deposit ; nor is there any thing, in the original charter of the <em>Bank of Utica, </em>giving them such a right. Then, if there was any authority to do this, it should have been specially shewn. The plaintiffs below did not seek to recover of any officer of the branch, but of the mother bank\u2014not for the act or omission of the bank, but for the fault of an individual. If the <em>Bank of Utica </em>had no right to erect this office, they are not liable ; and, in all cases, where a party seeks te. establish a right in virtue of a private act, as this must be, he must plead the act as he would any other record. True, the declaration refers generally to an act authorizing the establishment of an office at <em>Canandaigua, </em>but the act itself should be set forth specially, to shew the connexion between the mother bank and the agent. (1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>218. 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>86. <em>Bac. Abr. Statute, </em>(L).) Here even the title of the statute is not mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b666-8\">2. The 1st and 2d counts of the declaration set forth a note payable on demand ; and no cause of action could arise against the defendants below, for negligence in not presenting such a note for payment, and in emitting to notify the endorser 6 months after it was due. No time of payment being specified in the notes, they were due and demandable immediately. <em>(Thompson </em>v. Ketcham, 8 <em>John. Rep. </em>192. <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Bennett, id. </em>374. <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>7 <em>Cranch, </em>217.) The notes are stated, in both these counts, to have been made and dated on the <em>12th August, </em>1817 ; to have been endorsed by <em>Spencer </em>at that time ; and to have been deposited in the bank on the <em>14th </em>day of <em>February, </em>1818 ; at which time the defendants below promised to make demand and give notice. What duty was imposed upon the defendants ? Of what avail were a demand and notice at that late day ? Two months and a half have been holden $m unreasonable delay. This must depend on circumstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ces ; such as the distance between the residence of the hoider and the other parties. In this case, there would be a material difference, as to time, between a residence of the drawers in <em>South Carolina, </em>and the village of <em>Canandaigua ; </em>and nothing appears that they did not reside at the latter place. But suppose they resided at the city of <em>New-Yorlc, </em>at the date of the note\u2014a demand might have been made, and the usual time of communication, which is but a few days, between these places, would have carried notice of nonpayment to <em>Canandaigua. </em>There is an allegation that the plaintiffs below brought a suit against the endorser, and were defeated, with costs, for want of due notice. This appears, on the face of the declaration, to have been their own fault. <em>(Chitty on Bills, </em>350.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-4\">3. There is no sufficient consideration set forth in the 3d count. The promise relied on was a <em>nudum pactum. </em>There is a wide distinction, in this respect, between a non-feasance and misfeasance. In the latter case, an action lies for negligence, though the undertaking be without consideration : otherwise for a non-feasance. In such case, a full and plain consideration must be clearly stated, to warrant an action. <em>(Thorne </em>v. <em>Deas, </em>4 <em>John. Rep. </em>84.) In the case cited, all the authorities are stated and considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-6\">That error will lie upon one count substantially bad, though the others be good, if the verdict be general, the Court are referred to <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Beedle, </em>(1 <em>Caines' Rep. </em>347) <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Astle, (Doug. </em>730) <em>Cheetham </em>v. <em>Tillotson, </em>(5 <em>John. Rep. </em>430) and <em>Trevor </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>(1 <em>T. R. </em>151.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-7\">The distinction upon which we rely, between a non-feasance and misfeasance, is admitted by his honor Judge <em>Wood-worth, </em>who delivered the opinion of the Court below upon the case made. He admits, that ordinarily, in the former case, there must be a complete consideration appearing upon the face of the declaration ; but he considers that banks form an exception. Where is the distinction ? Suppose this had been the case of an individual banker or broker ; would not the case be precisely the same in principle ? Is it true, of them, that the mere delivery of the paper, and the expected benefit to be derived from deposit, funds, facilities, &amp;c. would form,\" a legal consideration ? If not; why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>otherwise as to incorporated banks ? The learned Judge adverts to the case of <em>Elsee </em>v. <em>Gatward, </em>(5 <em>T. R. </em>143.) Now, in that case, the Judges agree, that if <em>Gahvard </em>had performe&lt;^\u2019 he might have had an action for his compensation against <em>Elsee ; </em>but this expectation of benefit was not allowed to form a consideration. Having done nothing towards the work, though it was in the line of his business as a carpenter, yet this circumstance did not make out a consideration. How is it possible to distinguish the two cases ? The very point decided in <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>Deas, </em>(4 <em>John. Rep. </em>96) was, that an action will not lie in such a case. In this case, we admit, that if the bank had got the money in their vaults, they would have been liable ; but they were as much at liberty to attempt obtaining it or not, as <em>Gatward </em>was to undertake or omit the building. The only consideration alleged by this count is, that the plaintiffs would deliver the notes to be collected for the plaintiffs\u2019 benefit. This is no consideration at all. The delivery of the notes was no benefit to the defendants. It does not appear, by the declaration, that they could possibly derive any benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-4\">4. The 3d count does not aver the non-payment of the note by the makers. This was an essential averment, and payment not being negatived, we have a right to infer that it was made at the day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-5\"><em>5. </em>Neither of the counts aver that the makers were insolvent. Without this, the plaintiffs below could have sustained no damage.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b668-6\">S. <em>M. </em>Hopkins, for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtQY\">The note in question, in fact, fell due on the <em>14th </em>of <em>February, </em>1818, as averred in the 3d count. The opinion of the Court below was given upon the merits of the case, as they appeared at the circuit, and has very little bearing upon the form of the declaration, which, alone, is questioned here. The informalities in the record were never brought to the view of the Court below in any shape ; and this furnishes us with one answer to the writ of error. It is, that the defendants below should have taken their objections in the Supreme Court, by demurrer or motion in arrest. We are not to be met, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the first time with them, here. This was determined in the late case of <em>Colden </em>v. Knickerbacker, (2 <em>Cowen's Rep. </em>31) which holds that, to warrant reviewing a point here, it must have been expressly passed upon by the Court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b669-3\">It is admitted, that the first and second counts aver a suffix yient consideration $ but there is a clerical mistake, in not setting forth the not\u00e9 \u00e1s payable at 6 months. In the third count, however, the note is truly set forth ; but this is said to be defective, in omitting to aver a sufficient consideration. The law does not require a full consideration. The meiest trifle is sufficient. An attorney who engages to defend a suit for <em>$5 </em>received, is bound to a faithful discharge of his duty, and is fully amenable for all the damages arising from his neglect. Equally so, if he engages to defend upon the express or implied promise of his Client to pay him the reasonable or legal fees. If he simply engage to defend a cause, without any thing farther, it is a mere naked promise ; but if any thing be done by the client, or any liability incurred, the attorney will be bound. The slightest loss or inconvenience, on the part of the promissee, makes a sufficient consideration. (1 <em>Com. on Cont. </em>16, 17.) This is fully exemplified in the books. An executor is not bound without assets ; yet if he promise the creditor, \u201c prove your debt and I will pay it,\u201d he is bound, on the condition being performed. A delivery of goods, in which one has only a special property, <em>(Bind </em>v. <em>Plain, Cro. Eliz. </em>218) or mutual acceptance of bills to the same amount, is also .a good consideration. So intermarriage with a third person. <em>(Brown et ux. </em>v. Garbo<em>rough, Cro. Eliz. </em>63.) So performance of what the promissee was previously bound to do by an award. <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Scarlet, Cro. Eliz. </em>70.) So a promise to show a deed. <em>(Sturlyn </em>v. <em>Albany, Cro. </em>Eliz. 67. <em>id. </em>150, S. <em>C.) </em>Doing an act for the benefit of a third person, at the defendant\u2019s request. <em>(Hunt </em>v. <em>Bate, Dy. </em>272, b.) In the margin of this page, the plaintiff\u2019s sealing a lease is mentioned as a consideration, though it was of no consequence to the defendant. Now, in the 3d count, it is thus set forth ; \u201c In consideration that the said plaintiffs, at the special instance and request of the said defendants, would endorse and deliver to them, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>said defendants, a certain other promissory note, in the words and figures following,\u201d &amp;c. <em>{settingforth the note in questionr and that it was endorsed and </em>delivered.) Here is a consideration, within the cases, fully stated. The endorsement and delivery put it upon the defendants to make the demand and give the notice; otherwise the plaintiffs\u2019 remedy against the endorser would be gone forever. The plaintiffs ceased to . hold the note. They had put it out of their power, therefore, to make the demand, at the request of the.defendants; and the mere fact that they had incurred this inconvenience was enough.\" The consideration is not merely formal, as supposed. The distinction between non-feasance and misfeasance is founded on the case of <em>Coggs </em>v. Bernard, (2 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>909) and I had supposed this case would have been cited. It has not been ; and, I presume, for the reason that it would make decidedly against the plaintiffs in error. The receipt of the property, and beginning to act about it, was holden enough, in that case\", tb bind the bailee to its prudent management, according to the terms of the bailment. Having the note in their possession, controlling it exclusively, and not acting at the proper time, became a deceit upon us, which worked a lasting injury. If the act is commenced, it must be finished\u2014it must be well, truly, faithfully, and correctly done, according to the nature of the act to be perfor-. med\u2014otherwise an action lies. In this case, an attorney undertakes to charge an endorser. <em>Coggs </em>v. <em>Bernard </em>is, that if you begin the trust, you must go through with it. I retain an attorney to defend, put my papers in his hands, and lie omits to appear, by which I am damnified, in the loss of my cause, or otherwise\u2014was it ever doubted that he would be liable ? Here the papers are delivered, and no notice given ; yet, say the bailees, \u201c we might act our pleasure, and\" ruin you with impunity\u2014we have a right to go on, and do the business at the halves, and yet you have no remedy for our carelessness.\u201d Is this to be tolerated ? In <em>Coggs </em>v. <em>Bernard, </em>there were two objections\u2014one, a want of consideration\u2014the other, that the defendant was not shewn to be a common carrier. The objection, and all the reasoning in that cause, pre-supposed and admitted that the being a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>mon carrier, whose business it is to convey goods, would have been sufficient to sustain the action. Here is a common collector; and his honor Mr. Justice <em>Woodworth </em>rightly held, that the bank was liable, on the ground that this was in the ordinary course of their business, of which they made a profit. This abundantly appeared upon a consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-5\">But if all the defects imputed to this declaration exist, they are cured by the verdict. The objection is to a title defectively set forth\u2014nota defective title. <em>(Rex </em>v. Landaff, 2 <em>Str. </em>1011.) In <em>Small </em>v. <em>Cole &amp; Skinner, </em>(2 <em>Burr. </em>1159, 1161)' the demise was laid as having been made 30 years after the memorandum ; yet the Court held that this defect was cured by the verdict. <em>Dennison, </em>J. gave as a reason, that no doubt a proper title was proved upon the trial. <em>Com. Dig. Pleader, </em>(C.) 87, refers to various cases of the like character. One defect complained of is, that our declaration does not allege a neglect to pay the notes. But we say the defendants caused no notice to be given that payment was not made\u2014an averment of non-payment which, to be sure, is somewhat circuitous and argumentative, but no ground of objection upon error. It is a mere formal defect, scarcely objectionable by special demurrer. No position is better- settled, than that a verdict shall cure all that which may be supposed, from the record, to have been proved at the trial. Neglect was essential to maintain the action before the jury, and must have been proved. The omission, therefore, is cured. <em>(Hornsey </em>v. <em>Dimocke, </em>1 <em>Ventr. </em>119. <em>De La Barre </em>v. <em>Jones, Hardr. </em>222, <em>Bull. N. P. </em>321. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Douglass, Barn. </em>452. <em>Huffam </em>v. <em>Ellis, 3 Taunt. </em>415.) Indeed, it is a negative averment, which it lay with the defendants to disprove. If this be not done, it is received as proved from the nature of the issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-12\">We must not, however, be considered as admitting that this declaration is substantially defective; for we do not think this can he maintained. On the subject of what consideration is necessary, wp also refer to <em>Com. Dig. Action upon the case upon assumpsit, (B. </em>1, 2, 3.) In Anonymous, (2 <em>Ventr. </em>45) the consideration alleged and held good was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>that the plaintiff paid to the defendant so much money, who, assumed to pay a like sum into Court and appear\u2014a case much like the present. The bank received a note, equivaleut in itself to rn\u00b0ney&gt; which, in the ordinary course of things, would produce to them its face in cash, from which they might have derived a benfit as a deposit. They are, at any rate, henefittefi as much as the attorney was in <em>Venir is, </em>though they forthwith pay out the money. Again : if, in consideration that you will pay <em>A- </em>such a sum of money, I promise to pay <em>B </em>the same sum, this binds me to the payment, though I derive no benefit from the consideration. (Com. <em>Dig. Action up,on the case upon assump.sit, (B.) </em>11.) .Again : if the plaintiff will permit the defendant to receive money of <em>A, </em>which he owes the plaintiff, the defendant promises to give the plaintiff a bill of exchange for so much : this shall bind, though\" <em>A </em>become insolvent and never pay ; for the plaintiff, perhaps, would not have delayed, had it no.fc been for the defendant\u2019s promise, <em>(id.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-3\">We admit that the doctrine of nonfeasance and misfeasance is left in a little confusion by the books, some expressions giving color to the positions advanced against us. It is said, for instance, that if one take charge of brandy, and spill a portion of it, which implies feasance, he, is liable ;. but if the bailee, who receives it, totally omit doing any thing whatever by which it is lost or spilled, he is not liable.' The. ' latter position is not warranted by the cases. <em>Coggs </em>v. Bernard is, that the bailee is not liable if he do nothing; that is, if he never even receive the property. Suppose a revenue law required brandy to be deposited in a public store; or that, otherwise, it should be forfeited\u2014I deliver the brandy, with the documents and key, to one, for the purpose of having it stored, and he staves the pipes and wastes the brandy\u2014it is. admitted he would be liable. Suppose., again, that he receives them, and then refuses to stir, by which the brandy is forfeited to the government, by reason of not being deposited : the loss is equally serious\u2014the consideration equally adequate-^-and yet shall it be said the bailor must abide the loss ? In <em>Elsee </em>v. <em>Gatward, </em>(5 <em>T. R. </em>143, 148,) Ld. <em>Kenyon </em>recognized what <em>Powell, </em>J. said in <em>Coggs </em>v. Bernard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>that \u201c an action will not lie for not doimz a thing, for want of a sufficient consideration; hut if the bailee will take the goods into bis custody, he shall be answerable for them; for the taking of the goods into his custody is Ms own act.\u201d So here, the defendants take the note, which is the same as a delivery of goods, and they are liable, no matter what name you give to the omission, whether <em>nonfeasance </em>or <em>misfea</em>sance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b673-6\">As to the clerical error in the first and second counts, which omit to set forth the time the notes had to run, it is true they are mentioned as bearing date on the <em>V2th </em>of <em>&lt;Mu%vst, </em>and as being endorsed on the <em>14lii </em>of <em>February ; </em>but the time is laid under a <em>scilicet, </em>and is immaterial. There san te no intendment that the notes were endorsed an hour before they were delivered, or that they lay an unreasonable time with \u00edhe plaintiffs below. The proof must have been regular, and might have proceeded in total disregard of the time, which was mere form. Beside, it does not lie with the ba. ik to say that a presentment and notice would do ns no service, alter having expressly promised, upon good consideration, to perfoim these acts for us. Being notes payable on demand, no particular time is fixed by the law, within which these acts should be done. The time, it is admitted, must depend on circumstances, which may, in certain cases, warrant a greater delay than 6 months. All this was proper matter of proof upon the trial. <em>(Losee </em>v. <em>Dunkin, </em>7 <em>John. Rep. </em>70. <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Haskin, </em>2 Caines\u2019 <em>Rep. </em>369. <em>Loomis </em>v. <em>Pulver, </em>9 <em>John. Rep. </em>244. <em>Hendricks </em>v. <em>Judah, </em>1 <em>id. </em>319. Various circumstances would excuse a delay of strict notice. It might have been waived by the endorser. These are matters which are never spread upon the record, and cannot come fairly in question here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b673-11\">The statute under which the parties proceeded is sufficiently set forth ; but \u00a1f not so, the imperfection is cured by the verdict. Beside, we do not admit that acts in relation to banks are private. They are treated as public in all our judicial proceedings, where it has never been thought necessary to recite them at large. Our Courts have decided that their bills are a legal tender, unless specially objected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to, and their charters concern the.currency of the country. <em>(Holland\u2019s case, </em>4 <em>Rep. </em>76.--. v- --, 2 Shower, 318, <em>Cade </em>v. <em>Hillary et al. Lulw. </em>1407, 1410. <em>The </em>King v. <em>Buggs, Skin. </em>428, 429.) In <em>The People </em>v. The <em>Utica Ins. Company, </em>(15 John. Rep. 363) in answer to an information in nature of a <em>quo warranto, </em>the defendants pleaded the act incorporating them as an insurance company, not as a private but a public act; and no exception was taken for this reason.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b674-7\">S. <em>A. Foot, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvP\">This is certainly a case of the first impression. There has been none, either in <em>England </em>or this country, where a bank has been charged under circumstances like the present. This Court are called upon to make a precedent, and I need not remark that it should be well considered. The single ground of complaint is, that the bank gave no notice to the endorser, by which the plaintiffs below sustained damage. The bank made an honest attempt to save the note, by employing an agent to give notice. Neither party are in moral default; and the case, therefore, presents a close contest, upon a legal question, which shall sustain the loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az9E\">It is said we are estopped to call upon this. Court tor its interference, because we did not interpose our objections in the Court below. We present them with the record, and the opinion of the Court. How does it appear that we did not move ip arrest of judgment ? This is not to he determined by the assertion of counsel. Can it be ascertained by the printed opinion of the Court <em>? </em>Suppose there should be no formal opinion, or the Court below should forbear to. notice what we did object there, must we be concluded ? Is it meant that this Court cannot notice objections which that Court were pleased to think unimportant, and therefore did not mention ? I see no other way, but to look at the record ; see what objections might have been made ; and consider them, at least, <em>prima facie, </em>as made. We are referred to <em>Colden </em>v. <em>Knickerbacker, </em>(2 <em>Cowen\u2019s Rep. </em>31.) What was that case <em>l </em>The defendant had allowed judgment to pass by default; the question came up on u record of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the default; and it was seen that he had not even placed himself in a condition to take the objections raised. The record must be the only test. The question can not be tried by affidavit. But if this be not so, and the Court should seek for the best lights they have, the opinion below, it does appear from; this, that the objections upon the case related not only to the evidence, but the pleadings. Mr. Justice <em>Woodworth, </em>who gave the opinion, felt himself constrained to lay the first and second counts out of view as not reaching the case ; and to make the whole depend upon the third count. What does this mean, unless the pleadings were drawn in question ? Substantially, they were as much in question as here. The whole declaration was before the Court, who restricted the case to the third count. With leave of this Court, however, I shall consider all the questions which might have been raised in the Court below, relying upon the rule which I first advanced as the correct one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b675-12\">It Vill not be denied that where one count is substantially defective, and the verdict is general, the judgment should be reversed. I would barely observe in relation to the first and second counts, that it is true, as contended by the other side, that the note should have been presented in a reasonable time ; and that this was matter of proof at the trial; but the declaration should have averred expressly, that after-wards, to wit, on such a day, <em>being within a reasonable time after the making or endorsement, </em>they were presented for payment, and notice of non-payment given. The counts neither contain this averment, nor set forth the circumstances to shew whether these steps were taken in a reasonable time or not. Omitting this, no- loss is shown, as a consequence of the default.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b675-13\">As to the third count, upon which the principal question arises, I shall not stop to review the cases, and draw the distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance, because I am sure it will be found that Mr. Justice <em>Woodworth </em>assumed the sensible ground in the Court below. In a word, nonfeasance is not doing; misfeasance is entering upon the undertaking, doing, but doing negligently. In the first case, a consideration is necessary; in the latter, not. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>first, the contract is merely honorary ; as to the second, if you will be kind and generous, and enter upon the act of kindness and generosity, you shall be holden to perform faithfully- If you merely say you will be so, it is a different thing. Woodworth, J. says, of this declaration, \u201c the third count is the only one on which the plaintiffs can rely ; and that is for a nonfeasance, which cannot be supported, unless founded on a valid consideration.?\u2019 (20 <em>John. Rep. </em>379.) To the same effect is the language of <em>Kent, </em>Ch. Justice, in <em>Thorn </em>v. <em>Deas, </em>(4 <em>John. Rep. </em>99.) \u201c But none of these cases,\u201d says he, \u201c nor, as far as I can discover, do any of the <em>dicta </em>of the judges in them, go so far as to say, that an assumpsit would lie for the non performance of a promise, without stating a consideration for the promise.\u201d <em>Woodworth, </em>J. also defines, and well defines, what shall constitute a consideration. It is either an injury to one party, or a benefit to the other; (20 <em>John. Rep. </em>380) that is, if the promisee be injured or the promissor benefitted. Here the single consideration is, thift the plaintiffs below would endorse and deliver over the note to the defendants below for collection. Was this such a prejudice to the holders, or benefit to the bank as would make a binding consideration, and render them liable for omitting performance ? Neither the counsel, nor the Court below, pretended that this alone was sufficient; but they put it on' the ground of expectation. It was the probable, or expected benefit to the bank, arising from the course of their business, the hope that it would result in the receipt of the \u2022 money due, and its temporary use; and the Judge enters into a disquisition upon the manner of doing business in banks, to shew that the expectation was a reasonable one. But it is essential to the validity of the declaration, that not only the promise, but the consideration should be distinctly and fully set forth there. Now,the consideration mentioned, and relied, on by the Court, does not appear in the third count at all. It is the act of endorsement and delivery ; not the expectation, which is averred. To conform to the opinion of the Court below, the, addition should have been made, \u201c and also in consideration of the use of the money to be r\u00e9ceived till withdrawn.\u201d The real consideration, upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Court below proceeded, is a perfect nonentity here. The Court below forgot this. They forgot that they could not rely upon a consideration not made the foundation of the judgment by pleading. It may be thought that the benefit to have been derived from the use of the money was not a distinct and independent fact necessary to be averred, but that it resulted from the allegation of endorsement and delivery. A moment\u2019s reflection will shew the contrary It may be the course of the bank to keep such monies separate from the general fund ; but whether they do so or not, is a question of fact. This may or may not be their practice. It depends on their mode of doing business; and the temporary use of the money may, or may not, result from its receipt. Again, it may be no benefit to the bank, even if it be intended that they would use it; or the benefit may not equal the risque of receiving, paying out, exchange, &amp;c. If not, it can constitute no legal consideration. Thus, the temporary use itself, and the benefit of that use, are both of them independent facts, which it is necessary to aver; and it would introduce a singular laxity in pleading, to say that mere matters of proof shall be the subject of judicial intendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-5\">But suppose we are mistaken in saying that the consideration is not sufficiently set forth; will an expectation of benefit, from performing the promise, constitute a consideration ? It appears to me that the case of <em>Elsee </em>v. <em>Gatward, </em>(5 <em>T. R. </em>143) furnishes a complete answer. It can not be said that, in that case, a benefit was not equally matter of expectation from a performance by the promissory yet all the Judges agreed that the promise was a <em>nudum pactum. </em>This case is stronger against the action than that. There the carpenter must certainly have been paid, if he had performed the services. Here, it is not pretended that the receipt of the money would have conferred any thing more than a contingent benefit. It might or might not have resulted in an advantage to the promissors. The benefit intended by the cases, which is to form a consideration, must be a benefit either actually received, or resting in a present, legal, vested right to it. Take the case, stated on the other side, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>of an attorney or counsel employed to manage a cause. The client tells his counsel, \u201c 1 can not pay you ; but the cause stands high on the calendar ; and if you argue it ably, you will probably be retained in several causes which stand lower upon the same calendar.\u201d Suppose the counsel to promise upon such a consideration ; would he be bound to perform ? The case of the attorney directly retained is different. Certain fees are allowed him by the law; on his accepting a retainer, his client incurs the legal liability to pay those fees, and he must, therefore, appear and defend or prosecute according to his engagement, or pay damages for the neglect. So of common carriers. They are allowed, by law, certain fees ; and it is enough, in complaining of nonfeasance, to allege that the defendant was a common carrier, or a common porter, and that the article was delivered by the promissee and accepted by the promissor. No other consideration is necessary, because, by the law, he may exact and enforce a reward. This is not so of the bank. It is not one of their legal duties to notify endorsers. This is the proper business of a notary publick. The bank can recover no reward, while the notary is entitled to his fees. The bank is like the carpenter, not the attorney, carrier or porter. Ld. <em>Kenyon </em>draws this very distinction in <em>Elsee </em>v. <em>Gatward.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b678-4\">The endorsement and delivery, so far from being an injury to the plaintiffs below, was a benefit ; and so intended by the parties. The note was payable at the bank. Suppose they. had. refused to receive it in any shape. The <em>Smedes </em>must haVe been at the expense of employing some other agent to attend at the bank during the whole third day of grace. The bank relieved them from this expense by engaging a notary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b678-5\">Again; the bank of <em>Utica, </em>not being connected by any statute, which is set forth, with the bank at <em>Canandaigua, </em>the former can not be liable, unless it has assented to the latter doing business in this way for the former. All this should have been averred. The connexion between the two banks should have been exhibited upon the pleadings, either from a statute or a contract of agency. The rule is inflexible, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>private statute must be set forth at large in pleading. <em>(Bac. Abr. statute, </em>(F). <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Whitaker, Doug. </em>97. <em>Dive </em>v. <em>Maningham, Plowd. 65. Read v. Potter, Cro. Jac. </em>139. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Union Turn.

Rep. 300. <em>Holland\u2019s case, </em>4 Rep. 76.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b679-6\">It is said, however, that all our objections to this declaration are cured by the verdict. The rule upon this head is, that if a matter essential in pleading be alleged in terms too general to stand the test of a demurrer, and a certain specific fact is necessary to support it, that fact will, after verdict, be intended to have been proved at the trial; but the rule goes no farther. The law will only imply means to substantiate a general allegation. This is what it means by a title defectively set forth. Here is a defective title. Nothing either general or special is alleged. The want of averring non-payment specifically may be cured hy- the rule, as to the effect of the verdict, but nothing more. The law knows nothing about individual rights, gifts, or franchises. If all the effects claimed from this verdict are to be recognized, it is certainly a most sovereign remedy. It will not only supply defects in a general allegation, but make a case out of whole cloth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b679-7\">It is said this act is public, because it concerns the currency of the state. But this is very indirectly and distantly. The charter is still a franchise. Suppose a statute gives a private banker certain privileges ; would the act be public, because it affects the currency ? There is a clause at the end of almost every bank charter, declaring it a public act. Would this be necessary, if these acts are, in their own nature, public ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b679-10\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AAY\">The principal question raised in this cause, is one which was discussed before the supreme court, and was there determined. It is, whether any sufficient consideration for the promise stated in the third count, appears from the declaration, or not. Upon this question, I concur with the supreme court in their opinion, that this count is good, considered as a count for nonfeasance. The reasons of the supreme court, in support of this opinion, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>just and conclusive. But the third count may also, I think, be as properly considered, a count for misfeasance. The truth of the transaction, even as it is stated in this count, was as much a mismanagement of the business undertaken, as it was a total neglect to perform it. The reception of the note by the bank for collection, may well be considered, as the first step in the execution of the contract, on their part, and ill this view, no other consideration was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The principal question relates to the 3d count;</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">which is good either as a count for a nonfeasance, or misfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The other objections are not admissible here, because not made in the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Upon the other objections made bj the plaintiffs in error, it might be sufficient to say, that they do not appear to have, been presented to the supreme court; and that by the decisions and practice of this court, such objections, can not be entertained here. I will however, state my opinion, upon some of the most important of those objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The corporation might contract, (keeping within ' the scope of its general powers) to do an act at anyplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">It seems, a law incorporating a bank is a public act. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">But the act authorizing an office of discount, &amp;c. is sufficiently set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">It is urged, that there is no public law, establishing an office of the bank of Utica, at Canandaigua ; and that the act of the tenth day of April 1815, authorizing this bank to establish an office at Canandaigua, is a private act, which is not set forth in the declaration. The act incorporating the, hank of Utica, is declared to be a public act; and the action is against this bank. This corporation may make any contract within the scope of its general powers, and may bind itself to do an act at Canandaigua, or any other place ; and wherever the engagement may be broken, the bank will be. equally liable. But I am not prepared to admit, that a law incorporating a bank, without declaring the law to be a public statute, is a private act, which must be recited in every suit against the corporation. These institutions are public, jn their nature and character; and their operations affect the whole community. But without pursuing this inquiry, I am. of opinion, that the act of the tenth day of April 1815, authorizing the bank of Utica to establish an office at Canandaigua, is sufficiently set forth in the declaration in this cause. The declaration states, that the bank of Utica, had pursuant to the act of the legislature, passed the tenth day of April 1815, established an office of discount and deposit, in Canandaigua. This allegation, though not a full recital of the, act, must be sufficient, at least, after a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Another objection is, that the note stated in the two first pounts of the declaration, appears as a note payable on demand ; and that it is not alleged, that any demand of payment from the makers, was made within a reasonable time. What was a reasonable time, would depend upon all the facts \u2019 r . pf the case, as they must have appeared at the trial. The decisive answer to this objection and to some others which have been urged, is, that they are made for the first time, after the trial of the cause and a verdict by a jury. All these objections may have been made, and all these defects if they are such, may have been supplied, by sufficient proofs at the trial. The established rules of our law authorize, and justice and public convenience, require, that the power of a verdict to cure foripal defects in pleading, should be liberally applied.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">It was not ne~ cessary to aver, demand of payment was made of the makers within a reasonable time. The notes being payable on demand, what is a reasonable time depended on all the facts, to be proved at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AMyS\">I am accordingly of opinion, that the judgment of the supreme court, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\"><em>The Court </em>being unanimously of this opinion, it was, thereupon, ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the judgment pf the Supreme Court be affirmed ; and that the defendants in error, according to the statute in such case made and provided, recover their double costs for their defence of the writ of error to be taxed; and also their damages for the de-: Jay and vexation, tobe assessed; which said damages shall be calculated at and after the rate of seven <em>per cent, </em>upon the amount of the judgment in the Supreme Court, so as aforesaid rendered, from the return of the <em>postea </em>in the Supreme Court, to the day of such assessment; and that the amount pf such damages and costs be inserted in the <em>remittitur </em>; and that the record be remitted, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"pAvqF\">The power of a verdict to cure formal defects in pleading should be liberally applied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
