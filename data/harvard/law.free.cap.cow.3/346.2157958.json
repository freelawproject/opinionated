He said, this did not depend upon the general statute of costs. Treble costs result from the stat-which inflicts treble, damages. This means treble the <em>gUpreme Court </em>costs. \u25a0 <em>Beekman </em>v. <em>Chalmers, </em>(1 <em>Cowen's Rep. </em>584) must have gone upon this ground. It denies any eff*ect to the general statute, <em>(sess. </em>41, <em>ch. </em>94, <em>s. </em>5) providing that in actions cognizable before a Justice, the plaintiff shall not recover costs, unless his damages exceed 50 dollars,</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQJ\">Another ground of the application is, that a Justice has ns \u201e 11 cognizance of this action. It is true that the statute gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>him, in terms, jurisdiction of trespass on lands ; but not of trespasses committed under this statute. Again, he has no power to try an action, where the title comes in question. In this action, is it not necessarily in question ? It has been holden at the Circuit that, in an action for a statute trespass, it is not enough for the plaintiff to shew himself in possession, as he might in trespass quare, &amp;c. at the common law. The penalty is for cutting timber, treble the value of which is to he recovered ; and possession must be foliowed by proof of title. A reversioner or remainder man might maintain this action, even against the tenant in possession. <em>(Vid. Wickham v. </em>Freeman, 12 <em>John.
