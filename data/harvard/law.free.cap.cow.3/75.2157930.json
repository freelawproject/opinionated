To their introduction in evidence, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, upon the ground that they were given since issue was joined ; and should have been pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance </em>at the last <em>August </em>term, or, at all events, at the (then) Circuit Court before the trial of the cause ; and it was agreed by the counsel that issue was joined on the 4ZA <em>June, </em>1823. The consent rule was in the usual form. It was also objected that the deeds were void, being in violation of the 1st section of the act <em>to </em>prevent and punish champerty and maintenance ; and also because they were not given within a reasonable time after the sale. The Judge rejected the deeds on the ground that they should have been pleaded <em>puis darrein </em>continuance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-4\">A motion was now made for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-5\"><em>E.

At any rate, it is confined to the case of an alien enemy- But if otherwise, the Sheriff\u2019s deeds were not hew matter within the rule which requires such matter to be interposed by plea. This Court have often decided that a Sheriff\u2019s deed relates back to the time of the sale, although executed afterwards. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Dickenson, </em>15 <em>John. </em>309.) The delay is the fault of the officer ; and should hot prejudice the purchaser. Indeed it is a general rule that a conveyance executed in pursuance of a previous contract relates back to the time of the contract. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>1 <em>John. Cas. </em>81. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Raymond, id. </em>85, <em>n. (a) Johnson </em>v. <em>Stagg, </em>2 <em>John.

Paige, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqh\">The rule is peremptory, that where matter of defence arises after i^sue joined, it must be pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance. </em>This must be done the first opportunity,and before a term intervenes, <em>(Bull. N. P. </em>309. 1 <em>Selm. </em>N. <em>P. </em>147. 1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>635, 532. <em>Tidd, </em>773. 5 <em>Bac. Abr. 477, 6th ed. 3 Bl.Com.317. Jackson v. M'Connell, </em>II <em>John. </em>424.) If the matter of defence arise in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>termediate the term and the next Circuit, it must be' pleaded at the Circuit, (o prevent a trial. (13 <em>John. </em>157. 3 <em>Caines\u2019 </em>Rep. 173. <em>Tidd, </em>773. 2 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>677, n. 2 Dunl. 622.) These rules extend to actions of ejectment. (Jac<em>kson </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>7 John. 194. <em>Jackson v. Demont, </em>9 John. 55, per Kent. Ch. J. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>M\u2019Conncll, </em>11 <em>John. </em>424. per <em>Spencer, J. Jackson </em>v. Bell, 19 <em>John. </em>168.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-9\">In this case, before issue joined, the defendant bad no title. It was acquired by the deed's only. Without this, (he levy, sale and return, even if accompanied with payment of- the money, carried no title. They did not divest the estate of the deblor. <em>(Jackson </em>v. Catlin, 2 <em>John. Rep. </em>248. 8 <em>John. </em>520. S. <em>C. affirmed on error. Simonds v. Catlin, </em>2 <em>Caines' Rep. </em>61.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-10\">The doctrine of relation takes place only where it becomes necessary for (he preservation of the estate, or to promote the ends of justice ; as to avoid ihe effect of an adverse possession, intermediate the conclusion of the contract, and (he giving of the deed. (1 <em>John. </em>Cas. 85 ) or to render an intermediate sale by the grantee valid, <em>(id. </em>81. 2 <em>John. Rep. </em>510.) or to enable a grantee to susiain an action of trespass for cutting-timber after the contract but before the deed, (12 John. 140) or to prevent a purchaser at a sherifps sale being foreclosed from contesting the validity of a mortgage in an action of ejectment at law, a bill of foreclosure having been filed in Chancery before the execution of the sheriff\u2019s deed, but subsequent to the sale. (15 <em>John. </em>309.) The general rule is otherwise. The deed does not, if there he no special circumstances to require it. relate to the time of the contract, (Doe v. Telling 2 <em>East, </em>256.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-11\">But the deed was void within the statute of champerty and maintenance, (1 <em>R. L. </em>172.) being a purchase of lands pending the suit, (1 <em>Hawk. P.C. ch. </em>84, <em>s. </em>9. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Ketchum, </em>8 <em>John. </em>479. <em>Same v. Demont, </em>9 <em>id. </em>55.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-12\">Again ; the deed should have been executed within a reasonable time- Is it competent to wait several years ? Can the deed be executed at any distance of time ? The delay must not be unreasonable. <em>(Catlin </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>8 <em>John. </em>552, <em>per Lansing, Chancellor.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The doctrine of relation is held only as between the parties to the grant. It is never adopted vhen th.rd persons, not names or privies, will be prejudiced. (12 <em>John. </em>140. 4 <em>id. </em>234. 3 <em>Caines\u2019 Rep. </em>263. <em>Jac L. D. Relation.)</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Curia,</p>\n<author id=\"A-bN\"><em>per </em>Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlR\">The principal question in the case is, whether a .Sheriff\u2019s deed, executed after issue joined in the cause, the sale having been made before the commencement of the suit, can be given in evidence by the defendant under the general issue, or should be pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">The declaration'was returnable <em>May </em>term, 1823. The consent rule bore date the <em>28th </em>of <em>May, </em>and issue was joined the 4&lt;/i of <em>Jane </em>in the same year. The Sheriff\u2019s sale of the premises in question was made on the <em>2d </em>of <em>October, </em>1818, but the deeds which were offered in evidence, and which were made in pursuance of that sale, were dated the <em>12th </em>of' <em>August, </em>1823.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">That the general rule, requiring matter of defence which has arisen after issue joined, to be pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>is applicable to this as well as other actions, is abimdanily settled in this Court. <em>(Jackson, ex dem. Colden. </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>7 <em>John. </em>194. <em>Jackson v. Demont, </em>9 <em>John. </em>60. <em>per Kent, Ch. J. Jackson </em>v. <em>M\u2019Connell, 11 John. </em>424. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>19 <em>John. </em>168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">But it is contended on the part of the defendant that the deeds relate back to the day of sale by the Sheriff; and in judgment of law are considered as having been then given. The lessors of the plaintiff derived their title under the will of <em>Alexander M\u2019Michael\u25a0; </em>and the Sheriff\u2019s sale was under judgments obtained against <em>M\u2019Michael </em>in his lifetime. When the defendant entered into possession does not appear ; but it is to be presumed that he entered under the title acquired by him at the Sheriff\u2019s sale. The lessors of the plaintiff stand in the same relation to the defendant that <em>Alexander M\u2019Michael </em>would, had he been living and made a lessor, This, the efore, is a case to which the doctrine of relation is peculiarly applicable, \u00a1here being no strangers or (bird persons, whose interest can be affected by iff That doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>trine is this : <em>Where there are divers acts concurrent to make a conveyance, estate or other thing, the original act shall be preferred </em>; <em>and to this the other act shall have relation (Vin. Ab. Tit. Relation, </em>290, <em>Harper </em>v. <em>The Bailiffs of Der</em>by) This principle has been repeatedly recognized. In <em>Jackson, ex dem. Loan Officers of Rensselaer, </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>(1 John. <em>Cas. </em>81,) it was held \u201c that a deed executed in pursuance of a previous contract for the same premises, is good by relation, from the time of makipg the contract, so as to render valid every intermediate sale or disposition of the land by the grantees. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Raymond, id. </em>85, <em>note. Case </em>v. <em>De </em>Goes, 3 <em>Caines\u2019 Rep. </em>262, <em>per Thompson, J. Jackson </em>v. <em>Bard, </em>4 John. 234.) <em>In Heath v. Ross, </em>(12 <em>John. </em>140) a patent for land, dated the <em>4th </em>of <em>December, </em>but which did not pass the great seal until the <em>28th, </em>was held to relate back as between the parties, so as to vest the title in <em>the patentee </em>from the <em>date.Jackson, ex dem. Noah, v. Dickenson &amp; Thompson, </em>(15 <em>John. </em>309) was the case of a Sheriff\u2019s sale made on the 1st of <em>March, </em>and the deed not delivered until the <em>9th. </em>On the <em>10th </em>of the same month, a mortgagee of the same land filed a bill of foreclosure, without making the purchaser at the Sheriff\u2019s sale a party. It was held that the deed related back to the time of the sale ; that the purchaser\u2019s title was acquired previous to the filing of the bill, and he was not precluded from contesting the validity of the mortgage in an action of ejectment. The Court say <em>the subsequent delivery of the deed, being mere matter of form, must have relation lack to the time of purchase at the Sheriff\u2019s sale.\u201d (Johnson </em>v. <em>Stagg, </em>2 <em>John. Rep. </em>520,per <em>Kent, Ch. J. S. </em>P.)</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9M\">But the lapse of time between the sale a'nd the giving of the deeds is objected to their validity, or, at all events, to their relation back to the time of.sale; and the observations of Chancellor <em>Lansing </em>in <em>Catlin </em>v <em>Jackson in error, </em>(8 <em>John. Rep. </em>552-3)'are supposed to countenance the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"AWS\">But in that case, the purchaser at the Sheriff\u2019s sale had never paid his bid; and the deed was delivered to a third person as an escrow to take effect, when the consideration money should be paid, without any time being limited for the purpose. The remarks of the Chancellor are applicable to that; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>state of facts. But in this case the consideration money was paid by the purchaser. He had done every thing to entitle him to a deed. The money must be presumed to have been paid over by the Sheriff to the plaintiff in the execution, in satisfaction of the d.ebt, and, of course, for the benefit of the estate of <em>A. M* Michael, </em>whom the lessors of the plaintiff represent. The essential and important part of the Sheri\u00ed\u00ed\u2019s duty had then been performed; and nothing remained to be done but <em>\u00bfhe formal act of delivering the </em>deed\u2014the purchaser having been in possession, as we have right to presume, from the day of the sale, The lapse of time, under such circumstances, and between these parties, can afford no objection either to the validity of the deed or to its relation back to the time of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">But admitting that by relation it is to be considered as having been given at the time of the sale, does that dispense with the necessity of pleading the fact of delivery, according to its truth, <em>puis darrein continuance ? </em>I am of opinion that it does. The defence relied on was the title acquired under the Sheriff\u2019s sale. When did that title vest in the defendant ? is the point of enquiry, If before the commencement of the suit, it was available under the general issue. If after issue joined, it should have been pleaded <em>puis darrien continuance ; </em>and the date or time of delivery of one of the evidences of the title, is perfectly immaterial, The legal effect and operation of such delivery <em>is the matter of defence, </em>and not the instrument itself. The legal effect of the delivery, then, in this case, having been to vest the title in the defendant by relation, as of the <em>2d October, </em>1818, the matter of defence did not arise subsequent to the joining of the issue, and need not be pleaded <em>puis darrien continuance. I </em>am of opinion, therefore, that the Judge erred in rejecting the Sheriff\u2019s deeds on that ground $ and that a new trial must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">New trial granted,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
