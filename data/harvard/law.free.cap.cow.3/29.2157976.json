He said he was aware that this charge had been allowed under the clause in the act of <em>April b, </em>1813, (l <em>R. L. 517, s. </em>4) which declares that, on taxation of cosls upon a reference, \u201c a reasonab!e allowance shall be made to the prevailing party, for such services and expenses as may accrue upon, or attend the reference of the cause.\u201d With deference, he considered the practice incorrect. The fee bill was passed <em>April Oth. </em>of the samfe year, (2 <em>R. L. </em>3) fixing the allowance to attorneys, counsel, witnesses, fee. and if the former act contemplated \u00e1n extra allowance, it was repealed by the latter. But the statute authorizing this <em>reasonable allowance, </em>may be satisfied, entirely independent of attorney and counsel fees. It means no more than that the allowance shall be made for those expenses not etnbraced by the fee hill, owing to the peculiar course of proceeding ; such as the expenses of the referees, as house-room, board, fee. In all other respects the quantum should be graduated by the fee bill. If you give an extra allowance <em>to </em>counsel, there is nothing to prevent your enlarging the fees of the attorney, witnesses, the magistrate forswearing the referees, fee. This may certainly be donfc upon the same principle.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-13\"><em>W. H.
