C. </em>On referring the costs for taxalion, as there mentioned, <em>(page </em>604) Judge <em>Irving </em>refused to tax a new record of judgment upon the return of the writ of inquiry, and the services about entering and perfecting a new judgment; but he allowed the appropriate services for . . , , . . , , r \u201e . \u201e , continuing down the original record remitted trom the Court of Errors, with a history of the proceedings.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A7U\">quiry under ttie 0-3) judgment on^i-ov/and. the record being remitted, a new judgment i-eocr'd is not the proceedings may be continued at the foot of the</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A8XM\">.ei to be done, aratebe\u00b0paper\u00a1 an(1 attached. to record, as to as^ignm* breaches, <em>foties quo* </em>jy\u201e^,alte bond to perform covenants, or court, \u201en motion, to be continued\u2019&amp;c'</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AGPt\">\n<em>A. Burr,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmR\">moved for a re-taxation, on this ground, among ' ' &lt; i r \u00a9thers. He said the statute, (1 R. L. 144, <em>s. </em>3) speaks ot <em>inquiry, </em>judgment, and award of execution, for <em>damages, </em>with <em>costs of suit. </em>If no rule for judgment, and no record, there is no authority to \u201c award execution for the damages and costs of suit.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Au9B\">v. <em>H.

It was sufficient to continue tb\u00e9 proceedings upon the old one.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AFyY\">\n<em>Burr,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APX\">said the statute evidently contemplated a new judgment, independent of, and distinct from the first, and, therefore, authorized a new record. This might as well be denied of a <em>scire facias, </em>or debt on judgment. The original record, when filed, is beyond the control of the attorney. It can be altered by the Clerk, only, under the direction of &lt;he Court. The new judgment should be docketed. There is no authority for this, unless there be a new record signed and filed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"At9V\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AZ6n\">A new record was unnecessary. The proceeding by inquiry might have been continued upon the record remitted from the Court of Errors ; and Woodworth, J said this did not mean taking the record from the Clerk, and continuing the history upon that. All that is necessary isa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>to make the proper suggestion, and give a history of the subsequent proceedings upon separate paper, and attach this to the original roll, as is done when you assign new breaches, <em>toties quoties, </em>on the record of judgment upon a bond for the performance of covenants. And Sutherland, J. said, that if it were otherwise, that would be ho argument in favour of a new record ; for this Court, on application, would grant leave, of course, to continue the original record in the hands of the Clerk, provided it were necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
