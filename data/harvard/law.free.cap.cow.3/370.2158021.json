He read the defendant\u2019s affidavit, stating that the first notice was interposed in good faith, and/, , r \u00b0 7 under the advice of counsel; that when it was delivered, *ie ver*ty believed he should be able to prove the material facts stated in it; that <em>ffl. </em>JV. Palmer, formerly of <em>Poughkeepsie, </em>was the witness upon whom he placed the principal reliance for this purpose; but that he had left the state, with his family, without the defendant\u2019s knowledge ; and, as he was informed by the witness\u2019 friends, had gone to reside in some part of <em>South America, </em>and would not return to this country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-12\">He supposed the gentleman opposed to him, (Mr. <em>J. </em>Tall-. <em>madge) </em>would take the same ground here as he did in <em>Clinton </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>(3 <em>John.

It did not, in that case, as in this, appear that the notice was given in <em>good faith ; </em>which is the reason assigned by the Court, for refusing, the rule.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-13\"><em>J.

The defendant has followed up his slander by a gross libel upon the record, and which the plaintiff is entitled to have falsified in the same way. This must be either by the defendant\u2019s- affidavit of its falsity, or the verdict of a jury, giving those aggravated damages which such a notice called for.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b367-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Atg\">were clear with the counsel for the plaintiff, , . , . , , . . j mat, for these reasons, the motion must be denied; and Woodworth, J. said, that this application was even a still farther aggravation of the slander; for the defendant says, in his affidavit, \u201c the charge which 1 advanced against the plaintiff is true; but by reason of <em>Palmer's </em>absence, alone, I am, unfortunately, not able to prove it.,?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
