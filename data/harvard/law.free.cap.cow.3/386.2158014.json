The 3d count stated the value of the goods at $350, and demanded that sum; the sums in the ^ree counts making $1000. Plea the general issue. Verdiet for the plaintiff at the <em>Oneida </em>Circuit, <em>December 26th, </em>1823. The verdict was sealed, and in these words: \u201cIn ^6 above cause we find for the plaintiff.\u201d The Circuit 1 Judge certified that the amount to be recovered Was not contesteJ on the trial ; but the amount claimed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was $391,23, being the amount which the defendant confessed he gave for the property in question. Upon this verdict a judgment was perfected in March, \u201e r . . , <em>J </em>\u00b0 . <em>1 . </em>1824, for $391,23, with a <em>remit Mur </em>of $608,77, of which the defendant\u2019s attorney was not informed till after last <em>May </em>term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOa\">At the last <em>August </em>term, a motion was made to set aside ^ie ver(hct f\u00b0r irregularity, because all the jury were not pres\u00bb ent when the verdict was delivered ; but the Court were of opinion, that, admitting the verdict to be irregular for that reason, the motion came too late. The party should have moved at the next term after the verdict; A motion was also made at the last <em>August </em>term to set aside the judgment, on the ground that it was entered upon a verdict void on its face.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-24\"><em>G.

He cited to this point, <em>Bac. </em>Ab. <em>verdict, </em>(M) <em>pl. </em>1. <em>(Q) pl. </em>1. (Z) <em>pl. 3. </em>3 <em>Salk. </em>372, 374. <em>Brockway </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>2 <em>John.

It was in the usual form, and would, in strictness, perhaps, have warranted an entry upon <em>the. postea </em>of a finding for the whole sum claimed of $1000 ; but as it xvas doubtless the intention of the jury to find the amount proved, we have remitted all except this. The verdict may be thus amended either by the Judge\u2019s minutes, or by a <em>remittitur, </em>as was done here. (2 <em>Archb. Pr. </em>241, 242. 1 <em>Wils. </em>33.) Verdicts should be construed favorably, <em>(Burr. </em>699, 700. 2 <em>Salk. </em>664,) and, it appearing that no injustice has been done, is a reason against setting a verdict aside. <em>(Burr. </em>1255-6. <em>Dunl. Pr. </em>679, <em>and cases there cited.)</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AyyQ\">It is an answer to this application, that the verdict is not void, so as to make the judgment irregular. Without saying whether the verdict be voidable or not, we are clear that the defendant cannot try that question in this form. The verdict appears upon the record, and the party must be put to his writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
