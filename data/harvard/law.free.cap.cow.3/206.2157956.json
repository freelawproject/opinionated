The cause came on to he tried in <em>February </em>term, 1822, when the plaintiff called one <em>White </em>as a witness, who testified that he went, at the request 0f <em>Harvey, </em>to the office of <em>Brewer, </em>who was a Justice of the Peace, in order to become bail for <em>Harvey, </em>to procure certain attachments against <em>Adkins, </em>which <em>Huri\u00edey </em>contemplated taking out; that the witness, in conjunction with <em>Harrey, </em>signed, sealed and delivered printed blank bond's for that pUrp0se <em>\u25a0 </em>that one of them was either partially or totally filled up before its execution ; that three others were signed, geaje(j an(j executed' in blank ; (these were then produced, and appeared still to be blanks) that the witness was In a hurry, as well as Harvey; that the witness delivered the bon\u00bfs to <em>Brewer, </em>the Justice, with directions to fill them up : <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>that <em>Brewer </em>was then filling up an attachment. The counsel for the defendant, on notice, produced but one attach\" ment. The counsel for the plaintiff then gave in evidence three several executions, issued upon three several judgments, by <em>Brewer </em>against <em>Adkins, </em>in favour of <em>Harvey, </em>and also proved that the property in question was.sold by one <em>Holden, </em>a constable, by virtue of an execution in favour of one <em>Aaron Bigalom, </em>and seven executions in favour of <em>Selak Havens, </em>all older than <em>Harvey\u2019s, </em>as well as by virtue of the several executions issued by <em>Brewer; </em>that about <em>$ </em>102 of the money raised by the sale, was paid to <em>Harvey, </em>upon his executions, which were issued on judgments rendered upon attachments where no bonds had been filled up, or executed, otherwise than as above stated.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b202-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>In trespass against a justice for issuingattachments and executions, &amp;e which were void, it appeared that the constable, who levied and sold under these, had several other executions, older than the void ones, upon which he levied and sold at the same time, and the sale Was under all the executions indiscriminately; but ihe void executions, as well as the others, were satisfied by the sale, and the money paid to the plaintiff; <em>held, </em>that trespass lay against the justice and party.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b202-14\">When the justice wants jurisdiction, he is liable as a trespasser : otherwise, where he has jurisdiction, and errs in the exercise of it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b202-15\">In trespass against an officer, for issuing process, by virtue of which the plaintiff\u2019s goods are taken, to justify the taking, the officer must shew affirmatively, on his part, that he bad jurisdiction; especially where, from the plaintiff\u2019s proof, there is reason to presume that \"the proper steps were not taken to confer jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The counsel for the defendant thereupon moved for a nonsuit, which was opposed, on the ground that there was no evidence of any proof of the absence or concealment of the plaintiff having been taken at the time the attachments issued ; and that no bonds were taken pursuant to the 23d section of the 25 dollar act; that the defendants were, therefore, trespassers : but the motion was granted by the Court below, on the ground that the judgments were voidable only ; and that, inasmuch as it appeared that the constable\u2019s sale was made on a variety of other executions, as well as <em>Harvey\u2019s, </em>without discrimination, trespass would not lie.

The action should have been case. The proceeding is like taking an excessive distress, for which trespass will not die. A party having two authorities may justify under one, though the other be void, <em>(Crother </em>v. <em>Ramsbottom, </em>7 <em>T. R. </em>654, <em>per Lawrence, J. Grenville </em>v. <em>The College of Physicians, </em>(12 <em>Mod. </em>386, <em>per. Holt, Ch.

Korts, 10. <em>John. Rep. </em>167.) So, if without oath.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AFQ\">\n<em>Curia,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"Afzx\">per Savage, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2F\">The defendants are called on <em>directly, </em>not <em>collaterally, </em>to shew why they have undertaken to dispose of the plaintiff\u2019s property. They must then show a lawful authority. A power to act is the first thing to be shewn by a Court of limited and special jurisdiction. To give the Justice jurisdiction, it must appear that the person against whose property an attachment is sought, is either concealed within the county, with the intent mentioned in the act, or has departed, or is about to depart the county, with the like intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In <em>Van Steenburgh </em>v. <em>Korts, </em>(10 <em>John. </em>169) the Court seem to consider the proof of this necessary to confer jurisdiction ; and <em>Spencer, </em>J. takes the distinction between proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>before a Court which is to <em>give </em>it jurisdiction, and before a Court that already <em>has </em>jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In <em>Vosburgh </em>v. Welch, (11 <em>John. </em>175) the Court say, the Justice must be considered as having issued the attachment without any proof whatever of the departure or concealment required by the act; and, of course, without authority. The rule as to the Justice\u2019s liability, is, that when he has no jurisdiction whatever, and undertakes to act, his acts are <em>coram non </em>judice, and void\u2014equally so \u00e1s if he was not a Justice. If he has jurisdiction, but errs in exercising it, then bis acts are not void, but voidable only. In the former case he is personally liable\u2014in the latter not. (17 <em>John. </em>146. 2 <em>John. Cas. </em>27. 14 <em>John. </em>246. 19 <em>John. </em>39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">I do not consider this case as coming within the rule that an officer is presumed to have done an act, the omission of which would render him liable for negligence. There is presumptive proof, at least, that no evidence was taken by the Justice, and positive proof that no security was taken, except in one cause out of four. The sale by the constable, after the other executions were satisfied, could not be justified, except upon the authority of these executions; and as they were void, there was no authority whatever: all persons concerned were trespassers.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The judgment of the Court below must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
