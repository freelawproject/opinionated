But the practice is well settled, upon the facts before us, that, in a case like this, where money may be properly paid into Court, the sum paid in must be considered as stricken out of the declaration. It is a defence, <em>pro </em>tanto, and unless the plaintiff proves a sum beyond what is paid, there should be a verdict for the defendant. We deny this motion, with costs; but as the form of bringing it forward has been misapprehended, we give the defendants ten days, within which to make a case, and bring the question properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
