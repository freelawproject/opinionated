He did this, he said, principally with a view to the attorney\u2019s fee on argument, which here amounted to a large sum, as the cause had been noticed for argument a great number of times, and an attorney\u2019s fee charged for each term. He insisted, that the attorney would be entitled to but one fee on argument, and this for the term at which the cause was, in fact, argued. The phrase providing for the allowance of this fee, differs from the one which allows a fee to counsel. The latter is, <em>attending prepared for argument\u2014the </em>former is, arguing, &amp;c.

It </em>is reasonable that this fee should be allowed for each term at which the cause is noticed for argument. The attorney attends, whether he succeed in reaching the cause on the calendar or not. The other items are correct, with the exception of that for serving writ of possession, which must he \u2018educed to $1,25, and motion and rule for argument, which must be stricken out. The only objection against the <em>fi.fa. </em>for costs is, that it might have been incorporated into the writ of possession. This is true, but the party may also elect to proceed with it separately. Though the 4 folios are drawn for the <em>nisi prius </em>record, yet it is necessary to make another draft when the judgment roll comes to be framed. It is no objection that a similar charge was allowed in the <em>nisi prius </em>record. They are distinct instruments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-13\"><em>Samson. </em>The $3,75 were taxed by anticipation, on the ground that aid might be necessary in executing the writ of possession. It was thought that this should be placed at its highest, and a deduction made in the event of execution being executed in the ordinary way.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b21-14\">Savage, Ch.
