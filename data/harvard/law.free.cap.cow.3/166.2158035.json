The bay mare above mentioned is to be delivered to <em>Malcom M\u2019Naughton, </em>on demand, but she is intended to remain in said <em>Dryer\u2019s </em>use for the present, and he is to pay into <em>Elihu Scofield\u2019s </em>hands, for said <em>Hopkins, </em>in good judgments or securities, or to said <em>M\u2019 Jfaughlon\u2019s </em>hands in grain,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the amount of fifty dollars, within one month, and on contipu'nS his payments in proportion, the mare is intended to remain with him. <em>Jesse </em>Dryer.\u201d That, in the month of <em>April, </em>1817, a book account commenced between the plaintiff and <em>Dryer </em>; that settlements were made at different times between them, beside those already mentioned in writing ; and that, at the time of the several settlements, including the above written ones, <em>Dryer </em>was justly indebted to the plaintiff to the amount of the several sums in the instruments in writing mentioned ; that, from the time the plaintiff\u2019s account commenced, <em>Dryer </em>continued considerably indebted to him, and is now justly indebted to him to the amount of more than $100; that in <em>September, </em>1817, <em>Dryer </em>rented of the plaintiff a tavern stand and small farm, at $120 <em>per annum, </em>and continued therein (but subsequently at reduced rents) till the time the mare in question was sold by direction of the defendant, as hereinafter mentioned 5 that a large part of the plaintiff\u2019s account was for rent, and that, at the time of the sale of the mare by the defendant, more than one year\u2019s rent was due from <em>Dryer </em>to the plaintiff. That in the month of <em>November, </em>1817, an account commenced between <em>Dryer </em>and the defendant, and in <em>March, </em>1820, a considerable' balance being due the defendant, he commenced an action against <em>Dryer, </em>in the Court of Common Pleas of the county of <em>Genesee, </em>and in <em>September </em>term thereafter recovered ajudgment against <em>Dryer, </em>in that Court, for $91,58, and on the <em>4th </em>day of <em>January, </em>1821, the defendant caused execution to be issu-, ed oil his judgment, and delivered to the Sheriff of <em>Genesee ; </em>that the defendant directed the Sheriff to levy on the mare in question, by virtue of his execution, if possible, while the mare was off the premises rented by <em>Dryer </em>of the plaintiff; that, pursuant to such directions, the Sheriff did levy and seize upon the mare, while off the premises, but in the possession of said <em>Dryir, </em>and sold the same at publiclc auction or vendue, in the month of <em>February, </em>1821, at which sale the defendant became the purchaser, and took and led away the mare, and that no rent was tendered or offered to be paid to the plaintiff; that before the sale, the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the mare, that <em>Dryer </em>had been a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>stable, and had considerable unsettled business, and the special object of leaving the mare in his possession was, (as he had no other horse) to close such business, by which means, as he stated at the time, he hoped to make his payments ; that applications were afterwards made to <em>Dryer </em>to sell the mare, (being a well known animal, and considered valuable) to which he always, after the pledge, answered, that she was not his, and that the plaintiff had a claim on her, or owned her, and the fact of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was publickly known ; that the appraisal by <em>Curtiss </em>was meant to be a fair one, according to his best judgment; that <em>Curtiss, </em>and also <em>M\u2019Jfaughton, </em>(being the only persons who were present at, and conversant with the transaction between the plaintiff and <em>Dryer) </em>both supposed that no secrecy or concealment was intended, and never themselves had the least reserve upon the subject, dr knew of any ; that, at the time the bill of sale was executed, <em>Dryer </em>was indebted to the plaintiff, and to the defendant and to others, but no judgment or execution existed against him, unless for some trivial amount, till subsequently to the assignment; that the mare remained in <em>Dryer\u2019s </em>possession from the time when the instrument in writing first above mentioned was executed, till the seizure by the Sheriff; that part of the articles mentioned in the appraisal herein before mentioned, had, from time to time, been delivered and credited to <em>Dryer </em>in account, but that <em>Dryer </em>made no payment after the settlement of the 1st of <em>January, </em>1821, except the sum of $1,50, till the time of sale. And if, &amp;c. then the jurors say, &amp;c. and then they assess the damages of the plaintiff, &amp;c. to $62,62, &amp;c. And hereupon, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-4\">Judgment was for the plaintiff below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-5\"><em>Talcott, </em>(Attorney General) for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3q\">submitted the following written points or propositions to the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">1. The first bill of sale does not <em>shew on its face </em>that the possession of the horse should be in the vendor; and, therefore, <em>it is fraudulent in law </em>against creditors. Whether there was fraud, <em>in fact, </em>is not material.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>2. This bill of sale is not a mortgage. There wa s <em>no time' </em>for the payment of the debt secured by it\u2014no means pointed out of obtaining payment out of the property. It was an <em>everlasting </em>pledge, without delivery of .the thing pledged,. and, therefore, void. If a creditor can keep other creditors at bay, by such a contrivance, for <em>one, </em>day, he may for ten years.' Leaving the horse in the debtor\u2019s possession was, therefore, fraudulent against creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">3. Payment of the debt was not the <em>creditor\u2019s object </em>in taking the bill of sale. <em>It was </em>to prevent other creditors from taking the property. The memorandum at the foot of the bill of sale, dated in January, 18^1, was an attempt, <em>four days </em>before the levy, to account for the possession of the property continuing in the <em>vendor, </em>and thus change.the nature <em>of </em>the sale. The excuse for leaving the horse in the vendor\u2019s possession, was not sufficient. A year and half is an unreasonable time to settle his accounts as constable, &amp;c. Both plaintiff and defendant were creditors, and the one obtaining the possession ought to have the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\">4. The defendant\u2019s knowing of the plaintiff\u2019s claim cannot affect the case ; for if the sale <em>was void, </em>as against him,, his knolwledge of such void claim is nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-8\"><em>b. </em>As landlord, the defendant in error might have distrained, if any rent was due, and the property having been seized off the premises, he cannot maintain trover for it. Besides, it does not appear that the rent due was that of the last preceding year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-9\">6. At the time of the taking and sale, the defendant in error had no right of possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abt\">He added, that in examining these propositions, it becomes necessary to look back to the statute of <em>Elizabeth.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Up-<em>J . </em>1 on the question, whether leaving property in the hands of the vendor is fraudulent as to creditors, a variety of principles are scattered through the books. Sometimes we are told the Court are to take the question into their own hands\u2014sometimes that it is to be left to the jury\u2014sometimes that such a possession is fraud, per se\u2014sometimes that it is so, <em>prima facie, </em>only\u2014sometimes that possession is not fraudulent where the sale is conditional\u2014sometimes that it is so, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>sale be absolute or conditional. I take this to be the general principle, <em>that the whole depends upon the intention of the parties. </em>That intention in this, as in all other cases, is sometimes to be found by the jury, and sometimes it is matter of law, referrible to the Court, and to be presumed not only with, but even against evidence# Thus, Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in <em>Worseley </em>v. <em>De Mattos </em>:<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> \u201c Whether a transaction be fair or fraudulent, is often a question of law : it is tbe <em>judgment of law, </em>upon facts and intents.\u201d <em>Intent </em>is either <em>in fact </em>or <em>in law. </em>There are a variety of circumstances from which the law will infer an intent: in others it must be found by a jury, and is then a question of fact. An inference of law is not to be resisted ; and this proposition is well illustrated by the criminal code. One sends a child to a drawer, who takes thence a poisoned apple, eats it, and is killed. It is a question of fact for the jury, whether the child was sent on purpose. If he was, they should find the'sender guilty of murder. On the other hand, if one gives a poisoned apple to <em>A, </em>with intent to murder <em>A </em>by his eating, and it should accidentally come to the hands of the child, and the donor should even interfere to prevent the child\u2019s eating it, yet the child being killed by eating the poisoned apple, the donor is guilty of murder; for the law will infer an intention to kill the child,eren against the fact. It is the same thing as to fraud. Where' it depends on the actual intent, it is for the jury : if upon the constructive intent, the whole is a matter of legal inference for the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-9\">We shall doubtless be told that this is the case\u2019 of a <em>mere mortgage, </em>and that, therefore, <em>possession need not follow. </em>This position is not maintainable ; and the only case which' looks that way is <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Paxton.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The acknowledged distinction between a mortgage of goods and a pledge, will', be found in I <em>Powell on Mortgages, 3, </em>4, and in the <em>2d chapter, p. </em>29, the subject is taken up, and almost the whole of that chapter is devoted to the inquiry, in what cases possession of the mortgagor and vendor is fraudulent as- to creditors and purchasers ; and mortgages and absolute sales are placed by him on the same footing, in which he is abundantly sustained by the cases which he cites. He begins the chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ter by saying, that \u201cA mortgage being a contract of sale \u00e9x\u00e9<em>cuted, with </em>power to redeem, must 'have all the properties and qualities incidentaRte-the validity of an absolute disposition.\u201d He then proceeds directly to apply the statute of <em>Elizabeth to </em>fraudulent mortgages of chattels ; and considers the mortgagor, who continues in full possession, as within its purview. W\u00e9 do not deny the doctrine, that when there is such a conditional sale, that possession in the vendor is consistent with <em>it, </em>the possession is no evidence of fraud; but a mortgage is not that case. There the property passes presently, defeasible by condition subsequent; but it is only where the condition is precedent, that the vendor\u2019s possession may be said to be consistent with the deed. The bill of sal\u00e9 should be such as to vest a future interest; as where it is <em>to </em>become absolute on the payment of a sum of money at another day. What the Court say in <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Paxton, </em>is, that \u201c delivery always accompanies a pledge, but a mortgage of goods is <em>often valid </em>without delivery.\u201d These words, <em>often valid, </em>ar\u00e9 very cautious and qualified. They are no more than may be said of an absolute sale without change of possession, which, in common with a mortgage, may, under peculiar circumstances, <em>often be valid. Barrow </em>v. <em>Paxton </em>presented one of those circumstances. The bill of sale retained a right of distress. The goods continued on the demised premises, and the rights of creditors were not at all' in question. The defendant was a purchaser, with full notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim\u2014a mere fraudulent volunteer, who had no right to protection. The remark of the Court, that a mortgage may be <em>often valid, </em>unaccompanied with delivery, is sustained by various other acknowledged exceptions to be found in the <em>2d chapter </em>of <em>Powell, </em>before quoted. Why should there be any distinction between an absolute sale and a mortgage ? Why is it that continuance of possession in the vendor is holden fraudulent ? Because it gives him credit. Where is the difference in fact, whether the vendor has given a mortgage or bill of sale ? How much better off is the creditor on account of the proviso in the bill \u2022 of sale, than if he had been deprived of the property without a proviso ? The principle contended for on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>side, leads to all the evils of allowing an absolute sale, without a transfer of possession. All the parties need do, in order to give it complete effect, is to attach a proviso.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\">In <em>Clayborn </em>v. <em>Hill,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a mortgage of personal property, the possession continuing in the mortgagor, was declared valid, upon the sole ground that such mortgages were recognized by a statute of <em>Virginia, </em>which guarded against fraud, by providing that the mortgage should be recorded, like our mortgages of land. But, even in that case, the question did not necessarily arise ; and the conveyance was pronounced void, on the ground that the equity of redemption had been released, and the possession of the vendor Continued notwithstanding. This was the only point directly before the Court. The remarks in regard to the mortgage, as such,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> are mere <em>obiter dicta </em>of the President.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">The case of <em>Clow &amp; Sharp </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>decided by the Supreme Court of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>at <em>Pittsburgh, Sept. </em>1819, <em>MS.</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>drew in question the validity of an unrecorded mortgage of goods, which continued in possession of the mortgagor. It was adjudged fraudulent as to creditors, from the mere circumstance of the continued possession; and, per <em>Gibson, </em>J. in delivering the opinion of the Court\u2014\u201c The statute, 13 <em>Eliz. </em>does not, in words, declare a conveyance of goods fraudulent, where the vendor retains possession 5 but, in general terms, renders void all conveyances made to the end, purpose and intent of defrauding creditors. Hence it becomes incumbent on the Courts to determine, from all circumstances of the case, whether the conveyance be or be not made with a fraudulent intention ; and, in judging of that, it is held, that any neglect in leaving the vendor in possession, is fraudulent within the statute. The general rule is, <em>that the possession must be transferred to the </em>purchaser. But, it has been said, the rule does not apply to conditional sales : <em>that is altogether without foundation </em>; for neither this statute, nor 27 <em>Eliz. </em>which provides for the securing of purchasers, makes any difference between absolute and conditional sales. The only question is, whether the sale be fraud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ulent; and. if it be, it is within the statute. `Deli'oery of the' subject matter of the contract, is as requisi~e in the case of o mortgage of goods, as it is in the case of an absolute sale.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-3\">In Ryall v. Rolle,<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> this question was much considered,~ and the doctrine laid down is, in terms, the same as that in Clow &amp; Sharp v. Woods. The questions of frau~i are bela to depend on the same circumstances, whether they arise Under 13 Etiz. or the statute of bankrupts, 21 Jac. 1. The very question here under consideration underwent the direct examination of Lord Hardw~c Ice, C., Lee, Cli. J. of the K. B., Parker, Cli. B. of the Exchequer, and Burmet, J. of the Common Pleas, and they all agreed, Lu terms, 1. That the possession continuing in the mortgagor was not consistent with the deed, and that it was fraudulent in relation to creditors, considered either under the statute of fraudulent conveyances, or of hankrupt&amp;; and the cases before that decis ion,<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> to this point, are alt summed up, in the course of thediscussion, by the different Judges. Burnet, J. says,<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> \" The next question to be considered wiIl.be in relation to the condition of creditors, where the debtor continues in possession of the goods mortgag~d. This was fiaudul\u00e8nt af~ the common law, and the 13 Eliz. cap. 5, s. i,2,provides against it, that it shall be void. There is no distinctipn wheth-' er the sale be absolute or conditional.\" Again: <footnotemark>(j)</footnotemark> \" the only thing contended for is, whether the mortgagee shall be considered as the true owner, or the mortgagor; and~ there is no doubt the conditional vendee is the true oviner, or pro.~ prietay ; and there is no reason to make a distinction be- tween an absolute and conditional vendee, but by confoun- ding the difference~ betwixt pawns and mortgages. There might some doubt arise, if this was the case of a pawn, a~ in the case, 3 Bulstr. 17, but it cannot be doubted in the case of a mortgage, for it is an immediate sale to the mortgagee;. and though the mortgagor may buy itagain, or redeem by favot~r of a Court of Equity, till then the vendee is the ab- sc1ute proprietor. A pawn is complete by a delivery, buff ~n a conditional or absolute sale, the sale is complete by the contract, and the party is entitled to a delivery of the goods3 ~as soon as he has paid theprice. (Salk. 113. Dyer, 20, 203.)\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Again: *(as there is no authority to warrant a distinction between absolute and conditional sales, so there is a case that \u25a0destroys it. <em>(Stevens </em>v. <em>Sole, in Chanc.

No injustice is done to such mortgagee ; because he really trusts only to the general credit of the trader. The conveyance is not a fraud against him, but against his other creditors.\u201d In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Day,</em><footnotemark><em>(q)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was also the case of a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>mortgage, he says the same thing,<footnotemark>(r)</footnotemark> and per Foster, J.<footnotemark>(s)</footnotemark> a trader, before bankruptcy, may pay a particular creditor ; or he may mortgage his effects to a particular creditor, <em>with possession delivered ; </em>and here it is a mortgage, it is true, with a resulting trust to <em>Lawson ; </em>but there is no alteration of possession ; no delivery, which is the badge of ownership. <em>(Twyne\u2019s case, 3 Co. </em>81. <em>a.) Wilmot, </em>J. concurred, in the same terms. <em>Ladbroke </em>v. <em>Cricketi</em><footnotemark><em>(1)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was a question between an execution creditor who had levied upon a vessel, and a creditor by bottomry (in nature of a mortgage) on the same vessel; and because the latter had reduced the ship into his own possession before the levy, he recovered : but, per Ld, <em>Kenyon, </em>C. J. \u201c If no possession had been taken under this instrument, it would have been fraudulent ; and any other creditor might have taken her in execution : but here the title of the first purchaser was consummated by taking possession of the ship.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-11\">In <em>Mace </em>v. <em>Cadell,</em><footnotemark><em>(t)</em></footnotemark><em>Ld. Mansfield </em>takes up and considers what is the true distinction between questions arising under the 13 <em>Eliz. </em>&amp; 21 <em>Jac. </em>The latter, he held, subjects goods to the commission of bankruptcy, though they were not <em>originally </em>the bankrupt\u2019s, but were merely leased to him, if he used and possessed them as owner ; and he says if this latter statute \u201c meant to comprehend nothing more than is contained in the preamble, it means nothing at all; because even <em>before </em>the statute, if a man had <em>conveyed </em>his <em>own </em>goods to a third person, and had kept the possession, such possession would have been void, as being fraudulent, according to the doctrine in <em>Twyne's case, </em>3 <em>Rep. </em>81.\u201d In all other points . the doctrine is the same, whether upon the statute of <em>Eliz. </em>or <em>James.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-12\">Thus the Court will perceive, by adverting to the cases, that they all concur in the general rule, whether the bill of sale be absolute or conditional, that possession must follow the sale. Cases where it may be retained are mere exceptions to the rule arising from special circumstances. Whether the sale be absolute or conditional, a continuing possession in the vendor may be explained, but not in .one case any more than in the other. What reasons are available, then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>En case the sale is absolute ? Property not capable of delivery is one; as a ship at sea. Where the vendor refuses to deliver, though the money be paid, holds the vendee at arm\u2019s length, and puts him to his action of trover, is another. It .is true that it may become material to inquire into the conditions of the sale, to see whether the reasons for retaining possession be good. If the sale be absolute, necessity alone is an excuse. If left even from the most humane motives, fraud is a presumption <em>de juris et de jure, </em>which nothing can resist. By classifying the cases, it will be seen that there is no difference of principle, though there may be in the expressions used. By some cases, we are told that where one makes a bill of sale to secure a debt, and the bill is absolute on its face, and there is a continuance of possession in the vendor, it will be deemed fraudulent unless such conduct be fully accounted for- We say necessity alone will account for it, under this rule. The same rule and same explanation holds where the owner sells for cash advanced, or an antecedent debt, though otherwise pf money lent to buy the goods with. Where it is necessary that the vendor should do something about the goods for the benefit of the vendee, the former may retain possession for this purpose; and circumstances may render it imperiously necessary that he should retain the goods for the purpose of selling them for the vendee\u2019s benefit. In such a case the sale was holden not to be fraudulent, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> Another exception may perhaps be considered as established; and that is, where the goods are disposed of by a public judicial sale to one, other than the creditor, and are left with the debtor; there it may be necessary to shew <em>actual </em>fraud, <footnotemark>(u)</footnotemark> Accordingly, in <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Wood,</em><footnotemark><em>(v)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Ld. <em>Ellenborougk </em>said, \u201c The doctrine of possession applies to cases of conveyance from the party himself. The statute of <em>Eliz. </em>does not apply to a case like this, where the property is sold not by the party, but under a distress for rent.\u201d Goods conveyed by a marriage settlement, by a husband to trustees, in trust for the wife, are also an exception, from the peculiar nature of the transaction and the relation of the parties.<footnotemark>(w)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-4\">It cannot be pretended that the present case comes within any of the exceptions to the general rule. The doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>is universal that there must be a satisfactory explanation why the possession continues with the vendor. Here is none. The possession was not even confined to a reasonable time for the vendor to arrange his affairs as a constable. It was left for the debtor\u2019s own use, for a long and unreasonable time. No case can be found justifying this. The money was due from the moment of the sale, but no time specified for its payment. The doctrine of the other side will enable any..man to defeat his creditors of their just debts,, and yet enjoy his property during his whole life.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-4\"><em>S.

It is admittted to be the general rule, that a <em>sale </em>of chattels, unaccompanied by possession,is, by presumption of <em>law, prima facie, </em>fraudulent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-6\">2. But this rule is subject to exceptions in all cases where the vendor\u2019s possession is for-a fair and lawful reason ; and. where that possession accompanies and followsthe deed or bill of sale. <em>(Cowp. </em>432. 2 <em>Bulst. </em>225. <em>Prec. in Ch. </em>285. 1 <em>Ld. Ray. </em>724. 2 <em>T. R. </em>579, <em>per Buller, J. </em>1 <em>Crunch. </em>309. 9 <em>John. </em>201, &amp; 9 <em>John. </em>337, <em>in which most of the above are cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-11\">3. And our decisions have fully recognized the doctrine,, that sales, subject to a general presumption of legal fraud, may still be valid in special cases, to be approved by judgment of law, such as, where the <em>intent is fair\u2014not calculated to work a </em>wrong,\u201d &amp;c. &amp;c. (9 <em>John. </em>33, <em>per Kent, Ch. </em>J. \u201c <em>unless in special cases to be approved by the Court f </em>5 <em>John, per Spencer, J.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-12\"><em>4. </em>And on those grounds a' <em>bona fide </em>mortgage of goods is universally allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-13\">5. In this case, the first instrument was a plain mortgage*, payable on demand. It has all the qualities of a mortgage; 1, a debt acknowledged ; 2, a property conveyed to secure payment; 3, a clause of redemption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-14\">6. The 2d instrument was plainly a mortgage also\u2014or rather a continuation of the first, occasioned by a 2d adjust-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>sflent of the accounts, made at the close of the year; and it <em>\" * </em>is upon the effect of the 2d instrument that the question turns.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACs\">7. This transaction Was perfectly fair, reasonable, pub-lie, and well known to the defendant below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-7\">8. In such a case as this, it would be no objection that the property might be kept from the other creditors a long time or even forever, if that had been the intent; for the other creditors can never have any just claim upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-8\">He added, the conveyance here is of definite property,which is made the subject of a definite appraisal; and the <em>bona fides </em>admitted. There is nothing to intend. Every thing necessary to sustain the transaction is found by a special verdict, upon which, it should be remembered, the question arises. That verdict finds the <em>bona fides. </em>It is enough that it does not find <em>mala fides} </em>and the only question for the Court to decide is, whether fraud arises from Such a case by necessary legal intendment. The value of the property is short of the debt. The bill of sale provides that, on payment, the surplus-shall be released. <em>Bissell </em>did not obtain judgment nor even prosecute for his debt till after the pledge; and the seizure and conversion upon his execution was before default of paying the debt upon the second mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-9\">Much has been said about <em>legal fraud </em>and <em>fraud in fact } </em>and I agree that the understanding to be derived from the books is not very clear, as to what these phrases mean, and the distinction between then\u00bb. One sells goods which, from motives of humanity merely, the vendee still suffers to remain in the possession of the vendor : The rules of law say this is liable to the imputation of fraud. The reason, says the Attorney General, is, because it gives a false credit. On this I take issue. The reason is totally different. It&gt; is that the parties have power to hatch up a fictitious debt, give it the appearance of fairness, and make it a colorable lien on property. The law, therefore, comes with a general rule to supply the defect of human testimony, and reach, the truth. It seizes upon <em>indicia </em>as a standard of proof, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>by a presumption <em>de </em>jure, pronounces the continuance' of possession fraudulent. Then, I say, though <em>prima facie </em>fraudulent, this presumption may, in all cases, be repelled. It is always subject to be rebutted by proof that the sal\u00e9 is <em>not fraudulent.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-3\">Two \u201cpositions are taken on the other side, not exactly consistent. It is first said that possession continuing in the vendor is always an indication of fraud ; and then again* that, in certain cases, it may be accounted for; and that the goods, being the subject of a mortgage, is one way of giving such an account. The moment you admit it may be accounted for, the rulq is gone as to there being a presumption <em>d\u00e9 juris et de jure </em>; for it depends upon, and is a question of fact. If a question of fact, may not human affairs be so modified as to present facts beyond those which have ever before entered into any case ? Is necessity alone an answer ? Shall it be said that a <em>bona fide </em>possession, and nobody injured, is not equally an excuse ? One gives\" property with fair appraisement, to an amount less than the debt, and passes it by mortgages. Is not this one of the answers which may be given ? Suppose it mortgaged at 7 years or 70 years: the debtor has a right to mete it <em>out to </em>creditors as he chooses :\u2022 and why not 70 years, if no one is injured ? But \u201cwe cannot levy upon it.\u201d No matter. You gave no credit on the faith of it; and are not injured. Then, we come back to the inquiry ; wherefore does the law object ? Why does it interpose presumption ? I answered because, for aught we know, there may be fraud, and it being so liable, we will presume, and deny the truth and reality of the business, and call it a fictitious sale until explained and \u2019 answered. Here it is explained.. The record says it ir fair ; and the plaintiff in error is driven to the length of sayr ing that, in the face of a record, the Court must find bad faith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-4\">Although the line of distinction which I advance, may not be well drawn, yet it has been constantly recognized by the Courts. It is not necessary to extend our inquiries beyond the 13 <em>Eliz. </em>and the cases upon that statute. Nor will I say that where third persons are injured'by giv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ling credit or purchasing on the faith of the possession, Courts will not presume fraud in order to protect them. I was going on to cite cases to establish the distinction I last advanced ; but I will first examine <em>Edtvards </em>v. <em>Harben.</em><footnotemark><em>(x)</em></footnotemark><em> Buller, </em>J. speaks of non-delivery as a circumstance, <em>per se, </em>which makes the sale void in point of law ; and adds, u we are all of opinion, that <em>if there be nothing but the absolute conveyance without the possession, </em>in point of law it is fraudulent.\u201d It is upon such propositions as this, scattered through the books, that legal intendment is insisted on. In that case the vendor sold, but retained possession ; and I admit the legal intendment of fraud followed ; but what becomes of the presumption, if there be <em>something else </em>in the case besides <em>conveyance </em>and <em>possession ? </em>How does this difier from cases of presumption <em>de jure </em>upon facts found by special % erdict, or admitted by a demurrer ? Not one case can be found in which <em>bona fides </em>was made out, where fraud was ever presumed; and the whole course of the authorities- go on this ground. The late case of <em>Benton v. </em>Thornhill,<footnotemark><em>(y)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I shall not largely insist on, because I agree that it was of a mixed character upon the question of possession, which was left to the jury, to say whether fraudulent or not; but contending for delivery upon a mortgage, is in the face of <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Paxton,</em><footnotemark><em>(z)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided by this Court, wrhich is a leading case, and W'hich has guided the profession in transactions of this kind ever since- In <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Ward,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court say, \u201c There must be a fraudulent or deceptive purpose in view, or implied, under the special circumstances of the case.\u201d In <em>Sturtevant v. Ballard,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court again recognize fraud as matter of actual intent. There must, say they,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> \u201c be some sufficient motive, and of which the Court is to judge, for the non-delivery of the goods, or the law will still presume the sale to have been made with a view to <em>\u201c delay, hinder 01 defraud </em>creditors.\u201d Again : \u201c In such cases, it has been frequently said not to be absolutely fraudulent; or not so in point of law, to permit the donor to continue in possession. The only inquiry would be as to matter of <em>fact, </em>w'hether the transaction was really and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>intrinsically fair and honest.\u201d And after a full review of the cases, the whole are summed up in these words : \u201c We may, therefore, safely conclude, that a voluntary sale of chattels, with an agreement, either in or out of the deed, that the vendor may keep possession, is, except in special cases, and for special reasons, to be shewn &lt;o, and approved of by the Court, fraudulent and void as against creditors.\u201d In <em>Mant\u00f3n </em>v. <em>Moore,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> Grose, </em>J. says, \u201c I am- of opinion that the question of fraud was for the consideration of the jury, and the duty of the jury, in this case, has devolved on the arbitrator, who has determined that there was no fraud.\u201d <em>Kidd </em>v. Rawlinson,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> was a purchase of goods at Sheriff\u2019s sale, but not.by the judgment creditor, and the goods were-left with the debtor ; and Ld. <em>Eldon </em>relied upon this to take it out of the general rule ; yet he treated it as a question of fact, and left it to the jury to pronounce upon the intent. In <em>Worseley </em>v. <em>De Maltas,</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>per Ld. <em>Mansfield, </em>\u201c Nay, <em>the not taking </em>possession. being only <em>evidence of fraud, </em>may be explained.\u201d In <em>Ryall </em>v. <em>Rolle,</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>per <em>Burnet, </em>J. \u201c Courts of Equity and juries are to consider upon the whole evidence, whether the conveyance was made with a view to defraud or not.\u201d In <em>Heselinlon </em>v. <em>Gill,</em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>per <em>Butter, </em>J. \u201c It has been frequently determined, that possession alone is not evidence of fraud; the transaction must be shewn to be fraudulent from other circumstances.\u201d In <em>Edwards </em>v. Harbtn,<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> per <em>Butter, </em>J. \u201c On the other hand,, there are cases, where the vendor has continued in poss\u00e9ssion, and the bill of sale has not been adjudged fraudulent,, if the want of immediate possession be consistent with the deed.\u201d The 21 <em>Jac. </em>has a different scope and object from the 13 <em>Eliz. </em>and the cases of <em>Worsely </em>v. <em>De Mattos, </em>and <em>Ryall </em>v. <em>Rolle, </em>and other cases arising under that act, do not apply ; yet it will he seen by these cases, that fraud may be disproved even under the 21 <em>Jac. </em>This is apparent from the authorities cited by Ld. <em>Mansfield, </em>in the latter case.<footnotemark>(j)</footnotemark> <em>Powell </em>has been cited. He, too, proceeds throughout upon the idea that no delivery may be made, and yet the transaction not fraudulent; and he sums up the law in this man-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Dor 1<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> \u201c Another ground upon which eases have been\u2019 considered as not within the purview of the statute (of <em>Eliz.) </em>is, that, by the specific words of the contract, possession was not meant to follow immediately thereupon ; for the circumstance which stains the transaction with fraud, is the false appearance held out, when one thing is done, and an appearance permitted, which imports the contrary; an absolute, unqualified transfer of the right to the vendee, but the possession and use retained by the vendor, with no other object but to defraud. But there can be no fraud where the appearances agree with the real state of things. And what was the intrinsic nature of the contract, as to the retaining or parting with the possession, may be made out from the deeds where the transaction is in writing, and where the transaction is <em>en </em>pais, by such parol evidence as can be adduced for the purpose of proving it.\u201d Then, after illustrating this preposition by the case of <em>Bucknal </em>v. <em>Roys ton, (Prec. Chan. </em>285,) he adopts<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark> the words of Ld. <em>Mansfield, </em>in <em>Cadogan </em>v. <em>Kennet, (Cowp. </em>432.) \u201c Therefore the statute did not militate against any transaction <em>bona fide, </em>and where there was no imagination of faud ; and so was the common law. The question, therefore, in every case was, whether the act done was a <em>bona fide </em>transaction, or whether it was a trick and contrivance to defeat creditors.\u201d In <em>Cortelyou </em>v. <em>Lansing,</em><footnotemark><em>(m)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>per <em>Kent, </em>J. speaking of <em>a </em>pledge ; \u201c It is, therefore, to be distinguished from a mortgage of goods, for that is an absolute pledge, to become an absolute interest if not redeemed at a fixed time. Besides, delivery is essential to a pledge ; but a mortgage of goods is, in certain cases, valid without delivery.\u201d <em>Bucknal </em>v. Royston,<footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark> is a leading case upon these questions as to the validity of a mortgage without delivery, as between the parties, and as to creditors, under the statute of <em>Eliz.-Brewer </em>there mortgaged a ship in port, with the cargo and the profits of the voyage, but retained possession, and sold the cargo and invested the proceeds in other goods in the course of the voyage. A judgment creditor claimed the goods upon the return of the ship ; but the claim was overruled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Was the delivery, in that case, impossible ? Could not the adventure-have been taken into the lender\u2019s own hands, and the money lent at simple interest, instead of respondentia ? Certainly, no physical or moral impossibility intervened. What, then, becomes of the doctrine of neces-. sity ? It is admitted, that a condition precedent shall excuse, according to what <em>Coke, </em>J. says, in 2 Ba lstrode, 226. But this is only one exception among many ; and the same effect has, again and again, been given to a condition subsaquent. In <em>Cole </em>v. Davies,<footnotemark>(o)</footnotemark> it was resolved that if goods of A are seized upon a <em>fieri facias, </em>and sold to <em>B, bona fide, </em>upon valuable consideration ; though <em>B </em>permits <em>A </em>to have, the goods in his possession, upon condition that <em>A </em>shall pay. to <em>B </em>the money, as he shall raise it b.y the sale of the goods, this will not make the execution fraudulent ;\" though it was agreed that actual fraud might be shewn. If a mortgage require delivery, wherein does it differ from a pledge ? Yet a distinction is constantly kept up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-4\"><em>Talcott, </em>in reply. It is true, that the books often say. possession continuing, in the vendor, is only, prima <em>facie, </em>evidence of fraud, and may be explained. This proposition I admit; but I deny its application to the present case. It should be taken in the same sense in which it was advanced by <em>Buller, J. </em>in <em>Edwards </em>v. Harben ;<footnotemark>(p)</footnotemark> but the ulterior. inquiry must be, is the explanation such as satisfies the law ? This depends on the nature of the agreement between the parties, and the circumstances attending the sale. I do not contend for a physical or moral necessity as the only which can be given. There, are, I admit, other, cases, among which <em>Bucknall </em>v. <em>Royston, </em>is the strongest, Lord <em>Mansfield says,</em><footnotemark><em>(q)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that was a case \u201c upon the course of administration of assets, where secret liens give priority. Besides, the possession there was a trust under an authorty to negotiate and sell; and could not be meant to, give any false credit.\u201d As to the distinction between a mortgage and pledge, in the latter there must be a delivery as between the pawnor and pawnee ; the former may be good as be-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u00abween mortgagor and mortgagee without delivery, but not as to creditors ; a,nd so is the passage from <em>Cortelyou </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>as read by the gentleman ; \u201c a mortgage of goods is, <em>n certain cases, </em>valid without delivery.\u201d Such language recognizes the doctrine that, as a general rule, delivery is necessary in the case of a mortgage. <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Paxton, </em>I have shewn, maintains the same doctrine. \u201c Often valid,\u201d as used in that case, is certainly not\u201c always.\u201d In <em>Bucknal </em>v. <em>Royston, </em>it was <em>part of the, trust </em>that the goods should remain. Why give this reason, if possession is always consistent with the mortgage ? Would it not have been enough to say, \u201c here is a mortgage,\u201d and stop there ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-3\">It is said the jury have found no fraud. This is a mistake! They have, in the language of the cases, found certain <em>facts </em>and <em>intents, </em>and referred the question of law arising upon these to the Court, and it is a proper question for the Court to determine. \u201c Fraud is a question of lqw, and especially when there is no dispute about the facts. It is <em>the judgment of the law on facts and intents, </em>as has been frequently observed by Judges of the greatest eminence.\u201d<footnotemark>(r)</footnotemark> The jury find that a year and an half before the sale, a large variety of personal property, including the horse, was conveyed by a bill of sale to secure a debt, the whole continu-, ing in possession of the debtor during all the time, from the date of the bill of sale, to the time when the horse was taken in execution at the suit of the defendant below. These circumstances, standing alone, render the sale void as to creditors, within all the English cases. It lies with the vendee to explain them ; and the Court are to say whether the explanation be sufficient, as to sales conveying a present interest. Something more than mere convenience is necessary. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Thornhill,</em><footnotemark><em>(s)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>cited for the defendant in error, is agaipst him. That was a hill of sale for securing a debt, and yet it was left to the-jury to say whether the vendee\u2019s possession was honest. The jury were hot called upon to say whether the vendor\u2019s possession was evidence of fraud, but whether the vendee\u2019s possession being colora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ble, was not, in truth, the vendor\u2019s possession ; and if the latter, it was agreed that the sale must be adjudged fraudulent. The jury found possession in the vendee. The case was Put upon the question of possession alone ; and the jury were correctly told, that though the debt was honest yet the sale was fraudulent unless possession passed ; this, too, in the case of a mere mortgage or bill of sale, to secure a debt. So the jury, here, have not, as supposed, found against any fraudulent intent. They find possession continued, and for what purpose, expressly ; but it is for the Court to pronounce the conclusion of law, as was held in <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Thornhill. Maggot </em>v. <em>Mills,</em><footnotemark><em>(t)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is relied on. answer to this, I will barely refer to 1 <em>Atk. </em>176, where it is said, <em>\u201c </em>If the sale there had been to any other person than the landlord, it would have been fraudulent.\u201d Thus that case is considered as proceeding on a very narrow doctrine, which was equally applicable to <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Paxton. </em>Indeed, in the latter case, the language of the Court rather seems to put it upon the doctrine of landlord and tenant.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\"> 13 <em>Eliz. eh. </em>5, <em>enacted almost verbatim, </em>1 <em>R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXls\">The facts in this case are shortly these: In <em>September, </em>1817, one <em>Jesse Dryer </em>rented of <em>Hopkins </em>a tavern stand and small farm, at an annual rent of $120; which, however, was subsequently reduced. <em>A, </em>book account had commenced between them in <em>April </em>preceding. Settlements were made at different times. At one of them, on the <em>1st October, </em>1819, <em>Dryer </em>was found in arrear $274,84J ; and to provide for the payment and security of this sum, he executed a bill of sale of a variety of articles of personal property, including the mare now in controversy. It was agreed that the articles should be appraised by <em>Jerome Curtiss ; </em>and, upon payment being made, in the articles or otherwise, the surplus and remaining articles, if any, should be released. On the next day, the articles were appraised by <em>Curtiss, </em>at $237,75, and the appraisement endorsed on the bill of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">On the <em>1st January, </em>1821, another settlement took place, at which a balance of $146,61, was found due from Dryer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>and another agreement was written on the same paper with the first, as follows : !t <em>1821, January </em>1. Settled the amount of the above to this time, and adjusted the balance at <em>$ </em>148-1-lVV, f\u00b0r which so much of the above property as remains on hand is to remain liable. The mare above mentioned is to be delivered to <em>Mnlcom M\u2019Naughton, </em>on demand, but she is intended to remain in said <em>Dryer\u2019s </em>use for the present, and he is to pay into <em>Elihu Scofield\u2019s </em>hands, for said <em>Hopkins </em>in good judgments or securities, or to said <em>M\u2019Naughton\u2019s </em>hands, in grain, the amount of $50, within one month, and on continuing his payments in proportion, the mare is intended to remain with him.\u201d <em>Dryer </em>continued indebted to <em>Hopkins, </em>and at the time of the trial in the Court below, <em>{May, </em>1821) was still indebted more than $100. A large portion of his debt was for rent. More than one year\u2019s rent was due at the time of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">In the month of <em>November, </em>1817, an account commenced between <em>Dryer </em>and <em>Bissell, </em>and in <em>March, </em>1820, a considerable balance being due, a suit was commenced against <em>Dryer, </em>and a judgment recovered in <em>September, </em>for $91,58. Execution was issued on the <em>4th January, </em>1821, and delivered to the Sheriff, who was directed by <em>Bissell </em>to levy on the mare, while she was off the premises rented by <em>Dryer </em>of <em>Hopkins. </em>This was done, while the mare was in <em>Dryer\u2019s </em>possession, and in <em>February </em>she was sold at auction. <em>Bissell </em>became the purchaser. No rent was tendered or oilered to be paid ; and <em>Bissell </em>had notice of <em>Hopkins\u2019 </em>claim on the mare, before the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The object of leaving the mare with <em>Dryer, </em>was to enable him to settle and close his business as constable, he having no other horse. Applications were made to him for the purchase of the mare, to which he always answered, she was not his. and that <em>Hopkins </em>had a claim on her, or owned her. <em>Hopkins\u2019 </em>claim was publickly known. There was no secrecy about the transaction. \u25a0 When the bill of sale was executed, <em>Dryer </em>was indebted to both plaintiff and defendant, and to others, but no judgment or execution, of consequence, was obtained agamst him, till aft'er the assignment. The mare remained in <em>Dryer\u2019s </em>possession from the date bf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the first instrument, till seized by the Sheriff. Part of the articles had been delivered, and credited on account.</p>\n<p id=\"A5D\">The bill of sale of the <em>1st October, </em>1819, was clearly a mortgage payable on demand, and I cari see no grounds for the imputation of fraud <em>in fact </em>; nor do I conceive the facts such as to constitute <em>legal </em>fraud. It is very distinguishable from <em>Twyners case, (3 Rep. </em>80.) The property was received at a fair valuation. The donor continued in possession j -but no person was deceived or defrauded. There was no se* , crecy\u2014no concealment\u2014no suit pending till several months afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">I do not think it necessary to enter upon \u00e1 minute review of the cases. <em>Rent, </em>Ch. J, has examined many of them, iti <em>Sturtevant </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>(9 <em>John. </em>338) and comes to the conclusion, that a voluntary sale of chattels, with an agreement,\" either in or out of the deed, that the vendor may keep possession, is, except in special cases, and. for special reasons, to be shewn to and approved of by the Court,- fraudulent and void as against creditors. The learned Judge, no doubt, intended to say here, as in <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Paxton, </em>(5 <em>John. Rep. </em>261) that possession continuing in the vendor is only, <em>prima facie, </em>evidence of fraud, and may be explained. The question <em>in every </em>case is, whether the <em>act done </em>is a <em>bona fids. </em>transaction, or whether it is a trick and contrivance to defeat creditors. <em>(Cadogan </em>v. <em>Kennet, Cowp. </em>435.) The possession, by the vendor, of personal chattels after the sale, is not conclusive evidence of fraud. The vendee may, notwithstanding, upon proof that the sale was <em>bona fide, </em>and for a valuable consideration, and that the possession of the vendor, after such sale, was in pursuance of some agreement not inconsistent with honesty in the transaction, hold under his purchase, against creditors. These points were directly resolved in <em>Brooks v. Powers, </em>(15 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>244.) It appeared, in that case, that one <em>Witt, </em>in the years <em>1816 </em>and 17, lived on a farm of the plaintiff, under distinct leases for each year, dated the <em>1st April. </em>On the <em>14th April, </em>1817, a few days before the defendant\u2019s attachment issued, <em>Witt </em>gave-the plaintiff a bill of sale of the oxen in controversy, and delivered them on the farm in payment of the rent of part of the prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ding year and the whole of the ensuing year. The plaintiff then agreed that <em>Witt </em>should have the oxen to carry on the farm, and they remained in his possession when the defendant caused them to be seized under his attachment. The Court held the sale valid, and expressed themselves generally as to the effect of the vendor\u2019s continuing in possession in the manner I have already stated. <em>Benton </em>v. Thornhill, (7 <em>Taunt. </em>149) is a case somewhat similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The reason why the continuance of the vendor in possess1 ****6 ion will be accounted fraudulent is, that it gives him a false credit, by which third persons are deceived. That reason fails in this instance. When the bill of sale was executed, <em>Dryer </em>was known to be indebted to several persons, but whether he was reputed to be insolvent does not appear. His landlord had an undoubted right to secure himself for' his rent. <em>Dryer </em>had a right to prefer one creditor, provided it were fairly and honesly done, in this case, the <em>bona Jides </em>of the transaction is not questioned. A good reason is given, in my judgment, why the tenant was not at once stripped of his property, as thereby his power of acquiring the means to pay his debts, would have been taken from him. No deception was practised. The transaction was publick. <em>Dryer </em>himself, always, after the mortgage, stated the property of the mare to be in Hopkins. <em>Bissell </em>knew it before the sale, and probably before he prosecuted <em>Dryer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In my opinion, the Common Pleas decided correctly, and their judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\"> Perhaps nothing farther, upon the much litigated question, how far possession by the vendor, after a sale of goods, shall be evidence of fraud as to creditors, ever can be reached by way of legal rule, than what is advanced by the Court in this case, to wit, that such possession is, <em>piima facie, </em>evidence of fraud, but may he explained. (Vid. <em>Dickenson </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>17 <em>John. </em>332.) It seems to be a mere rule of evidence calculated to shift the <em>onus probandi </em>from the creditor to the vendee. The details or circumstances which shall constitute fraud, like those of usury, or the degree of neglect which shall render a man liable in an action on the case, seem to mock the efforts of a general rule, and must be ranged forever without thp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>line which divides the province of the Court from that of the jury. The law may declare that fraud shall vitiate the sale; but as the devices by which feat fraud is to be compassed and disguised, may he various, so the evidence by which it is to be established or repelled, must frequently vary with the eases as they arise</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Some judges have started, with a high-toned rule, that unless a change of possession follows immediately, it is not only evidence of fraud, but. per se, <em>makes the sale fraudulent and void. (Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>2 T. R. 596-7, <em>per Baller, J. Hamilton v. Russell, </em>1 <em>Cranch, </em>317,318, <em>per Marshall, Ch. </em>J. <em>Dawes </em>v. Cope, 4 <em>Binn. </em>265, <em>per Tilghman, Ch. J.) </em>Bat these learned 3udges were embarrassed with numerous exceptions in the out-set; and when the late Ch. J. <em>Kent </em>made an effort, in <em>Sturtevant v. Ballard, (9 John. Rep. 337) to </em>introduce the same rule, as far as possible, into the jurisprudence of this state, he found it encumbered with the following exceptions, which he enumerates: 1. Where a creditor is knowing and assenting to the sale, <em>(Steel v. Brown, </em>1 <em>Taunt. </em>381). 2. Where the sale is conditional, (per <em>Coke, </em>J. <em>in Stone </em>v. <em>Grubham, </em>2 <em>Bulstr. </em>225; <em>and per Buller, </em>J. <em>in Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>2 <em>T R. 596, i. e. </em>in the last case, a condition precedent to he performed by the vendee. 3- Where the goods remain with the vendor, to be sold fer the benefit of the vendee, the vendor being a borrower on bottomry, <em>(i. e. </em>a mortgagor) the trust being declared by the deed, <em>(Bucknal </em>v. <em>Royston, Prec. in Ch </em>285). 4 Where <em>JL </em>purchases the goods on <em>aJi.fa. in </em>favour of <em>B, </em>and leaves them with the judgment deb'.or, to the intent that he pay for and redeem them, <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>1 <em>Ld Raym. </em>724). 5. Where the goods parcha ed in this manner are left, from <em>benevolence, </em>or <em>for a temporary and honest purpose, (Kidd </em>v. Rawlinson, 2 <em>B. </em>&amp; <em>P. </em>59). 6. Where money is lent to buy furniture, and a bill of sale <em>honestly </em>taken to secure the re-payment of the money. 7. Where the purchase was a <em>fair </em>one, at publiok sale, and the goods are left with a<em>relatiosi </em>or <em>friend, </em>(per <em>Shippen, Ch. </em>J. <em>in Waters </em>v. <em>M'Lellan, </em>4 <em>Dall. </em>268). 8. Where the vendor is an intended husband, and sells to trustees to make a marriage settlement upon his future wife, <em>(Haselinton v. Gill,3 T. R. </em>620, <em>in </em>nolis; <em>Cadogan </em>v. <em>Kennet, Cowp </em>432). And he concludes that, except <em>m special </em>cases, and for special reasons, to be <em>shown </em>to, and approved ef by the Covert, continuance of possession is fraudulent</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">To these may be added, from our own reports, 9. <em>Barrow v. Paxton, </em>(5 <em>John. Rep. </em>258) where stress was laid almost exclusively on the circumstance feat the hill of sale was a mortgage ? (U. <em>States </em>v. <em>Hove, </em>3 Cranch, 88,89, <em>per Marshall, Ch. </em>J. <em>S. </em>P.) 10 Where the non-delivery arises from the sickness of the vendor\u2019s depositary, <em>(Beals v. Guernsey, </em>8 <em>John. </em>451). Te these exceptions naay be added, 11. Where the assignment is of a cargo in a shiplyingat the port where the assignment is executed, but bound to a \u00abforeign port, the assignment providing that remittances shall be made to \u00a1liquidate the debt due to the vendee, in eensideration of which debt fee assignment is made, fee. <em>(Dawes </em>v. <em>Cope, 4 Binn. </em>258). 12. Where the conveyance was late on <em>Saturday </em>night, and the possession remained unchanged till <em>Monday, (Wilt </em>v. <em>Franlin, </em>1 <em>Binn. </em>517). 13. The Supreme Court, in <em>M'-Instry </em>v. Tanner, (9 J<em>ohn. </em>135) seam to question the right of fee creditor in,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ass execution, to purchase goods arder xi.\u00fa execution, arel le;.vs Smvs witliMs debtor, but its <em>Eng. and </em>even this distinction is done away by the case of <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Birch, </em>(4 <em>Taunt. </em>822). \u201c This tos trespass against the Sheriff of <em>Middlesex, </em>who had taken cerium gods in execution, at the suit et <em>Bhiejisid </em>against <em>O anean. Duncan </em>had executed a warrant of attorney to cort\u00e9is judgesest to fheplaialiff\", and, after judgment entered up, she issued sjr <em>fa. </em>and caused the effects of <em>Duncan </em>to be su'd <em>et </em>pttbliek Kuo\u00edioB,\u00a1md herself became the buyer, whereupon the Sheriff in <em>February, </em>1831, in consideration of \u00a358, which the plaintiff actually paid, executed a hill of sale oi the goods to the plaint iff I-.i <em>May, </em>1811, she agreed to let the goods to <em>Dun</em>can, who still retained the possession, for a rent; which was regularly paid\u00bb and receipts given. When <em>BiwfidtPo </em>execution was about to be levied, <em>Duncan </em>clandestinely removed certain other goods which were <em>in bis . </em>ossession, bat none of those which the plamtiffhad so bought. Upon the trial of tile cause, <em>Pell, </em>Serjt for the defendant, endeavoured to establish, upon the cross-examination, a case of <em>actual </em>fraud on the part of the plaintiff but the facts completely rebutting it, a verdict passed for the plaintiff. Upon moving for a new trial,</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Per Mahsfiemi, Ch. J. Unless it can be made out that the fact of e. former owner of goods being in any way afterwards permitted to possess them, is a badge of fraud, I know not how this verdict can be set aside, The plaintiff buys these goods and lets them, and receives rent for them $ end can we say that a person who, under an execution, has bought goods, may nol let them to the former owner of them ? l\u00edo case has gone so far as that, It is a much stronger case, on account of the letting of the goods, than if she had permitted them to remida in the custody of <em>Duncan </em>without any consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Gibbs, J. It is impossible to distinguish this case from the case of <em>Kidd Y. Kawlmson, </em>(2 <em>B &amp;P. </em>59.)

The doctrine of possession applies to the cases of a conveyance from the party <em>himself. </em>The statute of <em>Elisabeth </em>does not apply to a case like this, where the property is sold, not by the party, but under a distress for rent. <em>Guthrie </em>became the purchaser at the sale, as any other person might have been, and it was at his option to take the goods or leave them. He was the legal proprietor, and the creditor had no right to take them in execution.\u201d Verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>15.

Sparrow, </em>a farmer, had borrowed \u00a3600 of the plaintiff, who was his brother-in-law, and the. plaintiff had sent his sonto <em>Sparrow, </em>to obtain from him a bill of sale of all his effects, as security. <em>Sparrow </em>executed a bill of sale, accordingly, of <em>all his effects, </em>but notincluding the lease of his farm. The plaintiff\u2019s son took possession of the stock, and continued to reside in <em>Sparrow\u2019s </em>house, and employed labourers, &amp;c. <em>Sparrow, </em>however, continued to reside in the house, and still appeared to act as master, the servante on the farm not knowing that the plaintiff\u2019s son had taken possession, as he gaye them orders in <em>Sparrow\u2019s </em>name, who sold a cow and some crops, and exercised other strong acts of ownership. The goods having been afterwards taken in execution by the Sheriff, at the suit of a creditor of Sparrowj on a. judgment for \u00a3600, (a debt due when the bill of sale was executed) an action was brought for them by the vendee, against the Sheriff. All these circumstances having been left to the jury, byLd. Ch. J. <em>Gibbs, </em>who tried the cause, they found a verdict for the plaintiff, thereby establishing the validity of the bill of sale; and the Court of Common Pleas refused to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\"><em>Shepherd, </em>Solicitor General, on moving for a new trial, cited Twyne\u2019scase, (8 Co. 80, <em>b.) </em>and <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>(2 <em>T. R. </em>587) and distinguished this ease from those of <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>(2 <em>B. </em>&amp; <em>P. </em>59) and <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>(3 <em>Taunt. </em>256;. But ho mainly relied on <em>Wordallv. Smith, </em>(1 <em>Canvpb. </em>332) and what Ld. <em>Ellenborough, </em>Ch. J. says there. Strangers eould not know that <em>Benton, </em>the son, was not residing with his uncle as a visitor. The bargainee ought to. have an absolute, notorious, and exclusivq possession : if the vendor remains on the premises, and continues to manage the property, the vendee having merely the instrument in his pocket, the sale is nugatory and fraudulent. But,</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Per Gibbs, Ch. J. \u201cI certainly meant, at the trial, to give the defendant the benefit of all the arguments now used in his behalf. I belieVe that in summing up the evidence, I did give him the benefit of all those arguments. Ileft it to the jury, whether this possession of <em>Benton\u2019s </em>were an honest one; for that, if a bill of sale to <em>Benton </em>were attended with a possession, there being a debt honestly due to <em>Benton, Sparrow </em>had a right to make this conveyance to <em>Benton, </em>for securing his debt, and <em>then the </em>execution came too late, there being no bankruptcy here. I stated that the question, whether the transaction were fraudulent, depended on the object of the bill of sale, and on the circumstance, whether, under that bill of sale, an actual <em>bona fide </em>possession was delivered to young <em>Benton, </em>acting on the behalf of his father. I stated the positive oath of young <em>Benton, </em>that he was sent by His father for the bill of sale, and that he did get it, and that he remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>in possession under it. I also left to the jury all the circumstances which went to falsify <em>Benton's </em>evidence. <em>Sparrow's </em>acts of continuing ownership\u2014his sowing of the corn\u2014his declarations when the officer entered\u2014 and his remaining on the farm\u2014which last circumstance, indeed, deserved no great weight; for his term in the land was not conveyed. And I t.old them, also, this, that even if there was a <em>bona fide </em>debt due from <em>Sparrow </em>to the plaintiff, yet if they thought that, beyond that debt, the conveyance was meant to colour and protect the residue of the property from <em>Sparroio's </em>other creditors, it was void for the excess. I also pointed out that the value of the property, particularly at that time, was a fluctuating one, and that, if it was the intention of the parties merely to provide for the debt to <em>Benton, </em>the verdict must be found for the defendant. The jury have come to a conclusion <em>on </em>these facts ; and if I were to sum up the evidence to them again, I could not sum it up otherwise than I have done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Dallas, J. \u201c This is moved upon the ground that the verdict was given against the weight of evidence ; but <em>J think the verdict is even consistent with all the </em>evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Park, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Burrough, J. \u201c My Lord seems to have put the case to the jury on all the grounds on which it can be put, and there is no foundation for granting a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">In the course of his charge to the jury, <em>Gibbs, </em>Ch. J. glanced at another circumstance, which, I suppose, must often present itself in trying a mortgage of personal property, viz. \u201c <em>If beyond Benton's debt, the conveyance was meant to colour and protect the residue of the property from Sparrow's other crediiois, it was void for the excess.\u201d </em>Would not the mortgage be void for the whole, upon such a circumstance? In <em>Wilson </em>&amp; <em>I/ormal s </em>case, <em>[God-bolt, </em>161) <em>Coke, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Foster, </em>J, wei^at issue upon a point like this. <em>Coke </em>said. \u201c If a man who has goods of the value of \u00a330, only, be indented to two men\u2014to one in \u00a320, and another in \u00a310 ; and the debtor assign to the one to whom he is indebted \u00a310 all the goods which are worth \u00a330, to the intent, that for the residue above the \u00a310 debt he shall be favourable to him, this assignment is altogether void, because it is fraudulent in part.\u201d But, per <em>Foster, </em>J. \u201c It shall not be void for the whole ; but only for the surplusage.\u201d \u201c If the creditor were aware of the fraudulent intent of the debtor, (says <em>hong, </em>in his <em>Treatise on Sales, </em>78) it seems most consonant to the general maxims of the common law, that fraud vitiates every thing, as well as to the provisions of the statute of <em>Elis, </em>that the transaction should be completely avoided : if, on the other hand, the creditor were not aware of other debts being due from the debtor, but considered himself as honestly standing in the situation of trustee for the debtor, as to the excess above what would be sufficient to pay his own debt, it seems most reasonable that the a.-signment should be held good to the amount of the debt due, and that it should be avoided for the remainder.\u201d There is a difficulty in making this idea, that the sale shall be good impart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>and bad in part, square with the remedy. It is easy to conceive, that the-', severance may be made in Chancery, as was done in <em>Boyd </em>&amp; <em>Suydam </em>v. <em>Dunlap et. al. </em>(1 <em>John. Ch. Rep. </em>478). So it might be done in trespass or trover, at the suit of the vendee, without doing absolute violence to the form of the remedy; but should replevin be brought, wh'eh is for a recovery of the speeifick article or articles in question, or ejectment for land fraudulently sold or mortgaged, it is not easy to conceive how the distinction could be preserved. But this by the by.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\">18. The case of <em>Dewey </em>v. Baynton, (6 <em>East, </em>257) presents another exception, viz. that a wife may, <em>after marriage, </em>buy her husband's personal property in exchange for her separate estate,and leave it in his possession as before ; and yet this shall not be deemed fraudulent as to creditors, provided it be proved fair in all other respects. The ease was shortly this <em>i </em>Lord <em>Arwndell, </em>who had a life interest in a settled estate of Lady <em>Arun\u2022dell, </em>(both being aged) of at least 30001. a year, whereof the ultimate reversion, on failure of issue male, (of which there was none) was in Lady <em>A.; </em>and Lord <em>A. </em>having furniture and pictures in his mansion of not less than 80001 value, being pressed by his creditors, in pursuance of an agreement with his wife, Lady <em>A., </em>conveyed all his property to trustees, (who had married his two daughters) for the benefit of his wife and daughters, and subject to his wife\u2019s future appointment ;in consideration whereof, tbs wife discharged him of above 30001, before vised on the estate, principally for his use, and enabled the trustees to raise out of the estate 12,0001. more, for the benefit of Lord <em>Ah </em>creditors, but subject to the appointment of him, his executors, &amp;c. ; and also covenanted to levy a fine, which was levied a year afterwards ; and he covenanted to deliver an inventory of the goods to the trustees, within 6 months, which was not done. <em>And after {he conveyance he continued to use the furniture in the house as before ; </em>and was soon afterwards sued by several of the creditors, whose executions against his goods were satisfied by him, without seiting up the trust deed, or resorting to the trust fund*; but money was raised on it afterwards, for other creditors; and above two years after the deed, the husband being sued by the plaintiff, a creditor before the date of the trust deed, this was set up in bar of the levy upon the goods in the house ; and the Sheriff returned <em>nullabona. </em>And upon an action brought for a false return, <em>held, </em>that in the consideration of the question whether this were a <em>bona fide </em>transaction, or a contrivance to defeat creditors, and therefore void at common law, or by the 13 <em>Elis.ch. </em>5, it was material to submit to the jury the relative value of the property, withdrawn from the reach of the creditors in proportion to the amount of their demands at the time, and the value and tangibility of that substituted in its place, in aid of the conclusion that, the deed was covinous against them ; and, therefore, a verdict for the plaintiff, founded principally on these concomitant circumstances : 1. The previous embarrassment of the husband\u20142. The want of notoriety of the conveyance at the time\u20143. The want of an inventory\u20144. The continuance of the husband\u2019s possession, though consistent with the deed, yet without notice of the change of property\u2014and, 5. The appropriation, by the husband, of a part of the money raised by the trustees, to his own use, without objee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>iioa\u2014was set aside, and a new trial granted, to bring the question more ful3y before the Court and jury as to the <em>good faith </em>of the transaction, and <em>the value of the eonsideration, </em>and its availability to the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\">L(L Em\u00edenboro\u00fc\u00edgh, upon the first trial of this cause, at 7Vm Prims, made a distmcikm be-\u2018ween this ease and that of <em>Cadogan v. Kennet, (Cowp. </em>432) and he also questioned the case of <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>(2 B. &amp; <em>P. </em>59) as it appears by 10 Jiz\u00bb. 145, where the same matter came ap in the Court of Chancery. The verdict being for the plaintiff, the Lord Chancellor, <em>Eldon, </em>was moved for an injunction against other executions levied upon the same property, on the ground that the verdict was contrary to law and fact, and that a new trial would be moved for in the K. B. This was the easejof Lady <em>Arundell v. Phipps </em>&amp; <em>Taunton, </em>(10 <em>Ves. </em>139, 151) in which Ld. <em>Eldon, </em>(10 <em>Ves. </em>145) was fretted to think that Ld. Ellen-<em>borough </em>should have made so bad a use of the maxim that <em>possession proves fraud. </em>Indeed, his whole opinion is remarkably strong and clear, as to the force which should be allowed to that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>The Lori Chancellor. </em>61 Upon this ease I believe that my decision in the Court of Common Pleas, <em>(Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>2 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>59) was disputed. My opinion upon the trial of that cause was, that pos-essicn is only, <em>prima facie, </em>evidence of \u00edrauci ; and as that property could not be reached by bankruptcy, and the possession was according to the deed which created the title, and the title was publickly created, that was not fraudulent possession against the creditors in general; and, upon a motion for a new trial* the Court agreed with me. With great deference, if Ld. <em>Ellenboreugh </em>thinks otherwise, I am, at present, of the same opinion ; and 1 am also, at present, o\u00ed opinion, upon the doctrine of this Court, that if the purchase of the wife is <em>bona </em>fide, it is of no consequence whether it was before or after marriage. The mere circumstance of possession of chattels, however familiar it may be to say that it proves fraud, amounts to no more than that it is, <em>p\u2019itua facie, </em>evidence of property in the man possessing, until a title* not fraudulent, is shewn, under which that possession has followed. Every case, from <em>TmjnPo </em>ease, '3 <em>Rep. </em>80) downwards, sup, oris that, and there was no occasion otherwise for the statute of <em>King James, </em>(21 <em>Job. </em>1, <em>eh, 19, s. </em>10, $ L) Can there be any doubt that a married woman, having separate property, may buy an interest in the property of her husband, by a settlement under the direction of this Court ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The injunction was granted upon an undertaking not to remove the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">A motion was afterwards made in <em>Dewy </em>v. <em>Baynton. </em>for a new trial, which was granted ; the cause tried a second time, when a verdict was again obtained for the plaintiff, upon which a motion was again made \u00a1or a new trial upon the circumstances as above detailed from the report of the ease in 6 <em>East, </em>257 ; but, in the mean time, the question was again up before the Ld. <em>Chancellor ia Lady Arundell v. Phipps, </em>(10 <em>Ves. </em>146,7, &amp;c.) and his opinion shews the great variety of considerations which may enter into a question oi fraud,</p>\n<p id=\"Aplky\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The <em>Lord Chancellor. </em>\u201c I granted this injunction, on the ground ditii this bill was brought; stating that <em>Lady Arundell </em>was, according to law, to be considered equitable owner of goods and chattels of a very special and peculiar kind ; that she became so under a contract of purchase ; which she insisted she was entitled, in a mode, to make with her husband himself; that she had contracted with him for the ownership, and instruments were executed, placing the legal property in trustees for her use and benefit; and attending to all tbe circumstances, her title, as administered in this Court, and the title of her trustees, as administered in other Courts, are as incapable of being impeached, as they were upon the date of the instrument ; that an action was brought by a creditor, and the Sheriff Was prevailed on to return <em>nulla bona. </em>An action was brought aga'nst him for a false return by the creditor; insisting, he might hare had possession of these goods and chattels, either the property of <em>Lord Arundell, </em>or in a question between him and his creditors and all other persons, including Lady <em>Arundell </em>and her trustees, liable to her husband\u2019s creditors. The form of the action being against the Sheriff, it depended upon some arrangement in a Court of law, whether the trustees of the wife could maintain the question, that these were not the goods of Lord <em>Arundell, </em>or liable to execution by his creditors: what arrangement I do not know : but Ido not think myself at liberty to surrender the jurisdiction of this Court; because the Court of King\u2019s Bench may by some arrangement execute the jurisdiction of a Court of Equity. It is my duty to give the plaintiff relief according to the rules and proceedings in this Court, if she is entitled to sue here ; and Lady <em>Arundell, </em>from the nature of her title, had a right to have it decided here by some mode of proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"AfX\">\u201c From the only account I have had of this case [East\u2019s report of the case was not then published] in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, it appears to have been asserted, that a husband and wife could not, after marriage, contract for a <em>bona fide </em>and valuable consideration, for a transfer of property from, the husbaud to the wife or trustees for her. The doctrine is not so either here or at law. I stated before what I conceived the doctrine of this Court and of the law upon this subject. There have been two trials, as there was a mistake in point of law upon the first. As to the subsequent trial, I know nothing except what is said here. But if the case is finally to be decided here, there are many points deserving great consideration, and.very fit for discussion, as connected with every fact and circumstance of the case in detail; as bearing upon the question whether this instrument is fraudulent against creditors. When Lord <em>Mnnfie\u2019d </em>upon this subject speaks of trick and contrivance (in <em>Cudogan </em>v. <em>Kennet, (Cowp. </em>435) he ought to state what the law denominates trick and contrivance. For instance, in this case, if the purpose of this instrument was to defeat creditor\u2019s, it is said to be bad, I desire <em>that </em>may be reconsidered. If the express object of this purchase was to vest this property, of the value of 12,0001. in trustees to transmit to the daughters of Lady <em>Arundell, </em>if she paid the value, 12,0001. to the creditors of Lord <em>Arundell, </em>that is not illegal. It is assuming a great deal to say it is delaying or defeating creditors. But, if so, it has in all time been sanctioned by this Court and Courts of law too. If the property transferred was of the immediate value, at which this has been stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Certainly then it ought to be submitted to the jury whether it was not fraudulent as to a great part. It is said the limitation to the daughters here is not to be deemed a part of the consideration of the settlement with ref- * * erence to the creditors. It is not necessary to touch upon that, if the property bore any reasonable proportion to the value of 12,000/. If it were necessary to discuss it, attention must be given to the cases of moral obligation, executed by a provision for persons, not the direct objects of the contract, in which that provision has been held such a part of the consideration as would support their interest, as well as those with regard to whom that contract was more directly entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Then as to possession, and the other circumstances relied on at law ; suppose the question arose the day after the deed was executed, and the 12,000Z. had become, under the circumstances, to all intents and purposes a part of the assets of Lord Arundell; which I see, was questioned at the bars suppose it proved the day after, that the property was worth that sum: could it have been contended, for the want of publicity, of an inventory, of possession, considering the nature of the subject, and the relation in which the parties stood, this would not have been a deed, the trusts of which must hare been executed for Lady <em>Arundell. </em>If it is contended that the deed was originally fraudulent, because no consideration was paid or what a Court of law would call colorable, all subsequent facts and enjoyment tell forcibly, connected with the objections to the deed, at the time of execution. They are evidence in the other case ; but such as, when the value is appreciated, ought to be stated to the jury, to be weighed, regard being had to the law, if the question had occurred immediately after the execution. The circumstances of not informing witnesses, the steward, &amp;e. would not have weighed with me ; as they are circumstances in almost every transaction of this nature ; and, therefore, not so unusual as to atford a fair ground of suspicion. Then as to the nature of the possession, what is the publicity to be ? Suppose there were no trustees | but an agreement without the interposition of trustees, by a covenant that this property, upon the wife\u2019s advancing 12,OOOZ. to the creditors of the husband should be to her separate use. The nature of the transaction must have left the legal property in the husband ; and I doubt extremely whether that could be a fraudulent possession even in a Court of law. Clearly it would not here. Suppose'this had been before marriage, and these articles had been settled as heir looms; and it is exactly the same, if after marriage and for valuable consideration ; what is the publicity shewing they are heir looms ? What is the nature of the property, and the sort of possession naturally to be looked for ? When Lady <em>Arundell </em>was making a settlement for the benefit of her daughters, afterwards in all probability to enjoy the possession of this ancieut family seat, there was neither legal nor moral fraud in taking the property, for wh\u2019ch she paid the value. But the nature of the property, the relation of the parties, the circumstances, that she should have no object but to transmit it to her family, and that she must live with him who sold it, those circumstances are very material as to the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201c It is said Lord <em>Ai undell </em>dealt with creditors, as if this was his property ; and there might he a considerable question-, whether his or the steward\u2019s dealings in conversation or correspondence with creditors, as if this-was part of the husbands property, is to be admitted in a question between husband and wife; more difficult perhaps between the creditors and the Sheriff; but it is exiremely possible, that such a case might be laid in evidence, with reference to her acts, that the dealings of the husband might be considered a part of her conduct with regard to the property ; and therefore that sort of evidence would be admissible against her. It was also-stated at the bar, that she has permitted a creditor, in more instances than- \" one, to take execution out of this property. That is a very material fact <em>} </em>but to be stated with some qualification. It is evidence that she did not believe the property to be her\u2019s ; but not conclusive evidence. She might let a part of her own property go to discharge a particular debt, by which she saw her husband pressed. That fact, therefore, ought to be examined' before it can be considered as having much influence one way'or the other. If is very difficult to fiud the means of taking the opinion of a Court of law in this particular ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The order was, that it should be admitted that the Sheriff returned <em>mullet bona; </em>that an action should be brought in the Court of Common Pleas for that return ; and Lady <em>Arundett </em>and the trustees should be at liberty to defend it; but in consequence of a fund having been provided for Lord <em>ArundetPs </em>creditors, an end was put to all further proceedings, and the case never came before the Court of Common Pleas. <em>(Atherly on </em>Marr. <em>Settlements, </em>172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">19. The modern English decisions seem to maintain a determined conflict with the strong- rule in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harden. </em>That case came under review in <em>Steward </em>v. <em>Lombe, </em>(1 <em>Brod. </em>&amp; <em>Bingh. </em>506.) In that case the Sheriff had taken a windmill in execution against one <em>W. B. </em>who was in possession of it with 'the farm on which it stood. <em>TV. B. </em>had before mortgaged the farm, describing it as one \u201c on which he had lately erected and placed a windmill.\u201d And in the same deed sold the windmill to the mortgagee, <em>habendum, </em>&amp;c. for <em>ever,proviso </em>that if the debt 1095/. should be paid at such a day, the deed to be void. \u00a1N o change of possession of the farm or mill followed. The mill was so constructed as to be removable at pleasure; and in an action by the mortgagee against the Sheriff, the jury were directed to answer two questions ; whether the mill was a mere chattel, and whether the property in it passed to the plaintiff, he never having taken corporal possession ? The jury found that the mill was a chattel but gave a verdict for the plaintiff, damages 270/.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">On a motion for a new trial, <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>(2 <em>T. R. </em>587) alone was cit\u2019 d for the defendan', and <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>(2 B. &amp; <em>P. </em>59,) and <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>(9 <em>East, </em>215) for the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Dallas, Ch. J. (after examining the question whether the mill was a fixture) said, \u201cthe next question is, whether, taking it to be a chattel,there, has been such a possession of it as will pass the property ? Now this is aot a case in which a separate and actual possession could have been ta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ken ; for, whether the mill was legally a fixture or not, it was at all events actually fastened to the land, and it was not to be expected, that the mortgagee should come to reside in a mill. Still, it is said, that according to the ease of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>actual possession is necessary to transfer the .property in a chattel. Before we consider that case, it may be observed, that this question does not arise upon the bankrupt law; it is not a case in which possession and visible ownership by a bankrupt has tended to procure him an unmerited credit; and even if it had been a case within the bankrupt laws, it would not have been a ease in which the appearance could excite a false credit This, however, is a case between mortgagor sand mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">The case of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben </em>has been dissented from often. In <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>Lord <em>Eldon, </em>Ch. J. cites and sane.ions the following passage from <em>Butler's Nisi Prius, </em>(258)\u201c The donor conti.miug in possession is not, in all cases, a mark of fraud, as where a donee lends his donor money to buy goods, and at the same time, takes a bill of sale of them for securing the money.\u201d <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson </em>was a case o\u00ed a bill of sale; but the party taking the bill, having permitted the party giving it t0 remain in possession, it was held, nevertheless, that the property remained in the party who received the bill. The present case is that of a mortgage, whei\u00bb the mortgagee, in conformity with the usual practice in such matters, permit, th\u00a3 mortgagor to remain in possession. In the case <em>of </em>Edwards v. <em>Harben, </em>the goods were such as pass from hand to hand, and might, therefore, without inconvenience, be transferred into actual possession ; here the chattel is of a very different description. Ii seems, therefore, that the constructive possession of the land under the deed is a sufficient possession of the mill standing on the land ; and the more so, as this was not an absolute conveyance^ but a mere pledge to be kept till money lent on the security of it was repaid. The only possession possible, in such a case, did take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Park, J. \u201c Supposing <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben </em>to be law, (though doubts have arisen as to the extent of the doctrine there laid down,) and possession to be necessary to confer the property in this mill, there has been such possession as was admitted by the nature of the case, which is very different irom the case of goods capable of being transferred from hand to hand; the possession of these by a supposed vendor, after sale, may be a badge of fraud; but would it not be ridiculous if the mortgagee should be required to come from another part of the country, and turn miller in order to take possession of his security ? This is a mortgage of land, by a party who is in the actual occupation of a mill, and if he relinguished his occupation, it would probably defeat all the ends of his mortgage. l\u00edo false credit has-been created by the transaction, and therefore the verdict must stand for the plaintiff,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Burrottgh &amp; Richardson, Js. were against a new trial mainly upon the ground that <em>quodam modo, </em>the mill was annexed to the land; and <em>Richardson, </em>J. added, \u201c That actual possession is not in all cases necessary ta transfer the property of chattels, appears from <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>and <em>Wat-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>kins </em>v. <em>Birch, </em>(4 <em>Taunt. </em>823.) ,The mill could not have been moved without inconvenience, and the mortgagee could only take actual possession by entering on the land unnecessarily, or by occupying the mill to his own personal inconvenience ; it was therefore perfectly consistent with the whole nature of the transaction, that the mortgagor should remain in possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">New trial denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">It is proper here to remark, that in <em>Steel </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; </em>Parry, (1 <em>Taunt. </em>381,) Lawrence, J. said, \u201c <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben </em>is good law, though not applicable here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVuf\">20. Exceptions to <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben </em>are multiplying in this country. In <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>(1 <em>Pickering's Rep. </em>288,) <em>A. </em>gave a bill of sale of a vessel to <em>B. </em>and <em>B. </em>promised in writing tq reconvey upon the payment pf a promissory note due from <em>A. B. </em>however did not take possession until 8 months after the delivery of the bill of sale. <em>Held, </em>nevertheless, that <em>J}'s </em>title was good against a&gt;= attachment made by a creditor of <em>A. </em>after such possession taken, <em>Putnam, </em>J. who delivered the opinion of the Court, recognizes <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben </em>as sound law ; S1 but there,\u201d he says, \u201c the vendee did not obtain possession under the bill of sale, <em>before the right of the creditors of the vendor </em>accruedand he relies for the distinction upon <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Donell, </em>(2 <em>B. &amp; A. </em>134;) and particularly the remarks of <em>Bayley, </em>J. who says that, \u201c where there was a deed executed, under which it is competent for a party to take possession immedi- tely, and he does not do so, hut omits it for six months, he was not aware of any case which decides that such omission would he fraudulent, so as to make the deed void under the statute of <em>Elizabeth. </em>If, indeed, the right of a third person had intervened, the deed might he void as against him.\u201d <em>Putnam, </em>J. continues, \u201c The vessel was liable to the attachment until the title of the vendee was completed by possession. That was the only objection which a creditor of the vendor could have made ; and that objec-. tion was removed before the vessel was attached. \u201c <em>Quod nullo interno vitio laborat, at objecto impedimento cessaf, remoto impedimento perse emergit.\u201d </em>He had before remarked, \u201c that the possession of the vendor after the bill of sale, unexplained, would render the conveyance void as against creditors ; hut such a possession may be explained as in <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>(2 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>59,) and be perfectly consistent with justice.\u201d The only explanation given in the case was, that the bill of sale was a mortgage to secure a sum of money. The money was payable on demand, and, indeed, except in the single particular, that the vendee got possession in fact before the Sheriff, the case was in all its features much like the principal one of <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Hopkins. </em>The ship was in port at the time of the mortgage, and the possession might have been immediately changed. That a change of possession need not accompany a mortgage, has been again and again decided in <em>Massachusetts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">21. In <em>Bedlam </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>(1 <em>Pickering's Rep. </em>389,) the question watt again before the Supreme Court of that state. The debtor mortgaged a brig tq secure a subsisting debt with future advances ; and the bill of sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>fcgntained a stipulation that the brig should remain in possession of the mortgagor till default of payment; and it was attached at the suit of the mortgagor\u2019s creditor before any change of possession or demand of possession. It is true, the brig was at sea, when the bill of sale or mortgage was executed ; but <em>Wilde, </em>J. who delivered the opinion of the Court, (\u00a1V. 397,) drops this circumstance, and considers the naked question, whether the possession of the mortgagor pursuant to a stipulation in the deed can, in any case, be considered evidence of fraud. \u201c But,\u201d says h e, \u201c It has been argued that the clause respecting possession was fraudulent as against creditors. Wo case, however, can be found in support of this objection. Similar stipulations in mortgage deeds are not uncommon,nor can they be considered unreasonable. Where, by the terms of the conveyance, the vendee is not to have possession until the performance, or non-perfo.nianee of a certain condition, there the vendor\u2019s continuing in possession, is no evidence of fraud, because it is consistent with the trust appearing on the face of the deed, and is not to be presumed to give a false credit to the vendor. 1 Such possession,\u2019 says <em>Buller, J. (Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>2 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>596,)\u2018comes within the rule, as accompanying and following the deed.\u2019 <em>(Stone </em>v. <em>Grubham, </em>2 <em>Bulstr. </em>226. <em>Bucknal </em>v. <em>Roiston, Prec. Chan. </em>285. <em>Jarman v. Wolloton, </em>3 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>620. <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Paxton, </em>5 <em>John. Rep. </em>258. <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>2 <em>B. &amp; P, </em>60. <em>Cadogan </em>v. <em>Kennet, Cowp. </em>432.) There are many cases on this point, but the principle now laid down, ji as never been questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\">\u201c An objection has also been made to the stipulation in the mortgage deed, for the security of future advances and responsibilities. Such a stipulation may have a fraudulent aspect, or may be satisfactorily explained, according to the attending circumstances. Where a mortgage is made merely to secure future advances, without any other consideration at the time, it might be void against creditors, as tending to facilitate collusion, and enabling the mortgagor to get credit on his property, without any notice that it was incumbered. But if the object of the mortgage be, as it was in the present case, to secure an existing demand, the addition of a clause protecting future advances, would not necessarily avoid the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u201c As to this point, and several others already noticed, the case under consideration cannot be distinguished from that of <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Maling, (2 D. </em>&amp; <em>E. </em>462.) That was a case depending on amortgage made for securing an advance, and such further sums as the mortgagee might afterwards advance; with a clause that until default of payment should be made, it should be lawful for the mortgagor to hold the ship, and take the profits for his own use and benefit. Much stress was laid in the argument on the clause for the security of advances to he made subsequently to the mortgage ; but the Court held that there was no objection to it, and that the mortgage was valid, notwithstanding that clause, and the one respecting the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u201c All these objections to the mortgage, therefore, are unavailing. And \u25a0f the mortgagees had appeared chargeable with neglect, in not taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>possession seasonably, it would have been only evidence of fraud, and-might have been explained, if submitted to the consideration of the j ury.. It has been always held in this state, that the possession of the vendor aftersale, is only evidence of fraud, and not sucha circumstance as, <em>perse, </em>necessarily invalidates the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">He then proceeds to consider another question, important to the creditor of a mortgagor ; and which, I believe, has not before been raised, i. e, whether the goods can be taken in execution subject to the incumbrance ? \u201c They must,\u201d says he, \u201c be the property of the debtor, and the attaching officer must have the right to seize them, and to hold possession, so that they may be finally taken in execution. Now there is no substantial difference, at common law, between a mortgage of real estate, and of a, chattel. In both cases, the property vests in the mortgagee, subject to be defeated by the performance of the condition; and on the forfeiture or non-performance of the condition, his interest becomes absolute. <em>(Powell on Mortgages, </em>3, 4.) It is therefore manifest, that th,e attaching officer had no legal right to seize the vessel, as the property of the mortgagors ; and that his attachment of the shares mortgaged was void. The same principle applies to pawns ; for if goods be pawned, and afterwards a judgment .is recovered against the pawner, the goods cannot be taken in execution, pntil the money is paid or tendered to the pawnee. <em>(The King </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>3 <em>Bulstr. </em>17. <em>Bro. Abr. Pledges, &amp;c. </em>28. 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>715, <em>Execution, </em>(C.) 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"AsV\">\u201c A mere equitable interest cannot be taken and sold on execution ; lb-, where there is no legal right, there is no legal remedy. This was settled on great deliberation by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in the case of <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Scholey etal.(0East,4K\u00a1 </em>;J and the reasons there given, are entirely satisfactory. The judgment of the Court in that case, was sanctioned by the Court of Common Pleas, in the case of <em>Metcalf et al. </em>v. <em>Scholey. et al. </em>(5 <em>B &amp; P. </em>461,) and is supported by all the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"AyL\">\u201c It is only by statute, that equities, or rights to redeem, are subject to attachment by ordinary process, and no statute has authorized the attachment of such interest in personal property. A creditor can reach such ail interest of his debtor only by resorting to a Court of Equity, where he may he let in to redeem incumbrances, <em>(Shirley v. Watts, </em>3 <em>Aik. 200,) </em>unless perhaps he may first remove the incumbrance, and then layan attachment on the property, as to which, however, we give no opinion. But until payment, or a tender of payment, of the money due to the mortgagee or pawnee of fhe goods and chattels,, it is very clear that' the creditor of the mortgagor or pawner has no remedy against them by attachment and execution.</p>\n<p id=\"ALU\">A mortgage of goods, as to the possession continuing in the mortgagor, has been considered by several of the state legislatures, on the same footjing with a mortgage of lands ; and provision by statute accordingly made for recording the mortgage in both cases. Such was the law of <em>Virginia, </em>as appeavsby <em>Clayborn v. Hill, (1 Wash. Rep. </em>177.) There it is valid, if recorded, otherwise not, where the possession continues with the mart? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>gagor. <em>(id.) </em>But in relation to absolute unconditional sales, the doctrine in <em>Edwards v. Harben, </em>and <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>is maintained in its highest tone, i. e. that retaining possession is, <em>per se, fraudulent in law, </em>not merely <em>evidence of fraud. (Fitsburgh </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>2 <em>Hen. </em>&amp; <em>Munf. Rep. </em>302, 3, <em>per Roane, J. Alexander </em>v. Deneale, 2 <em>Munf. </em>341. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Farley, Gilmer's Virgin. Rep. </em>15.) On the other hand, where a statute provides that bills of sale shall be registered, the mere circumstance of recording Will not be conclusive evidence of good faith ; but the sale may be impeached for fraud notwithstanding. Such is the law of <em>Maiyland, </em>where,it seems, the statute requires even an absolute bill of sale to be recorded; yet the vendor\u2019s continuing in possession, is evidence of fraud. <em>(Garrett </em>v. <em>Hughlett, </em>1 <em>Harris </em>&amp; <em>Johnson\u2019s Rep. </em>3.) In <em>North Carolina, </em>where, it Seems, the same statute regulation prevails, <em>(Hodges </em>v. <em>Blount, l Haywood\u2019s Rep. </em>414, 415, <em>per Cur.) </em>the authority of <em>Edwards </em>v. Harben, is denied, and possession declared <em>prima facie </em>evidence of fiaud merely j <em>(id. Vick </em>v. <em>Kegs, </em>2 <em>Haywood's Rep. </em>126. <em>Falkner </em>v. <em>Perkins, id. </em>224) while that case has been adopted in its greatest extent by the Judges of <em>Tennessee. (Raygan </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>1 <em>Tenn. Rep. </em>97.) So in' <em>South Carotina, (Kennedy </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>2 <em>Rep Constitutional Court, S. C. </em>125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">22. Another exception to the rule that possession is evidence of fraud, is established in this state, by <em>Vredenburgh </em>v. <em>White &amp; Stout, </em>(1 <em>John. Cas. </em>156.) There an insolvent assigned all his effects to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors but retained possession with the consent of the trustee, who advertised the goods for sale immediately ; hut before the day of sale, they were levied upon at the suit of a judgment creditor. The sale was holden valid, the possession being consistent with the real indent of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">23. In <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Swartwood, </em>(2 <em>Cowen\u2019s Rep. </em>431,) the vendee bespoke' a bureau of the vendor, who was a cabinet maker ; he completed the article, and for fear it should be taken in execution, sent to the vendee, who same and took a delivery, but removed it from the shop of the vendor to-his house to be trimmed and remain till snow came-, so that it might be removed by a sleigh. A constable levied upon the article by virtue ef au execution against the vendor, and the vendee recovered the value in trover, the sale being holden valid, and a possession thus explained no evidence of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">24. When to these we add the exception mentioned by the Chief Justice, as having been established in <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>(15 <em>Mass Rep. </em>244,) when we look at the nature of the 24 different exceptions to the rule in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>which are above enumerated, it is time to ask, what does the rule amount to ? What is it worth ? And does its preservation merit a \u25a0struggle ? Some of the exceptions are almost as broad as the rule itself. <em>The nature of the instrument of sale, the kind of sale, whether directly between the </em>parlies, or <em>on execution, or distress for rent, necessity, convenience, customs of doing business, the nature, quantity, relative value, distance, and place of the arh c les sold, the consideration, the relation of the parlies, honesty fairness, humanity, friendship, special circumstances, special reasons, Sic. </em>&amp;c. have, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>.their turn, been called in by the different cases to fritter down the rule,\" Sometimes the attempt to apply it strikes the Judges with such evident absurdity, that they no longer proceed by way of exception Instead of attempting to untie, they cut the knot at once by denying the existence of the rule. Such was the case in <em>Steward </em>v. Lombe, cited above, from 1 <em>Brod. </em>&amp; <em>Bing. </em>506. The counsel must have supposed it a strong rule indeed, when they asked the Court to use it for the Quixotic purpose of attacking and carrying a wind mill from one part of the kingdom to another. But the rule is worlh the less, because if you allow one half the exceptions which appear to be established, it can always be evaded. If the sale is to be absolute, it may be done through a voluntary judgment and execution ; if conditional, by a bill of sale in nature of a mortgage. Surely the Court act with judgmentin <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>when they say a voluntary and judicial sale are the same thing in effect. They do so by allowing possession to remain for an honest purpose after a voluntary sale. Had they said otherwise, they would afterwards have been baffled in a like case by the mere form of a distress for rent, or a sale upon a volun ary judgment; or a mortgage of the oxen to secure\" the*rent due or to become due.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\">It is not to be denied, that in relation to voluntary, direct and absolute bills of sale, the Judges of the King\u2019s Bench have adhered to the rule of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>in all its unmitigated severity. In <em>Paget </em>v. <em>Perchard, </em>(1 <em>Esp. Rep. </em>205,) tried before Ld. <em>Kenyon, </em>in 1794, it appeared that \u00e1 publican had attempted to secure her distillers by executing to them a bill of sale of all her effects, including liquors in her house, as well as furniture# <em>&amp;c. </em>on the <em>4th </em>of <em>Jlpril; </em>and a person had entered her house at 7 P. M.\" of that day, and taken possession, but he permitted her to sell liquour during the evening as usual, and to receive the money ; and she had not ac:-' counted for it. Ld. <em>Kenyon </em>said, that allowing her to appear as usual, mistress of the house, and to execute acts of ownership, after having parted with all her property by the bill of sale, was inconsistent with such situation, and a sufficient evidence of fraud as against <em>bona fide </em>executions. And the Sheriff having levied the next day, he non-suited the distillers# the vendees, who had brought trover for the goods. Again, in <em>Wordall </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(1 <em>Campl. Rep. </em>332,) before Ld. <em>E'llmborough, </em>in 1808, even in\" an action for a false return upon a <em>fi.fa. </em>against the Sheriff for not levying an execution against one <em>Mason, </em>on certain goods, being his household furniture and stock in trade, as a publican ; it appeared that before the issuing of the <em>fi. fa. </em>he had given a bill of sale of these goods to one of his creditors, who immediately put his servant into the house; but <em>Mason </em>and his wife continued to carry on the business as usual, for several weeks after ; during which time, with the assent of the servant employed to keep possession, they sold beer and put the money into the till, to which they had access. And, <em>per Ld. Ellenborough, </em>\u201c To defeat the execution by a bill of sale, there must appear to have been a <em>bona fide, </em>substantial change of possession. It is a mere mockery to put in another person to take possession jointly with the former owners of the goods. A concurrent pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>session with the assignor is colorable. There must be an exclusive poshession under the assignment, or it is fraudulent and void as against creditors.\u201d These were <em>nisi prius </em>cases ; and it might be sufficient to remark, that neither of them was a mere unrnixt case of possession. In addition to possession, strong and distinct acts of ownership were permitted, and in the last case this continued for a considerable time. In the first, the bill of sale was, moreover, general, probably <em>not even excepting the donor\u2019s apparel. </em>These were relied on as strong marks of fraud in <em>Twyne\u2019s </em>case. Ld. <em>Kenyon </em>puts <em>Paget </em>v. <em>Purchard, </em>upon these actso-\u2019 ownership, in addition to which he was doubtless influenced by the generality of the gift. And though Ld. Ellenborough, in the last, lays the main stress on' possession, yet this was not necessary ; for <em>Twyne\u2019s </em>is a point blank ease to overthrow the gift upon the acts of ownership. The learned editor of <em>Espinasse's Reports. </em>(Mr. <em>Day) </em>in a note to <em>Paget &amp; Purchard, </em>takes occasion to advert to <em>Hamilton </em>v. Russell, (1 <em>Cranch, </em>310,) and he says no other case goes so far as to say that possession is <em>itself a fraud. </em>He considers <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Raw</em>linson, opposed to that position. This note was published in 1808. I imagine it will he found that the weight of authority since that time, decidedly sustains <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson ; </em>and even goes far beyond that case, in sanctioning a mere possession continued in strict and open subordination to the rights of the vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">But whichever way the decisions may tend upon the question of possession in the vendor, alter a voluntary, direct and absolute bill of sale ; so far as the statute of <em>Elizabeth </em>is concerned, <em>(and vid. farther, 1 Gall. Rep. 422,per Story, J. and </em>1 <em>Halst. N. J. Rep. </em>155,) no doubt can be entertained at this day, that a continued possession in a <em>mo.igagor </em>of chattels is not, <em>per se, </em>evidence of fraud, either as to purchasers or creditors. So long ago asLadyLem&amp;e/I\u2019s <em>case, (Ship. Touch. </em>67,). this xvassettledin relaiion to chattels real. A termor had mortgaged his term for years to B, upon condition that if he repaid the money to B a year after, he should re-enter, and B covenanted that the mortgagor sho ild take the profits of the land until that time, &amp;c. The moi tgagor did not pay, and B, hoping that he would pay in time, suffered him to continue in possession, and take the profits two or three years after; and in the inter! ;n, j udg-nent and execution was obtained against the mortgagor. <em>Held, </em>that execution should not be made of this lease, for the mortgage should not he said to be fraudulent as to the creditor : and when a conveyance is not fraudulent at the time of making it,it shall never be said tobe so for any matter <em>ex post facto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">That mortgages of personal chattels have been of long and ex.ensive practice in this state ; and considered, with reference to possession, much in the same light with real estate Or chattels real, and subject to much the same evils, appears by an oid colonial statute, passed <em>December </em>31, 1786. <em>(Van Schaick\u2019s ed. of Col. Statutes, </em>524.) This act recites, that divers frauds had been committed in <em>Dutchess, </em>Richmond, <em>Orange </em>and <em>Queens </em>counties, by persons mortgaging their goods and then selling to others, ignorant of the mortgage ; and provides, that such mortgages, not under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Value of \u00a35, nor over \u00a3100, should be inoperative as to subsequent purchasers, unless oath was first made before a magistrate that it was not given to defraud; and the mortgage was thereupon recorded in the town clerk\u2019s office, &amp;e. This act expired by its own limitation, in 1771 ; and has not been, renewed. 1 before' remarked, that permanent provisions of a similar character have been made upon this subject, in several of the states. Thestatuiesof <em>Virginia, North Sc South Carolina, </em>and <em>Georgia? </em>may be seen in a digest of the laws of those states, concerning con-veyances, in a supplement to <em>Sheppard's Tombstone, </em>by Mr. <em>Antlion, psi-</em>467, 501-2, 543-4, 467.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
