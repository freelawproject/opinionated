The first count was on the note, and the second and third were the common money counts, and an account stated. <em>Rochester </em>and <em>Atkinson </em>pleaded <em>nonassumpsit ; </em>and, to the first count, that the note was fraudulently and oppressively obtained, setting forth the particulars. Upon the receipt of this plea, the plaintiff entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to them, and took a judgment by default against Atkinson, which it was now moved to set aside as irregular. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-13\"><em>E. </em>Pomeroy, for. the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADST\">said the <em>nolle prosequi </em>was a discontinuance as to all the defendants. <em>(Noke </em>v. <em>Ingham, </em>1 <em>Wills. </em>89. <em>Hariness </em>v. <em>Thompson et al. </em>5 <em>John. Rep. </em>160. <em>Morton v. Croghan, </em>20 <em>John. Rep. </em>122, <em>per Spencer, Ch. </em>J\u00f3 1 <em>Chit. Plead. </em>546. Tidd, 632.) The result of these authorities is, that in actions in form <em>ex delicto, </em>the plaintiff may enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to one of several defendants j but in actions <em>ex contractu, </em>unless the defence go merely to the personal discharge of one, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>cannot be entered as to one and the suit be continued as to the other, but the <em>nolle prosequi </em>discontinues the suit as to the whole-Actions <em>ex contractu, </em>against several, are joint. The plaintiff, to sustain his action, must shew a joint contract made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>all; and a plea, by one, to the action of the writ, enures to the benefit of all the defendants. (1 <em>Chit. Pl. 31,32. Boulter </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>1 <em>Sid. </em>76. <em>Sheriff </em>v. <em>Wilkes et al. </em>1 <em>East, </em>52. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Palmer et al. </em>1 <em>Esp. Rep. </em>135.) That the note is joint and <em>several, </em>makes no difference. The plaintiff has elected to proceed against the defendants jointly; and, for the purposes of this question, the demand must be treated as a joint one.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-7\"><em>F. M. Haight, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-W\">said there was ho direct authority for this application. In <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Croghan, </em>cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel, the decision is put on the ground that the defendants were all <em>necessarily </em>parties. Accordingly, per <em>Spencer, </em>J. \u201c Where all the defendants are necessarily parties, and the plaintiff was obliged to make them parties, as in a proceeding against terre-tenants, a discontinuance as to some is a discontinuance as <em>to </em>all.\u201d Here the action was not <em>necessarily </em>joint. It might have been several; and it is the same thing to the defendant <em>(Atkinson) </em>as if he, alone, had been sued.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b371-8\">Curia.</author>\n<p id=\"AIAp\">The distinction contended for, by the defendants\u2019 counsel, is fully borne out by the cases to which he refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
