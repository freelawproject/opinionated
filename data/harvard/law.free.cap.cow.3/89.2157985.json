On the trial, the lessors of the plaintiff showed the following title : 1. A deed duly acknowledged and proved, dated the <em>2d </em>day <em>January, </em>1818, from JV\". <em>Rochester, C. Carroll, </em>and <em>William Fitzburgh, </em>to <em>William Robb, </em>for lots number 61, 62 and 63, in the village of <em>Rochester. </em>The deed was executed by JV. <em>Rochester, </em>for himself, and for <em>Carrol </em>and <em>Fitzburgh, </em>by JV\". <em>Rochester, </em>their attorney. 2. An exemplification of a judgment in the Supreme Court, in favour of <em>Jonathan R. Hale, </em>against <em>Robb, </em>for $483,62, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>filed <em>August SOth, </em>1819, and an <em>alias testatum, fi. fa. </em>on this judgment, directed to the Sheriff of the county of <em>Genessee,</em>tested August, and returnable <em>October </em>term, 1820. It was then proved on the part of the plaintiff, that the above lots 61, 62, and the north half of 63, were sold by virtue of the execution, by <em>Oliver Lee, </em>a Deputy Sheriff, on the <em>4th </em>day of <em>October, </em>1820, to <em>Ralph Wadhams, </em>for $535,50, being the full amount of the execution and Sheriff\u2019s costs, and it was further proved, that at the time of the sale. <em>Lee </em>gave to <em>Wad* hams </em>a certificate that, at the expiration of 15 monihs, ho would be entitled to a deed. The plaintiff then produced a deed duly proved, dated the <em>9th </em>day of <em>Februray, </em>1822, of the above premises, from <em>Parmenio Adams, </em>late Sheriff of the county of <em>Genessee, </em>by <em>Oliver Lee, </em>deputy, to <em>Ralph Wadhams, </em>the purchaser, for the consideration of $535,50 ; and a quit-claim deed, duly proved, from <em>Wadhams </em>to <em>Scoi field, </em>the lessor, dated the <em>18th </em>day <em>o\u00ed February, </em>1822. for the consideration of 600 dollars. It was also proved by the plaintiff, that the defendant, at the time of the demise in the declaration, and at the time of trial, was in possession of the premises, and that he confessed that he rented the premises of one <em>Harvey Montgomery ; </em>and that <em>Montgomery, </em>four or five years since, said that he had the premises in question, of Robb, from whom the lessor of the plaintiff claimed title.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Axh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>jn ejectment, an objection cannot be made at the plaintiff failed at the trial to make out a title, unless such objection was previously made at the trial.

He stated that <em>Scofield, </em>the lessor, handed him the execution in favour of <em>Hale, </em>against <em>Robb, </em>and directed him to sell the premises in question, stating, at the same time, that he had bought the judgment of <em>Hale ; </em>that at the time he sold the premises, he informed the by-stapd<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ers the amount of the execution, and the sum he wished to raise, and that there were several bids from different persons; that Wadhams, to whom it was sold, overbid the rest. The witness further stated, that the purchase money was not paid by <em>Wadhams, </em>at the time of the sale ; that, in a conversation between the lessor of the plaintiff and Wadhams, after the sale, <em>Scofield, </em>the lessor, offered to take <em>Wadham\u2019s </em>note ; witness saw <em>Scofield </em>and <em>Wadhams </em>sit down at a table to write, but did not see <em>Wadhams </em>deliver the note to <em>Scofield </em>; that at the time they were writing the note, the witne\u00abs left the room. Soon after, Scofield, the lessor, as Assignee of <em>Bale, </em>receipted the execution in full. It appeared that Scofield, at the time the premises wer\u00e9 sold, was s Deputy Sheriff of the county of <em>Genessee.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">From the above facts, it was contended by the defendant, \u00cd. That <em>Wadhams </em>was the trustee of <em>Scofield, </em>and purchased the land for his benefit. 2. That the purchase was void,<em>Scofield </em>being a deputy at the time. 3. That the deed given by <em>Lee, </em>the deputy, after <em>Mams, </em>the Sheriff, went out of office, 77as void ; and 4. That if <em>Wadhams </em>was not the trustee of <em>Scofield, </em>there was an adverse possession on the 18th day of February, 1822, at the date of Wadhams? deed to <em>Scofield, </em>the lessor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court on the above case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-9\"><em>H. D. Mason </em>&amp; J. C. <em>Spencer, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6Jz\">The\u2019 16th section of the act concerning judgments and executions,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> is general, and forbids a Sheriff to whom an exeeution is directed, and his deputies, from purchasing; but this must mean the officer acting in the sale, or to whom the process is delivered. If not so, then a deputy having a judgment, cannot adopt the only effectual means of getting his money, that of bidding under the execution ; for, in such a ease, the execution cannot go to the coroner. It goes to him only when the <em>Sheriff </em>is interested, <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c Such a construction ought to be put on a statute as may best answer the intenlion which the makers had in view ; and this intention is sometimes to be collected from the case or necessity of ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>king the statute, and sometimes from other circumstances,- and when\u00e9ver such intention can be discovered, it ought to' be followed with reason and discretion in the construction oi the statute, although such construction seem contrary to the letter of the statute ; and a thing which is within the letter of a statute, is not within the statute, unless it be within the intention of the makers.\u201d These propositions are sustained and illustrated by various English cases of construction upon statutes where the Courts have departed from the letter in order to reach the spirit and intent of the act. <em>(Reniger v. Foggassa, Plowd. </em>18. <em>Straunge </em>v. <em>Croker, id. </em>88. 2 <em>Inst. </em>64. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Younger, 5 T. R. </em>449. <em>Margate Pier Co. </em>v. <em>Hannani, </em>3 <em>B. &amp; A. </em>266. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Deck, </em>4 <em>id. </em>212, <em>per Holroyd, J.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI1\">Here was not an adverse possession in the defendant at the time of <em>WadhamPs </em>conveyance to <em>Scofield. </em>If the former was the trustee of the latter, as insisted by one of the defendant\u2019s points, and which we concede, of course, adverse possession is out of the question. But, proc\u00e9eding upon the ground that <em>Wadhams </em>purchased for his own b\u00e9nefit, we de&lt; ny that there was such an adverse possession as prevented his conveying to <em>Scofield. </em>The defendant, <em>Collins, </em>held under <em>Montgomery, </em>who purchased of <em>Robb, </em>the defendant in the judgment and execution. Both <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Collins </em>were <em>quasi </em>the tenants of the purchaser, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-F\"><em>'^ee </em>had a right to convey, though his principal had gon'd out of office.\u2019 The sale was complete on the 14&lt;/\u00bf October, 1820. The Sheriff had obeyed the execution ; and all that remained was to give' the evidence of the sale, if the property should not be redeemed. In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bush,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the \u00a3ourt say; (\u00ed a sale, and the consummation of that sale by a deed, are acts which the Sheriff may do by deputy. The law does not require them to be done by the Sheriff in person.\u201d Here no distinction is made between the deputy of a Sheriff out of office, or one in. The case, indeed, did not call for it; but as far as it goes, it shows that the. deputy <em>maY </em>do whatever the Sheriff can. <em>Lee </em>was proved to be a general deputy.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> Execution being an entire thing, he \u00b0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>who begins must end it, and therefore, if a Sheriff seize goods, and is removed, yet he is to proceed in the sale.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> The authority of the principal, therefore, continued ;<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> and an authority fiom him to the deputy being indefinite in time is not revoked unless it be countermanded, or cease by the death of the principal or agent. <footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> The appointment of a deputy is so long as the principal shall be Sheriff, or have any thing to do as Sheriff; and if he may execute process after he is out of office, he does this as Sheriff. So far has this doctrine been carried, that on the renewal of a Sheriff\u2019s commission under the old constitution, no new appointment of an Under Sheriff was necessary ; neither need his bond be renewed ; but he continued Under Sheriff, and his bond continued in full <em>force.</em><footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> Dallon, </em>in his treatise on the office of Sheriff,<footnotemark>(j)</footnotemark> calls the Under Sheriff (who answers to our deputy) the <em>attorney </em>of the Sheriff; and that he may be appointed at will, and revoked as an attorney may be. Why may not a removed Sheriff appoint an attorney to do that which the principal is authorized to perform ? And what is the difference whether the appointment be before or after his removal ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-12\">No objection to <em>Robb\u2019s </em>title was taken at the trial. It is too late to raise it now. But it is unfounded in point of fact. <em>Rochester\u2019s </em>authority to execute the deed, was not questioned at the trial. Besides, <em>Montgomery </em>claimed under <em>Robb.</em><footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-14\"><em>W. C. Van \u00a1Ness Sp J. A. Collier, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-15\">No title is shewn in the lessor of the plaintiff. Even <em>aprima facie </em>case was not made ; and this is not one of that class of objections from which we are precluded by having omitted to make it at the trial. The objection goes to the merits ; there is a defect in the title; and the defendant shall not be precluded from urging it merely because other objections were made at the trial.<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ard\">The Deputy Sheriff had no power to execute a deed after the Sheriff, his principal, was removed from office. We can 6nd no adjudged case upon this subject, but contend that af- <em>' </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ter the Sheriff is removed from office, the power of his dep-' uv <em>,s&gt; ipso jacio, </em>at an end ; and that, at all events, no one can thereafter act without <em>new </em>and <em>special </em>authority from the Sheriff. He and his sureties would not be bound for the misconduct of his deputy after the expiration of his term of office. Suppose the deputy should sell the goods of a stranger, after the Sheriff\u2019s term of office had expired ; would he he liable for this act of his <em>late </em>deputy ? Previous to the redemption act, (as it is called) suppose the <em>late </em>deputy of a <em>late </em>Sheriff should have given a <em>deed, </em>without any previous levy or sale\u2014nothing more need be shewn than the judgment, execution and Sheriff\u2019s deed, to entitle the plaintiff to recover. Would such a deed from the <em>late </em>deputy be sufficient, then, to authorize a judgment against the defendant in possession ? There is <em>no responsibility </em>resting upon the <em>late </em>deputy. He acts under no oath of office. His <em>own sureties </em>would not be bound beyond the period of the Sheriff\u2019s term, and neither the Sheriff nor his <em>sureties </em>for any act after this period. The authority of an agent or attorney ceases upon the death of his principal. Does not the power and authority of a deputy also cease, upon the <em>political death </em>of the Sheriff ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-3\">The defendant, (or Montgomery) was in possession, claiming adversely, at the date of the deed to the lessor of the-plaintiff. The defendant had <em>rented </em>the premises of <em>Montgomery, </em>and neither of them acknowledged any subsisting interest in <em>Robb. </em>The defendant claimed to hold under his lease, and Montgomery, who said he <em>had </em>the premises of <em>Robb, </em>claimed and exercised the right of leasing the premises to the defendant, without the privity or consent of <em>Robb </em>or any other person ; and the defendant was in possession -under the lease.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b87-16\"> 1 R.

Title was in <em>Robb </em>the 2d <em>January, </em>1818, and judgment <em>August 30th, </em>1819. The presumption is, therefore, in the absence of all proof to the contrary, that it continued in him during the intermediate time. Besides, had the objection been taken at the trial, that fact might have been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>9. It is objected that <em>Lee, </em>as deputy to <em>Adams, </em>had no Tight to execute a deed after <em>Adams </em>was out of office, Lee being no longer deputy. It is not denied that during <em>Adams\u2019 </em>continuance in office, the deputy had authority to do any act which his principal could do in his official capacity, except the appointment of deputies, (and <em>vid. Parker </em>v. <em>Kett, </em>1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>659, and S. <em>C. </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>95.) But it is contended that the authority of the deputy ceased when the new Sheriff had \u2022taken the office upon him. . In my opinion, the authority of the deputy is limited by the duration of the authority of his principal. An execution against the .property of a defendant, partly executed by the old Sheriff, shall be completed by him, and in relation to any such execution in the Sheriff\u2019s hands, when he goes out of office, he continues Sheriff, and may act by deputy, as if he was still in office. He is in office <em>quoad </em>hoc, and the acts of a deputy in relation to such an execution are the acts of the Sheriff himself. Even in the case of a <em>ca. sa. </em>upon which the defendant has been arrested, and is imprisoned, it is optional with the old Sheriff whether he will transfer the prisoner to the new Sheriff. The old Sheriff has a right to retain the custody of the prisoner, and complete the execution of the writ. <em>(Hempstead </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>20 <em>John. </em>64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">3. There was no adverse possession shewn, to defeat the operation of the deed, either from the Sheriff to <em>Wadhams, </em>or from <em>Wadhams </em>to the lessor of the plaintiff.-</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">4. It is made a point, that <em>Wadhams </em>was a mere trustee for <em>Scofield, </em>and that he, being a deputy of the Sheriff at the time of the sale, was prohibited by statute from purchasing. The statute is, \u201c that it shall not be lawful for any Sheriff, or other officer, to whom any such execution shall be directed, or any of their deputies, or any person for them or either of them, to purchase any goods or chattels, lands or tenements, at any sale, by virtue of any execution, and all purchases so made by them, or any of them, or for the use of them, or any of them, shall be void.\u201d Admitting, as the plaintiff does, that <em>Wadhams </em>purchased for the use of <em>Scofield, </em>the purchase comes within the letter of the act, but it could never have been the intention of the legislature to have prevented a Deputy Sheriff, when plaintiff in an execution, from bidding, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>order to secure his money. The object was to prevent abusq \u2014that tiie Sheriff or his deputies should not be allowed to, become purchasers at their own sales, and thereby be induced to conduct corruptly in relation to them. But surely it was n&lt;2vev intended to place those persons in a worse situation than others, as to the collection of their own demands. \u201c Whenever the intention of the makers of a statute can be discovered, it ought to be followed with reason and discretion in the construction of the statute, although such construction seem contrary to the letter of the statute.\u201d <em>(Bac. Ab. tit. </em>Statute, (I) 15 <em>John. </em>380, <em>per Ch. J. </em>Thompson.) A thing which is within the letter of a statute is not within the statute, unless it be within the intention of the makers. This proposition is fully established and illustrated by the cases cited on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that <em>Scofield </em>had a right to bid and purchase, <em>bona fide, </em>as we are to presume he did in this case ; for fraud, of any kind, is not imputed. The plaintiff, is accordingly entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
