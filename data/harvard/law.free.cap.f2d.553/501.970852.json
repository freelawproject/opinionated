Petitioner contends that the evidence used at the deportation hearing to establish his deportability was inadmissible because he had been illegally arrested and detained. We find no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-25\">The uncontested evidence shows that an Immigration and Naturalization Service of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ficer, having received an anonymous telephone call that the Monterey Restaurant was employing illegal aliens, visited the restaurant on May 20, 1976 and stated to petitioner that he was searching for illegal aliens. Petitioner responded that he was the only illegal alien employed there and volunteered information that he had been \u201cpicked up before.\u201d Petitioner was arrested and taken to the Immigration and Naturalization Service office in Atlanta, where he signed a statement admitting his alien-age as well as an illegal entry into the United States in January, 1974. This statement and petitioner\u2019s oral statements prior to arrest were received in evidence at the deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Under the express authority of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a)(1) and (2) the warrantless arrest was legal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s voluntary admissions prior to arrest formed a sufficient basis for the arresting officer to believe that petitioner might abscond before a warrant could be obtained, thus justifying the warrantless arrest. The Board of Immigration Appeals, which sustained the order of the Immigration judge, so held. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AAE\">.
