White and W. W. White, Jr., through their attorney in fact, confessed a judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>favor of the National Bank of Suffolk in the clerk\u2019s office of the Circuit Court of Southampton county. On the same date the clerk entered the following order in the book kept by him among the records in his office, and labeled and designated as \u201cCommon Law Order Book\u2014Confession of Judgment\u2014No. 1\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\">\u201cVirginia: In the Clerk\u2019s Office of the Circuit Court of Southampton County, the 15th day of January, 1931.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">National Bank of Suffolk v.

White and W. W. White, Jr., which were promptly docketed in the same clerk\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Shortly subsequent to the docketing of the appellants\u2019 judgments, the National Bank of Suffolk filed a suit in equity to subject certain lands of Allie M. White to the lien of its confessed judgment. The appellants, who had been made parties defendant to the bill, answered attacking the validity of the confessed judgment. From a decree holding the confessed judgment valid, this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The validity of the judgment in question depends upon the construction of the act of the General Assembly pertaining to the confession of judgments, approved March 27, 1922, Acts 1922, ch. 440, p. 765, as amended by Acts 1923, Ex. Sess., ch. 162, p. 201, and as further amended by Acts 1926, ch. 448, p. 744.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">So much of the act as was in effect at the date of the confession of the judgment, January 15, 1931, and is here material, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">\u201c(a) Any person being indebted to another person, may, at any time confess judgment in the clerk\u2019s office of any court of record in this Commonwealth, whether a suit, motion or action be pending therefor or not, for so much principal and interest as his creditor may be willing to accept a judgment for, which judgment, when so confessed, shall be forthwith entered of record by the clerk in whose office it is confessed, in the proper order book of his court, and shall be as final and as binding as though confessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>in open court or rendered by the court, subject to the control of the court in which rendered, and may be set aside only for fraud or other like taint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">\u201c(b) The clerk shall enter on the margin of the record of such judgment, the day and hour when the same was confessed, and the lien thereof shall attach and be binding from the time of such confession so entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\"><em>*M. </em>\u00abU. \u00abS\u00ed.

The same shall be entered of record by the clerk in the order or minute book and be as final and as valid as if entered in court on the day of such confession, except merely that the court shall have such control over it as is given by section sixty-one hundred and forty. And the said clerk shall enter upon the margin of such book opposite where the said judgment or decree is entered the date and time of the day at which the same was confessed, and the lien of the said judgment or decree shall run only from the time of day of the confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Section 6130 provides for the confession of judgments \u201cin vacation of the court,\u201d while the Act of 1922, as amended, provides for the confession of judgments \u201cat any time.\u201d Aside from this there is a marked similarity in the language used in section 6130 and that employed in subsections (a) and (b) of the Act of 1922, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Section 6130 requires that the judgment be entered of record by the clerk \u201cin the order or minute book,\u201d while the Act of 1922, as amended, directs that it be entered \u201cin the proper order book.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Again, section 6130 requires the clerk to enter on the margin of the order book \u201cthe date and time of the day at which the same was confessed,\u201d while the- Act of 1922, as amended, directs the clerk to enter \u201cthe day and hour when the same was confessed\u201d \u201con the margin of the record of such judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In <em>Shadrack\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Woolfolk, </em>32 Gratt. (73 Va.) 707, in construing the confession of judgment statute then in effect (substantially similar to section 6130 of Code 1919), this court held that the requirement that the clerk should enter the judgment in his order or minute book was merely directory, and that his failure to do so did not invalidate the judgment. It was there said (32 Gratt. (73 Va.) 707, at p. 716) : \u201cThe object of the entry is to give the judgment a more enduring form; where it might be preserved, seen and inspected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">This holding was adhered to in <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Lipscomb, </em>90 Va. 647, 652, 19 S. E. 450, 451, with the added observation that section 3283, Code 1887 (section 6130, Code 1919), \u201cbeing mainly declaratory of the common law, requires only substantial compliance, in order to render valid a judgment <em>bona fide </em>confessed in the clerk\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">See also, <em>Manson &amp; Shell </em>v. <em>Rawlings\u2019 Ex\u2019rs, </em>112 Va. 384, 386, 387, 71 S. E. 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\"> In view of the interpretation which this court has placed upon Code, section 6130, with which the General Assembly is presumed to have been familiar, it is hardly likely that there would have been written in the Act of 1922 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>language so similar to that in Code, section 6130, unless such interpretation met with the approval of the General Assembly. On the contrary if the legislature had intended that the failure of the clerk to make such entry should render the confessed judgment void, as claimed by the appellants, it is fair to assume that the act would have plainly said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The failure of the act to invalidate the judgment by reason of the clerk\u2019s not making the required entry becomes all the more significant when we consider that in subsection (i) the legislature has expressly'said that a judgment confessed by virtue of a warrant or power of attorney which does not comply with the statute shall be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Likewise, we think there is no merit in the contention that the lien of the confession judgment, under the Act of 1922, as amended, runs only from the date of the entry of the order by the clerk in the \u201cproper order book.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">It will be observed that under the language of section 6130 \u201cthe lien of the said judgment or decree shall run only from th\u00e9 time of day of the confession.\u201d The language in subsection (b) of the Act of 1922, as amended, is, we think, to the same effect when it provides that \u201cthe lien thereof shall attach and be binding from the time of such confession so entered.\u201d In the latter instance the lien runs \u201cfrom the time of such confession,\u201d and the words \u201cso entered\u201d are merely descriptive of the clerk\u2019s ministerial duties with reference to recording the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Code, section 6470, provides, among other things, that \u201cA judgment by confession in vacation shall also be a lien upon such real estate, but only from the time of day at which such judgment is confessed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">If the contention of the appellants be sound, and the lien of the judgment dates only from the time of the entry thereof by the clerk in the order book, then the Act of 1922, as amended, is in conflict with the provisions of section 6470, with respect to judgments \u201cby confession in vacation,\u201d while the construction contended for by the appellee bank, and sustained by us, harmonizes these two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>It follows from what we have already said that the failure of the clerk to \u201cforthwith docket such judgment,\u201d as required by subsection (g) of the Act of 1922, as amended, does not invalidate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The object and purpose of docketing judgments is to give notice to purchasers for value and without notice of the real estate of the judgment debtor. Code, sections 6470, 6471. It was not designed to protect judgment creditors. Burks\u2019 Pleading and Practice (3d Ed.), secs. 316, 318, 323; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Rixey, </em>76 Va. 694, 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"> The added provisions found in the Act of 1922, and not incorporated in Code, section 6130, are obviously intended for the protection of the confession judgment debt- or, and not his creditors. The judgment conforms in all respects with these added safeguards. Consequently, \u201cIf the judgment is valid as to the debtor, it is equally so as to the creditor, unless it can be impeached on some ground of fraud or collusion.\u201d <em>Shadrack\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Woolfolk, </em>supra, 32 Gratt. (73 Va.) 707, at p. 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The decree is</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\">See also, Miehie\u2019s Code of 1936, sec. 6130a, which contains the above-mentioned act as further amended by Acts 1934, ch. 298, p. 479; 1936, ch. 158, p. 275, ch. 222, p. 374.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
