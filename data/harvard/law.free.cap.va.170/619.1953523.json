This request was refused. The warrant, with the finding of the trial justice, was given to the jury and they arrived at the identical punishment which had been meted out to her by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\"> The court is of opinion that upon a trial of an appeal from a trial justice, it is improper for the jury to be informed of the <em>quantum </em>of punishment given an accused by the trial justice. Code, section 4989, as amended by Acts 1932, ch. 172, and section 4990 provide that such an appeal must be tried <em>de novo. </em>When the warrant with the finding of the trial justice written thereon was given to the jury in this case, it effectually told the jury how much punishment he had given the accused. For this error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
