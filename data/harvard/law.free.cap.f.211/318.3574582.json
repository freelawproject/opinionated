On the same day appellants also filed a petition asking the court to appoint a receiver, and the court, at once made such an appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-12\">On December 2, 1913, appellee filed its answer, in which it \u201cdenies that it has committed any of the acts of bankruptcy set forth in said petition, or that it is insolvent, or at the time of filing such involuntary petition in bankruptcy was insolvent, and that it should not be declared bankrupt for any cause in said petition alleged.\u201d At the same time the Oudahy Packing Company, a creditor, filed an answer denying the allegations of the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-13\">Upon December 4, 1912, the judge referred the petition of appellants and the \u201canswer\u201d (not answers) to a^ special master with instructions \u201cto set a day for hearing, and notify the parties, and to take the testimony in said matter and report the same to this court, together with his findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-14\">On January 11, 1913, the special master filed his report, in which he showed that on December 26, 1912, he set the cause for hearing at the court house in La Porte, Ind., on January 9, 1913, and notified the parties in interest and also their attorneys of record, and that at the time and place set for hearing the cause came on for hearing, and that appellants and their counsel failed to appear. The master further reported that appellee by counsel and the Cudahy. Packing Company by counsel were present, and called one Parkhurst, president of appellee, as a witness, and that the witness was sworn and examined. The master then certified that said witness \u201ctestified in substance as follows,\u201d setting out in narrative form Parkhurst\u2019s statements that the real estate, plant and machinery of appellee on November 7, 1912, were of the cash value of $240,000, against which there was a bonded indebtedness of $64,500, and that the merchandise then on hand was worth in cash $61,000, and that there were accounts receivable worth $7,500 net, and that all of appellee\u2019s indebtedness in excess of said bonded indebtedness was $60,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-15\">In appellants\u2019 petition for the appointment of a receiver is set out a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>which the president of appellee had sent on November 8, 1912, asking for a conference with its creditors. In this letter, after a statement of the floating debt, the following statement appears: \u201cWhile this amount is not large, we are unable to meet these claims promptly and continue our business. We hope to have a full representation and have you examine our plant and equipment for doing business. We have been handicapped by having too much invested in our plant and too little working capital. It looks as though we could procure business enough if we could put ourselves in shape to take care of it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-3\">On February 10, 1913, appellants filed certain exceptions to the report of the special master. These exceptions are noticed in the opinion. And at the same time appellants filed a motion that they be granted leave to dismiss, and that 10 days\u2019 notice be given to all creditors of the contemplated dismissal, or that the original petition for adjudication be again referred to a special master. This petition alleged that appellants believed that appellee \u201cis hopelessly insolvent,\u201d but failed to tender or refer to any evidence, newly discovered or otherwise, in support of the alleged belief. And on February 13, 1913, the court overruled said exceptions and motion and entered the decree appealed from, adjudging that appellee was not and is not a bankrupt, and that the petition be dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-4\">Israel Cowen, of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-5\">Ellsworth E.

This confession is said to be brought about by the wording of the answer to the effect that appellee denied that it should not be declared a bankrupt. But the argument overlooks the phrases that immediately follow the word \u201cdenies,\u201d and couples the second negative with the original denial, while the second negative was evidently intended, from the context, to be an additional independent denial. At all events, after a hearing upon the petition and the answer without objection, there is no merit in the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> Counsel challenges the sufficiency of the verification of appellee\u2019s answer. But on examination of the record it appears that it is the appellants\u2019 own petition, and not appellee\u2019s answer, that is verified on information and belief. But if appellee\u2019s answer had been only verified in the same way, appellants could not well call for a better verification than they gave. This matter, also, became utterly immaterial when the case was heard on these pleadings without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> An insistence is made that the order of reference is insufficient to support any decree based upon a report under the reference, on the ground that the matter submitted to the special master was the issue formed by the petition and \u201cthe answer thereto.\u201d The point is that since the appellee and a creditor had each filed an answer, appellants could not be required to pay any attention to this ambiguous order of reference. But as both answers were denials of the material allegations of the petition, only one issue was in fact presented, and a trial upon the petition and either answer would determine that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> Objection is made to the master\u2019s report because it does not set out the evidence in obedience to the order of reference, but only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>states that the witness \u201ctestified, in substance, as follows.\u201d No request was made at any time that the testimony be returned verbatim. General Order 27 (89 Fed. <em>xi, 32 </em>C. C. A. xi) provides for the certification of \u201ca summary of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> Against the testimony of the president of appellee given before the master it is claimed that the facts stated in the letter of the president should prevail. But this letter was never introduced before the master, and it only appeared in the ex parte application of appellants for the appointment of a receiver. There is, however, no contradiction between the testimony of Mr. Parlchurst and the statements in the letter. This letter is far from admitting any cause for an adjudication of bankruptcy. It merely admits that appellee\u2019s floating indebtedness cannot be met promptly. The view presented is that too much capital is invested in plant in proportion to the working capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Counsel also insists that under section 3 of the Bankruptcy Act, relating to the burden of proof, appellee had the burden of establishing that no cause existed for an adjudication of bankruptcy. We shall not stop to analyze the various provisions of this section, because if the burden was upon' the appellee, that burden was fully met.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> Objection is also made to the proof of the \u201ctrue cash value\u201d of the property, when \u201cfair valuation\u201d is the test required by the statute. We are of the opinion that appellee assumed at least as heavy a burden as the statute required in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">It is also' claimed that the proof is insufficient because the date with respect to solvency was given as November 7th instead of November 12th, when the petition was filed. But November 7th was the date of the alleged preference, and to constitute a preference it was necessary that appellee while insolvent should have made a transfer. So that, even if the presumption of a continuation of solvency from November 7th to November 12th could not be indulged, yet an adjudication of bankruptcy could not be rendered in the face of the proof that appellee had committed no act of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> Appellants\u2019 motion to have the matter resubmitted was without merit. It simply repeated the appellants\u2019 original charge on information and belief that appellee was insolvent, but contained no .statement of any procurable evidence with which to combat that which had been offered by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> The alternative of the motion, namely, that appellants be permitted to dismiss\u201d the petition after 10 days\u2019 notice to all creditors, was likewise without merit. Section 58a contemplates notice to other creditors when the petition is about to be dismissed for want of prose.cution or by consent of the parties already in court, and has no application to a dismissal of the petition on the merits after a hearing.
