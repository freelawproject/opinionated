Construing the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, as given as a witness for herself, most strongly against her, as it should be construed (Clark Thread Co. v. Willimantic Linen Co., 140 U. S. 481, 488, 11 Sup. Ct. 846, 35 L. Ed. 521), it seems that she admitted, rather than denied, that the contest had her sanction and approval, if not her active encouragement. While she denies that she ever \u201cdirectly advised\u201d Mrs. Tillman to contest the will, we cannot avoid the conclusion, from her deposition, that the contest was encouraged and approved by her. The testimony of Mrs. W. B. Butt, R. E. Clements, and Mrs. Hattie Tillman, while in some parts denying the fact, tends, we think, strongly to show that the plaintiff encouraged and approved the contest. Having instigated and encouraged the contest\u2014a step that, according to her contention, revokes the bequests to Mrs. Hattie Tillman\u2014she cannot come into court and reap benefits from the fact of such contest. If she advised or encouraged Mrs. Hattie Tillman to take steps in' the unsuccessful contest of the will that would cause the revocation of bequests to Mrs. Tillman, she should not be permitted in equity to profit by her advice. In this aspect of the case, the right of the plaintiff to relief is based entirely on the averment that Mrs. Tillman forfeited her interest as legatee by an alleged wrongful violation of the terms of the will in taking steps to set it aside. We are of the opinion that the plaintiff cannot be permitted in equity to profit by such contest, when it appears that she sanctioned, approved or advised it. 1 Pomeroy\u2019s Eq. Jur. (3d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 397-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">So we conclude that, if appellant\u2019s chief contention is well founded\u2014 that there was such a contest as constituted \u201clegal steps\u201d and a forfeiture under the will\u2014the plaintiff cannot reap any benefit from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
