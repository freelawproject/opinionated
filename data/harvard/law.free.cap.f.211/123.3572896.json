Upon an examination of the claim of Harry M. Spence, an alleged creditor before the referee, the latter excluded testimony which the trustee sought to introduce, and allowed the claim. The trustee thereupon brought the matter before the District Judge, who reversed the order of the referee denying his application to introduce the testimony and allowing the claim. The District Judge remanded the proceeding to the referee, with instructions to \u201callow the trustee full latitude of inquiry with regard to the claim of Spence,\u201d providing, further, that the trustee be allowed to add the defense of payment should he be so advised. This order Spence seeks to.revise on petition to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-6\">Olcott, Gruber, Bonynge &amp; McManus, of New York City (Irving E.

He merely sent the matter back to the referee, with instructions to take testimony which had been offered and excluded, and then to pass upon the whole case. Such a direction should not be brought here for review. When the record is complete and has been passed upon by the referee and the District Judge, it may properly be brought here. It would inaugurate an intolerable practice if mere rulings as to admission or rejection of testimony were brought here in advance of a decision on the merits of the question to the elucidation of which the testimony was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The petition is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
