Subsequently the District Court affirmed the order of deportation, which judgment is assigned as error. The cause is before us on appeal from that order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-16\">On the hearing before the commissioner, appellant testified that he was, at the time of his arrest, 20 years of age; that his father, Moy Nie Xin, was then, and for some time previous thereto had been, a merchant in Philadelphia, Pa., and had lived in this country more than twenty years. Pie further testified on the trial that he was born in Philadelphia; that he returned to the United States in the year 1911; that his mother had died ten years prior to the time of his trial; that he. had corresponded with his father, who had returned to Philadelphia; that after his mother\u2019s death he had lived with his grandmother; that his father had sent him money from time to time. He further testified that his father had told him not to return to the United States, but that funds had been saved up out of moneys sent by his father sufficient to provide him with transportation and pocket money. According to his account, he feared he would not be admitted to the United States., not having the statutory certificate of residence, and therefore bought a ticket in China for Vera Cruz, Mexico, via Vancouver and Montreal. From Vera Cruz he went to a town in Mexico just across the border line from El Paso, Tex., where he worked two months in a Chinese grocery store. From that town he entered the United States surreptitiously under the tutilage of a Chinaman named Xee, and arrived in Chicago after a two days\u2019 trip as a stowaway in a box or baggage car, where he was arrested. In his statement before the Chinese inspector, appellant made a somewhat different statement; in substance, that he had lived over a laundry in Philadelphia for a good many years, \u201cjust loafing around,\u201d but did not know the street; that he \u201cwas little then\u201d; that he did not remember when he went to China or with whom; he was then two or three years- old; that since he came back he had been living in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>United States in different places\u2014a long time in Philadelphia. When asked if he meant that he \u201cwent to China when you were little and returned when two or three years old and have been living here ever since?\u201d he answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Pie said he left Philadelphia over ten years ago and had been living in San Francisco over ten years, which city he had left over ten days ago; that he did not know the name of the town where he entered the baggage car; that he hid in the baggage ear because he had no money to pay car fare; that he was never in Mexico; and that he had no certificate of residence because \u201cI was little then and my father didn\u2019t secure me any.\u201d On the hearing of the cause, Moy Nie Yin, the alleged father of the appellant, was sworn and testified that he had lived in Philadelphia since he came, with his wife, to the United States, Kwang-hsu 7th, with the exception of a short time, when he stayed in New York to collect accounts; that, he was the owner of the Chinese grocery business which he conducted; that'the young man, Moy Guey Lum, then on trial, was his son; that appellant was born in Philadelphia Kwang-hsu 17th, where he lived with witness until four years of age, when he was taken to China by his parents; that after six months witness returned to Philadelphia where he had lived substantially ever since; that he had corresponded with his wife and son before the wife died and with appellant thereafter, and sent him money. The witness further testified that appellant had written a letter within the last year stating that he, the son, wished to come to the United States, but that he., had written to him that he did not want him to come; that he wanted him to go to school in China, and knew nothing of appellant\u2019s coming until h\u2019e heard he had been arrested in Chicago. On cross-examination, when shown his certificate of residence, which recited that in 1894 he had resided two years in New York, witness denied that such was the casq and said the paper was procured by his cousin; that he only stayed in New York while making collections. He further testified that the accused was 20 years old, and that he had\u2019no other children. Moy Wing was sworn, and testified that he had known Moy Nie Yin since Kwang-hsu 16th, in Philadelphia ; that he knew' the boy and had known his mother in her lifetime; that she had borne a son to Moy Nie Yin in Philadelphia (this appellant); that witness worked in that city a few months after the child was born and then came to Chicago; that he afterwards saw Moy Nie Yin here on his way to and on his return from China; that when he went to China his wife and appellant, then about four years old, were with him; that appellant was born while witness was in Philadelphia; and that he had not seen him since he was four years old until the present time. Wong Kong, being sworn, stated that he never had known Moy Nie Yin; that he lived in Portland, Or.; that appellant\u2019s father sent $50 to witness with'which'to procure $100 Mexican money and take it to appellant in China, which he did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-3\">The .District Court, on appeal taken to it, affirmed the order of deportation made by the commissioner as above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-4\">Benjamin C.

In United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 18 Sup. Ct. 456, 42 L. Ed. 890, the court, after quoting the first clause of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution reading as follows, viz., \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state in which they reside,\u201d says, \u201cand, this being true, the Chinese Exclusion Acts do not apply to .him.\u201d The defendant in that case was the child of Chinese parents who, at the time of defendant\u2019s birth, had a permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>residence in California and were engaged in commercial pursuits and not in any diplomatic or official capacity. The parents returned to China, but the son remained in California. When about 21 years of age he departed for China on a visit with the intention of returning. The court, on page 705 of 169 U. S., page 478 of 18 Sup. Ct. (42 L. Ed. 890), further says the question there presented was \u201cwhe'ther a child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth, a citizen of the United States,\u201d and thereupon decrees that under such circumstances he does become a citizen. This ruling was followed in Chin Bak Kan v. United States, 186 U. S. 200, 22 Sup. Ct. 891, 46 L. Ed. 1121; Re Giovanna (D. C.) 93 Fed. 660; Lee Sing Far v. United States, 94 Fed. 836, 35 C. C. A. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The question before us, therefore, is whether there was evidence before the commissioner and the District Court sufficient to establish to the satisfaction of the commissioner and District Court that respondent was lawfully entitled to remain in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Under the statute, a Chinese person be adjudged unlawfully within the United States unless he \u201cshall establish by affirmative proof to the satisfaction of such justice, judge or commissioner, his lawful right to remain in the United States.\u201d The decisions are numerous to the effect that in this class of cases, where the facts have been already determined by two judgments below, the appellate court cannot properly re-examine them. This language is used by the United States Supreme Court in Chin Bak Kan v. United States, supra. Where the question is one of fact as to whether the respondent is a native of this country, it has been held in some of the federal courts that the decision of the District Court will not be reversed on appeal. Yee Yet et al. v. United States, 175 Fed. 565, 99 C. C. A. 187; Chew Hing v. United States, 133 Fed. 227, 66 C. C. A. 281; Eng Choy v. United States, 175 Fed. 566, 99 C. C. A. 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In Lee Ah Yin v. United States, 116 Fed. 614, 54 C. C. A. 70, the court, on appeal, re-examined the facts, notwithstanding the judgment of the District Court affirming the order of deportation entered by the commissioner, and decided that such facts did not justify it in disturbing the judgments of the lower tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> Undoubtedly, the language of the statute requiring that a Chinese person \u201cshall establish by affirmative proof to the satisfaction\u201d of the judicial officer before whom he is examined that he is entitled to remain in the United States should not be construed to invest that officer with arbitrary power. \u201cBy satisfactory evidence, which is sometimes called sufficient evidence,\u201d says Greenleaf on Evidence, vol. 1, \u00a7 2, \u201cis intended that amount of proof which ordinarily satisfies an unprejudiced mind beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d The testimony had before the commissioner in the present case cannot be said to settle the question of citizenship of appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. The representations made by appellant to the inspector, introduced in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>dence, discloses statements entirely at variance with his testimony before the commissioner. When asked what he did in Philadelphia, he replied, \u201cNothing, just loaf around.\u201d When asked, \u201cWhen did you come from China?\u201d he answered, \u201cWhen I was two or three years old.\u201d When asked, \u201cWhere have you been living in the United States since you came back?\u201d he replied, \u201cDifferent places * * * long time in Philadelphia. * * * Left Philadelphia over ten years ago.\u201d He further said he had been living in San Francisco since leaving Philadelphia; that he left there ten days ago; that he had lived there more than ten years, on Jackson street. He is made to say that he went to China when he was little and returned when he was two or three years old and had been in the United States ever since. If he told the truth before the commissioner, all of the above statements were false. As admissions, however, they serve to discredit the stqry he told the commissioner. Furthermore, his testimony as to the route he took in coming to this country was so remarkable as to justify the commissioner in scrutinizing his statement very closely. The further fact that he entered the United States surreptitiously was rightly taken into consideration by the commissioner. While the testimony of the alleged father seems on its face to be devoid of suspicious indicia, it must be remembered that the commissioner had the witness before him and was able to form an opinion as to his truthfulness from his conduct on the stand. The fact that the witness\u2019 certificate of residence stated that he had lived two years in New York prior to the issuance thereof, whereas he states that he never had lived in New York, may have cast some discredit upon his testimony in the mind of the commissioner and the District Court. The father had not seen the son for about sixteen years according tq his own statement. Moy Wing, likewise, had not seen the appellant for the same period. He identified appellant only upon the father\u2019s statement. Wong Kong had never met the father until the time of the trial. He saw the boy in China about a year before the trial and gave him funds sent by the father. He himself did not know the appellant prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We have nothing to do with the weight of the evidence. Unless we can see from the record that the commissioner and the court arbitrarily ignored the evidence adduced and entered judgment of deportation in defiance thereof, we are not at liberty to. interfere. Under the facts of the present case, we,are unable to say that the appellant has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was entitled to remain in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Such being the case, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
