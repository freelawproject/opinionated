This conspiracy was, it is alleged, carried out by organizing other, apparently independent and competing, companies, but which were in fact under the control of the defendants other than the Consolidated Company. It is asserted that by means of such dummy corporations, the conspiring defendants endeavored to monopolize interstate commerce in the materials necessary for carrying out public lighting contracts. That these defendants, realizing that the Consolidated Company would be a strong competitor in the business of municipal lighting, agreed and conspired together to prevent the Consolidated Company from carrying on such business in the United States and to drive said company out of business. It is alleged further that, in pursuance of the said conspiracy, the said defendants acquired, through fraud and fraudulent representations, a majority of the stock in said Consolidated Company and placed in control thereof creatures of their own and adopted every method in their power to wreck and destroy the said Consolidated Company. That they succeeded in accomplishing this result and, in 1910, caused the Consolidated Street Lighting Company to discontinue its operations and abandon its business; the result being that the business has been destroyed and the stock is worthless. The bill also alleges that prior to this suit, the plaintiff demanded of the officers of the Consolidated Company that they would bring an action asking relief similar <em>to that </em>now demanded, but they have refused to bring such action. It is alleged that but for the unlawful acts of the defendants, the property, good will and assets prior to the commencement of this suit would have been worth $1,000,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">The foregoing statement shows sufficiently the intent and purpose of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">The question presented by these motions, briefly - stated, is whether, when it appears that a number of individuals and corporations have conspired together to wreck a corporation and have succeeded in doing so, a single minority shareholder of such corporation, after the directors and majority shareholders have declined to act, can maintain a suit in equity and recover threefold damages against the conspirators under section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-7\">So far as the seventh section of the act is concerned, it has been uniformly construed to refer only to an action at law. It permits a person\u2014which word, by the eighth section, includes a corporation\u2014to bring an action at law to recover treble damages. Nowhere in the act is the right given to an individual to proceed in equity. Blindell v. Hagan (C. C.) 54 Fed. 40; s. c., 56 Fed. 696, 6 C. C. A. 86; Greer, Mills &amp; Co. v. Stoller (C. C.) 77 Fed. 1; Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Miami S. S. Co., 86 Fed. 407, 30 C. C. A. 142; National Fire Proofing Company v. Mason Builders\u2019 Association et al., 169 Fed. 259, 94 C. C. A. 535, 26 L. R. A. (N. S.) 148.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-8\">In National Fire Proofing Co. v. Mason, cited above, the Circuit Court of Appeals for this circuit said, <em>at </em>page 263 of 169 Fed., at page 539 of 94 C. C. A. (26 L. R. A. [N. S.] 148):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-9\">\u201cWith respect to the federal statute, it is not obvious in what way a trade agreement between builders and bricklayers, relating to their <em>work in the </em>state of New York, can be said to directly affect interstate commerce; but \u00a3he consideration of this question is not necessary, because a person injured by a violation of the-federal act cannot sue for an injunction under it. The injunctive remedy is available to the government only. An individual can only sue for threefold damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-10\">These authorities would seem to dispose of these motions. An individual cannot maintain a suit in equity under the Anti-Trust Act. The complainant is an individual, and this is such a suit. An individual can sue only for threefold damages under the act, and this must be in a suit at law. The complainant here is suing for threefold damages in a suit in equity. The defendants are entitled to have the facts passed on by a jury, but here they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>are deprived of such right. In short, the complainant is asking relief under a statute, the provisions of which he has failed to follow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-3\">The Consolidated Company could bring an action at law under the permission implied in section 8, but where in the law is the right given to a single shareholder to'maintain such an action? A law which grants such drastic relief must be strictly construed; the right to maintain an action not mentioned in the law cannot be implied. It will not do to say that the extraordinary remedy here invoked is necessary and should \"be implied. If such tremendous power is to, be given a single shareholder, the appeal should be made to the legislative and not the. judicial branch of the government. It is unnecessary to determine whether a single shareholder can maintain an action at law under the seventh section for the reason that this is not such an action. Other questions have been discussed but I do not deem it essential or wise to extend this decision beyond the precise point involved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-4\">What I decide is that an equity suit cannot be-maintained under section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act by a single stockholder to recover threefold damages for injuries sustained by his corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-5\">The motions to dismiss the bill are granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-6\">Hirsch, Scheuerman &amp; Eimbury, of New, York City (Henry L.

There is no prayer for relief which would warrant such a construction of the t\u00edxll as would merely require the Consolidated Company to sue the other defendants for treble damages under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">We think the dismissal was proper, and affirm the decrees, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
