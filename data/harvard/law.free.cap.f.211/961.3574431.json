Thereafter an article was published stating that efforts were being made to -pay the depositors in full, and charged that the notes, representing money loaned to C. and his friends, would yield more than was expected, after which followed a list of the makers of bills or notes due to the trust company under a heading that they contained \u201cthe names of some friends of City Chamberlain H.,\u201d who was also accused of the same offenses as C. In the list appeared plaintiff\u2019s name, followed by the figures \u00a710,000. <em>Held, </em>that such publication was insufficient to sustain an innuendo that it was intended to mean that plaintiff, through friendship o\u00ed a common interest with C. or H., had obtained $10,000 with the trust company with a dishonest purpose not to repay it, and that the publication was therefore not libelous.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b975-11\">[Ed.

Hyde was chamberlain of the city of New York. That shortly after the action of the Banking Department there appeared, from day to day, numerous editorials and articles in the columns of defendant\u2019s newspaper, wherein and whereby the said Cummins and the said Hyde were, both openly and by imjplication, accused of various illegal and criminal acts in connection with the affairs of the Carnegie Trust Company; that among other things and more especially they were accused of borrowing and permitting their business associates and personal friends to borrow large sums of money from said trust company, upon insufficient security or upon no security at all, in fraud of the rights of the creditors and stockholders of said Carnegie Trust Company, and in violation of the laws of the state of New York. That in March, 1911, the defendant published in the columns of its newspaper an article headed \u201cPlan on foot to pay depositors of Carnegie Trust Company in full,\u201d and that said article contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-8\">\u201cThe men who have thus come to the aid of the trust company have taken into consideration the long list of bills purchased, which really are promissory notes, upon which the company lent money to Cummins and the latter\u2019s friends. They hold, however, that the notes will yield much more than was expected, now that the public knows about them, but even if they do not, they say they form only a comparatively small portion of the real assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-9\">. \u201cIn the following partial list of the makers of bills or notes the names of some friends of the City Chamberlain Hyde may be recognized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">That a list of names and amounts is thereafter given as and for said \u201cpartial list,\u201d among which appears the name \u201cCharles P. Wiffard,\u201d followed by figures $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">By innuendo the complaint then alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-12\">\u25a0 \u201cThat by the language above quoted the defendant meant and intended to mean, and was understood by the general public as meaning, that the moneys obtained by the persons named in said list were obtained by them through their friendship with or business connection or identity with the said Cummins or the said Hyde, with the dishonest purpose on the part of the persons so obtaining said loans of never repaying the same. That the spelling of the name of plaintiff was a mistake in the printing of the list; but it was the intention of defendant to insert therein the plaintiff\u2019s name, and the name \u2018Charles P. Woffard\u2019 on such list was intended for the plaintiff and was so understood by the general public. That by the insertion of this plaintiff\u2019s name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>in said list the defendant meant and intended to mean, and was understood by the general public to mean, that plaintiff, through the friendship of or common interest with the said Cummins or said Hyde, or both, had obtained a loan of money from the Carnegie Trust Company with the dishonest purpose of never repaying it; and that by the figures $10,000 being set out in said list opposite said name was meant, intended to mean, and was understood by the general public to mean, that this plaintiff then owed to the Carnegie Trust Company the sum of $10,000 upon a loan obtained with the dishonest purpose aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">The complaint further states that <em>subsequent to the -publication </em>complained of Cummins and Hyde were indicted; Cummins was convicted. What bearing these facts are supposed to have upon the prior publication it is difficult to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">A' majority of the court think it putting too much- strain on the theory of \u201cinnuendo\u201d to justify the conclusion that the article complained of .is a libel on the plaintiff. Even if it were conceded that the prior publications of the newspaper might lead a reader to suppose that every friend of the chamberlain, who borrowed money from the trust company without security, did so \u201cwith- the dishonest purpose * * * of never repaying the same,\u201d and such concession would seem to put an excessive strain on \u201cinnuendo,\u201d the only statement in this issue is that in the published list the names of <em>some </em>friends of the chamberlain may be recognized. It is not stated that all the names on the list are \u201cfriends\u201d; on the contrary, the phraseology would seem to indicate that some of them are not. No fact and no statement of defendant which is set forth in the complaint would, as it seems to us, warrant a jury in finding that the defendant has asserted, directly or indirectly, that the plaintiff borrowed money from the trust company with the fraudulent and dishonest intention of not repaying the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
