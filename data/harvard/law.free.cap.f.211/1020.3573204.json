This case was tried in the court below before Judge Wolverton, who heard the witnesses and saw their demeanor on the stand. His opinion (Minnesota &amp; Oregon Land &amp; Timber Co. v. Hewitt Inv. Co. [D. C.] 201 Fed. 752) contains a very full and searching review of the testimony in the case. We have read that testimony, and have considered it in the light of the arguments submitted on behalf of the appellant for a reversal of the decree. We find no reason to differ from the learned judge in the court below in the conclusions he reached upon the evidence in the case. For the reasons there stated, the decree of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
