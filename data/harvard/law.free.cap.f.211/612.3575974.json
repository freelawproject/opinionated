In 1908 it began making a brand of gum in the form of thin disks or chips; its first variety being violet-flavored and called \u201cViolet Chips,\u201d its second variety (put out in 1909) being mint-flavored and called \u201cMint Chips.\u201d The company adopted in 1908 a distinctive package in the form of a round, enameled, and lithographed tin box, about \u201cAo inches deep and with a cover about 1% inches in diameter, containing 10 disks, and retailing at 5 cents. The Violet Chips were contained in violet-colored boxes and the Mint Chips in boxes colored green. The lettering upon both boxes was white. Upon the covers of the boxes containing Violet Chips were the words \u201cColgan\u2019s Violet Chips\u2014The Gum That\u2019s Round\u201d; the latter four words being in the form of a circle on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>margin of the lower half of the cover-top. The Mint Chip boxes had the same legend, using, however, the word \u201cMint\u201d instead of \u201cViolet.\u201d There was other printing upon the bottom of the boxes and on the rim of the cover. The Colgan Company was not the first to manufacture gum in the form of disks, but it was the first to put out \u201cround gum\u201d in round tin boxes, and at the time its manufacture began it was the only manufacturer of round gum. The Faultless Chemical Company had for a few years put out what it called \u201cChips,\u201d its package being a rectangular pasteboard box; at least one form of its advertisement carrying the legend, \u201cThe gum that\u2019s round.\u201d The Faultless Company ceased manufacturing gum as early as 1900, and its round-gum' cutting machines were in 1907 sold to the Colgan Company, in preparation for its manufacture of round gum. One Primley manufactured a round gum from about 1893 to 1896, when he ceased. His disk was of considerably larger diameter than Colgan\u2019s, and was packed in gold-colored pasteboard boxes and called \u201cPrimley\u2019s Goldbox Gum.\u201d The Faultless Company and Primley seem to have been the only ones manufacturing round gum previous to Colgan\u2019s taking up that form. The Colgan Company sold out its business to complainant (appellee) May 15, 1911, and the latter has continuously sold (among-other gums) the Violet and Mint Chips of the same diameter and form, in precisely the same kind of a package, and lettered in precisely the same way, except as respects certain details on the bottom of the box not material here\u2014latterly putting 7 disks in a box.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">From 1908 until approximately June, 1911, the Colgan Gum Com: pany expended in advertising Colgan\u2019s \u201cChips\u201d about $250,000, by means of magazine and newspaper advertisements, billboards, window displays, hangers, counter display stands, sample distribution, and otherwise; and complainant, from May 15, 1911, to March 31, 1913, expended in advertising the same product, in ways similar to those employed by the Colgan Company, more than $180,000. The advertising matter of both complainant and Colgan generally contained prominent pictorial representations of the boxes or containers, or both. From the time they were put on the market until January 1913 the sales of Colgan\u2019s Violet and Mint Chips have amounted to about $1,-750,000. The counter display stands put out by the Colgan Company and complain\u00e1nt were of enameled, metal, consisting of five upright compartments, each adapted to hold four boxes of chips; the stand containing, among other lettering, the words \u201cColgan\u2019s Chips\u201d prominently displayed, together with the words \u201cThe Gum That\u2019s Round,\u201d printed in color on a white circular surface, the character \u201c5c\u201d being in the center of the circle. Colgan\u2019s Chips were delivered to the retailer in distinctive pasteboard cartons, each holding 20 boxes, the cartons being colored to correspond with the boxes they contained, and being prominently marked on the cover (which was provided to be left open) \u201cColgan\u2019s Mint Chips\u201d (or Violet Chips, as the case might be) \u201cThe Gum That\u2019s Round\u201d; the lettering throughout on the cartons being white and having conspicuously displayed on each side and each end of the carton the words \u201cThe Gum That\u2019s Round,\u201d contained within a circle, in connection with the words \u201cMint Chips\u201d or \u201cViolet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Chips,\u201d the circle on the ends of the cartons being between the two words forming the name of the Chips. The principal sales of Mint Chips and Violet Chips (both of Colgan and complainant) were in the south and southwest parts of the United States, and in some sections largely to Negroes, Italians, and Trench. Customers were in the habit of calling for and ordering these chips by the names \u201cround gum,\u201d \u201ctin box gum,\u201d or \u201ctin gum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\">About the middle of the year 1912 defendant began putting out a round gum, which it called \u201cWinterton\u2019s Satsuma Chips.\u201d It adopted a box of the precise shape, size, and form of that used by Colgan and complainant, even to the slight depression in the cover of the box, which left more or less of a rim on the upper surface; defendant\u2019s box contained from 7 to 11 'chips. Defendant also enameled its boxes, using two different colors, a light blue and red, respectively; the gum, however, contained in the different colored boxes being apparently the same, including flavor. Defendant also lettered its boxes in white, the inscription upon the top of the box being \u201cWinterton\u2019s Satsuma (Trade-Mark) Chips. A dainty box for the purse\u201d ; the word \u201cChips\u201d being printed in a distinctive style similar to that word as printed upon complainant\u2019s Violet Chip boxes, and the words \u201cA dainty box for the purse\u201d occupying the same position as complainant\u2019s legend \u201cThe Gum That\u2019s Round.\u201d Defendant likewise packed its \u201cChips\u201d for the use of the retailer in pasteboard cartons, the blank being apparently cut from the same pattern as complainant\u2019s, even to the ears attached to the cover for the purpose of holding it up when the box is open. Defendant\u2019s cartons thus contained the same number of boxes as did complainant\u2019s, and were likewise colored to correspond with the color of the enameled tin boxes contained therein, and likewise had a circle in white prominently displayed on the cover, the sides, and ends of its cartons, in the same relation to the words \u201cSatsuma Chips\u201d as complainant\u2019s circle occupied toward the words \u201cViolet Chips\u201d or \u201cMint Chips\u201d; the legend within defendant\u2019s circle being \u201cSatsuma\u2014That Regular Make,\u201d so arranged that the word \u201cThat\u201d is prominently and alone in the exact center of the circle, as is the word \u201cThat\u2019s\u201d in the circle of complainant and Colgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Defendant has spent comparatively little in advertising its product in question, its total outlay for all advertising purposes, including free gum, being from $6,000 to $8,000. It has done no pictorial advertising, and but little in trade journals or other periodicals. Its goods have been sold through traveling salesmen in the territory occupied by complainant, and apparently in large part upon the strength of the popularity of complainant\u2019s chips. Since the advent of defendant\u2019s chips, complainant\u2019s sales have been appreciably affected in some localities; and a part of this interference seems fairly traceable to the competition of defendant, whose boxes being of the same size and shape, and at a distance of a few feet presenting the same general appearance as those of complainant (although actually differing in color and otherwise), could be, and in some instances are shown to have been, put in and sold from complainant\u2019s display standards and jars, mixed with boxes of complainant\u2019s chips. The fact that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>fendant\u2019s chips were sold to the retailer at a lower price than complainant\u2019s, although sold to the consumer at the same price, would naturally offer temptation to the retailer to confuse the two manufactures.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">After suit, was threatened, and during the last days of November, 1912, defendant formally discontinued the use of its cartons and containers, as' well as the name \u201cSatsuma Chips,\u201d protesting, however, that such discontinuance was only temporary; and about six weeks later, and shortly after this suit was begun, began putting out the same product and in the same style of package, except that the name was changed from \u201cChips\u201d to \u201cWafers,\u201d the words \u201cA dainty box for the purse,\u201d formerly printed on the cover, being omitted; and the position and style of type in the word \u201cWafers\u201d differing from the position and type of the word \u201cChips\u201d in the former label. The colors adopted were a shade of tan and a slightly different shade of blue. An amended and supplemental bill was filed to meet the new situation. The decree enjoined defendant specifically from manufacturing and putting out chewing gum in round packages of the shape, style, and appearance of either defendant\u2019s \u201cSatsuma Chips\u201d or \u201cSatsuma Wafers\u201d boxes, as well as in defendant\u2019s pasteboard cartons; and'generally from 'manufacturing and putting out chewing gum in colored round metal packages or pasteboard boxes, or under labels, substantially identical with or like complainant\u2019s boxes, packages, and labels, or such as are calculated to deceive purchasers or consumers. Defendant does not assign error upon the specific enjoining of the use of its \u201cSatsuma Chips\u201d boxes and cartons, but does complain that it is adjudged guilty of unfair competition and of the general features of the injunction, as well as the specific enjoining of the use of \u201cSatsuma Wafers\u201d boxes and packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We think the court rightly found unfair competition, and rightly enjoined the use of defendant\u2019s \u201cSatsuma Chips\u201d boxes and containers, despite defendant\u2019s disclaimer of intention to resume the use of that label. The injunction properly extended to the use of any boxes, containers, or labels likely to mislead the public by creating confusion between the two manufactures. The question whether complainant can acquire, broadly speaking, a monopoly of the right' to use a round, tin, lithographed box is not here involved; the decree need not rest upon the theory of such monopoly. The dress of complainant\u2019s boxes and cartons, taking all their features into account, is, in our opinion, distinctive; and this distinctive dress has become known to the .public as characterizing complainant\u2019s product. This dress is therefore entitled to protection against unfair competition. Paris Medicine Co. v. W. H. Hill Co. (C. C. A. 6th Cir.) 102 Fed. 148, 42 C. C. A. 227; Wm. Wrigley, Jr., &amp; Co. v. Grove Co. (C. C. A. 2d Cir.) 183 Fed. 99, 101, 105 C. C. A. 391; Moxie Co. v. Daoust (C. C. A. 1st Cir.) 206 Fed. 434, 124 C. C. A. 316; Samson Cordage Works v. Puritan Cordage Mills, 211 Fed. 603, decided by this court January 6, 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is true that the word \u201cChips\u201d is a descriptive term, and (unless it has acquired a secondary meaning, which we are not called up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>on to decide) could not be exclusively appropriated. But while defendant had the right to use the word as describing its goods, it \"had not the right to so use it in connection with other words and form of dress as to induce the public to believe that its \u201cChips\u201d are complainant\u2019s product. Wm. Wrigley, Jr., &amp; Co. v. Grove Co., supra, 183 Fed. at page 101, 105 C. C. A. 391. The. rule in trade-mark cases, that color, except in connection with some definite, arbitrary design, cannot be the subject of exclusive appropriation (Leschen Rope Co. v. Broderick, 201 U. S. 166, 171, 26 Sup. Ct. 425, 50 L. Ed. 710; Samson Cordage Works v. Puritan Cordage Mills, supra, and cases there cited), has little application here; where the pivotal question, so far as it affects that feature, is the existence or nonexistence of deceptive similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> That color may.be one of the elements making up a dress entitled to protection is clear. Coca-Cola Co. v. Gay-Ola Co. (C. C. A. 6th Cir.) 200 Fed. 720, 724, 119 C. C. A. 164. We are unable to resist the conclusion not only that the dress of defendant\u2019s \u201cSatsuma Chips\u201d boxes and cartons inevitably tends to confuse defendant\u2019s \u201cChips\u201d with complainant\u2019s product, having in mind the conditions under which the two products are sold, but that the dress employed by defendant was adopted with the intent thereby to profit from the popularity of complainant\u2019s product and the latter\u2019s good will. It is true that the differences in coloring and lettering are such that the careful and discriminating purchaser, able and willing to read and seeing the two products side by side, need not be misled into accepting defendant\u2019s product for that of complainant; but the record suggests that not all of complainant\u2019s customers are able to read English at least, that the conspicuous characteristic in the minds of many purchasers is the round gum in the tin box, and that a casual observation of the differences in coloring and- lettering of complainant\u2019s boxes would not suggest to the ordinary purchaser the distinction between the two products.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> It need scarcely be said that it is the ultimate purchaser whose deception is to be guarded against; that the imitation need not be such as to mislead the careful and discriminating purchaser. It is enough that it misleads the ordinary and casual buyer. Coca-Cola Co. v. Gay-Ola Co., supra, 200 Fed. at page 723, 119 C. C. A. 164; Cordage Works v. Cordage Mills, supra, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> It is urged that defendant is not responsible for the fraud of the retailer; and this is true where such fraud is not encouraged by the defendant, and where the latter has done its legal duty in distinguishing its product from that of its competitor. Rathbone, Sard &amp; Co. v. Champion Steel Range Co. (C. C. A. 6th Cir.) 189 Fed. 26, 33, 110 C. C. A. 596, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 258. But in our opinion defendant has not brought itself within this limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Whether defendant\u2019s \u201cSatsuma Wafers\u201d boxes and cartons unfairly compete presents a somewhat different question, but we think different only in degree. If the consideration of these boxes and cartons could be dissoci\u00e1ted from the previous use of and experience with defendant\u2019s \u201cSatsumg, Chips\u201d boxes and containers, we might hesitate to find sufficient misleading similarity .to justify a conclusion of unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>competition. But this dissociation cannot properly be made; defendant seems to have 'gained a foothold with the trade through the use of its \u201cSatsuma Chips\u201d boxes and containers; presumably the latter were still kept in stock to some extent by some dealers at the time Satsuma Wafers were put out; and, in view of the history we have stated, we are impressed that the differences between \u201cSatsuma Wafers\u201d and \u201cSatsuma Chips\u201d boxes are not such as sufficiently to distinguish the former from complainant\u2019s \u201cChips\u201d to prevent the misleading of the ordinary buyer. In many cases the use of the manufacturer\u2019s name is sufficient to prevent confusion, but there is no hard and fast rule to this effect. Gaines v. Turner-Booker Co. (C. C. A. 6th Cir.) 204 Fed. 553, 556, 123 C. C. A. 79. The question of deceptive similarity is, after all, one of fact, to be determined in each case upon its own peculiar incidents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> The record contains several assignments of error addressed to the overruling of objections and to the reading of portions of depositions of certain witnesses. These assignments are not discussed in appellant\u2019s brief, beyond the statement that they \u201care submitted for the consideration of the court on the reasons assigned in the objections to the evidence and without further argument on our part.\u201d They are not discussed in appellee\u2019s brief. We nowhere find any reference to the pages of the record where the action complained of is to be found, as is .required by subdivision 2 of Rule 20 of this court (202 Fed. xiv, 118 C. C. A. xvi); nor is the substance of the admitted evidence quoted in the assignments, as required by our rule No. 11 (202 Fed. viii, 118 C. C. A. x). We should not be called upon to search the record for this purpose, and so cannot consider the. assignments. Chicago Gt. Western Ry. Co. v. Egan (C. C. A. 8th Cir.) 159 Fed. 40, 46, 86 C. C.
