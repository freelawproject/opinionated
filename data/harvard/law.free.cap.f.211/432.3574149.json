Moreover, the only representation averred therein as false, in reference to an existing fact relied upon in making the purchases of and investments in the mining properties, relates to an incidental transaction with one Bradburn, in reference to which the notice states that the defendant was \u201cfurther misled and deceived by the statement of plaintiff that he had procured one James Bradburn who would buy ten thousand dollars worth of said stock at once, without waiting until said proposed company was incorporated\u201d; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>plaintiff subsequently produced Bradburn\u2019s check for that amount and delivered it to the defendant, stating that it was given for such stock. It is further averred, in substance, that Br\u00e1dburn subsequently denied and repudiated this transaction as a purchase of stock, and claimed that he had thereby purchased an interest in the mining properties; that Bradburn sued defendant for recovery of damages thereupon, and for settlement of such claim defendant paid $35,000 for a release thereof, pursuant to this plaintiff\u2019s advice to do so; that such transactions were conspiracies between the plaintiff and Brad-burn to defraud the defendant; and that \u201cthe contract of February 2,\u201d 1903 (in reference to their respective shares in the promotion stock), was made \u201cbetween defendant and plaintiff and Byrns for the purpose of\u201d such settlement, and \u201cdid not in any way attempt to define the rights and interests of the parties signing said contract as between themselves.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-4\">The notice states, by way of summary or conclusion, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">\u201cDefendant will further show that, relying upon the representations of plaintiff and believing from all th\u00e9 aforesaid conversations and representations that plaintiff could and would sell forthwith 300,000 shares of the capital \u25a0 stock of the Penobscot Mining Company to be organized, he (defendant) agreed to pay plaintiff the sum of $25,000 for the 50,000 shares of stock to which plaintiff would become entitled when he (plaintiff) had kept and performed his aforesaid promises and agreements but defendant will show that, By reason of failure of plaintiff to carry out his agreement and promises with defendant as aforesaid, the said stock was and is wholly and entirely worthless; that he (defendant) has been deceived and defrauded by the false and fraudulent representations of plaintiff; and that the writing in plaintiff\u2019s declaration mentioned was and is without consideration and was obtained from defendant by fraud and deception on the part of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">\u25a0 \u201cDefendant will further show that none of the properties has as yet shown any evidence of containing a valuable vein or veins of gold ore; that no ore of any considerable value has been as yet taken therefrom; that across a nearby gulch, and about five miles distant from said properties, is located a valuable gold-producing mine, in no way connected with the transactions of the parties hereto; that whether the vein of ore in that mine has a continuation on this side of said gulch is as yet unkn'own; that, if ore in valuable and paying quantities is not located upon said properties in the near future, they will be of no value whatever to defendant, and defendant will lose his entire investment of about $500,000 therein, made by defendant upon the aforesaid promises and representations of plaintiff and his said associates.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">The proceedings at the trial, testimony received, and rulings thereupon, and offers of proof which were excluded by the trial court, are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">Before BAKER, SEAMAN, and KOHESAAT, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-9\">Norman H.

The verdict and judgment against Maitland, the plaintiff in error and defendant below, award recovery upon his written agreement to pay Traver, plaintiff below, $25,000 on or before four years from its date. Although the agreement is dated February <em>7, </em>1903, the testimony of the parties is conflicting as to the actual date of making and delivery, whether in February or in December, 1903, but this difference between them bears only on the credibility of their respective versions of the transaction as submitted to the jury and settled by the verdict. The agreement (promissory note) recites, as the consideration thereof, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>sale, transfer and assignment to me by Wilber H. Traver of all his right and claim to receive fifty thousand shares of the capital stock of the Penobscot Mining Company of South Dakota, as evidenced by'an instrument of transfer, bearing even date herewith, executed\u201d by Traver; and the instrument referred to, dated February 7, 1903, and signed by Traver, was produced by Maitland at the trial and appears in evidence. It describes the 50,000 shares of stock, thereby sold, assigned, etc., as \u201ccoming to me from the said Alexander Maitland under and by virtue of a certain contract dated February 2, 1903, between the said Maitland on the one part and myself and one Frank R.

This notice is a form of pleading certain defenses, in actions upon notes and other instruments for payment of money or property, authorized by statute in Illinois, as between the original parties. Sections 9 and 10, c. 98, Hurd\u2019s Rev. Stat. 1905. Vide R. S.\u2018 1845, p. 385, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11. It is settled by decisions of the Supreme Court of the state that the defenses which may thus be set up are: (1) That the instrument was made without any valuable consideration; (2) that the consideration has wholly faile4; (3) that there has been \u201ca part failure of the consideration\u201d; and (4) that \u201cfraud and circumvention have been used in obtaining\u201d the instrument. Sims v. Klein, 1 Ill. <em>(Breese), </em>302, 303; Taft v. Myerscough, 197 Ill. 600, 603, 604, 64 N. E. 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Thus the issue for review is limited to the inquiry whether testimony was expressly offered on behalf of the defendant and rejected by the court, which would tend to prove one or more of the above-mentioned defenses- embraced in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">In reference to the notice of' special defense, we believe the utmost import of the various specifications of matters the \u201cdefendant will give in evidence and insist in his defense\u201d may be summarized in these propositions: (1) That the agreement in suit was induced and obtained by \u201cfraud and circumvention\u201d and through \u201cconspiracy\u201d on the part of the plaintiff and his associates. (2) That the plaintiff was not entitled to any of the shares of stock purporting, to be transferred to the defendant, and consideration for the agreement \u201chas wholly failed'.\u201d (3) That prior to such agreement, and early in the year 1902, the defendant had been induced by frau4ulent representations and conspiracy on the part of the plaintiff and his associates to purchase gold-mining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>properties (named) in South Dakota, had taken titles thereto, and invested upwards of $500,000 in and about their development, without success or reimbursement in any'manner. (4) That a purported corporation, Penobscot Mining Company, had been organized by Maitland, Traver, and one Byrns (to take over the mining properties when transferred by Maitland), with $500,000 of capital stock, whereof $300,000 was to be \u201ctreasury stock,\u201d which Traver represented and agreed would be sold by him to outside parties and the proceeds applied to reimburse Maitland\u2019s investment, and the remaining $200,000 to be issued to the incorporators 'after Maitland had been reimbursed, $100,000 to Maitland and $50,000 each to Traver and Byrns; and that the agreement of Traver to sell the treasury stock for reimbursement of: Maitland was in full force entirely unperformed and entered into the agreement in suit and was relied upon to give value to the transfer, but remains wholly unperformed, so that the transfer is worthless. (5) That the mining properties so purchased by the defendant have shown no evidence of value, and whether they contain ore of value \u201cis as yet unknown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">At the trial, the defendant Maitland testified at considerable length, detailing the circumstances of his purchases of the South Dakota gold-mining properties and of his investments for erection of a mill and development of the mines, together with representations and agreements on the part of the plaintiff and his associates which had induced him to make such purchases and investments; the court having overruled at that stage the objections raised to such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It expressly appears therefrom: That all purchases were made from outside parties and his entire investments made long prior to the transaction in controversy, with titles preserved in him; that operations had been carried on throughout the year 1902 under his control, direction, and expense; that the corporation organized to take over the properties, with capital stock provided for as described in the notice of defense, had proceeded no farther than to place the stock in the hands of Maitland, to hold until it was disposed of as the parties had stipulated; that Traver had agreed to sell the treasury stock to outside parties for proceeds to be applied for reimbursements of Maitland; that Traver and Byrns stipulated in writing that Maitland was to be reimbursed for his cash investments \u201cbefore there is to be any payments in the form of dividends or otherwise, to the promotion stock interests\u201d; that Maitland had become dissatisfied with the status of affairs, and early in February, 1903, on his return with Traver from a visit to the mines, negotiations occurred between them for purchase by Maitland of Traver\u2019s claim of interest in the properties; and that such negotiations were continued in Chicago and resulted in the agreement in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Upon this showing on the part of the defendant of the state of facts under which the agreement was concluded, the trial court became satisfied that the negotiations and transaction were' separated from and independent of the prior transactions and investments, in time,- purpose, and consideration; that the defense predicated thereon was inadmissible; and, ruling in conformity with that view, the above-men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>tioned testimony was excluded from submission to the jury, together with various tenders of proof in further support of the defense so predicated. .</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The defendant, however, was permitted to testify and testified in reference to the circumstances and conversations between the parties leading up to and attending the execution of the agreement in suit, including therein his version of an agreement by parol between them that the note was not to be, paid when due unless Maitland (thepromissor) \u201chad previously received his money, or words to that effect,\u201d which version was denied by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony; and the court, assuming that an issue of fact arose in respect of this alleged oral understanding, submitted it to the jury for determination, and their verdict was adverse to such contention. Whether this testimony was admissible, in any view, to affect the instruments so executed by both parties may best be considered under the other branch of the defense. Thus the contract terms for payment of $25,000, if not otherwise conclusive, are settled by the verdict; and it is likewise settled, both by evidence and verdict, that the entire consideration entering therein was purchase and release of the promotion share of Traver in the venture (including his Retirement from the corporation), which interest appeared, by written agreement between the parties, as 50,000 shares, or one-fourth of the \u201cpromotion stock,\u201d to be effective only when Maitland had been reimbursed for his investments. Its value was plainly understood by both parties to be problematical, contingent on developments of the mjnes, as referred to in. the notice of defense, and it'is equally clear that the purchase and release was treated and regarded by both as a valuable and sufficient consideration for the note, and that the benefits thereof were so accepted and retained by the defendant for his purpose of reorganizing a corporation to take over the mines, as disclosed by his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In the absence of evidence, either produced or expressly offered, tending to prove that execution of their agreement was obtained by \u201cfraud and circumvention\u201d on the part of the plaintiff (as the notice of defense repeatedly states the \u201cdefendant will give in evidence and insist in his defense\u201d), we are of opinion that the testimony and offers of testimony in support of the averments of fraudulent representations and conduct in the transactions of the previous year were rightly excluded by the trial court. The bill of exceptions shows neither testimony nor offers of testimony tending to support the charge of fraud entering into the agreement; and it is conceded in the brief, submitted on behalf of the defendant (plaintiff in error), that such defense failed for want of proof. Nevertheless, it is contended that the testimony so excluded was admissible as tending to support the remaining defense set up under the statute, namely, that the consideration for the agreement \u201chas wholly failed.\u201d The theory upon which this contention is urged by counsel is stated in their argument in two propositions, in substance as follows: (1) That the prior representations of Traver, both of \u201chis ability to sell stock\u201d and of purchasers \u201che had secured\u201d to take stock, \u201chad a direct bearing on the value of- Traver\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>promotion stock, which he was to receive only after he had sold the so-called treas\u00fcry stock,\u201d and the fraud as to the value of the stock \u201cconstitutes failure of consideration.\u201d (2) That the note in suit \u201cwas one step only in a conspiracy entered into * * * to defraud Maitland through this mining scheme,\u201d and the representations which induced his prior investments in the properties, as the earlier \u201csteps taken in pursuance of this design are admissible as being part of the same general transaction.\u201d If neither of these claims is tenable, it is obvious that error is not well assigned, and we are of opinion that both are not only fallacious and beside the issue presented by the suit, but that both are inconsistent with the conceded facts, and the second proposition is not within any tender of proof at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The testimony of the defendant had established (as before stated) that the representations referred to were made and the object consummated by the investments of Maitland in the mining properties, together with the provision for the promotion shares of Traver and Byrns in the corporation upon conditions stated, all apart from and long prior to the negotiations which resulted in the present contract for release of Traver\u2019s interest and participation in the venture. With this last transaction between these parties so separated from the alleged representations, both in character and event, its independence therefrom was in effect conceded by counsel for the defendant at the trial, in answer to an inquiry by the court, namely, that it was not claimed to have been within the contemplation of either party when the representations were made'and acted upon. So, whatever may have been the bearing and force of these representations in the original transactions, as stated in the notice, we believe them to be irrelevant and without force for defense against the new contract, differing entirely in purpose and effect from the prior transactions, described, in the notice as intended, induced, and accomplished through such representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Recurring to the notice of defense, its charges of fraud and conspiracy rest wholly on the representations there specified as inducing his investments in the property, and no doubt is entertainable that most of such representations are mere expressions of opinion and promises which do not amount to actionable fraud under the averments. F.or the purposes of this inquiry, however, we lay aside the question whether any of the representations stated support these charges, and proceed on the assumption that one or more thereof may be sufficient to that end, in reference alone to the original transactions. The testimony and offers of testimony which were excluded, with the possible exception of two offers to be separately considered, are predicated alone on the' charges of fraud in the prior transactions, and we believe such rejection was required pursuant to the elementary rule of evidence against the reception of irrelevant matter to defeat or affect the independent cdntract. It is undoubted, of course, that competent evidence would be admissible to prove that any of these prior representations entered into and became part of the consideration for this contract by express agreement of the parties, thus making it a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>new representation or promise for the new purpose, but the original representations have no force in that direction, as we understand to be the contention in each of the above propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The last-mentioned view, that the prior representation must be renewed to become effective for the new purpose, appears to have received some measure of recognition in framing the defense, in the attempt to prove the agreement by parol, that payment of the note was conditioned upon the performance by Traver of his pre-existing promise to sell the treasury stock for reimbursement of Maitland\u2019s investment. While that version of the transaction was submitted to the jury and settled adversely, it is contended that the defendant became entitled, through such testimony, to submission as well of the prior representations and agreement referred to, so that error was committed in its exclusion. We believe it to be sufficient to remark, in answer to this proposition, that the consideration for- the note was distinctly stated in writing, in both instruments, and, no \u201cfraud or circumvention\u201d entering into the execution (as conceded), extrinsic testimony to change their terms or effect was inadmissible, under any theory of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The record shows two offers of proof, above referred to as possible exceptions from the theory of the other offers, which were so urgently pressed at the trial that we have reserved them for special mention, although not impressed with either tender as' presenting a meritorious question: (1) One of these offers was \u201cto show that said mining properties have never paid, and have been shut down for upwards of five years, and are without value as mining properties or for any other purpose.\u201d On objection interposed that this was \u201ca variance from the notice of defense,\u201d an amendment of the notice was allowed to conform thereto, but the offer was nevertheless rightly overruled as irrelevant. Laying aside its obvious inconsistency with the prior averments and testimony, it was both conceded and settled by the undisputed evidence that both parties entered into the contract in suit, equally well informed as to developments of ore in the mines, and that their producing value was \u201centirely problematical,\u201d and without concealment or fraud entering into such contract, so that liability for performance could not be affected by the proposed proof of their present value or want of value. (2) The other offer was thus stated: \u201cTo prove and show that at the time of the execution\u201d of the instruments \u201cthe plaintiff owned no stock in the Penobscot Mining Company,\u201d had \u201cno right to the stock,\u201d and the note given therefor \u201cwas entirely without consideration.\u201d For support of this offer, however, counsel relies upon the prior agreement between the parties postponing title to the stock until the treasury stock had been sold for reimbursement of Maitland, so 'that the foregoing ruling against its admissibility is applicable alik\u00e9 to this offer. As the entire interest of Traver in the undertaking was obtained in conformity with the mutual purpose of the bargain, with full understanding of its character, and no fraud, concealment, or mistake entered into the contract, under well-recognized general principles any failure of ultimate benefit or title through the purchase does not constitute failure of consideration to relieve from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>liability upon the contract, and such is the settled rule as well in Illinois. Kerney v. Gardner, 27 Ill. 162, 168; Cobb v. Heron, 180 Ill. 49, 54, 54 N. E. 189. This principle is aptly stated by Chief Justice Mitchell, in Ingalls v. Miller, 121 Ind. 188, 22 N. E. 995:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">\u201cThat one who, with all the facts before him, and without fraud, oppression, or imposition, decides his own case against himself cannot afterwards appeal to the courts to reverse his own decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We are of opinion, therefore, that error is not well assigned for reversal, and the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
