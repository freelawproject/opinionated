LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">This is a petition for review of a supplemental decision and order of the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) dismissing Petitioner Walter J. Slaughter\u2019s unfair labor practice complaint. 274 N.L. R.B. No. 176 (1985). For the reasons that follow, we will grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">On July 20, 1982, the Board issued a decision and order in this matter finding that Intervenor E.I. DuPont deNemours &amp; Co. (\u201cDuPont\u201d) violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1982),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by discharging Petitioner from his job in a nonunion plant for refusing to submit to an investigatory interview with his supervisor without a fellow employee present, where Petitioner reasonably believed that the interview might result in disciplinary action. The underlying facts are recounted in detail in our initial opinion in this matter. <em>E.I. DuPont deNemours &amp; Co. (Chestnut Run) v. N.L.R.B., </em>724 F.2d 1061, 1063-64 (3d Cir.1983) <em>(\u201cDuPont </em>/\u201d), <em>vacated, </em>733 F.2d 296 (3d Cir.1984) <em>(\"DuPont I\"). </em>The Board\u2019s original unfair labor practice finding was based on its conclusion that the rule of <em>N.L.R.B. v. J. Weingarten, Inc., </em>420 U.S. 251, 95 S.Ct. 959, 43 L.Ed.2d 171 (1975)\u2014 holding that \u00a7 7 of the Act protected an employee\u2019s right to refuse to submit to an investigatory interview without the presence of a union representative \u2014 also applied in a nonunion setting by virtue of \u00a7 7\u2019s general protection of \u201cother concerted activities for the purpose of ... mutual aid or protection.\u201d 262 N.L.R.B. 1028 (1982) (following <em>Materials Research Corp., </em>262 N.L.R.B. 1010 (1982)). We held that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Act was permissible, 724 F.2d at 1063, and accordingly enforced its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-18\">On February 17, 1984, while DuPont\u2019s petition for rehearing was pending, the Board moved this court to vacate <em>DuPont I </em>and remand the matter to the Board for further consideration. The Board stated that it had another case pending that presented similar issues, that it was giving additional thought to the questions involved, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-19\">the public interest and the interests of the parties would be better served by its considering ... this case together with the other case posing related questions, to issue decisions comprehensively addressing the questions raised in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>area, thereby allowing for more effective judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><em>DuPont II, </em>733 F.2d at 297. \u201cMindful of the deference owed the Board\u2019s special expertise in interpreting the Act,\u201d we determined that \u201cour discretion [was] best exercised by postponing further judicial involvement until we have been informed of a comprehensive adjudication by the NLRB.\u201d 733 F.2d at 297-98 (footnotes omitted). Accordingly, we vacated <em>DuPont I </em>and remanded the matter to the Board for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In <em>Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>274 N.L.R.B. No. 55 (1985), the Board overruled <em>Materials Research, </em>holding that its extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Weingarten </em>decision to nonunion employees was erroneous. 274 N.L.R.B. No. 55, at 2. Following <em>Sears, </em>the Board ruled on remand that Petitioner\u2019s refusal to submit to an investigatory interview without a <em>Weingarten </em>representative<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was not protected concerted activity and dismissed his unfair labor practice complaint. 274 N.L.R.B. No. 176, at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In <em>Sears </em>a majority of the Board held that the Act <em>compels </em>the conclusion that nonunion employees do not enjoy the rights recognized in the <em>Weingarten </em>decision. 274 N.L.R.B. No. 55, at 3 n. 5. The reasoning of <em>Sears </em>was incorporated by reference into the Board\u2019s decision in this case. Thus, if we are to sustain the Board\u2019s action, it must be on the basis that no other interpretation of the Act is permissible, regardless of whether their order could be sustained on other grounds. <em>S.E.C. v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 87, 95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 462, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943); 3 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 14.29 (2d ed. 1980). Because we adhere to this Court\u2019s earlier view, stated in <em>DuPont I, </em>that <em>Materials Research </em>represented a permissible interpretation of the Act, we cannot sustain the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">In <em>Weingarten, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held permissible the Board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 7 as creating a statutory right in an employee to refuse to submit without union representation to an interview that he reasonably fears may result in his being disciplined. 420 U.S. at 260, 95 S.Ct. at 965. The Court described the \u201ccontours and limits of the statutory right,\u201d 420 U.S. at 256, 95 S.Ct. at 963, as defined by the Board in a series of decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\"><em>First, </em>the right inheres in \u00a7 7\u2019s guarantee of the right of employees to act in concert for mutual aid and protection. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\"><em>Second, </em>the right arises only in situations where the employee requests representation. 420 U.S. at 257 [95 S.Ct. at 963].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\"><em>Third, </em>the employee\u2019s right to request representation as a condition of participation in an interview is limited to situations where the employee reasonably believes the investigation will result in disciplinary action. <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ7q\"><em>Fourth, </em>exercise of the right may not interfere with legitimate employer prerogatives. The employer has no obligation to justify his refusal to allow union representation, and despite refusal, the employer is free to carry on his inquiry without interviewing the employee, and thus leave to the employee the choice between having an interview unaccompanied by his representative, or having no interview and foregoing any benefits that might be derived from one. 420 U.S. at 258 [95 S.Ct. at 964].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\"><em>Fifth, </em>the employer has no duty to bargain with any union representative who may be permitted to attend the investigatory interview. 420 U.S. at 259 [95 S.Ct. at 964].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">The Court identified a number of factors supporting the Board\u2019s interpretation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>First, it noted that the action of an employee seeking representation at an investigatory interview clearly constitutes \u201cconcerted activity\u201d for \u201cmutual aid or protection,\u201d even though the employee alone may have a stake in the outcome, since the union representative whose participation is sought would help safeguard the interests of the entire bargaining unit by exercising vigilance over the fairness and uniformity of the employer\u2019s disciplinary practices. 420 U.S. at 260-61, 95 S.Ct. at 965. The Court also suggested that the representative\u2019s presence provides an assurance to other members of the bargaining unit that they could also obtain a representative\u2019s aid and protection if called upon to attend a similar interview. 420 U.S. at 261, 95 S.Ct. at 965. The Court further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">The Board\u2019s construction plainly effectuates the most fundamental purposes of the Act. In \u00a7 1, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, the Act declares that it is a goal of national labor policy to protect \u201cthe exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of ... mutual aid or protection.\u201d To that end the Act is designed to eliminate the \u201cinequality of bargaining power between employees ... and employers.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Requiring a lone employee to attend an investigatory interview which he reasonably believes may result in the imposition of discipline perpetuates the inequality the Act was designed to eliminate, and bars recourse to the safeguards the Act provided \u201cto redress the perceived imbalance of economic power between labor and management.\u201d <em>American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB, </em>380 U.S. 300, 316 [85 S.Ct. 955, 966, 13 L.Ed.2d 855] (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">420 U.S. at 261-62, 95 S.Ct. at 966. The Court also found that the presence of a representative could assist a \u201cfearful and inarticulate\u201d employee to relate accurately the incident being investigated, and that the representative might be able, through informal discussion and persuasion conducted at the threshold, to discourage unjustified grievances. 420 U.S. at 262-63, 95 S.Ct. at 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In <em>Materials Research, supra, </em>the Board considered whether the <em>Weingarten </em>rule applied in a nonunion setting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">The decision in <em>Weingarten, </em>of course, is framed in terms of the right to the assistance of a \u201cunion representative\u201d at an investigatory interview. That terminology, however, was utilized because it accurately depicted the specific fact pattern presented, i.e., an employee in an organized facility requesting the assistance of her union steward, and not because the Court intended to limit the right recognized in <em>Weingarten </em>only to unionized employees. This is readily apparent from the <em>Weingarten </em>decision itself. The Court emphasized that the right to representation is derived from the Section 7 protection afforded to concerted activity for mutual aid or protection, not from a union\u2019s right pursuant to Section 9 to act as an employee\u2019s exclusive representative for the purpose of collective bargaining____ Moreover, the Court carefully differentiated the role assigned to a \u201crepresentative\u201d at an investigatory interview from that of a collective-bargaining representative acting in its representative capacity. Indeed, the term \u201crepresentative\u201d in this context is quite limited in that the role is described as acting as an assistant present \u201cto assist the employee, and ... to clarify the facts or suggest other employees who may have knowledge of them.\u201d [420 U.S. at 260, 95 S.Ct. at 965.] In addition, the Court made it clear that the employer is free to carry on its inquiry without interviewing the employee who requests assistance, thereby leaving the employee the choice of attending the interview unaccompanied, or having no interview and foregoing any benefits that might be derived from one. Finally, to dispel any possible remaining doubt about the matter, the Court stressed that the employer has no obligation to bargain with any such \u201crepresentative\u201d who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>may be permitted to attend an investigatory interview.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">262 N.L.R.B. at 1012 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Board was also, of the view that nonunion employees may have an even <em>greater </em>need for <em>Weingarten </em>representation than union employees, since they do not normally have the benefits of a collective bargaining agreement or established grievance procedures. 262 N.L.R.B. at 1014. The Board rejected the contention that the <em>Weingarten </em>right was not useful where the employee could not avail himself of an experienced shop steward:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">[T]he type of assistance that any individual can provide in the situation outlined in <em>Weingarten </em>is limited and can certainly be performed by a fellow employee. A coworker can assist by eliciting favorable facts and even, perhaps, save the employer production time by helping to get to the bottom of the problem that occasioned the interview. Certainly, that an employee is not part of a represented unit does not alter the real possibility that a single employee, confronted by an employer investigating conduct which may result in discipline, may be too fearful or inarticulate to describe accurately the incident being investigated, or too ignorant to raise extenuating factors, as was noted in <em>Weingarten. </em>Indeed, without the benefit of a grievance-arbitration procedure to check unjust or arbitrary conduct, an employee in an unorganized plant may experience even greater apprehension than one in an organized plant and need the moral support of a sympathetic fellow employee. Moreover, a coworker who has witnessed employer action and can accurately inform co-employees may diminish any tendency by an employer to act unjustly or arbitrarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnW\">262 N.L.R.B. at 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">When Petitioner\u2019s unfair labor practice complaint was first before it, the Board simply incorporated the <em>Materials Research </em>holding \u2014 decided that same day\u2014 without additional analysis. 262 N.L.R.B. 1028, 1029 n. 2 (1982). On cross-petitions for review and enforcement, this court, echoing the reasoning of <em>Materials Research, </em>concluded that \u201cthe logic and reasoning of <em>Weingarten </em>carry equal force in the non-union context.\u201d <em>DuPont I, </em>724 F.2d at 1065.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As noted previously, the panel subsequently vacated this opinion at the Board's request to permit reconsideration of the issues involved. <em>DuPont II, supra. </em>That reconsideration took place in the <em>Sears </em>case, <em>supra, </em>in which a majority of the Board, as then constituted,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> overruled <em>Materials Research, </em>holding that the Act <em>compelled </em>the conclusion that <em>\u201cWein-garten </em>rights are inapplicable where ... there is no certified or recognized union.\u201d 274 N.L.R.B. No. 55, at 2. On the basis of this turnaround in <em>Sears, </em>the Board dismissed Petitioner's complaint on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">The limited role of the federal courts in the administration of the Act is well-established. The Board has the primary responsibility for applying the general provisions of the Act to the complexities of industrial life. <em>Pattern Makers' League v. N.L.R.B., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 3064, 3075, 87 L.Ed.2d 68 (1985). We do not sit to substitute our wisdom on the subject of labor relations for that of the Board, <em>Ford Motor Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>441 U.S. 488, 497, 99 S.Ct. 1842, 1849, 60 L.Ed.2d 420 (1979), nor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ensure \u201cacademic consistency\u201d in its interpretation of the Act, <em>DuPont II, </em>733 F.2d at 297. Rather, we review its interpretations of the Act only to determine their reasonableness, <em>N.L.R.B. v. City Disposal Systems, </em>465 U.S. 822,104 S.Ct. 1505, 1510, 79 L.Ed.2d 839 (1984). Interpretations of the Act that are inconsistent with the statutory mandate, that frustrate the congressional policy, or that rest on an erroneous legal foundation, however, must be set aside. <em>N.L.R.B. v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 291-92, 85 S.Ct. 980, 988, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In recognition of these principles, in <em>DuPont I </em>we sustained the Board\u2019s former view that \u00a7 7 of the Act gave nonunion employees the right to a <em>Weingarten </em>representative, despite the reservations of at least one member of the majority regarding the wisdom of such a practice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In further recognition of the deference owed the Board, the panel vacated <em>DuPont I </em>at the Board\u2019s request, to permit it to reconsider the issues involved. Had the Board, on remand, determined that practical considerations such as those noted by Judge Adams in <em>DuPont I </em>led it to conclude that \u00a7 7 <em>should </em>not be interpreted as extending <em>Weingarten </em>rights to nonunion employees, that determination, too, would be entitled to considerable deference, and we would have a very different case before us. But see <em>Finkin, </em>Labor Law by Boz \u2014 A Theory of Myers Industries, Inc., Sears, Roebuck and Co., <em>and </em>Bird Engineering, 71 Iowa L.Rev. 155 (1985); Note, <em>Extending </em>Wein-garten <em>Rights to Nonunion Employees, </em>86 Colum.L.Rev. 618 (1986). Instead, the Board went much further and held \u2014 in direct contradiction to <em>DuPont </em>/ \u2014 that <em>Materials Research </em>reflected an <em>impermissible (i.e., </em>unreasonable) interpretation of the Act, and that the contrary result was <em>compelled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">It is the Board\u2019s duty to choose amongst permissible interpretations of the Act to best effectuate its overarching goals. <em>See Pattern Makers\u2019 League, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3076-77 (White, J., concurring). Our role is to mark out the boundaries of what the Act permits. <em>See Prill v. N.L.R.B., </em>755 F.2d 941, 942 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Meyers Industries v. Prill, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 313, 352, 188 L.Ed.2d 294 (1985). In <em>DuPont I </em>we held that <em>Materials Research </em>was within those boundaries. Though that opinion was subsequently vacated and is therefore not strictly binding on this panel, we have found nothing in the Board\u2019s opinion in <em>Sears, </em>or in its brief and argument before us now, that would lead us to conclude that our earlier view of what the Act permits was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">The overruling of <em>Materials Research </em>took place with a minimum of fanfare, the <em>Sears </em>majority simply incorporating the <em>Materials Research </em>dissent of then-Chairman Van de Water and making a few \u201cadditional observations.\u201d 274 N.L.R.B. No. 55, at 3. We discern two distinct, yet converging, lines of argument behind the Board\u2019s current position that <em>Materials Research </em>reflected an impermissible interpretation of the Act. First, they argue that <em>Weingarten </em>was premised on the right of <em>organized </em>employees to be free from \u201cdealing with\u201d their employer individually regarding the terms and conditions of employment, and thus is inapplicable here. Second, the Board contends that \u00a7 7 cannot be an independent source of such a right in unorganized employees, because that would be inconsistent with the principle of exclusivity embodied in \u00a7 9(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The Board contends, following Van de Water's <em>Materials Research </em>dissent, that the right to representation at an investigatory interview was, historically and analytically, rooted in \u00a7 8(a)(5) of the Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rather than \u00a7 7, in recognition that \u201cthe unlawful interference caused by an employer\u2019s refusal of a request for a representative is the frustration of an employee\u2019s right to be free from being required to deal <em>individually </em>with the employer in a situation where the established collective-bargaining relationship mandates a right of employees to require that the employer deal with the employee\u2019s selected collective-bargaining representative.\u201d 262 N.L.R.B. at 1017 (Van de Water, Ch., dissenting) (emphasis in original). Van de Water further contended that extension of the <em>Weingarten </em>rule, illogically, gave nonunion employees a right to representation in investigatory interviews that they do not enjoy in \u201cother employer-employee confrontations relating to terms and conditions of employment.\u201d 262 N.L.R.B. at 1019. In a persuasive response, the <em>Materials Research </em>majority stated that Van de Water erroneously relied on a <em>pre-Weingarten </em>case, <em>Texaco</em>, <em>Inc., Houston Producing Division, </em>168 N.L.R.B. 361 (1967), <em>enforcement denied, </em>408 F.2d 142 (5th Cir.1969), involving the right to union representation in an actual <em>disciplinary </em>meeting which, the Board held, affected terms and conditions of employment and thereby implicated the right to be represented by one\u2019s collective bargaining agent. The Board viewed investigatory interviews, on the other hand, \u201cas involving only a potential for action adverse to terms and conditions of employment and, therefore, lacking any matter to which a bargaining obligation attached.\u201d 262 N.L.R.B. at 1013. <em>See also Weingarten, </em>420 U.S. at 259-60, 95 S.Ct. at 964 (\u201cThe Board thus adhered to its decisions distinguishing between disciplinary and investigatory interviews, imposing a mandatory affirmative obligation to meet with the union representative only in the case of the disciplinary interview.\u201d). Thus, in the case of investigatory interviews, the employer need not bargain, and can even bypass the interview altogether. Nor does the fact that the right is specifically limited to situations where there is a reasonable apprehension of discipline demonstrate, as the Board suggests, that the employee\u2019s right is linked to the employer\u2019s bargaining obligation. That requirement was merely intended to ensure that the right would not apply \u201cto such run-of-the-mill shop-floor conversations as, for example, the giving of instructions or training or needed corrections of work techniques.\u201d <em>Weingarten, </em>420 U.S. at 257-58, 95 S.Ct. at 964 (quoting <em>Quality Mfg. Co., </em>195 N.L.R.B. 197, 199 (1972), <em>enforcement denied in part, </em>481 F.2d 1018 (4th Cir.1973), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom., ILGWU v. Quality Mfg. Co., </em>420 U.S. 276, 95 S.Ct. 972, 43 L.Ed.2d 189 (1975)). We think it is plain beyond cavil that the <em>Weingarten </em>right is rooted in \u00a7 7\u2019s protection of concerted activity, not \u00a7 8(a)(5)\u2019s guarantee of the right to bargain collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The Board also relies oh <em>Emporium Capwell Co. v. Western Addition Community Organization, </em>420 U.S. 50, 95 S.Ct. 977, 43 L.Ed.2d 12 (1975). That case involved a group of minority employees who confronted their employers directly on race discrimination issues, rather than utilizing the grievance mechanism created by their union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement. The employees argued that they were engaged in protected concerted activity within the meaning of \u00a7 7. The Court held that such activity was proscribed under \u00a7 9(a), because it constituted an attempt to bargain with the employer over the terms and conditions of employment as they affected racial minorities. The Court reasoned that the exclusive representation principle contained in \u00a7 9(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>and the principle of majority rule central to the Act\u2019s policy of fostering collective bargaining left no room for separate bargaining by dissident employees in a unionized workplace, but rather \u201cextinguishes the individual employee\u2019s power to order his own relations with his employer and creates a power vested in the chosen representative to act in the interest of all employees.\u201d 420 U.S. at 63, 95 S.Ct. at 985 (quoting <em>N.L.R.B. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 175, 180, 87 S.Ct. 2001, 2006, 18 L.Ed.2d 1123 (1967)). A contrary conclusion would undermine \u201cthe orderly collective-bargaining process contemplated by the NLRA,\u201d as well as the duly elected union\u2019s \u201clegitimate interest in presenting a united front on this as on other issues and in not seeing its strength dissipated and its stature denigrated by subgroups within the unit separately pursuing what they see as separate interests.\u201d 420 U.S. at 69-70, 95 S.Ct. at 988. Because the minority caucus\u2019 attempt to bargain separately undermined the union\u2019s status as the exclusive bargaining representative under \u00a7 9(a), it was not a legitimate and protected exercise of \u00a7 7 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Board describes <em>Emporium Cap-well </em>as standing for the broad proposition that \u00a7 7 rights are circumscribed by \u00a7 9(a), and contends that the right asserted by Petitioner conflicts with \u00a7 9(a)\u2019s exclusivity principle. The Board\u2019s analysis misconstrues <em>Emporium Capwell. </em>That decision was grounded in the need to protect the union\u2019s \u00a7 9(a) status as the majority-elected, exclusive bargaining representative, so to assure orderly collective bargaining. It cannot, therefore, be read to hold that the \u00a7 9(a) exclusive representation rule limits the \u00a7 7 rights of non-unionized employees. Section 9(a) on its face simply defines the status and role of a union once recognized or certified as the collective bargaining representative pursuant to the wishes of a majority of bargaining unit members. <em>Emporium Capwell </em>is thus irrelevant in the setting where there is no union, no exclusive bargaining representative, and no collective bargaining. This is highlighted by the fact that, as discussed above, <em>Weingar-ten </em>expressly held that the employer has no duty to bargain with the union representative in attendance at an investigatory interview. Board Member Hunter made this observation in his separate opinion in <em>Sears,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>stating \u201cI am unable to understand the majority\u2019s reasoning as to how <em>Emporium Capwell </em>has any relevancy to the issue here, which, as I have noted, has nothing to do with collective bargaining.\u201d 274 N.L.R.B. No. 55, at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The Board\u2019s two lines of argument begin to merge when it contends that, although there is no duty to \u201cbargain\u201d with a union representative at an investigatory interview, there is a duty, based on <em>Weingar-ten, </em>to \u201cdeal\u201d with the representative by allowing him or her to speak, to make proposals and suggestions or to offer alternative forms of discipline. Since such functions constitute \u201cdealing with\u201d the employer, the argument continues, and \u201cdealing with\u201d an employer is a primary indicium of labor organization status as well as a traditional union function, placing a <em>Weingar-ten </em>representative in a non-union setting means requiring the employer to recognize and deal with the equivalent of a union representative, contrary to the Act\u2019s exclusivity principle. 274 N.L.R.B. No. 55, at 7. This, however, blurs the Act\u2019s distinction between \u201cdealing\u201d and \u201cbargaining.\u201d One commentator has persuasively refuted this argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">The entire argument rests upon a non sequitur. A statutory labor organization is indeed one that \u201cdeals with\u201d employers, not one that \u201cbargains\u201d with employers. This broader formulation was chosen to give the greatest possible reach to the Act\u2019s prohibition of company unionism. And the majority is indeed correct in observing that a single individual can qualify as a statutory exclusive bargaining representative under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>9(a). But the system of exclusive representation, which the majority claims would be derogated from by the extension of <em>Weingarten </em>to the unorganized, is expressly one of collective bargaining, not of dealing. Accordingly, if, as the Supreme Court held, the employer has no statutory duty to bargain with the <em>Wein-garten </em>representative, the function of that representative in the unorganized setting cannot be in derogation of the exclusivity principle or any other important statutory policy. And for that reason, just as Member Hunter\u2019s concurrence seemed to recognize, <em>Emporium Capwell </em>is spectacularly irrelevant to the question presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Finkin, <em>supra, </em>71 Iowa L.Rev. at 182 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We now reaffirm our previous view that under the reasoning of <em>Weingarten </em>it is at least permissible to interpret \u00a7 7 as guaranteeing union members and unorganized employees alike the right to a representative at investigatory interviews. If that interpretation is permissible under the Act, it follows that the directly contradictory view expressed in <em>Sears </em>is not compelled. Because the Board\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s complaint was based on the erroneous premise that such a result was compelled by the Act, we must under the <em>Chenery </em>rule grant the petition for review and remand to the Board. Accordingly, we have no occasion to consider in the first instance whether the interpretation of the Act announced in <em>Sears </em>is a permissible one, or whether the Board\u2019s action might be sustained on that alternative ground. <em>Cf. Ewing v. N.L.R.B., </em>768 F.2d 51, 54-56 (2d Cir.1985); <em>Prill v.
