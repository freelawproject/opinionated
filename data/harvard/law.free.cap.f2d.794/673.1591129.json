We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-30\">Without again reviewing the circumstances of the strike or the general air controller arguments that have been rejected in <em>Schapansky v. Department of Transportation, FAA, </em>735 F.2d 477 (Fed.Cir.), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 432, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984), and other \u201clead cases,\u201d we proceed immediately to consider the particular situations and contentions of the five individuals now before us. In each instance we believe that the presiding official\u2019s opinion dealt adequately with petitioner\u2019s arguments, but we discuss briefly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the major individual points proffered to us in support of reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\n<em>Brickner and Novitsky</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">These petitioners claim that they did not report for their deadline shifts (which came after August 5, 11 a.m.) because they had heard from other controllers that their supervisor (Kenneth Erb) had stated that many controllers had already been fired and that anyone who had not reported by 11 o\u2019clock was or would be separated. Petitioners have said they believed that this statement meant that they too had already been removed. However, Brickner had been correctly informed by other controllers, shortly before he received this news, about the concept of a \u201cdeadline shift\u201d (which could occur after August 5,11 a.m.). Novitsky had received a telegram from the agency telling him to report for his next shift. The presiding officer held, in both instances, that the petitioners should have attempted to resolve \u2014 by communicating directly with Erb or another official person \u2014 the apparent conflict between the secondhand, hearsay information as to what Erb had said and the contrasting information as to the importance of meeting the deadlines they had already received. Neither Brickner nor Novitsky made any attempt to clarify his alleged confusion; they both simply stayed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">We agree with the presiding official that, on these facts, the petitioners were properly removed. This court has already indicated that controllers not intending to strike (nor participating in it) would not cavalierly accept, without inquiry, the loss of their jobs because of their own mistaken view that they had to return precisely by 11 o\u2019clock on August 5, 1981. <em>Adams v. Department of Transportation, FAA, </em>735 F.2d 488, 491 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 432, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984). <em>A fortiori, </em>controllers who received secondhand reports as to alleged statements by their supervisor \u2014 reports directly contradicting the controllers\u2019 previous information \u2014 would and should have made some inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"AUY\">Petitioners rely on the full Board\u2019s decision in <em>Benson v. Department of Transportation, FAA, </em>19 MSPR 596 (1984), reversing the removal of certain other controllers from the same facility who relied on Erb\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Benson </em>was quite different. Those four controllers \u201cproceeded to the home of supervisor Erb in order to get clarification concerning their confused work situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601. Erb told them directly, face to face, that they had already been fired as of 11 o\u2019clock that morning and could not return to work. This was of course incorrect, but those controllers reasonably relied on that erroneous statement. In the very same decision, however, the Board refused (over a dissent) to cancel the removal of two other controllers who, like petitioners here, did not meet with Erb and \u201cfailed to inquire of any management official concerning their deadline shift\u201d but instead relied on statements of others as to what Erb had said. <em>Id. </em>at 602. If the <em>Benson </em>decision has any bearing on the present case, it is solely this latter aspect of that ruling which sanctioned removal of controllers in the same situation as Brickner and Novitsky.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">\n<em>Lane and Snyder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">Lane and Snyder contend that they were on uncancelled annual leave at the time the agency thought they had to report to work. There was, however, an outstanding order of the Pittsburgh facility cancel-ling all outstanding leave at the time of the strike. Lane admitted he was aware of that order but thought it was countermanded by a telegram from the agency which told him to report for work on his next scheduled shift (his previously scheduled shift was after his annual leave was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>end). The presiding official disbelieved this explanation as \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and correctly held that, in any event, Lane should have made inquiry in the light of the allegedly confusing signals. <em>See </em>Part I, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Snyder signed the Pittsburgh order can-celling leave but says he had not read it. Like Lane, he too had received a telegram calling him back to work during the strike. The presiding official properly held that Snyder\u2019s testimony that he did not think he had to return during his previously authorized leave was entitled to no credence and that Lane was to be held accountable for knowing about the cancellation order bearing his own signature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\n<em>Stumpf</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Petitioner Stumpf\u2019s argument is that he was either on approved annual leave or had regular days off for the entire period from August 3 through August 10, 1981 \u2014 and that he was never notified that his leave was cancelled. The presiding official found that (a) Stumpf was not on approved annual leave for as much time as he claimed; (b) he was aware that, in the event of a strike, his leave would be cancelled; and (c) he must have been aware of the existence of the strike. These findings are supported by substantial evidence and stemmed from unassailable determinations of credibility. <em>E.g., Griessenauer v. Department of Energy, </em>754 F.2d 361 (Fed.Cir.1985). Furthermore, petitioner admitted that he had earlier been ordered to report for work or to call the facility for an assignment in the event of a strike. He never did so but continued to stay away.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-21\">. Oral argument has been heard in these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-10\">. Of course, a Board decision is not precedent in this court, but we consider it because petitioners argue disparate treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\">. These petitioners cite another portion of the Board\u2019s <em>Benson </em>decision (discussed in Part I, supra) which upheld the presiding official\u2019s reversal of the removal of two other controllers. There, unlike this case, the presiding official believed \u2014 on the facts of those cases \u2014 those controllers\u2019 testimony that they did not think the order cancelling leave applied to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
