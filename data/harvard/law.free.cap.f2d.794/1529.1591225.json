The District Court\u2019s judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-22\">\n<em>Trying to Avoid the Horrors of the Bar Exam</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-23\">Plaintiff-Appellant Edwin Berman is an attorney entitled to practice law in Illinois, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>and a judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County. Berman received a law degree from the University of Miami School of Law issued to him in 1982, nunc pro tunc to 1952. In June, 1984, he filed a request with the Florida Board of Bar Examiners to be admitted to the Florida bar without sitting for the bar exam. His request was made pursuant to a statutory \u201cDiploma Privilege\u201d waiving the bar exam requirement for graduates of Florida law schools. The relevant statute was in effect in 1952, but has since been repealed. Berman\u2019s request for admission under the \u201cDiploma Privilege\u201d was denied on October 16, 1984, and he subsequently filed a Petition for a Rule to Show Cause with the Florida Supreme Court. The Florida Board of Bar Examiners filed a response in the Supreme Court of Florida which contained legal argument addressed to Berman\u2019s \u201cDiploma Privilege\u201d claims. Berman\u2019s petition was denied without opinion or statement of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-4\">Thereafter, Berman brought this \u00a7 1983 action in federal district court alleging constitutional violations in connection with the denial of his bar application. The District Court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Berman\u2019s complaint since the complaint was, in essence, an effort to have an \u201cinferior\u201d federal court review the decision of the state supreme court. This appeal followed, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-5\">\n<em>A Legal Distinction Worthy of a Bar Exam</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-6\">For purposes of subject matter jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has recognized a critical distinction among cases brought in federal district court by disgruntled state bar applicants. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). In essence, there are two types of claims which a frustrated bar applicant might bring in federal court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1598-7\">(1) A constitutional challenge to a state\u2019s general rules and procedures governing admission to the state\u2019s bar; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1598-8\">(2) A claim, based on constitutional or other grounds, that a state court\u2019s judicial decision in a particular case has resulted in the unlawful denial of admission to a particular bar applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1598-10\">Federal district courts have jurisdiction over the first type of claim but not the second. <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 486, 103 S.Ct. at 1317, 75 L.Ed.2d at 225. According to the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1598-11\">United States District Courts ... have subject-matter jurisdiction over general challenges to state bar rules, promulgated by state courts in nonjudicial proceedings, which do not require review of a final state-court judgment in a particular case. They do not have jurisdiction, however, over challenges to state-court decisions in particular cases arising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges allege that the state court\u2019s action was unconstitutional. Review of those decisions may be had only in [the Supreme Court on certiorari].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1598-12\"><em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 486, 103 S.Ct. at 1317, 75 L.Ed.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-13\">The present suit is clearly a challenge to a state court judicial proceeding resulting in the denial of a particular application (Berman\u2019s) for admission to the Florida Bar. In his federal complaint, Berman\u2019s prayer for relief specifically requests a finding that Berman should be admitted to the Florida bar pursuant to the \u201cDiploma Privilege.\u201d He does not challenge the constitutionality of any existing rule or procedure; he only argues that he qualifies for admission pursuant to the \u201cDiploma Privilege,\u201d and that the adjudication of his application was therefore in error. Thus, Berman\u2019s claim is within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court rather than the original jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
