At his deportation hearing, Rebollo-Jovel conceded deportability and applied for withholding of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h) and for political asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a). The immigration judge (IJ) denied both applications. The Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) dismissed Rebollo-JovePs appeal, holding that he had failed to show either a \u201cclear probability\u201d or a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution. Rebollo-Jovel petitions for review, contending, first, that the Board applied the unduly heavy \u201cclear probability\u201d burden of proof to his asylum-eligibility claim and,-second, that in any event he did demonstrate a. \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d sufficient to entitle him to withholding of deportation and to render him eligible for a discretionary grant of asylum. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">To be entitled to withholding of deportation to a country, an alien must show a \u201cclear probability\u201d that his life or freedom would be threatened in such country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h). \u201cClear probability\u201d requires a showing that persecution is \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 424, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 2498, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); <em>Espinoza-Martinez v. INS, </em>754 F.2d 1536, 1539 (9th Cir.1985) <em>(Espinoza-Martinez). </em>Evidence of general conditions of strife is insufficient by itself to establish a clear probability of persecution. <em>See Espinoza-Martinez, </em>754 F.2d at 1540; <em>Chavez v. INS, </em>723 F.2d 1431, 1433-34 (9th Cir.1984) <em>(Chavez). </em>We review withholding of deportation decisions for substantial evidence. <em>Espinoza-Martinez, </em>754 F.2d at 1539.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">To be eligible for a discretionary grant of asylum, a petitioner must show a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution in his home country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a), 1101(a)(42)(A). A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d contains both a subjective component, requiring the fear to be genuine, and an objective component, which \u201crequires a showing, by credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record, of facts that would support a <em>reasonable </em>fear that the petitioner faces persecution.\u201d <em>Diaz-Escobar v. INS, </em>782 F.2d 1488, 1492 (9th Cir.1986) <em>(Diaz-Escobar) </em>(emphasis added). Because this standard requires slightly less than a showing that persecution is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d <em>id., </em>the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard is somewhat more generous than the \u201cclear probability\u201d standard. <em>Id.; Bolanos-Hemandez v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1277, 1282-83 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Argueta v. INS, </em>759 F.2d 1395, 1396-97 (9th Cir.1985). We must determine whether substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Rebollo-Jovel has failed to prove a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>well-founded fear of persecution. <em>Diaz-Es-cobar, </em>782 F.2d at 1491-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The Board denied Rebollo-Jovel\u2019s request for withholding of deportation because he failed to demonstrate a \u201cclear probability of persecution.\u201d In denying Rebollo-Jov-el\u2019s application for asylum, the Board stated that he had failed to substantiate his asylum claim \u201cregardless of whether such claim is assessed in terms of demonstrating a \u2018clear probability,\u2019 a \u2018realistic likelihood,\u2019 a \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 or a \u2018good reason to fear\u2019 persecution.\u201d The Board has since made it clear that it does not regard the well-founded fear standard and the clear probability standard to be meaningfully different. <em>See Matter of Acosta, </em>Interim Dec. No. 2986 (BIA Mar. 1, 1985) <em>(Acosta). </em>Re-bollo-Jovel argues that the Board erroneously applied the clear probability standard to his asylum claim. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) urges us to adopt the Board\u2019s position in <em>Acosta, </em>in effect asking us to overrule Ninth Circuit precedents. The primary question before us is what we should do when faced with a Board opinion that denies asylum on the ground that the alien failed to demonstrate a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution, whether that term is defined as a \u201cclear probability,\u201d a \u201crealistic likelihood,\u201d a \u201creasonable possibility,\u201d or a \u201cgood reason.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We have had several occasions to consider cases in which the Board used similar words to summarize its review of a request for asylum. Most often we have upheld the Board\u2019s denial of asylum in these cases. <em>Compare Vides-Vides v. INS, </em>783 F.2d 1463, 1468-69 (9th Cir.1986) <em>(Vides-Vides); Quintanilla-Ticas v. INS, </em>783 F.2d 955, 957 (9th Cir.1986) <em>(Quintanilla-Ticas); Chatila v. INS, </em>770 F.2d 786, 790 (9th Cir.1985) <em>(Chatila); Saballo-Cortez v. INS, </em>761 F.2d 1259, 1262 (9th Cir.1984) <em>(SaballoCortez), with Cardoza-Fonseca v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1448, 1450, 1453-54 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6 (9th Cir.1985) <em>(Cardoza-Fonseca), cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1181, 89 L.Ed.2d 298 (1986). The Board\u2019s choice of words in this case is problematic primarily because it has indicated, in <em>Acosta, </em>that it believes the \u201cclear probability\u201d and \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standards \u201care not meaningfully different and, in practical application, converge.\u201d <em>Acosta, </em>at 25. Although the circuits are divided on this question, <em>compare Sankar v. INS, </em>757 F.2d 532, 533 (3d Cir.1985), <em>with Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>and the Supreme Court has granted certiorari in one of our cases apparently to resolve the dispute, <em>see INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1181, 89 L.Ed.2d 298 (1986), our case law quite clearly establishes that the legal difference between \u201cclear probability\u201d and \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d must be respected. <em>See Vides-Vides, </em>783 F.2d at 1468.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">Unless the Supreme Court directs otherwise, we cannot uphold denials of asylum based upon a failure to demonstrate that persecution is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d and we thus require the Board to indicate that it has applied a somewhat less demanding standard. <em>See id. </em>At the same time, we recognize that the Board need not entirely segregate its analysis of \u201cclear probability\u201d and \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d because if an alien \u201cfail[s] to show a well-founded fear of persecution, he <em>a fortiori </em>fail[s] to show a clear probability of it whether or not the latter standard is more stringent or the same as the former.\u201d <em>Diaz-Escobar, </em>782 F.2d at 1491; <em>see also Quintanilla-Ticas, </em>783 F.2d at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">Nothing in our case law suggests that the use of certain words should lead either to automatic affirmance, or to automatic reversal. <em>See Vides-Vides, </em>783 F.2d at 1468-69. Where the Board applies an erroneous standard in reviewing an asylum claim, it should not be able to protect its decision by invoking a talismanic litany of words. We address questions relating to the standard applied on a case-by-case basis, deciding each not on the basis of \u201ccertain magic words,\u201d but on the basis of what the Board actually did. <em>Id. </em>Still, the several circuit court cases in which the Board ruled against aliens\u2019 asylum claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>using the same or similar language afford us considerable guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In <em>Carvajal-Munoz v. INS, </em>743 F.2d 562, 575 (7th Cir.1984) (Carvajal-Munoz), the Board held that an alien\u2019s evidence failed to meet any of several standards. The Seventh Circuit concluded that \u201calthough it did not go into detail regarding the specific evidentiary burden connected with each of the two standards,\u201d the Board\u2019s reference to \u201cgood reason\u201d and \u201crealistic likelihood\u201d as well as to \u201cclear probability\u201d made it apparent that the Board had assessed the evidence under an appropriately lenient standard. <em>Id.; see id. </em>at 572-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In <em>Saballo-Cortez, </em>we reasoned similarly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">We note that the [Board] found that Sa-ballo-Cortez failed to meet his burden of proof \u201cwhether his claim is assessed in terms of whether he has demonstrated \u2018clear probability,\u2019 \u2018good reason,\u2019 or \u2018realistic likelihood\u2019 of persecution.\u201d Thus, we cannot say on this record that the [Board] improperly applied the clear probability of persecution standard, as claimed by Saballo-Cortez.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">761 F.2d at 1262. The Board\u2019s language made plain enough that it had done more than to apply the \u201cclear probability\u201d standard alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Eight months later, in <em>Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>we struck down a denial of asylum despite the Board\u2019s use, in an unpublished and nonprecedential decision, of similar language. The record in <em>Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>however, was significantly different from its predecessor cases. We wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">The [Board] affirmed, stating that no matter what burden of proof Cardoza-Fonseca faced, whether \u201c \u2018clear probability,\u2019 \u2018good reason\u2019 or \u2018realistic likelihood,\u2019 \u201d all of which the Board thought to be identical, she failed to show that she <em>\u201cwould </em>suffer persecution.\u201d The Board also reasoned that her claim failed because she had not introduced any objective evidence to demonstrate that she <em>\u201cwill </em>be subject to persecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">767 F.2d at 1450 (emphasis supplied by court).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Thus, we concluded that the Board erroneously demanded proof that the alien <em>would </em>suffer persecution, and that its articulation of other standards of proof did not change this. In effect, the Board had held that \u201c \u2018good reason\u2019 or \u2018realistic likelihood\u2019 meant no more and no less than \u2018clear probability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1454 (footnote omitted). We recognized that this represented a departure from the usual usage. We wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">We need not decide whether the phrase \u201cgood reason\u201d could be synonymous with \u201cwell-founded fear.\u201d In either event, <em>it is clear from the standards applied to Cardoza-Fonseca\u2019s claim, </em>as well as from its position in <em>Lam, </em>[18 I&amp;N Dec. 15 (BIA 1982),] in <em>Acosta, </em>in its briefs, and at oral argument, that the Board did not apply the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">767 F.2d at 1454 n.6 (emphasis added). We struck down the Board\u2019s decision because it was \u201cclear\u201d from its opinion that it had applied the \u201cclear probability\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>Apparently, the INS conceded this \u201cin its briefs, and at oral argument.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">Notably, in <em>Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>we cited <em>Carvajal-Munoz </em>approvingly, and relied heavily on its analysis of the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 1453. Furthermore, in <em>Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>we did not even remotely suggest a repudiation of either <em>Sa-ballo-Cortez </em>or <em>Carvajal-Munoz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">In subsequent cases we have upheld the Board\u2019s denial of asylum as we did in <em>Sa-ballo-Cortez. </em>In <em>Chatila, </em>for example, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-17\">[The Board] recognized that there is a difference between the \u201cclear probability\u201d and the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standards. ... [The Board] stated that its conclusion \u201cas to [Mr. Chatila\u2019s] claim is the same whether we apply a standard of \u2018clear probability,\u2019 \u2018good reason,\u2019 or \u2018realistic likelihood.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">770 F.2d at 790. The Board\u2019s words indicated that it did not limit its asylum inquiry to the demanding clear probability stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>dard, but considered an appropriately less-demanding standard as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In <em>Quintanilla-Ticas, </em>we acknowledged that the Board\u2019s reference to several standards was confusing insofar as it did not explicitly differentiate and define each of the various standards stated, but upheld the Board because it had recognized the existence of a distinction between the standards for asylum and for withholding of deportation. 783 F.2d at 957. Similar words were adequate in <em>Vides-Vides, </em>where we held that \u201c[although the [Board\u2019s] decision fails to state explicitly that the asylum standard is \u2018more generous\u2019 or \u2018more liberal,\u2019 this cannot be regarded as a fatal flaw.\u201d 783 F.2d at 1468. We were satisfied because the Board\u2019s words, taken in the context of the opinion as a whole, reflected its \u201crecognition, although not necessarily adoption, of distinctive standards.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Our cases thus accept the Board\u2019s language in its common meaning. We ought not to impute uncommon meanings to the Board\u2019s words, unless the Board has given us a clear indication that it is using words in either a technical or somehow incorrect sense. Certainly, we ought not jump to the conclusion that the Board is endeavoring to mislead us. <em>See United Steelworkers v. Marshall, </em>647 F.2d 1189, 1217 (D.C.Cir.1980), cer<em>t. denied, </em>453 U.S. 913, 101 S.Ct. 3149, 69 L.Ed.2d 997 (1981); <em>FTC v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>626 F.2d 966, 975 (D.C.Cir.1980); Will<em>apoint Oysters, Inc. v. Ewing, </em>174 F.2d 676, 696 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 U.S. 860, 70 S.Ct. 101, 94 L.Ed. 527 (1949); <em>cf. United States v. Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 415-16, 61 S.Ct. 999, 1001-02, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1941). The clear import of the Board\u2019s words in all of these cases was that the Board had endeavored, except in <em>Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>to apply more than one standard \u2014 whether or not it believed it should be required to.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In this case, the Board first acknowledged that to be eligible for withholding of deportation an alien must demonstrate a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution \u2014 which it defined as a showing that persecution is \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d Board dec. at 2. The Board recognized that to qualify for asylum, on the other hand, the alien need demonstrate only a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution. The Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">In the case before us, we find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate his eligibility for withholding of deportation. We also find that he has failed to adequately substantiate his asylum claim regardless of whether such claim is assessed in terms of demonstrating a \u201cclear probability,\u201d a \u201crealistic likelihood,\u201d a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d or a \u201cgood reason to fear\u201d persecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 2-3. We are satisfied that the Board did not limit its analysis of the asylum claim to a determination of whether a \u201cclear probability\u201d had been demonstrated. Taken at face value, the passage shows that the Board concluded that Rebollo-Jov-el\u2019s request for asylum failed no matter which standard is applied, including the lesser standard required by our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">Merely because we disagree with the Board\u2019s opinion in <em>Acosta </em>that \u201cclear probability\u201d and \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d should be treated as essentially the same standard does not require that the petition be granted. It does not follow that, because the Board would prefer to equate \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d with \u201cclear probability,\u201d it always applies the \u201cclear probability\u201d standard no matter what else it says. Neither must we conclude that the Board applied <em>Acosta\u2019s </em>\u201cclear probability\u201d standard to the asylum claim in this case merely because the INS is urging us to adopt that standard ourselves. Our review is concerned with what the Board did, not with whether the INS, or even the Board, would like us to adopt a new standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">The Board in <em>Acosta </em>recognized that \u201c[t]he Ninth Circuit ... has concluded that the well-founded-fear standard is more generous to an alien than the clear-probability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>standard.\u201d <em>Acosta, </em>at 25. It acknowledged that \u201c[t]he Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits ... appear to have chosen the language \u2018good reason\u2019 or \u2018valid reason\u2019 to fear persecution to describe this standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23; <em>see Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>767 F.2d at 1453-54. Thus, although <em>Acosta </em>equated well-founded fear with clear probability, <em>Acosta </em>itself associates \u201cgood reason to fear\u201d with the lesser showing required by the Ninth Circuit. \u201cWhether a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 of persecution is called a \u2018reasonable chance,\u2019 a \u2018reasonable possibility,\u2019 a \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 ... a \u2018reasonable expectation\u2019 \u201d \u2014 or a \u201cgood reason to fear\u201d \u2014\u201cis not decisive.\u201d <em>Diaz-Escobar, </em>782 F.2d at 1492.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><em>Acosta </em>is consistent with the Board\u2019s word usage in other cases. In <em>Lopez v. INS, </em>775 F.2d 1015, 1016 (9th Cir.1985) <em>(Lopez), </em>for example, we reviewed a decision in which the Board wrote \u201cour conclusion is the same whether we apply the standard of \u2018clear probability,\u2019 or a <em>lesser standard, </em>such as a \u2018good reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1016 (quoting Board opinion) (emphasis added in <em>Lopez). </em>We cannot conclude that the Board regards \u201cgood reason to fear\u201d as expressing anything other than a lesser standard than \u201cclear probability.\u201d The Board explicitly applied the \u201cgood reason to fear\u201d standard in evaluating Rebollo-Jovel\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Our cases thus have a unifying theme: we should take the Board at its word when it states that it believes a claim should fail under any standard it might apply, unless it is clear to us, from their context in each case, that the Board\u2019s words mean something else. Although we have determined that the Board used appropriate legal standards to analyze Rebollo-Jovel\u2019s claims, we still must determine whether substantial evidence supports its conclusions under those standards. <em>See Diaz-Escobar, </em>782 F.2d at 1491-92; <em>Quintanilla-Ticas, </em>783 F.2d at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Rebollo-Jovel testified before the IJ that his \u201cuncle,\u201d who was actually his father\u2019s cousin and shared the family name \u201cRebol-lo,\u201d served as Minister of Education of El Salvador and was assassinated in 1979, reportedly by members of extremist groups. Rebollo-Jovel contended that he would be harmed because of his relationship to his uncle and because of his family name. He testified that two of his cousins were recently killed. One of these was killed while standing at a bus-stop, and the other died of shots fired at a bus on which he was riding. Rebollo-Jovel offered no evidence that his cousins\u2019 killings were politically motivated, and neither cousin shared his family name. Rebollo-Jovel\u2019s own involvement with politics was insignificant. He, his parents and sibling lived in El Salvador without harm, and his parents and sibling continue to live there.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Rebollo-Jovel also stated that he was \u201cinterrogated,\u201d apparently regarding rental payments, by three individuals posing as policemen who told him \u201cnot to get involved\u201d in matters that were none of his business. He received three threatening messages in 1979, one by telephone and two on the windshield of his car, also warning him in substance \u201cto mind [his] own business.\u201d Rebollo-Jovel suggested that the notes had something to do with his employment or association with a soccer team; however, the motives for Rebollo-Jovel\u2019s interrogation and for these threats were not established. Nothing in the record suggests that they were political. <em>Cf. Diaz-Escobar, </em>782 F.2d at 1493 (\u201cThere is no indication in the record that the notice on his windshield was from any political organization.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">On these facts, the Board was unpersuaded that Rebollo Jovel\u2019s fears of political persecution were objectively reasonable. Although his uncle\u2019s death apparently was a political killing, the Board concluded that RebolloJovel\u2019s fears of a similar fate were not grounded in reasonable likelihood, because he was not an immediate family member of his uncle, and because, unlike his uncle, he was not politically active. Nothing suggested that the deaths of his cousins, or the threats he received, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>were politically motivated, or that they evidenced anything more than the general conditions of unrest and violence in El Salvador. To qualify for political asylum, Re-bollo-Jovel must demonstrate that potential persecution would be directed at him as an individual, <em>Espinoza-Martinez, </em>754 F.2d at 1540, and that it would be politically motivated. <em>Zayas-Marini v. INS, </em>785 F.2d 801, 805-06 (9th Cir.1986). We have repeatedly \u201crejected the contention that a citizen of El Salvador can establish eligibility for asylum merely by pointing out that political violence is widespread there.\u201d <em>Sarvia-Quintanilla v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1387, 1394 (9th Cir.1985); <em>see, e.g., Chavez, </em>723 F.2d at 1434; <em>Martinez-Romero v. INS, </em>692 F.2d 595, 595-96 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The alien bears the burden of proof in both asylum and withholding of deportation cases. <em>Diaz-Escobar, </em>782 F.2d at 1492. With respect to asylum we conclude that Rebollo-Jovel \u201cfailed to establish ... fear of persecution under any standard.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>775 F.2d at 1016. Because Rebollo-Jovel failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability or \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution to support eligibility for asylum, he <em>a fortiori </em>failed to demonstrate entitlement to withholding of deportation under the clear probability standard. <em>See Diaz-Escobar, </em>782 F.2d at 1491; <em>Larimi v. INS, </em>782 F.2d 1494, 1497 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b528-6\">BEEZER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aop-dedup-0\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">I fully concur in the opinion of the court. I write separately only to point out that the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals in this case was rendered prior to its decision in <em>In re Matter of Acosta, </em>Interim Dec. No. 2986 (BIA March 1,1985). Consequently, today\u2019s decision cannot answer the question, which was expressly left open in our previous decision in <em>Vides-Vides v. INS, </em>783 F.2d 1463 (9th Cir.1986), as to what effect the BIA\u2019s holding in <em>Acosta </em>should have upon our review of future BIA decisions which use similar language in disposing of asylum claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">In <em>Vides-Vides, </em>we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">In <em>Acosta, </em>the BIA firmly adopted the position that there is no meaningful difference between the standards for asylum and withholding of deportation, thereby expressly rejecting the position adopted in this circuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">Decisions of the BIA rendered prior to the adoption of this approach in <em>Acosta </em>need not necessarily be read as definitely rejecting differentiating standards for prohibition of deportation and asylum</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">In light of <em>Acosta, </em>it may be appropriate henceforth to require a more explicit statement from the BIA that, even were it to apply a more generous standard such as required in this circuit, it would still deny the asylum petition____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">783 F.2d at 1468 n. 3.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b528-14\">CANBY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AT9Y\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">I agree with that portion of Judge Wallace\u2019s opinion that upholds the Board\u2019s determination that Rebollo-Jovel is not entitled to withholding of deportation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h). I dissent, however, from the denial of review of Rebollo-Jovel\u2019s claim for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a). I would grant the petition for review of that issue, and would reverse the Board\u2019s decision and remand the case to the Board for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">This court has made it abundantly clear that the \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d standard for asylum claims is \u201cmore generous\u201d than the \u201cclear probability\u201d standard for withholding of deportation because of threat to life or freedom. <em>E.g., Cardoza-Fonseca v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1448, 1451 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1181, 89 L.Ed.2d 298 (1986); <em>Bolanos-Hernandez v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1277, 1281-83 (9th Cir.1984). The difference between the standards is an important one.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asn8\">The term \u201cclear probability\u201d requires a showing that there is a greater-than-fifty-percent chance of persecution. In contrast, the term \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d requires that (1) the alien have a subjective fear, and (2) that this fear have enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>of a basis that it can be considered well-founded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><em>Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>767 F.2d at 1452-53. Because of the difference in standards, some aliens who cannot qualify for mandatory withholding of deportation because of their inability to show a clear probability that their lives or freedom would be threatened by return to their countries, may nevertheless be able to qualify for discretionary grants of asylum by showing a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">As the majority opinion recognizes, the Board has never accepted the view that the standards of \u201cclear probability\u201d and \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d are different. On the contrary, it has consistently equated the two standards, <em>see Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>767 F.2d at 1451, and has most recently and thoroughly reiterated its position in <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>Interim Dec. 2986 (BIA March 1, 1985). There the Board concluded, after lengthy discussion, that \u201cthe standards for asylum and withholding of deportation are not meaningfully different and, in practical application, converge.\u201d <em>Acosta, </em>slip op. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Because of this consistent position of the Board, it has been difficult for this court to evaluate the catchall phrase the Board often inserts in its asylum decisions and has inserted in this one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">We also find that [Rebollo-Jovel] has failed adequately to substantiate his asylum claim regardless of whether such claim is assessed in terms of demonstrating a \u201cclear probability,\u201d a \u201crealistic likelihood,\u201d a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d or a \u201cgood reason to fear\u201d persecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acb-dedup-0\">Normally such a recitation would be sufficient to assure us that the Board has assessed the claim in question by several different standards of greater and less severity, and has found the claim wanting under all. No such assurance is possible, however, in light of the consistent position of the Board that, in practical application, standards as different as \u201cclear probability\u201d and \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d are equivalent. If \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d does not mean to the Board what it means to this court, we cannot rest on the Board\u2019s use of the term, or what the Board considers its equivalents. The crucial point for purposes of review is that the Board apply the correct standard, not that it utter the correct words.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">This problem is not a new one for us. In reviewing Board decisions containing such disclaimers, we have adopted a case-by-case approach, pointing out that \u201c[t]he utterance of certain magic words by the BIA is not the focus of our inquiry. Rather our concern is with the analysis actually applied by the BIA.\u201d <em>Vides-Vides v. INS, </em>783 F.2d 1463, 1468 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">The majority opinion here purports to accept the proposition that \u201c[njothing in our case law suggests that the use of certain words should lead either to automatic affirmance, or to automatic reversal.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>p. 444. It then largely undermines that position by giving effect to the Board\u2019s catchall disclaimer, and suggesting that \u201c[w]e ought not to impute uncommon meanings to the Board\u2019s words, unless the Board has given us a clear indication that it is using words in either a technical or somehow incorrect sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">In my view, the Board <em>has </em>given us, many times over many years, a clear indication that it uses \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d to mean something other than the standard of asylum established for this circuit by <em>Bola-nos-Hemandez </em>and <em>Cardoza-Fonseca. </em>The majority gives presumptive effect to the Board\u2019s disclaimer. Because the Board has consistently merged the standards of \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution and \u201cclear probability\u201d of threat to life or freedom, I would give no presumptive effect, one way or the other, to the Board\u2019s catchall language.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">The presumption aside, I look to the record to determine the \u201canalysis actually applied by the BIA.\u201d <em>Vides-Vides, </em>783 F.2d at 1468. I can find nothing there to indicate that the Board has evaluated Re-bollo-Jovel\u2019s claim by a standard more generous than that required for withholding of deportation. The claim is at least a color-able one on its facts. Accordingly, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>reverse the Board\u2019s decision and would remand the case to the Board for reconsideration of Rebollo-Jovel\u2019s asylum claim explicitly by the standards adopted for this circuit in <em>Bolanos-Hemandez </em>and <em>Cardo-za-Fonseca.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
