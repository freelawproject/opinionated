LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">This appeal arises from the second order of the district court denying appellant\u2019s application for attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Award Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, after settlement on the merits of her claim of employment discrimination on the basis of race. For the reasons set forth below we will reverse and remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Betty J. Ashley was employed by Atlantic Richfield Company (\u201cArco\u201d) from August 2, 1976 to March 2, 1983, at which time she was discharged from her position as the Senior Secretary for Arco. Following her discharge, appellant initiated an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 alleging that her termination was racially motivated. After a series of negotiations, the parties agreed to settle their dispute. Accordingly, the district court entered an order on September 24, 1984 that dismissed the action with prejudice, pursuant to agreement of counsel without costs except as provided by Local Rule 42(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">Subsequently, counsel for Arco prepared a proposed general release and settlement agreement and submitted it to Ashley\u2019s attorney, Steven M. Kramer. Kramer refused to endorse the document, specifically objecting to language releasing Arco from liability for attorney\u2019s fees. Eventually, on October 24, 1984, a revised document was signed by the parties. The agreement provided that Arco make payment to Ashley in the sum of $7,500.00. In addition, Ashley received non-monetary relief consisting of Arco\u2019s agreement to seal Ashley\u2019s employment record for ten years and to inform prospective employers that she was \u201cqualified\u201d for the work she had performed. The revised settlement and release agreement was silent on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">Approximately one month after the settlement and release had been signed appellant\u2019s attorney filed an application for counsel fees and costs. The fee application was vehemently opposed by appellee principally on the ground that Arco considered their agreement to pay Ashley $7,500 a \u201cnuisance settlement.\u201d As such, Arco argued that it was unwilling to pay any more and would rather proceed to trial than bear the costs of appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Thereafter, the district court entered an order and opinion denying appellant\u2019s application on the ground that plaintiff was not the prevailing party because she had obtained only 23% of her potential back pay recovery and she had not \u2018essentially succeeded' on her claims for non-monetary re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>lief. App. at A-215. Ashley responded with a timely motion for reconsideration in which she informed the court that, having discharged her statutory duty to mitigate damages by obtaining alternative employment, she had actually recovered over 50% of the potential back pay award. Ashley further contested the district court\u2019s finding that the non-monetary relief received was insubstantial and did not entitle her to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. In a brief memorandum opinion the district court again rejected Ashley\u2019s claims, restating its prior position with regard to Ashley\u2019s non-monetary claims, and holding that notwithstanding Ashley\u2019s asserted 50% back pay recovery, \u201cshe is still not the prevailing party\u201d because Arco \u201cconsidered the $7,500 a nuisance settlement since it would have at least cost that amount to defend the case.\u201d App. at A-228. Accordingly, the district court affirmed its prior judgment and entered a second order denying appellant\u2019s requested fees and costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">We consider three issues. First, whether the settlement between the parties was a \u201cnuisance settlement\u201d so that appellant did not prevail. Second, whether, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that appellant did prevail, she has waived her right to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. And, finally, whether the agreement signed by the plaintiff releasing defendant of all costs encompasses attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\n<em>Nuisance Settlement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A2B\">Pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Awards Act of 1976 (\u201csection 1988\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a plaintiff who prevails in a civil rights action is \u201cordinarily [entitled to] recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>See Neuman v. Piggie Park Enters, </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966,19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968) (per curiam), <em>quoted in </em>S.Rep. No. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5908, 5912. \u201cThe standard used in this circuit for determining a plaintiff\u2019s prevailing party status is whether plaintiff achieved \u2018some of the benefit sought\u2019 by the party bringing the suit.\u201d <em>NAACP v. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 1161, 1167 (3d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1052, 103 S.Ct. 1499, 75 L.Ed.2d 930 (1983); <em>see also Institutionalized Juveniles v. Secretary of Public Welfare, </em>758 F.2d 897, 910-12 (3d Cir.1985) (reaffirming the <em>Wilmington Medical Center </em>standard in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)). Moreover, in order to be deemed as having prevailed, plaintiffs need not obtain relief \u201cidentical to the relief they specifically demanded, as long as the relief obtained is of the same general type.\u201d <em>Institutionalized Juveniles, 758 </em>F.2d at 912. Plaintiff need only demonstrate that she obtained some of the benefit sought and that the relief obtained was causally connected to the prosecution of the complaint. <em>See Wilmington Medical Center, </em>689 F.2d at 1171. That a plaintiff\u2019s claim terminates in an out-of-court settlement or consent decree does not preclude prevailing party status. <em>See Institutionalized Juveniles, 758 </em>F.2d at 911-12 (citing <em>Doe v. Busbee, </em>684 F.2d 1375 (11th Cir.1982)). Thus, in applying the test we first \u201ccompare the relief sought with that actually obtained, ... [and] the fact that relief was obtained by way of settlement is only a factor to be taken into account in deciding the second step required by the case law in this circuit; the causal connection between the relief obtained and the lawsuit.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Disabled In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>Action of Pennsylvania v. Pierce, </em>789 F.2d 1016, 1019-20 (3d Cir.1986). Finally, the fact that plaintiff prevailed through settlement does not extinguish or attenuate her claim for attorney\u2019s fees. As noted in the Supreme Court\u2019s seminal opinion, <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 131, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2575, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980), \u201c[n]othing in the language of \u00a7 1988 conditions the District Court\u2019s power to award fees on full litigation of the issues or on a judicial determination that the plaintiff\u2019s rights have been violated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">A. Monetary Relief</p>\n<p id=\"AO_\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Ashley sought relief in the form of a judgment in her favor, compensatory and punitive damages, counsel fees and costs, and such other relief as the court deemed just.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>App. at A-216. Guided by the principles enunciated above, we turn to consider the monetary relief obtained by Mrs. Ashley to determine whether such relief \u2014 albeit obtained via settlement \u2014 supports a determination of prevailing party status. Absent special circumstances, such a determination would entitle Ashley to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">Ashley received a total of $7,500 from Arco in settlement of her claim. The district court, however, refused to award attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of Ashley\u2019s monetary recovery. Indeed, the court declined to make a finding under \u00a7 1988 whether Ashley was the prevailing party on any of her claims for monetary relief,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> noting instead that defendant Arco considered the resolution of Ashley\u2019s claims as a nuisance settlement. The assertion of a purported nuisance settlement, however, does not circumvent application of the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">In analyzing Arco\u2019s \u201cnuisance settlement\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> argument, it is helpful to turn to some of the few reported cases in which the concept has been discussed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Parker v. Matthews, </em>411 F.Supp. 1059, 1064 (D.D.C.1976), <em>aff'd sub nom. Parker v. Califano, </em>561 F.2d 320 (D.C.Cir.1977),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>district court considered whether a party who settled her employment discrimination claim could be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. Noting that to hold otherwise would promote full-scale litigation in civil rights cases, the district court issued the caveat that although fee awards should be generally available to plaintiffs who prevail through settlement \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees should not be awarded in nuisance settlements.\u201d The court continued, however: \u201cTherefore, to avoid an abuse of the attorneys\u2019 fees provision, there must be some additional measure employed by the courts to determine whether the plaintiff is in fact the \u2018successful party.\u2019 \u201d The \u201cadditional measure\u201d employed by the <em>Parker </em>court consisted of a formula \u201cfocusing particularly on the necessity for bringing the action and whether the party is the successful party with respect to the central issue \u2014 discrimination.\u201d 411 F.Supp. at 1064. Thus, in addressing the ultimate inquiry \u2014 \u201cwhether the plaintiff [w]as in fact the \u2018successful party\u2019,\u201d \u2014 the <em>Parker </em>court centered its examination on an assessment of the benefit conferred upon the plaintiff, as opposed to the burden borne by the defendant. <em>Cf. Institutionalized Juveniles, </em>758 F.2d at 912 (focus of the prevailing party analysis is on \u201cthe relief actually obtained\u201d); <em>Bagby v. Beal, </em>606 F.2d 411, 415 (3d Cir.1979) (focus is on \u201crelief ultimately received by the plaintiff\u201d). Similarly, in <em>Forrest v. New York City Criminal Justice Agency, </em>549 F.Supp. 211 (1982), in considering whether the settlement entered into by the parties was a \u201cnuisance settlement\u201d precluding a finding that plaintiff had prevailed, the district court implicitly refused to forgo the conventional inquiry under \u00a7 1988 \u2014 whether the benefit obtained justifies the conclusion that plaintiff had prevailed. Finding that due to plaintiff\u2019s apparent mitigation of damages, the negotiated settlement amounted to approximately one-half of the relief requested, the district court held that the plaintiff had in fact prevailed and, accordingly, granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\"><em>Chicano Police Officer\u2019s Association v. Stover, </em>624 F.2d 127 (1980), addressed arguments in opposition to a fee award similar to those adopted by the district court and urged upon this court in the instant appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Stover, </em>the defendants argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe sum paid was about what a legal defense would have cost it and was paid only to end a lengthy and disruptive lawsuit, not as compensation on the merits,\u201d 624 F.2d at 130, and therefore, the plaintiff could not be deemed to have prevailed. The Tenth Circuit rejoined, and we concur, that such a view of what constitutes a prevailing party is too narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">To fully appreciate the intended scope of the prevailing party analysis, the policy objectives that inspired the enactment of \u00a7 1988 must be considered. \u201cIn enacting \u00a7 1988, Congress rejected the traditional assumption that private choices whether to litigate, compromise, or forgo a potential claim will yield a socially desirable level of enforcement as far as the enumerated civil rights statutes are concerned.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 444, 103 S.Ct. at 1945. (Brennan, J. concurring in part, dissenting in part). Rather, Congress recognized that \u201c[i]n many cases arising under our civil rights laws, the citizen who must sue to enforce the law has little or no money with which to hire a lawyer,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[i]f our civil rights laws are not to become mere hollow pronouncements which the average citizen cannot enforce, we must maintain the traditionally effective remedy of fee shifting in these cases.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 2, 6, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5908, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>5910, 5913. Thus, in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), the Supreme Court observed that the prevailing party standard is a \u201cgenerous formulation\u201d that entitles even those civil rights plaintiffs who obtain only partial relief to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433, 436-37, 103 S.Ct. at 1939, 1941; <em>cf. Institutionalized Juveniles, </em>758 F.2d at 911 n. 25 (\u201c[A] party can be eligible for attorneys\u2019 fees, albeit at a reduced amount, even though that party ... had obtained only \u2018minor relief\u2019 \u201d); 2 A. Larson, Employment Discrimination \u00a7 58.15(c) (1985) (\u201cThe fact that plaintiff prevails on some issues but not others may affect the amount of the award but does not mean that plaintiff is not \u2018prevailing.\u2019 \u201d); <em>accord Inmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Pierce, </em>716 F.2d 177 (3d Cir.1983), <em>modifying Hughes v. Repko, </em>578 F.2d 483 (3d Cir.1978). Indeed, <em>Hensley </em>teaches that even \u201cminor\u201d relief may justify an appropriately reduced award. 461 U.S. at 439 n. 14, 103 S.Ct. at 1942 n. 14. The important factor in establishing entitlement to a fee award is that plaintiffs\u2019 rights are vindicated, and \u201cif a settlement provides some benefit to plaintiffs or some vindication of their rights, then the congressional intent to encourage private enforcement of civil rights ... will be furthered by the awarding of fees.\u201d <em>Stover, </em>624 F.2d at 131. In sum, when a plaintiff obtains \u201csome of the benefit sought\u201d through a settlement, she is a prevailing party and will be entitled to a fee award unless the court finds it to be an exceptional case. Once it is determined that a plaintiff has in fact prevailed, the <em>Hensley </em>analysis which provides that the fee award bear some relation to the relief obtained, 461 U.S. at 440, 103 S.Ct. at 1943, will normally do justice to a defendant who is settling primarily to avoid litigation expense. Therefore, we hold that, consistent with the case law in this circuit and the policy objectives of \u00a7 1988, the threshold determination of prevailing party status that serves to entitle a plaintiff to a reasonable award of attorney\u2019s fees may not be jettisoned by the assertion of a nuisance settlement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 1988 <em>requires </em>a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>liminary determination whether plaintiff prevailed. <em>Cf. White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Sec., </em>455 U.S. 445, 451-52, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 1166, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1981) (\u201c[T]he court\u2019s decision of entitlement to fees will ... require an inquiry-separate from the decision on the merits\u2014 an inquiry that cannot even commence until one party has \u2018prevailed.\u2019\u201d). Failure to make that determination saps the statute of its content and thwarts its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In the instant appeal, the district court failed to assess the benefit conferred upon Mrs. Ashley to ascertain whether she had prevailed. If, however, as Ashley contends, she duly mitigated her damages by securing alternative employment and thereby obtained a settlement in excess of 50% of her potential recovery, she would qualify as a prevailing party. Although not the sole basis upon which a finding of prevailing party status may lie, Ashley\u2019s contention, if true, would entitle her to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under the standard applied in this circuit. Thus, to the extent that the district court considered the assertion of a nuisance settlement as dispositive of the issue whether plaintiff prevailed in the underlying settlement, it applied the wrong legal standard and cir-eumvented compliance with the congressional directive of \u00a7 1988. We therefore remand for a determination consistent with the standard set forth above whether plaintiff prevailed on her claim for back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">B. Non-monetary Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Appellant\u2019s requests for non-monetary relief consisted of (1) the removal of certain documents from her employee file, (2) a statement that she was \u201ccompetent\u201d for the work she performed, and (3) an assurance from Arco that it would not issue negative reports on her work performance. The relief ultimately obtained by Ashley was an agreement from Arco to seal her employee file for a period of ten years and to issue a statement to prospective employers that Ashley was \u201cqualified\u201d to do the work she performed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Arco further agreed that if for reasons specified in the agreement, the review of Ashley\u2019s file became necessary, notification would be issued to her by Arco\u2019s legal division. The district court denied appellant\u2019s fee petition holding that she had not vindicated any of her rights because the \u201cdefendant merely followed its usual procedures with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to all of plaintiffs non-monetary requests.\u201d App. at A-228. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Arco maintains (1) that \u201ccompany policy prohibits removal of documents from a file,\u201d (2) that \u201ca discharged employee\u2019s personnel file is as a matter of course sent to storage and never again referred to absent special circumstances,\u201d and (3) that \u201cresponses to inquiries about former employees are limited to the person\u2019s beginning and ending dates of employment, and their final position.\u201d Brief on Behalf of Defendant-Appellee at 24-25. Although there is no record evidence to either substantiate or invalidate Arco\u2019s characterization of its company policy, even if true, it does not sustain the conclusion that Ashley did not prevail. As this court recently noted, plaintiffs need not obtain relief \u201cidentical to the relief they specifically demanded, as long as the relief obtained is of the same general type.\u201d <em>Institutionalized Juveniles, </em>758 F.2d at 912. In addition, if a plaintiff is also successful in \u201cmov[ing] the defendant to do more than it was already committed to do,\u201d she will be deemed to have prevailed. <em>Disabled In Action, </em>789 F.2d 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We find that the sealing of Ashley\u2019s employee file for a period of ten years essentially grants her the type of relief sought in her request for the removal of certain documents from her file. By precluding review of her file altogether, with limited exceptions, Arco provides Ashley with the assurance that the existence of the documents she wished removed will be virtually innocuous. In addition, nothing in the record suggests, and Arco has not averred, that former employees are routinely notified if their files are subject to review. Ashley has secured the right to such notification and, implicitly, a right to contest any proposed review. <em>See supra </em>note 10. Similarly, we do not find the distinction between a statement that Ashley was \u201cqualified\u201d as opposed to \u201ccompetent\u201d to perform the work for which she was hired of such magnitude as to preclude prevailing party status. Although the terms are not synonymous or completely \u201cidentical to the relief [Ashley] specifically demanded,\u201d they are sufficiently similar so as to constitute \u201crelief ... of the same general type.\u201d <em>See Institutionalized Juveniles, </em>758 F.2d at 912. Finally, Ashley received some assurance that in situations where conventional Arco policy may not apply, Arco would be nevertheless precluded from issuing negative statements. The language of the settlement agreement makes clear that if prospective employers submit their own questionnaires to Arco with respect to Ashley\u2019s employment, thereby permitting deviation from standard Arco policy, \u201cunder no circumstances can the information provided be less favorable than\u201d the statement that Ashley was qualified to perform her duties. App. at A-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">As appellees concede, taking its policy characterizations as true, \u201c[e]ach [element of Ashley\u2019s non-monetary relief] was a <em>minor deviation </em>from [Arco] company policy.\u201d Brief on Behalf of Defendant-Appel-lee at 24 (emphasis added). Ashley obtained some of the benefit sought and moved Arco to do something more than it was committed to do. Hence, Ashley prevailed on her claims for non-monetary relief and is entitled to a fee award. Therefore, we will remand to the district court for computation of a reasonable fee award on Ashley\u2019s non-monetary claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\n<em>Fee Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Arco argues that even if we accept appellant\u2019s position that she prevailed on any or all of her underlying claims, she is nevertheless not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees because whatever rights she had were waived when she signed the settlement agreement. Ashley, however, points to the chronology of events surrounding the drafting of the settlement agreement and contends that no waiver of fees occurred. In addition, Ashley argues that this court\u2019s decision in <em>El Club Del Barrio v. United Community Corp., </em>735 F.2d 98 (3d Cir.1984), is controlling and resolves the waiver issue in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">As discussed <em>supra, </em>the initial settlement agreement prepared by Arco and submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>to Kramer, Ashley\u2019s counsel, contained language which unambiguously waived Ashley\u2019s statutory right to attorney\u2019s fees. Kramer objected to the language and refused to sign. Subsequently, a revised agreement deleting all references to attorney\u2019s fees was prepared by counsel for Arco. Prior to the execution of the revised agreement, counsel for Arco maintains that in response to the question whether Ashley was seeking attorney\u2019s fees, Kramer responded, \u201cI am not taking a position.\u201d The agreement was signed nonetheless by Ashley and both counsel without modification. This court recently held, on similar facts, that where a settlement agreement is silent on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cthe best rule of law would be one that places the burden [of proving waiver] on the party losing the underlying litigation. If the parties cannot agree on counsel fees and the losing party wishes to foreclose a suit under section 1988 for attorneys fees, it must insist that a stipulation to that effect be placed in the settlement agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>El Club Del Barrio, </em>735 F.2d at 101. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the principle enunciated in <em>El Club Del Barrio </em>obtains in the instant appeal, and consequently, appellant has not waived her rights to an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In <em>El Club Del Barrio </em>a plaintiff who had prevailed in the underlying settlement instituted an application for an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988. During the course of negotiations plaintiff had drafted an agreement expressly reserving plaintiff\u2019s right to seek attorney\u2019s fees notwithstanding settlement on the merits. Defendants objected to the reservation and ultimately, a revised agreement, silent on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, was endorsed by both parties. Defendants opposed the subsequent fee application arguing that the silence of the settlement agreement on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees together with plaintiff\u2019s conduct during the negotiations evinced a waiver of plaintiff\u2019s right to a fee award. Both parties in <em>El Club Del Barrio </em>\u2014 as in the case <em>sub judice</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 invoked this court\u2019s ruling in <em>Prandini v. National Tea Co., </em>557 F.2d 1015 (3d Cir.1977), which disapproved the simultaneous negotiation of settlements on the merits and attorney\u2019s fees, as a partial explanation for their conduct. After oral argument in the instant appeal, however, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Evans v. Jeff D.,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1531 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>(1986), in which the Court was unanimous in concluding \u201cthat the Fees Act [\u00a7 1988] should not be interpreted to prohibit all simultaneous negotiations of a defendant\u2019s liability on the merits and his liability for his opponent\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 106 S.Ct. at 1543 n. 30. To the extent that <em>Prandini </em>constitutes an absolute ban on simultaneous fee negotiation, then, it has been overruled. That <em>Prandini </em>has been overruled, however, does not vitiate the vitality of <em>El Club Del Barrio. </em>The rule enunciated in <em>El Club Del Barrio </em>was announced <em>in spite of Prandini, </em>not on the basis of it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, consistent with the spirit of <em>Evans, </em>the requirement that negotiated fee waivers be expressly contained in the settlement agreement will result in informed settlements<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u2014 prejudicing neither plaintiff nor defendant \u2014 and effectively extinguish most post-settlement petitions for fee awards. Thus, <em>El Club Del Barrio </em>.is neither inconsistent nor ..incompatible with the reasoning of <em>Evans. </em>While <em>Evans </em>decides the propriety of fee waivers, <em>El Club Del Barrio </em>merely determines the form they must take.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Of course, where plaintiffs fail to prevail under the standard applied in this circuit, no entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees attaches. Where the plaintiff does so pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>vail, however, in the absence of an express waiver, she will be deemed to have retained her statutory right to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Therefore, where a defendant seeks to settle its total liability on a claim, it shall be incumbent upon the defendant to secure an express waiver of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Silence will not suffice.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Although Arco offers decisions from two other circuits as support for the silence equals waiver rule, <em>see Brown v. General Motors Corp., Chevrolet Div., </em>722 F.2d 1009, 1012 (2d Cir.1983) (stipulation that action be dismissed \u2018without costs to any party\u2019 is intended to settle all claims, including a claim for attorney\u2019s fees); <em>Jennings v. Metropolitan Gov\u2019t of Nashville, </em>715 F.2d 1111, 1114 (6th Cir.1983) (silence of the agreement notwithstanding, the record supported \u201cthe single inference that the parties agreed to settle their dispute in full [including the issue of attorney\u2019s fees]\u201d),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we think the congressional policy of \u00a7 1988 will be enhanced by adherence to the contrary position. As we observed in <em>El Club Del Barrio, </em>the \u201c \u2018silence equals waiver\u2019 rule ... pays inadequate attention to the presumption established in <em>Hensley </em>and <em>Piggie Park </em>in favor of [fee awards to] prevailing civil rights plaintiffs.\u201d 735 F.2d at 100. Our approach avoids that result and thus furthers the nationally legislated, preferred policy of Congress.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> While statutory rights may be voluntarily bargained away by the party so entitled, they may not be assumed away by the party opposing/ their enforcement. With or without the<em>Prandini </em>prohibition, it is not unreasonable to expect defendants to presume that where a civil rights plaintiff satisfies the statutory requirements of \u00a7 1988, she is at liberty to invoke the provisions of the statute so as to entitle her to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Indeed, the presumption inheres in the existence of the statute itself. Nor do we find Ashley\u2019s counsel\u2019s refusal to take a position on the fee issue sufficiently \u201cmisleading\u201d to overcome that presumption.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>In the instant appeal, Arco is virtually indistinguishable from defendants against whom fee liability was imposed in <em>El Club Del Barrio. </em>Having failed to secure an express waiver of plaintiff\u2019s statutory entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 albeit due to a side-effect of <em>Prandini </em>\u2014 Arco may not, in effect, abrogate congressional intent and extinguish Ashley\u2019s claim (to the extent that she has prevailed) to a fee award either because the parties did not discuss attorney\u2019s fees or failed to reach an agreement on them. Section 1988 does not require that prevailing plaintiffs affirmatively reserve their rights under the statute as a condition precedent to its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Finally, we briefly consider whether the settlement agreement releasing defendant from all costs encompasses a release of attorney\u2019s fees. At oral argument Arco argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Marek v. Chesny, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 3012, 87 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), moots the prevailing party question because <em>Chesny </em>held that attorney\u2019s fees provided by \u00a7 1988 are included among taxable costs. While acknowledging that <em>Chesny </em>involved an interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, Arco nevertheless suggests that <em>Chesny </em>primarily considers the proper construction of the costs provision of \u00a7 1988. From this Arco reasons that the settlement agreement released it from liability for <em>all </em>\u00a7 1988 costs which include attorney\u2019s fees. Arco misreads the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\"><em>Chesny </em>involved the interplay between Rule 68<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and \u00a7 1988. Rule 68 is a cost-shifting mechanism which provides that a prevailing plaintiff must pay the defendant\u2019s \u201ccosts\u201d if she rejects a settlement offer which exceeds the amount recovered after trial. Under \u00a7 1988, however, a prevailing plaintiff is ordinarily entitled to a reasonable fee award. <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968) (per cu-riam). Thus, the issue in <em>Chesny </em>involved not the definition of costs under \u00a7 1988, but rather, the scope of the costs provision of Rule 68. In determining \u201cwhether attorney\u2019s fees incurred by a plaintiff subsequent to an offer of settlement under ... [Rule 68] must be paid by the defendant under ... \u00a7 1988, when the plaintiff recovers a judgment less than the offer,\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 3014, the Court held that \u201cwhere the underlying statute defines \u2018costs\u2019 to include attorney\u2019s fees, ... such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of Rule 68.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3017. Because \u00a7 1988 provides that attorney\u2019s fees may be recovered \u201cas part of the costs,\u201d <em>see supra </em>note 1, a prevailing plaintiff who recovers less than a defendant\u2019s Rule 68 offer must bear her own post-offer costs, including attorney\u2019s fees. The intended effect of <em>Chesny </em>is to deny to prevailing plaintiffs fee awards for post-offer services that do not produce any additional monetary benefit for the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 3018.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Arco\u2019s argument seeking to extend <em>Ches-ny </em>to the instant appeal fails for several reasons. First, Rule 68 requires a formal submission to the court of the offer and acceptance after which <em>judgment </em>will be entered against the defendant. Here there was no formal submission, and more important, judgment was not entered against Arco. Second, a Rule 68 offer <em>must </em>include an offer to pay all costs accrued at the time of the offer. In <em>Chesny </em>the court noted that \u201cit is immaterial whether the offer recites that costs are included, whether it specifies the amount the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>allowing for costs, or for that matter, whether it refers to costs at all. As long as the offer does not implicitly or explicitly provide that the judgment <em>not </em>include costs, a timely offer will be valid.\u201d <em>Ches-ny, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3016. The settlement agreement in the instant appeal expressly released defendant from all costs.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Finally, and more fundamentally, Rule 68 by its own terms applies to release defendants from costs where an offer is <em>rejected. </em>Ashley and Arco entered into a negotiated settlement that was <em>accepted </em>by both parties. <em>Chesny </em>neither mandates nor encourages the exclusion of attorney\u2019s fee liability in all civil rights settlement agreements. To read <em>Chesny </em>any other way would indeed undercut the Court\u2019s approval of simultaneous fee negotiation in <em>Evans.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In sum, <em>Chesny </em>is simply inapplicable to this appeal. The Supreme Court did not purport to establish a uniform definition of costs that is coterminous with attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Chesny </em>governs actions in which Rule 68 is invoked. There is no formal Rule 68 offer in the instant proceeding. Nor are the policy objectives undergirding Rule 68 remotely implicated by this appeal.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We do not consider here the construction of a costs provision of a statute or a rule. Rather, we seek to determine the content of costs as employed in a negotiated settlement agreement. We conclude that it is clear on this record that the parties did not consider \u201ccosts\u201d to be inclusive of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The original draft agreement included language referring to attorney\u2019s fees. Upon objection from Ashley\u2019s counsel, the parties agreed to delete that language while that referring to costs was retained. Thus, the agreement signed by the parties did not include a release of defendant\u2019s potential liability for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The agreement does provide, however, for a general release of Arco\u2019s liability for Ashley\u2019s traditional costs. The district court dismissed the action without costs to either party except as provided by Local Rule 42(d)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and subsequently refused to grant an award of costs to Ashley. Appellants have advanced no argument why that decision should be disturbed. Accordingly, we will affirm the district court\u2019s denial of costs to Ashley.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">We hold that the district court failed to make the requisite finding under \u00a7 1988 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>whether appellant prevailed on her monetary claims for relief. We therefore will remand for a determination whether appellant prevailed on her claim for back pay. We will reverse the district court\u2019s finding that appellant did not prevail on her non-monetary claims for relief and, accordingly, remand for a computation of a reasonable fee award on those claims.

Arco argues that \"as to the economic recovery, this was no more than a nuisance settlement entered into by the defendant to rid itself of a case of minimal exposure.\" Brief on Behalf of Defendant-Appellee at 24. As noted <em>supra, </em>the district court, in accordance with defendant\u2019s theory, held that Ashley was \u201cnot the prevailing party because as Arco argued, it considered the $7,500 a nuisance settlement since it would have at least cost that amount to defend the case.\u201d App. at A-228.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b214-4\">. In <em>Gillespie v. Brewer, </em>602 F.Supp. 218, 222 (N.D.W.Va.1985), the district court held that \u2018\u2018[t]he determination of whether a plaintiff is the prevailing party cannot be made by attempting to affix such an ambiguous label as \u2018nuisance settlement\u2019 to the final compromise reached by the litigants.\u201d In our view, nuisance settlement is not a concept that is helpful in fee award analysis. Consequently, we decline to fashion a rule specifically directed to \"nuisance settlements.\u201d We note that \u00a7 1988 neither condones nor promotes extorted settlements from which large sums in attorney's fees may be recovered from frivolous claims. The better analytic approach to such claims as Arco\u2019s, however, is to consider such factors under the judicially created exception to the presumption of fee awards to prevailing plaintiffs. To hold otherwise would permit the wholesale preemption of fee awards to plaintiffs who have in fact prevailed on their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Physical, psychological and monetary benefits inure to both sides of a settlement agreement. Indeed, the avoidance of litigation expense and delay is precisely what settlement contemplates. To embroil the district court at the initial stage of the entitlement inquiry in mechanical assessments of the relative benefits to each settlement participant would undermine \u00a7 1988 and unnecessarily complicate the prevailing party analysis. <em>See, e.g., Gillespie, </em>602 F.Supp. at 222. We recognize, however, that there may be settlements in which the plaintiffs claim clearly appears to be legally or factually non-meritorious and, accordingly, in which it appears that the \"some benefit obtained\u201d has been conferred by the defendant <em>solely </em>as a means of saving litigation expense. Courts may appropriately declare these cases as ones involving \"special circumstances\u201d and deny an award. But even in these cases, the focus should be on the lack of merit in the plaintiffs case, not on the defendant\u2019s motivation. Furthermore, under these circumstances the court should explain why the <em>Hensley </em>analysis will produce an unjust result. Thus, while a \u201cnuisance settlement\" theory may be asserted as a potential \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d rendering a fee award unjust, <em>see Piggie Park, </em>309 U.S. at 402, 88 S.Ct. at 966, it may not routinely operate to defeat plaintiffs prevailing party status.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Consequently, we hold in the instant appeal that Arco\u2019s nuisance settlement contention cannot obviate the requisite inquiry under \u00a7 1988 whether the fee petitioner prevailed in her underlying action. Moreover, our review of this record leaves us unconvinced that Arco\u2019s purported nuisance settlement justifies deviation from the general rule awarding fees to the prevailing party. By its own concession, Arco was informed by the district court that \"the case was worth something, and some level of risk warranted settlement,\u201d <em>see </em>Brief on Behalf of De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>fendant-Appellees at 11, thereby attenuating its claim that it was merely concerned with basic litigation expenses. Thus, the allegation that Arco sacrificed the minimum amount that it would have cost to defend the action in order to save itself from potentially high litigation expenses without more does not constitute a special circumstance that would render a fee award to Ashley, if she has prevailed, unjust. <em>Cf. Robinson v. Kimbrough, </em>652 F.2d 458, 467 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cThe fact that a defendant has its own attorneys\u2019 fees to pay is not such a \u2018special circumstance\u2019 sufficient to render an award unjust.\u201d). Indeed, as we noted above, the focus of the special circumstances inquiry is on the merit of the plaintiffs claim. The defendant\u2019s motivations and strategy choices are not dispositive. The \"special circumstances\u201d exception is an extremely limited one that is applied only in unusual circumstances and then only upon a strong showing by the party asserting it. <em>See Knights of the Ku Klux Klan </em>v. <em>East Baton Rouge Parish School Board, </em>643 F.2d 1034, 1041 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">.

Both Ashley and Arco raise the now familiar criticism of <em>Prandini: </em>that its bar on simultaneous negotiation results in the reluctance of both parties to settle. Ashley\u2019s objection to the effects of <em>Prandini </em>is essentially twofold: First, Ashley argues that in the settlement context, <em>Prandini </em>coupled with deference to the \"nuisance settlement\u201d concept in lieu of a determination of prevailing party status, <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>at n. 6, unfairly prejudices plaintiffs who on the one hand are prohibited from negotiating a fee and who on the other hand are faced with the likelihood of receiving little or no compensation even where they succeed in securing substantial relief. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 7. Second, Ashley implicitly argues that where plaintiffs sign a settlement agreement which is silent on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, equating silence as waiver unduly penalizes plaintiff for adhering to <em>Prandini\u2019s </em>prohibition. <em>See </em>Reply Brief of Appellant at 3 (citing <em>El Club Del Barrio </em>). Arco seemingly rejects <em>Prandini\u2019s </em>applicability on the grounds that the settlement was a nuisance settlement and that there were other options, short of discussion and negotiation, available to the plaintiff. <em>See </em>Brief on Behalf of Defendant-Appellee at 28-30. Arco also, however, appears to suggest reliance on <em>Prandini </em>in its contention that it believed it inappropriate to inquire into Ashley\u2019s fee arrangement during the course of settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b217-10\">. <em>Evans </em>involved a class action filed on behalf of Idaho children suffering from emotional and mental handicaps against the Governor of Idaho and other public officials responsible for their education and treatment. A prompt settlement was reached between the parties with regard to plaintiffs\u2019 claims relating to educational services. Settlement on the treatment claims, however, was not achieved until one week before trial was scheduled to begin, and after discovery had been completed. The settlement agreement prepared by the defendants granted substantial structural relief on the merits but was conditioned upon plaintiffs\u2019 waiver of any claim to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>fees and costs. Counsel for the plaintiffs\u2019, Charles Johnson, was employed by the Idaho Legal Aid Society, Inc., and had been instructed to reject any settlement offer conditioned upon a waiver of fees. Compelled by his ethical obligation to his clients, however, Johnson nevertheless signed the settlement agreement. The agreement provided in pertinent part: \u2018Plaintiffs and defendants shall each bear their own costs and attorney\u2019s fees thus far incurred, if so approved by the Court.\u2019 <em>Evans, </em>106 S.Ct. at 2535 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">After signing the agreement, Johnson urged the district court to approve only the settlement of plaintiffs\u2019 substantive claims, to reject the fee waiver, and to permit plaintiffs to petition for costs and fees. Johnson argued that defendants\u2019 offer \"had exploited his ethical duty to his clients \u2014 that he was \u2018forced,\u2019 by an offer giving his clients \u2018the best result [they] could have gotten____,\u2019 to waive his attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1535.

Focusing on the nature of the suit, i.e., a class action, and the policy underlying fee awards to private attorneys general, the circuit panel concluded: \"The historical background of both Rule 23 and section 1988, as well as our experience since their enactment, compel the conclusion that a stipulated waiver of all attorney\u2019s fees obtained solely as a condition for obtaining relief for the class should not be accepted by the [district] court.\u201d <em>Jeff D. v.

The majority rejected outright the contention that settlements conditioned on fee waivers presented counsel with 'ethical dilemmafs].\u2019 Far from being caught between an ethical Scylla and Charybdis, the Court observed that attorneys have \u201cno <em>ethical </em>obligation to seek a statutory fee award.\u201d Rather, counsel\u2019s sole ethical obligation \"was to serve his clients loyally and competently.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1537-38 (emphasis in original). In dissent, Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun concluded that \u2018\u2018[b]ecause making it more difficult for civil rights plaintiffs to obtain legal assistance is precisely the opposite of what Congress sought to achieve by enacting the Fees Act, fee waivers should be prohibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1554.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b218-13\">. <em>See El Club Del Barrio, </em>735 F.2d at 101 n. 3 (\"Prandini's side effect of deterring settlements is not altered by the consequences courts attach in suits under section 1988 to the earlier failure to have explicitly resolved attorneys fees issues. The rule we announce today ... determines only who will bear the costs of <em>Prandini, </em>i.e. will the plaintiff be deemed to have waived his statutory right to reasonable attorneys fees because <em>Prandini </em>barred him from negotiating about them, or will defendants be unable to secure a waiver or settlement of attorneys fees because <em>Prandini </em>barred the plaintiff from discussing them and because the court will not recognize a waiver under such circumstances?\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b218-14\">. Unlike counsel for Arco, we do not think that \"adversaries ... tire expected, ... encouraged and perhaps obligated to use, [albeit] within certain permissible limits, deception, guile, and concealment to obtain the best bargain for [their] clients.\" Brief on Behalf of Defendant-Appellee at 18. With the ban on simultaneous negotiations of substantive settlements and attorney's fees in this circuit now lifted, the express waiver rule will facilitate the finality of negotiated settlements. Thus, the measure of \"good lawyering\" should be rightfully reflected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>within the four corners of the settlement agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. <em>Evans </em>implicitly acknowledged that there may be circumstances under which fee waivers will be inappropriate and it left open the question whether a district court must refuse to approve a fee waiver where \"the defendant had \u2018no realistic defense on the merits,\u2019 ... or if the waiver was part of a \u2018vindictive effort ... to teach counsel that they had better not bring such cases,\" or where the \"situation presents a grossly unfair choice to the plaintiff and his/her counsel, and permitting such offers to be made would seriously undermine the purpose of fee shifting provisions.\u201d 106 S.Ct. at 1544 &amp; n. 32. Our requirement that fee waivers be explicit is not, of course, meant to encourage the type of egregious conduct the court has admonished against in <em>Evans.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. To be sure, silence cuts both ways. We see no reason why <em>defendants\u2019 </em>silence with regard to their potential fee liability should not be construed as consent to plaintiffs right to pursue an award of reasonable,-attorney\u2019s fees if plaintiff ultimately prevails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">. <em>But see, Johnston v. Jago, </em>691 F.2d 283 (6th Cir.1982) (upholding award of attorney\u2019s fees on ground that plaintiff was prevailing party under standard enunciated in <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275 (1st Cir.1978), even though settlement obtained in separate administrative proceeding was silent on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b219-11\">. Moreover, the concerns expressed in <em>Evans </em>regarding judicially imposed material modifications of proposed settlements, <em>see </em>106 S.Ct. at 1537, augur against an interpretation that en-grafts onto an otherwise finalized settlement agreement an <em>implied </em>waiver of statutory rights. <em>Evans </em>considered and rejected plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to nullify the <em>express </em>terms of a settlement agreement. <em>Evans </em>is thus factually distinguishable from the instant appeal in that there plaintiffs counsel specifically agreed to forgo his claim for fees, whereas here no such agreement was obtained. The <em>Evans </em>Court refused to announce a rule of law that would enable plaintiffs to mislead defendants during the course of negotiations and thereafter renege on the express terms of the settlement. <em>See also Moore v. National Ass'n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 1093 (D.C.Cir.1985) (same); <em>Lazar v. Pierce, </em>757 F.2d 435 (1st Cir.1985) (same). Equally objectionable, however, is a rule of law which would sanction similarly deceptive conduct on the part of defendants allowing them to deliberately rest on plaintiffs silence and thereafter ascribe an intent to waive thereto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\">. Furthermore, we continue to adhere to our preference against requiring a district court, as a matter of course, to reexamine settlement negotiations \"to determine who said what to whom when.\u201d <em>El Club Del Barrio, </em>735 F.2d at 100. Even if there were a definable category of circumstances that would justify further inquiry, Arco does not present it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b220-10\">. Rule 68 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-11\">At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against him for the money or property or to the effect specified in his offer, with costs then accrued. [If the offer is rejected and] ... the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\">. Indeed, if Arco\u2019s argument were to prevail liability for the very fees it seeks to avoid would necessarily be a part of the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\">. Indeed, under <em>Chesny </em>Rule 68 \"costs\u201d are subject to varying definitions depending on the underlying statute at issue. <em>See Chesny, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3017; <em>cf. id. </em>at 3024-25 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (criticizing the probable effect on settlement incentives under Rule 68 due to \"minor variations in the phraseology of the underlying fees-award statutes\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">. <em>Cf. Neal v. Berman, </em>576 F.Supp. 1250, 1253 (E.D.Mich.1983) (noting that \u201d[h]ad defendants made a record of a settlement offer that ultimately proved to be higher them the jury verdict, the Court would have concluded that the plaintiff had not \u2018prevailed\u2019 by going to trial, and would have refused to grant plaintiff his attorney\u2019s fees for those hours spent by his attorney in trying the case.\u201d) Although <em>Neal </em>made no reference to Rule 68 it is clear that identical policy concerns underlay the court\u2019s decision. In the instant appeal, however, those policy concerns \u2014 promoting settlements and discouraging prolonged litigation \u2014 are of no moment because the parties settled before trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b221-15\">. While we noted our disapproval of examination of the parties\u2019 conduct to determine whether rights have been waived, we do not feel that the same considerations apply where the definition of express terms within the agreement are at issue. Thus, it is relevant that language referring to attorney\u2019s fees was deleted while that referring to costs was retained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b221-16\">.
