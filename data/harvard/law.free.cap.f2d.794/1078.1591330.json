Laney &amp; Duke Storage Warehouse Co., Inc., </em>369 F.2d 859 (5th Cir.1966); <em>NLRB v. Bowman Transportation, Inc., </em>314 F.2d 497 (5th Cir.1963); <em>Metal Blast, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>324 F.2d 602 (6th Cir.1963) ] as opposed to a personal undertaking.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Esco Elevators, Inc., </em>736 F.2d 295, 300 (5th Cir.1984). Having reexamined the record on remand, the Board concluded that the complaints were a union endeavor and reaffirmed its prior remedial order. We grant enforcement of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-15\">The scope of our review is limited: \u201cwe may deny enforcement of an order of the Board only \u2018if, after full review of the record, we are unable conscientiously to conclude that the evidence supporting the Board\u2019s decision is substantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. Gulf States United Telephone Co., </em>694 F.2d 92, 95 (5th Cir.1982) (citations omitted). \u201cWhen the board\u2019s findings are reasonable and supported by substantial evidence, a court will affirm them, though the court might well have made contrary findings if sitting <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-16\">Here, the Board was presented with the factual question of whether McKinney\u2019s safety complaints were a union activity. Two factors were critical to its decision. First, during his successful campaign for president of Local 21 some months earlier, McKinney had emphasized safety-related issues in his platform. From the testimony of Roy Boring, the Board concluded that Esco supervisors knew of McKinney\u2019s campaign platform and related it to his complaints about the hazard at Lakeland Man- or. Second, in addition to his complaints to his supervisors, McKinney also notified other union officials of the problem. These officials then investigated the problem and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>twice discussed with Esco management the need for correction of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">These factors, coupled with the union\u2019s decision to pursue McKinney\u2019s complaint even after his discharge removed him from the dangerous area, substantially support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the complaints were not merely a personal undertaking, but rather part of McKinney\u2019s union campaign against unsafe conditions at the workplace. Furthermore, nothing in the record detracts from the Board\u2019s finding. We therefore agree that McKinney\u2019s discharge for his complaints violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) and (3) (1982). Contrary to Esco\u2019s suggestion, we see no need to remand for additional testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">ENFORCEMENT GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
