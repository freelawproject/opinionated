Claimant contends that the Secretary\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. We agree that is not, and vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Claimant\u2019s application for benefits alleged disability because of a heart condition and because of depressive neurosis and anxiety. Based on the record \u2014 claimant having waived a hearing \u2014 the ALJ found claimant disabled. Focussing on claimant\u2019s heart condition as an exertional impairment, the ALJ concluded that even if claimant had the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work, application of Rule 201.06 of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2 (\u201cthe grid\u201d) dictated a finding of disabled. The ALJ added that claimant\u2019s mental condition, a nonexertional impairment, probably precluded him from performing even sedentary work. The AU awarded benefits for a period of disability commencing May 30, 1981. The Appeals Council reviewed the AU\u2019s decision on its own motion and modified it, cutting off claimant\u2019s period of disability as of October 31, 1982. The Appeals Council found that claimant was unable to perform his past relevant work as an assistant steel roller in a steel mill. Nonetheless, the Appeals Council determined that, as a result of triple coronary bypass surgery performed in November 1981, by August 1982 claimant had regained the residual functional capacity to perform medium work, and accordingly was not disabled by application of Rule 203.15 of the grid. The Appeals Council further found, implicitly, that claimant\u2019s nonexertional impairment did not significantly affect his ability to perform the full</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">range of jobs requiring medium or lesser work.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">We cannot find that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Appeals Council\u2019s determination that claimant had the capacity to perform medium work as of August 1982. For the most part, the medical evidence in the record concerning claimant\u2019s heart condition established only the bare medical facts: that claimant suffered from arteriosclerotic heart disease with angina pectoris, and that this condition had improved as a result of claimant\u2019s November 1981 coronary bypass surgery. None of the physicians who examined claimant provided any medical findings concerning the impact of his heart condition on his residual functional capacity. Nor, since claimant waived hearing, was there any live testimony directed to this issue. Neither the Appeals Council nor this court is qualified to make this medical judgment about residual functional capacity based solely on bare medical findings as to claimant\u2019s heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The only medical evaluation of claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity was made by Dr. Rey, a non-examining medical consultant who reviewed reports by examining physicians and concluded, \u201cHeavy work is precluded. Should be able to walk/stand 6 hours/day; lift 50 lbs. max., 25 lbs. occ.\u201d This latter clearly means \u201c50 lbs. maximum, 25 lbs. occasionally.\u201d By contrast, the governing definition of \u201cmedium work\u201d states, \u201cMedium work involves lifting no more than 50 pounds at a time with <em>frequent </em>lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 25 pounds.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1567(c) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, this finding does not support a conclusion that claimant can perform medium work.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">Since a treadmill exercise test administered to claimant on August 9, 1982, was \u201cnegative,\u201d the Appeals Council specifically relied on an application of Social Security Ruling 82-51, sections B. 2 and B. 3, to find claimant not disabled. These sections state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201c2. Ischemic heart disease with angina, treadmill exercise test \u201cnegative\u201d at 7 METs, but \u201cpositive\u201d at 10 METs or less. Heavy work activity would be precluded, but ability to engage in medium work activity ordinarily would be retained unless restricted by other cardiac impairments such as congestive heart failure. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">3. Postmyocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft, without angina, congestive heart failure, or significant arrhythmias. Heavy work activity would be precluded unless specific exercise testing establishes the ability to engage in heavy work activity. The distinction between the capacity to perform medium and light work activity requires consideration of the medical evidence describing the individual\u2019s clinical condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">However, section B. 3 appears inapplicable because the medical evidence indicates that claimant had both a coronary artery bypass graft and angina. Nor is it clear that section B. 2 governs, since triple coronary bypass surgery may qualify as one of the \u201cother cardiac impairments\u201d that would restrict ability to engage in medium work activity. The record lacks adequate medical evidence addressing that question. Also, even apart from these objections it does not appear that either section could be applied to this case without at least some supporting medical findings, since section B. 2 provides only that the ability to perform medium work \u201cordinarily\u201d would be retained, and section B. 3 expressly requires further consideration of medical evidence to distinguish between the capacity to perform medium and light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">There being no dispute in this case that claimant suffers from a severe impairment which precludes him from returning to his former occupation as a steel worker, the burden was on the Secretary to demonstrate that claimant has the capacity to engage in alternative employment for which jobs exist in the national economy. <em>Vazquez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>683 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1982); <em>Gagnon v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>666 F.2d 662, 666 n. 9 (1st Cir.1981). In the absence of substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s finding that claimant had residual functional capacity to perform medium work, we remand to the Secretary so that he may receive and consider additional evidence regarding claimant\u2019s residual capacity in this respect. If it were concluded that claimant can only perform light work, application of Rule 202.06 of the grid would result in a finding of disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">We are also troubled by the Appeals Council\u2019s implicit finding that claimant\u2019s depressive neurosis and anxiety did not significantly affect his ability to perform the full range of jobs requiring medium work, so that the grid could be applied to determine claimant\u2019s disability despite the allegation of a nonexertional impairment. <em>See Burgos Lopez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>747 F.2d 37, 41 (1st Cir.1984); <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>666 F.2d at 666 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The only evidence regarding claimant\u2019s mental condition consisted of the findings of a single psychiatrist, Dr. Elias Jimenez Olivo, who submitted two reports. Dr. Jimenez found that claimant\u2019s depressive neurotic and anxious condition manifested itself in \u201cdiminished thought production, periods of blockings in train of thought.\u201d Dr. Jimenez noted that claimant\u2019s <em>memory </em>was impaired as to both past and present events, he was only partially oriented as to time, and his \u201cintellectual capacities in general seem affected, especially capacity for concentration and retention.\u201d Dr. Jimenez also found both a marked restriction of daily activities and an impaired ability to relate to others, noting that claimant engaged in no household duties, shopping, hobbies, or recreation, never went out alone, \u201cdoes not interact well [with] strangers,\u201d and exhibited an \u201cappropriateness of response in special situations\u201d that was \u201cinadequate, unpredictable.\u201d The conclusion stated by Dr. Jimenez was that claimant was \u201ctotally and permanently incompetent to engage in any gainful activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">We agree with the Appeals Council that the Secretary is not bound by Dr. Jimenez\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>latter, sweeping conclusion. However, given Dr. Jimenez\u2019 findings, controverted by no other evidence of record, we find it difficult to understand the Appeals Council\u2019s statement, \u201cThere is no evidence showing a lack of ability to reason or under-stand____ Also there is no indication that he has been maladjusted in his social life or would be maladjusted occupationally.\u201d Accordingly, upon remand the Secretary should also reassess the impact of claimant\u2019s alleged mental condition on claimant\u2019s ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>666 F.2d at 665-66, we approved the procedure set out by section 200.00(e)(2) of Appendix 2 to Subpart P, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, to be followed when both exertional and nonexertional factors are present. As the regulations state,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">\u201c(2) ... [W]here an individual has an impairment or combination of impairments resulting in both strength limitations and nonexertional limitations, the rules in this subpart are considered in determining first whether a finding of disabled may be possible based on the strength limitations alone and, if not, the rule(s) reflecting the individual\u2019s maximum residual strength capabilities, age, education, and work experience provide a framework for consideration of <em>how much the individual\u2019s work capability is further diminished in terms of any types of jobs that would be contraindicated by the nonexertional limitations. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">On remand, therefore, the Secretary first should receive and consider additional evidence on the issue whether claimant, based on his exertional impairment alone, retains the residual functional capacity to do medium work. If he does not, he is disabled by application of Rule 202.06 of the grid. If he does, he would not be disabled by application of Rule 203.15 of the grid, so the Secretary would need to consider further, with the aid of additional evidence if necessary, whether claimant\u2019s nonexertional impairment significantly affects claimant\u2019s ability to perform the full range of jobs requiring medium or lesser work. <em>See Burgos Lopez, supra, </em>747 F.2d at 41. If it does, the grid cannot be applied and the Secretary can find claimant not disabled only by using other means, such as evidence procured from vocational experts, to meet her burden of proving the availability of jobs in the national economy that claimant can perform. <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>666 F.2d at 665 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to remand to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">. We note that claimant's previous work, which the Appeals Council agreed he could no longer perform, involved the regular lifting of tools and iron bars weighing from twenty to sixty pounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
