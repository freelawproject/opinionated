(\u201cHoward Electrical\u201d), has failed to file an effective notice of appeal under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4). For purposes of determining jurisdiction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the following procedural sequence is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-12\">December 3, 1985 \u2014 final judgment entered by the district court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-13\">December 6, 1985 \u2014 defendant Howard Electrical filed its motion for additional findings of fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-14\">December 6, 1985 \u2014 notice of appeal filed by defendant Howard Electrical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-15\">January 10, 1986 \u2014 district court denied defendant Howard Electrical\u2019s motion for additional findings of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-18\">Subsequent to January 10, 1986, no further notice of appeal was filed. Indeed, the last document in the record is the district court\u2019s denial of the request for additional findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-19\">Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-20\">If a timely motion under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is filed in the district court by any party: ... (ii) under Rule 52(b) to amend or make additional findings of fact, whether or not an alteration of the judgment would be required if the motion is granted; ... the time for appeal for all parties shall run from the entry of the order denying a new trial or granting or denying any other such motion. A notice of appeal filed before the disposition of any of the above motions shall have no effect. A new notice of appeal must be filed within the prescribed time measured from the entry of the order disposing of the motion as provided above. No additional fees shall be required for such filing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-21\">Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4). It is well established that the failure to file a timely notice of appeal under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a) is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional, and absent compliance, the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Burnside v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., </em>519 F.2d 1127, 1128 n. 2 (5th Cir.1975) (per curiam). This Court has recently emphasized that a \u201cbright-line\u201d approach in administering Rule 4 serves the interest of both counsel and the Court. <em>See Harcon Barge Co. v. D &amp; G Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 665, 670 (5th Cir.1986) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-22\">Howard Electrical\u2019s postjudgment motion, which was captioned \u201cDefendant\u2019s Request for Additional Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\u201d is a motion under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the instant case, Howard Electrical filed its notice of appeal one day after its motion (i.e., the motion for additional findings of fact) under Rule 52(b) was served. Rule 4(a)(4) clearly provides, \u201cA notice of appeal filed before the disposition of any of the above motions shall have no effect.\u201d Thus, the notice of appeal, filed before the disposition of Howard Electrical\u2019s motion, \u201cis not merely defective; it is a nullity.\u201d 5A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 52.11[3], at 52-200 (1986). Moreover, this Court lacks the power to waive the defect of such a premature notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (per curiam)). <em>See also </em>9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2582, at 724-25 (1971 &amp; 1986 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">In response to the Court\u2019s inquiry, Howard Electrical argues that its motion \u201cwas addressed to mere matters of form\u201d and did not seek an alteration of the district court\u2019s judgment against it. While we would note some difficulty in accepting Howard Electrical\u2019s characterization of its motion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Howard Electrical\u2019s argument in any event would have this Court ignore the wording of the rule that the motion suspends the finality of the judgment \u201cwhether or not an alteration of the judgment would be required if the motion is granted.\u201d Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4). Accordingly, we must reject Howard Electrical\u2019s attempt to recharacterize its motion in order to avoid the terms of Rule 4. <em>See Harcon Barge, </em>784 F.2d at 667 (timely filed motion under Rule 59(e) cannot be characterized as Rule 60 motion in order to avoid effect of Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Accordingly, appellant Howard Electrical has failed to file an effective notice of appeal. This Court has no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-16\">. No party filed a motion to dismiss this appeal. However, it is axiomatic that this Court must raise <em>sua sponte </em>the issue of its own jurisdiction. Accordingly, upon noticing the possible jurisdictional defect, this Court asked the parties to submit letter briefs on the issue. The parties complied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1046-17\">. The certificate of service indicates that the motion was served on December 5. A motion to amend or make additions to the district court\u2019s findings of fact must be \"made\" within ten days of the district court's entry of judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b). A Rule 52(b) motion is deemed to be \"made\u201d when it is served. 5A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 52.11[1], at 52-193 n. 8 (1986). The Rule 52(b) motion was clearly made within ten days of the district court\u2019s entry of judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">. The motion clearly appears as a motion to the district court to \"make additional findings.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b). Moreover, the motion requests the addition of three pages of additional fact findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
