We affirm the ruling of the district court that the company was not required to extend appellant Home the additional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-23\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b701-24\">On September 12, 1980, John Chokos of Pederson-Chokos and Company, an independent insurance agency, which solicits insurance applications for numerous insurance companies, met with appellant Home and her mother to renew various insurance policies taken out by the Homes, collect the required premiums, and acquire their signatures on the various policy applications. Chokos had apparently been performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>this service for the Hornes for a number of years past. Included in the policies discussed was an application for standard automobile liability insurance with appellee State Auto. The application has two separate sections. The first contains the basic liability application with a signature space at the end. The second, labeled \u201cOffer to Purchase Optional Coverages\u201d contains within an application for additional, optional, personal injury protection (\u201cPIP\u201d) above and beyond the $5,000 coverage included in the basic standard, liability policy. This section of the application has the heading: \u201cPersonal Injury Protection ($5,000 coverage included in your basic premium charges).\u201d To receive the additional coverage, there are spaces indicating the amount of extra-insurance sought from $10,000 to $50,000. Additionally, there is a separate clause and blank space following stating: \u201cI reject all PIP options below.\u201d At the end of the one page second section is a separate signature space for the insured to sign. According to appellant, Chokos, in whom she had \u201ccomplete confidence\u201d did not explain the contents of this policy, nor did she question him about it. However, at his request, she simply signed both sections of the automobile liability insurance application. She contends that she additionally told Chokos that she wanted the maximum PIP protection. The application that was eventually received and accepted by State Auto, although requesting several other forms of optional insurance, indicated on the form by various checkmarks, expressly waived the optional PIP protection by a checkmark next to the \u201cI reject all PIP options below\u201d statement on the form. Horne claims that Chokos made the check-marks in the blanks on the form after she had signed it. Appellee disputes appellant\u2019s view of the events leading to the filing of the application, stating that Cho-kos \u201cmade the appropriate checkmarks as per Ms. Home\u2019s instructions, providing minimum $5,000 personal injury protection, dated the application, and presented Ms. Horne with the form for her review and signature.\u201d Once signed, he forwarded the application to State Auto for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">State Auto issued the policy in question in early October, 1980, by delivering it to Chokos who in turn forwarded the document to appellant. Home, however, never requested any change in the policy and on January 13, 1981 she was involved in an automobile accident, following which she claimed and received $5,000 in PIP benefits. On March 9,1984 she made a demand for $50,000 in optional PIP benefits and tendered the additional premium to State Auto. The insurance company refused to provide the extra benefits and subsequently commenced a declaratory judgment action in U.S. District Court to determine whether it was required to extend the full optional ($50,000) coverage to Home. The court below entered summary judgment in favor of State Auto, declaring that the optional benefit selector form used by State Auto and signed by Horne was in substantial compliance with Georgia statute O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-34-5(b) as interpreted by <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Nixon, </em>252 Ga. 469, 314 S.E.2d 215 (1984) and its progeny. Thus the court found that as a matter of law, appellant made a knowing and intentional waiver of her right to optional PIP benefits when she signed the form. Additionally, it found that State Auto had no obligation to make any more payments to Horne because as a matter of law, Chokos was her agent and, as such, even if he did make the checkmarks on the form after she had signed it, she was bound by that action. Following entry of final judgment in the action, this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">1. Whether the district court erred when it granted appellee\u2019s State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment when it concluded appellee\u2019s application was in substantial compliance with O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-34-5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">2. Whether the district court erred when it granted appellee\u2019s State Automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Mutual Insurance Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment when it concluded that Pederson-Chokos was not appellee\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Appellant Horne has raised two issues on appeal. She first argues that the district court erred in finding that the automobile liability insurance application form used by State Auto here was proper under Georgia law. We cannot agree with appellant. Under the Georgia Code\u2019s automobile liability insurance provision in effect at the time the policy at issue in this case was promulgated, it was stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">(a) Each insurer shall also make available on an optional basis the following coverage: (1) an aggregate limit of benefits payable without regard to fault up to $50,000 per person, which may be rejected or reduced to not less than an aggregate limit of benefits payable without regard to fault of $5,000 per person by written consent of the policy holder ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">(b) Each application for a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance sold in this state must contain separate spaces for the insured to indicate his acceptance or rejection of each of the optional coverages listed in subsection (a) of this code section and no such policy shall be issued in this state unless the spaces are completed and signed by the prospective insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-34-5(a), (b). To determine whether an application complied with these requirements, the Georgia Supreme Court in <em>St Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v. Nixon, </em>252 Ga. 469, 314 S.E.2d 215 (1984), developed what has been labeled the \u201csubstantial compliance test.\u201d In the opinion, the court approved an insurance application form with one signature space for the portion of the application containing basic information and a second signature space pertaining to the insurer\u2019s \u201cOffer to Purchase Additional Coverage Application.\u201d The court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">Here, as in <em>Nalley (Nalley v. Select Insurance Co., </em>251 Ga. 722 [313 S.E.2d 465] (1983)), although the optional-coverage application has only one signature, it is clear from the form of the application that the intent of the insured was to reject optional PIP benefits and vehicle-damage protection. Therefore, we hold that, \u2018the form is in substantial compliance with the statutory requirement, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 l-3-l(c) (Code Ann. \u00a7 102-102), and satisfies the intent of the General Assembly to ensure \u201c \u2018that insurers offer optional coverages to applicants for no-fault insurance <em>and </em>that an applicant\u2019s waiver of his privilege to obtain coverages be made knowingly and in writing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flewellen, supra, </em>250 Ga. [709] at 714 [300 S.E.2d 673 (1983)].\u2019 <em>Nalley v. Select Ins. Co., </em>251 Ga., <em>supra, </em>p. 724 [313 S.E.2d 465].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-12\"><em>St. Paul v. Nixon, </em>252 Ga. at 470, 314 S.E.2d 215. An application form thus is in compliance with the statute\u2019s requirements if it reasonably evidences the insured\u2019s awareness of and rejection of his right to optional no-fault coverages. In the present case, the form used by State Auto clearly meets the standard set by the state statute. The form discussing optional coverages, similar to that approved in <em>Nixon, </em>is on a separate page, displays the optional coverages required to be offered, provides separate clauses and spaces for rejection of each of the options, and has a signature line at its bottom, which is in addition to the signature space for the general portion of the insurance application. The form reasonably presents the optional coverages and places a reasonable person in the position of an insured with a clear awareness of the coverages and thus is in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the statute. The district court was correct in upholding the propriety of this form.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Appellant also challenges the district court\u2019s determination that Pederson-Chokos did not act as State Auto\u2019s agent in the transaction in question. We agree with the court\u2019s decision on this matter. The Georgia Court of Appeals has ruled that in questions of agency involving insurance brokers, such as Pederson-Chokos, insurance companies, and insureds, \u201cwhile insurance agents or brokers may be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>as \u2018dual' agents, or agents for both the insurer and the insured, normally such insurance representatives are independent insurance brokers and are the insured\u2019s agents, not those of the insurer.\u201d <em>National Property Owners Ins. Co. v. Wells, </em>166 Ga.App. 281, 282, 304 S.E.2d 458 (1983) (citations omitted.) In this case, it is quite clear that Chokos cannot be considered to have acted as an agent for State Auto. His company, Pederson-Chokos, is an independent insurance agency which takes applications from its customers and places automobile liability insurance with a number of different companies, State Auto only one of several. The agency was under no obligation to submit applications to State Auto nor did State Auto have any ownership interest in it. Pederson-Chokos merely prepared applications requesting insurance and forwarded them to appellee. State Auto completely retained the power to accept or reject the applications. Additionally, there were no signs posted on the building housing Pederson-Chokos\u2019 offices, indicating a relationship between State Auto and the agency. The district court was correct in determining on summary judgment that Pederson-Chokos did not function in this case as an agent for appel-lee State Auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
