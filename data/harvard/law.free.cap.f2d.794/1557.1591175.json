A district court jury found that Reichert had suffered $200,000 in damages, but that he had been 75 percent contributorily negligent. Reichert challenges the district court\u2019s ruling allowing the contributory negligence defense and the court\u2019s refusal to award prejudgment interest. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-15\">The Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a), provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0Gl\">[t]he liability of an employer prescribed in section 904 of this title shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee ..., except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter, an injured employee ... may elect ... to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages____ In such action the defendant may not plead as a defense ... that the injury was due to the contributory negligence of the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1626-18\">Defendants did not have compensation insurance covering Reichert; neither did Reichert\u2019s employer, MAN, the company with which defendants had contracted for the engine repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-19\">Reichert acknowledges that he was not an employee of defendants and that MAN was not a \u201csubcontractor\u201d of defendants. Under the LHWCA, therefore, defendants were not obligated to provide compensation coverage for Reichert. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a). Nevertheless, Reichert claims that because <em>MAN </em>did not provide him with coverage, <em>defendants </em>should not have been permitted to raise a contributory negligence defense. He argues that under section 905(a), if an injured worker\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d has failed to provide coverage as required, then any \u201cdefendant\u201d in a tort action may not argue contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-20\">Reichert\u2019s argument fails to take into account the structure of section 905(a). The subsection states that an employer\u2019s liability for compensation shall be exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>sively that prescribed in section 904 <em>except that </em>if the employer does not secure coverage the employee may maintain a lawsuit. The words \u201cexcept that\u201d indicate that the reference to legal action was intended to be an exception to the usual limited liability established in the previous clause. Congress simply provided that an employer which provides compensation coverage may not be sued, but one which does not provide coverage may be sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">It would make no sense to interpret the reference to a lawsuit to apply to legal action against <em>any </em>defendant, because a defendant who is not deemed to stand in the shoes of an employer may be sued <em>regardless </em>of whether the employer provided compensation coverage. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(a). Section 905(b), in fact, expressly permits an action against a vessel owner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1627-6\">It is thus clear that when Congress provided that \u201c[i]n <em>such action </em>the defendant may not plead ... contributory negligence,\u201d it was referring to an action brought <em>under the exception to the employer\u2019s limited liability. </em>In this context, the word \u201cdefendant\u201d refers only to a defendant, such as an employer, which has lost its limited liability because of a failure to provide compensation. Nonemployer vessel owners such as defendants here are never protected by section 905(a)\u2019s limitation of liability. They cannot lose a protection they never had, and thus cannot be \u201cdefendants\u201d under section 905(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-7\">This reading of the provision is supported by common sense. It is logical to override the defense of contributory negligence as it relates to a defendant who has breached a duty to provide compensation coverage. Having failed to provide compensation, under which the plaintiff\u2019s fault would be irrelevant, such a defendant is reasonably prevented from shifting all or part of the financial burden of an accident to the worker in a tort action. It would make little sense, however, to extend the rule to defendants with no obligation to provide a particular worker with coverage. Such defendants would, in effect, be punished for violations of LHWCA for which they were not responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-11\">We also reject Reichert\u2019s contention that the district court erred in not awarding prejudgment interest, although as a general rule it should be awarded in admiralty cases. <em>Drake Towing Co. v. Meisner Marine Construction Co., 765 </em>F.2d 1060, 1068 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Noritake Co. v. M/V Hellenic Champion, </em>627 F.2d 724, 728-29 (5th Cir.1980); <em>McCormack v. Noble Drilling Corp., </em>608 F.2d 169, 175 (5th Cir.1979). For prejudgment interest to be proper there must be some way for the court to determine the correct amount to award. Here, the jury\u2019s lump sum damage award presumably was intended to compensate Reichert for both past and future damages. As to future damages, however, prejudgment interest is inappropriate. The judge therefore had no way to determine upon what portion of the judgment, if any, to award prejudgment interest. Reichert does not contend that he had asked for and been refused a jury instruction on prejudgment interest, or an instruction that the jury should return an itemized verdict. Under these circumstances the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to make a guess as to the appropriate amount of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1627-8\">. The section refers to an action against a \"vessel,\u201d but the action need not actually be brought in rem. <em>See, e.g., Scindia Steam Navigation Co. v.
