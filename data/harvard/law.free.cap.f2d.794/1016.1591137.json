JONES, Circuit Judge, with whom CLARK, Chief Judge, GEE, JOLLY, HIGGINBOTHAM, and DAVIS, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-25\">I must respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision denying rehearing en banc. I do not agree that the panel majority and Judge Brown\u2019s dissent differ only in application of settled law to the facts. Quite the contrary, the chasm between the majority and dissenting opinions is strictly one of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-26\">First, the majority opinion changes the law regarding the definition of a \u201cseller\u201d of securities. The long-standing Fifth Circuit test for identifying a \u201cseller\u201d under the 1933 Act is whether the alleged seller\u2019s conduct was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing the purchase. <em>See Hill York Corp. v. American International Franchises, Inc., </em>448 F.2d 680 (5th Cir.1971); <em>Lewis v. Walston &amp; Co., Inc., </em>487 F.2d 617 (5th Cir.1973). This Court\u2019s seminal decisions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number><em>Hill York </em>and <em>Lewis </em>have been widely cited and followed by other circuits. <em>See, e.g., S.E.C. v. Murphy, </em>626 F.2d 633 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Stokes v. Lokken, </em>644 F.2d 779 (8th Cir.1981); <em>Davis v. Avco Financial Services, Inc., </em>739 F.2d 1057 (6th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1359, 84 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985). The panel majority specifically found that Dahl met the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test, yet declined to hold that he was a \u201cseller,\u201d because, according to the majority, Dahl had no expectation of financial benefit. Until this opinion, expectation of financial benefit played no role\u2014 express or implied \u2014 in the determination of \u201cseller\u201d status. According to the majority, the test is no longer \u201csubstantial factor\u201d but \u201csubstantial factor <em>plus </em>expectation of financial benefit.\u201d As Judge Brown stated in his dissent, this new restriction has absolutely no foundation in either settled securities law or its underlying policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">I sympathize with the panel\u2019s evident concern regarding an overly broad definition of \u201cseller\u201d lest a cocktail conversation should lead to unwarranted liability under section 12(1) of the 1933 Act. Dahl, however, was performing a role far more significant than that of \u201chappy hour investment advisor.\u201d The policy behind the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test, unadulterated by the majority\u2019s gloss, is fully satisfied by holding Dahl to be a \u201cseller.\u201d We need not speculate, therefore, on how a true cocktail conversationalist might defend himself consistent with that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">The second major divergence between the majority opinion and the dissent is also purely one of law. The majority declines to apply a recent Supreme Court case which, in the context of a private cause of action for a securities violation, fashions an explicit test for allowance of the <em>in pari delicto </em>defense. <em>See B. Eichler, H. Richard v. Berner, </em>472 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 2622, 86 L.Ed.2d 215 (1985). Rather, the majority ruled that the disposition of the <em>in pari delicto </em>issue raised on this appeal was controlled by a venerable Fifth Circuit case which, as correctly pointed out by the dissent, does not even discuss the <em>in pari delicto </em>defense. The majority\u2019s confusion regarding the controlling principles of law is evident in its hapless attempt to distinguish <em>Eichler </em>on the grounds that the <em>Ei-chler </em>test \u201cmirrors the classic formulation of the <em>in pari delicto </em>doctrine.\u201d Finally, the majority apparently suggests that <em>Ei-chler </em>should be confined to section 10(b) actions. <em>Eichler </em>does not remotely suggest such a result. In fact, it was conceded in <em>Eichler </em>that the <em>in pari delicto </em>defense should be available when Congress expressly provides for private remedies (e.g., actions under the 1933 Securities Act); the issue for decision was whether the defense should be unavailable when the private cause of action is implied (e.g., a Rule 10b-5 action). The Supreme Court rejected this distinction, ruling that the <em>in pari delicto </em>doctrine applies to implied causes of action under the federal securities laws as well as to private causes of action expressly provided for by Congress. 105 S.Ct. at 2628, 86 L.Ed.2d at 223-24. Thus, any reasonable reading of <em>Eichler </em>indicates that its formulation of the <em>in pari delicto </em>defense applies to actions instituted under the \u201933 Act as well as actions brought pursuant to 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">In sum, the panel majority has erred in its choice of controlling legal principles rather than its application of settled law to the facts. The practical implication of its error is obvious. A fence-straddler, such as Dahl, can promote and participate in an illegal sale of unregistered securities and, if the investment does not pay off, turn around and sue the issuer to recover his investment. This lamentable result may actually encourage future violations, thereby thwarting federal securities policy. Finally, in light of the panel majority\u2019s cloudy discussion of the <em>in pari delicto </em>doctrine, I am left wondering about the doctrine\u2019s current place in this Circuit\u2019s law. Are we really holding that the <em>Eichler </em>formulation of the <em>in pari delicto </em>doctrine does not apply to actions arising under the 1933 Act? Do we have any valid rationale for doing so? If not, on what basis are we to decide whether to apply <em>Eichler </em>in future cases? Reshaping the law in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>reach a predetermined desired outcome has created an ill-conceived precedent on two significant legal issues affecting securities litigation. Believing that it is our duty to refrain from such reshaping and to follow the obvious lead of the Supreme Court in <em>Eichler, </em>I dissent from the Court\u2019s denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
