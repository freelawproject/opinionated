Lynne, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b720-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b720-23\">Appellants Lawrence Ungar and John Daniel Dickinson appeal their convictions of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). With regards to Dickinson\u2019s appeal, his judgment of conviction is affirmed without opinion. <em>See </em>Circuit Rule 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-24\">The principal issue raised in Ungar\u2019s appeal is that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel at trial due to a conflict of interest existing with one of his attorneys. The government\u2019s indictment alleged that Un-gar, along with Dickinson, regularly sold cocaine to Richard Stalder and Richard Grinsberg, who in turn resold the cocaine to another purchaser. Stalder and Grins-berg had previously been prosecuted in this same conspiracy. Both Stalder and Grins-berg entered into plea agreements in exchange for their testimony against Ungar and Dickinson. Apparently, pursuant to Stalder\u2019s plea agreement the understanding existed that he would not be required to testify regarding his brother, Tom Stalder. Attorney Kent Harrison represented Stalder in the plea negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-25\">When indicted, Ungar contended that he did not supply any drugs to Stalder or Grinsberg. Rather, Stalder\u2019s source was exclusively his brother, Tom. Surprisingly, under these circumstances attorney Harri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>son undertook the representation of Ungar, to defend him against the case to be made by the prosecution through the testimony of Harrison\u2019s former client, Stalder. Further, Ungar\u2019s principal defense concerned matters integrally related to Stalder\u2019s plea negotiations \u2014 namely, Tom Stalder\u2019s involvement in the cocaine conspiracy and whether Richard Stalder would be required to reveal that alleged involvement. We harbor grave reservations about whether representation of Ungar by Harrison under these circumstances was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">However, in examining Ungar\u2019s claim we note that he has raised this issue for the first time on appeal. Because this is a direct appeal, the issue is not properly before this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">The law of this Circuit is that claims of inadequate representation cannot be determined on direct appeal where such claims were not raised before the District Court and there has been no opportunity to develop and include in the record evidence bearing on the merits of the allegations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\"><em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>582 F.2d 1015, 1016 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Ungar also contends that evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction on the conspiracy count. Our review of the record indicates this allegation of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Ungar\u2019s convictions are affirmed without prejudice to his right to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in a proper proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
