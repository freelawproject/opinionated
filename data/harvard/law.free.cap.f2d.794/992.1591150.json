Meloy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>and his wife sued Conoco for damages in federal court asserting jurisdiction under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(b). Conoco filed a third-party claim against Oilfield Services for defense and indemnity pursuant to an agreement that had previously been made between Conoco and Oilfield Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">In March 1979, Conoco and Oilfield Services had entered into a blanket agreement containing a defense and indemnity provision that is reproduced in full in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In May or June 1983, Conoco directed Oilfield Services to sandblast and paint its offshore production platform in accordance with the blanket agreement of March 1979. It was during the performance of this work that Meloy was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Oilfield Services resisted Conoco\u2019s third-party demand on the ground that the Louisiana Oilfield Indemnity Act of 1981, La. Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 9:2780, barred Conoco\u2019s claim for indemnity under the blanket agreement. The district court concluded that Louisiana law controlled and granted Oilfield Services\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Conoco appealed, and this panel affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In rejecting Conoco\u2019s claim for costs of defense, we held that under Louisiana law the indemnitor\u2019s obligation to defend is an issue that must be determined entirely by the allegations of the precipitating pleadings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Meloy did not allege fault on the part of Oilfield Services, the indemnitor, there was no duty to defend. We also held that, even if Conoco were found free of fault after trial on the merits and the injury were found to have resulted in whole or in part from the fault of Oilfield Services, Conoco still would be unable to recover its cost of defense. We also rejected Conoco\u2019s interpretation of the Oilfield Indemnity Act as not \u00e1ffecting an indemnity agreement to the extent that it requires the indemnitor (Oilfield Services) to indemnify the indemnitee (Conoco) for damages resulting from the indemnitor\u2019s negligence or fault in causing injuries to an employee of the indemnitor (Meloy).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">CERTIFICATE FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT TO THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA, PURSUANT TO RULE XII, LOUISIANA SUPREME COURT RULES TO THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA AND THE HONORABLE JUSTICES THEREOF:</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>I. STYLE OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">The style of the case in which certification is made is <em>Robert Earl Meloy, et al., Plaintiffs, versus Conoco, Inc., Defendant-Third Party Plaintiff-Appellant, versus Oilfield Services of Cameron, Inc., Third Party Defendant-Appellee. </em>Case No. 84-4718, United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, on appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">II. QUESTIONS CERTIFIED TO THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">The following questions of law are hereby certified to the Supreme Court of Louisiana for instructions based upon the facts recited herein:</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">(1) Under Louisiana law, is an indemnitor\u2019s obligation to defend a suit against the indemnitee for personal injuries sustained by an employee of the indemnitor determined entirely by the allegations of the complaint against the indemnitee? That is, if the petition against the indemnitee alleges only that the indemnitee was at fault, does the indemnitor have a duty to defend (assuming the indemnity agreement is interpreted to include costs of defense)?</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">(2) If the indemnitor does not have a duty to defend the suit, but if, after trial on the merits, the indemnitee is found free from fault and the injury is found to have resulted in whole or in part from the fault of the indemnitor, is the indemnitee entitled to recover its cost of defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">(3) If an indemnity agreement is covered by the Louisiana Oilfield Indemnity Act of 1981, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 9:2780, does the Act nullify completely an indemnity contract that obligates the indemnitor to indemnify the indemnitee regardless of which party is at fault? Or is the agreement valid to the extent it requires indemnification for damages attributable to the comparative fault of the indemnitor?</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">This court also certifies to the Louisiana Supreme Court that its answer to these questions will be determinative in this case, resolving all issues between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">The record in this case, together with the copies of the parties\u2019 briefs, is transmitted herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">QUESTIONS CERTIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-28\">. <em>Meloy </em>v. <em>Conoco, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 1320 (5th Cir.1986), <em>withdrawn, </em>792 F.2d 56 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">.
