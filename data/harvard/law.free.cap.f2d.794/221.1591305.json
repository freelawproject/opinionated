(Whit-worth) appeals from an order of the district court dismissing Whitworth\u2019s complaint filed pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(2)(A)(ii) against Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, its trustees and executive director for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">On September 15, 1983, Whitworth filed a complaint against Central States alleging that Central States is a multi-employer employee benefit plan covered by ERISA. The complaint alleged that Whitworth was an Ohio corporation, that Central States was headquartered in and had its principal place of business in Illinois, and that since 1955 William and Ernest Whitworth have been employees, co-owners and officers of Whitworth. Count I alleged jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Whitworth styled the action as one \u201cfor recovery of Plaintiff\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tributions to Central States on and after January 1, 1975 ... pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(2)(A)(ii),\u201d and claimed to have made $11,000 in contributions to Central States on behalf of William and Ernest in the mistaken belief that they were employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. Payments were made on behalf of William from January 1, 1975 through July 1981 and on behalf of Ernest from January 1, 1975 through March 1980. Whitworth alleged that a request was made on Central States for return of such contributions, and that, on July 23, 1981, such request was denied with respect to payments from January 1, 1975 through November 10, 1979 on behalf of William, but granted with respect to payments from November 11, 1979 through March 1, 1980 on behalf of William. Whitworth alleged that the refusal to refund the payments was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d and violated fiduciary duties pursuant to ERISA and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a). The complaint was served on the Secretaries of Labor and of the Treasury. In Count II, Whitworth sought restitution pursuant to a state claim for contributions prior to January 1, 1975, alleging that $9,000 was paid on behalf of Ernest and William Whitworth from 1955 through December 31, 1974. Whitworth alleged that demand was made on Central States but that Central States had refused to review the claim for the period 1955 through May 30, 1964, and had denied the request for a refund of contributions made May 31, 1964 through December 31, 1974. Whitworth claimed that Central States\u2019 approval of the claim for the period November 11, 1979 through March 1, 1980 es-topped Central States from denying Whit-worth\u2019s claim and that such approval \u201cconstitutes a waiver to deny Plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d In Count III, Whitworth, invoking jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1), (f), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, sought a declaratory judgment that Ernest Whitworth is not covered by the collective bargaining agreement, that Whitworth is entitled to restitution plus interest of the payments made on Ernest\u2019s behalf from 1955 through July 1981, and that Central States is not entitled to contributions for the period August 1981 through May 1983. On Count I, Whitworth sought a refund of $11,000 plus pre-judgment interest and attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g), and on Count II, a refund of $9,000 plus interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">On November 6, 1984, Central States moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim. On January 15, 1985, the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The district court held that employers are not authorized to maintain an ERISA action pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a), (e)(1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">The Sixth Circuit has not specifically ruled on whether an employer may bring an action for recovery of mistaken payments to a pension fund under \u00a7 1103(c). The circuit has found that the benefit plan administrator determines whether a mistaken contribution was made and the trustees\u2019 action is conclusive unless arbitrary or capricious, not supported by substantial evidence, or erroneous on a question of law. <em>Transisters [sic] Local 348 Health and Welfare Fund v. Kohn Beverage Co., </em>749 F.2d 315 (6th Cir.1984). The Court noted that employers who pay mistaken contributions have no right of action or entitlement to a refund. <em>Id. </em>fn. 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The district court concluded that ERISA provides employers with no cause of action, and, therefore, dismissed Counts I and III, and dismissed Count II as a pendant claim. An order of dismissal was entered January 22, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">On February 1, 1985, Whitworth moved for reconsideration and to alter or amend the judgment, and for leave to file an amended complaint. On March 11, 1985, the district court denied the motion based on the decision in <em>Kohn Beverage, </em>finding that \u201c[t]he Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did not hold that an employer may now bring an action under ERISA. In fact the Court noted that an employer who mistakenly makes a contribution to a pension fund has no cause of action for recovery.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The district court found that Whitworth attempted to add William and Ernest Whit-worth as individual plaintiffs to establish \u201cstanding as participants of the fund to file an action under ERISA.\u201d The court held that it could not grant the motion for leave until it first vacated the judgment, and concluded that even the amended complaint failed to state a cause of action, and, therefore, the grant of leave would be futile. \u201cThere is nothing in ERISA providing a cause of action by an employee to recover mistaken contributions to a plan by his employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The essence of Whitworth\u2019s complaint is that Whitworth made contributions to Central States on behalf of - its employees pursuant to written contracts, a trust agreement and a collective bargaining agreement, which Whitworth believed obligated it to make such payments. When Central States determined that certain of Whit-worth\u2019s employees were not entitled to benefits, Whitworth concluded that it had made contributions which it was not contractually obligated to make, and, accordingly, sought restitution of the erroneously paid monies. Accordingly, we consider whether the district court had jurisdiction of such a claim based on (1) the express actions recognized in ERISA; (2) an action implied from the terms of the statute; or (3) an action arising under federal common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The pertinent provisions of ERISA are reviewed below. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1) provides, with respect to jurisdiction, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWc\">Except for actions under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this subchapter brought by the Secretary or by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary. State courts of competent jurisdiction and district courts of the United States shall have concurrent jurisdiction of actions under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Actions available under ERISA are defined in section 502(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-11\">A civil action may be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-12\">(1) by a <em>participant </em>or beneficiary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-13\">(A) for the relief provided for in subsection (c) of this section, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-14\">(B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-15\">(2) by the <em>Secretary, </em>or by a <em>participant, beneficiary </em>or <em>fiduciary </em>for appropriate relief under section 1109 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-16\">(3) by a <em>participant, beneficiary, </em>or <em>fiduciary </em>(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this sub-chapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-17\">(4) by the <em>Secretary, </em>or by a <em>participant, </em>or <em>beneficiary </em>for appropriate relief in the case of a violation of 1025(c) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-18\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is clear that Whit-worth, the plaintiff-employer in this case, is neither a \u201cparticipant,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7), \u201cbeneficiary,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(8), or \u201cfiduciary,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21). Accordingly, from the face of the statute it does not appear that Whitworth can premise juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>diction on section 502(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">However, Whitworth further relies on section 403(c)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">Except as provided in paragraph (2), (3), or (4) or subsection (d) of this section, or under sections 1342 and 1344 of this title (relating to termination of insured plans), <em>the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer </em>and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">(Emphasis added). An exception to this prohibition in subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">In the case of a contribution ... made by an employer to a multiemployer plan by a mistake of fact or law ..., paragraph (1) shall not prohibit the return of such contribution or payment to the employer within 6 months after the plan administrator determines that the contribution was made by such a mistake.^</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Whitworth, accordingly, argues that section 1103 provides an employer with an action for return of mistakenly paid contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">While courts generally agree that section 502 of ERISA does not provide for a civil action for employers as employers,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> courts disagree regarding whether the grant of jurisdiction in section 502 is exclusive, thereby prohibiting an action by an employer such as Whitworth. In overpayment cases, such as the instant case, the Ninth Circuit has held that, despite the specific provisions of section 502, \u201can employer may bring an action under ERISA to enforce its terms where the employer alleges specific and personal injury.\u201d <em>Award Service, Inc. v. Northern California Retail Clerks Unions &amp; Food Employers Joint Pension Trust Fund, </em>763 F.2d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 850, 88 L.Ed.2d 890 (1986). The court found that the district court had \u201cjurisdiction to entertain the section 403 claim under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)\u201d where \u201cthe employer alleges that it has mistakenly paid more than $167,000 in contributions which it was not obligated to make.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The court in <em>Award Service </em>adhered to an earlier case holding that an employer could sue, pursuant to ERISA, a fund for failure to pay benefits, thereby impairing the employer\u2019s relationship with the union. <em>Fentron Industries, Inc. v. National Shopmen Pension Fund, </em>674 F.2d 1300 (9th Cir.1982). In <em>Fentron, </em>the court held that the jurisdictional grant of section 502 was not exclusive, and that \u201cFentron\u2019s alleged injuries also fall within the zone of interests that Congress intended to protect when it enacted ERISA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1305. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-17\">we do not believe that Congress, in enacting ERISA, intended to prohibit employers from suing to enforce its provisions. The omission of employers from 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132 is not significant in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>regard. There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest either that the list of parties empowered to sue under this section is exclusive or that Congress intentionally omitted employers____ In view of the intent of Congress to protect employer-employee relations, we hold that the statute does not prohibit employers from suing to enforce its provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANT\"><em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Other courts have reached the opposite conclusion. In <em>Great Lakes Steel v. Deggendorf </em>716 F.2d 1101, 1105 (6th Cir.1983), we held that \u201c29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1) does not confer jurisdiction over an action brought by an employer as employer administering an employee health benefit program.\u201d Also at odds with <em>Fentron </em>is the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Pressroom Unions Printers League Income Security Fund v. Continential Assurance Co., </em>700 F.2d 889, 892 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 845, 104 S.Ct. 148, 78 L.Ed.2d 138 (1983), in which the court, rejecting the <em>Fentron </em>analysis, declined to construe section 502 as allowing a fund or plan to maintain an action under ERISA. The court observed that \u201c[i]t is beyond dispute that only Congress is empowered to grant and extend the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, and that courts are not to infer a grant of jurisdiction absent a clear legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892. We \u201cfocus ... on whether there is any indication that the legislature intended to <em>grant </em>subject matter jurisdiction over suits by employers, funds, or other parties not listed in \u00a7 1132(e)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Noting that the legislative history was silent, the court held that, \u201cabsent such expression, \u00a7 1132(e)(1) should be viewed as an exclusive jurisdictional grant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The court further noted that it had previously held that \u201can employer, also not named in ERISA\u2019s jurisdictional provisions, may not bring suit under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. See Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp. v. Ilsley, </em>690 F.2d 323, 326 (2d Cir.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>463 U.S. 1220, 103 S.Ct. 3564, 77 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1983). The Third Circuit has approved a similar result with respect to actions by an employer to recover excess contributions. \u201cAn action brought by an employer <em>qua </em>employer such as plaintiff is not included within the scope of this section [502].\u201d <em>Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co. v. Teamsters Pension Fund of Philadelphia, </em>549 F.Supp. 307, 310 n. 3, 311 (E.D.Pa.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>720 F.2d 661 (3d Cir.1983) (\u201cSection 502(e)(1) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1) (1976) clearly restricts the categories of individuals empowered to bring a civil action to four groups of persons, none of which includes employers.\u201d). <em>See Hardy v. National Kinney of California, Inc., </em>571 F.Supp. 1214, 1215 (N.D.Cal.1983) (section 502 is exhaustive respecting jurisdiction);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Wong v. Bacon, </em>445 F.Supp. 1177, 1183 (N.D.Cal.1977) (\u201cemployers who contribute to employee benefit plans do not fit in any of the four limited categories of plaintiffs in \u00a7 502(e)(1).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Courts have likewise resisted employers\u2019 attempts to bring actions pursuant to section 502 on grounds other than restitution of allegedly mistaken contributions. The courts have rejected employers\u2019 attempts to maintain actions for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. <em>Tuvia Convalescent Center v. National Union, </em>717 F.2d 726, 729-30 (2d Cir.1983) (follows <em>Pressroom, </em>rejects <em>Fentron; </em>\u201csection 1132 does not provide that a civil action may be brought by an employer\u201d); <em>Modern Woodcrafts, Inc. v. Hawley, </em>534 F.Supp. 1000, 1013 (D.Conn.1982) (actions limited to parties enumerated in section 502); <em>Central States v. Admiral Merchants Motor Freight, Inc., </em>511 F.Supp. 38, 46 (D.Minn.1980), <em>aff'd, </em>642 F.2d 1122 (8th Cir.1981) (\u201cERISA by its terms permits actions only by the Secretary of Labor and participants, beneficiaries, and fiduciaries of trust funds\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>But see Building Service Employees Pension Trust v. Horsemen\u2019s Quarter Horse Racing Ass'n, </em>98 F.R.D. 458, 461 (N.D.Cal.1983) (follows <em>Fentron). See also Niagara of Wisconsin Paper Corp. v. Paper Industry Union-Management Pension Fund, </em>603 F.Supp. 1420,1422 (D.Minn.1984); <em>R.M. Bowler Contract Hauling v. Central States, </em>547 F.Supp. 783, 784 (S.D.Ill.1982). The courts have also restricted actions by parties, other than employers, who are also not among the parties enumerated in section 502. With respect to an action by a plan, <em>see Northeast Department ILGWU Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Teamsters Local Union No. 229 Welfare Fund, </em>764 F.2d 147, 152-54 (3d Cir.1985).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See also Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Kansas City v. Bell, </em>596 F.Supp. 1053, 1058 (D.Kan.1984) (\u201cthe Tenth Circuit would adopt the position that \u00a7 1132 is an exclusive jurisdictional grant and that to sue for equitable relief under ERISA a plaintiff must be a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary\u201d); <em>Amalgamated Industrial Union Local 44-A Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Webb, </em>562 F.Supp. 185, 187 (N.D.Ill.1983) (502 is exclusive grant of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Unfortunately, no legislative history is determinative with respect to whether Congress intended section 502 to be an exclusive grant of jurisdiction. It is clear, however, that when Congress intended to provide a civil action for employers with respect to pension plans it knew how to do so. For instance, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">A plan fiduciary, <em>employer, </em>plan participant, or beneficiary, who is adversely affected by the act or omission of any party under this subtitle with respect to a multiemployer plan, or an employee organization which represents such a plan participant or beneficiary for purposes of collective bargaining, may bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>an action for appropriate legal or equitable relief, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">(Emphasis added). Congress\u2019 failure to specifically mention the term \u201cemployer\u201d in section 502 can, therefore, be construed as meaning that Congress intended to exclude employers from the provisions of that section.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States has considered section 502 of ERISA. In <em>Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern California, </em>463 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983), an action by a state entity against a plan, the Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">[t]he express grant of federal jurisdiction in ERISA is limited to suits brought by certain parties, ... as to whom Congress presumably determined that a right to enter federal court was necessary to further the statute\u2019s purposes. It did not go so far as to provide that any suit <em>against </em>such parties must also be brought in federal court when they themselves did not choose to sue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 21, 103 S.Ct. at 2852 (footnote omitted). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">[tjhe phrasing of \u00a7 502(a) is instructive. Section 502(a) specifies which persons\u2014 participants, beneficiaries, fiduciaries, or the Secretary of Labor \u2014 may bring actions for particular kinds of relief. It neither creates nor expressly denies any cause of action in favor of state governments, to enforce tax levies or for any other purpose. It does not purport to reach every question relating to plans covered by ERISA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 25, 103 S.Ct. at 2854 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApK\">ERISA carefully enumerates the parties entitled to seek relief under \u00a7 502; it does not provide anyone other than participants, beneficiaries, or fiduciaries with an express cause of action for a declaratory judgment on the issues in this case. A suit for similar relief by some other party does not \u201carise under\u201d that provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 27, 103 S.Ct. at 2855 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">Accordingly, the aforementioned authorities and the plain language of the statute make clear that Congress intended to limit the parties who could maintain actions pursuant to section 502, that section 502 is an exclusive grant of jurisdiction, and that ERISA does not expressly provide for an action by an employer against a fund for a refund of contributions. We consider below whether such an action can be implied from section 403 of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">This Circuit and the Supreme Court have often considered the implication of private rights of action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cIn evaluating such a claim, our focus must be on the intent of Congress when it enacted the statute in question.\u201d <em>Daily Income Fund, Inc. v.

These \u201cfactors\u201d have more traditionally been reviewed by the standards set forth in <em>Cort v.

Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 3092-94, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985). \u201cThe starting point of the analysis is always the language of the statute,\u201d <em>Marx, </em>747 F.2d at 1544, \u201cparticularly ... the provisions made therein for enforcement and relief. Then we review the legislative history and other traditional aids of statutory interpretation to determine congressional intent.\u201d <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v.

Sierra Club, </em>451 U.S. 287, 294, 101 S.Ct. 1775, 1779, 68 L.Ed.2d 101 (1981)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZr\">The question whether a plaintiff is an intended beneficiary of a statute and the question whether a statute creates enforceable federal rights are related. Invariably, if a statute is found to establish a federal right in favor of the plaintiff, the plaintiff will be an \u201cintended beneficiary\u201d of the statute. However, the converse is not true necessarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 725. \u201c(T]he inference that Congress intended to create legally enforceable rights is strongest when the statutory language focuses unmistakably on a specific and identifiable class of beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726. \u201cAccordingly, an implied cause of action may be found when language in the pertinent statute expresses an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class\u2019 of which plaintiff is a member.\u201d <em>Id. See Cort, </em>422 U.S. at 82, 95 S.Ct. at 2089 (\u201cclearly articulated federal right\u201d or \u201cpervasive legislative scheme governing the relationship between the plaintiff class and the defendant class\u201d is required.). The Court has emphasized attention to the directness of the statutory language in question, <em>Marx, </em>747 F.2d at 1545, where such \u201cright-or duty-creating language\u201d is explicit, <em>Cannon, </em>441 U.S. at 690 n. 13, 99 S.Ct. at 1954 n. 13. Consistently, \u201cthe Court has been especially reluctant to imply causes of actions under statutes that create duties on the part of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>sons for the benefit of the public at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692, 99 S.Ct. at 1955. If the statute grants a class certain rights, then a plaintiff need not necessarily proffer the legislative intent to create a cause of action. <em>Cort, </em>422 U.S. at 82, 95 S.Ct. at 2090. However, where the legislative history evinces an intent to deny such cause of action, that intent is controlling. <em>Id. </em>Where the first <em>Cort </em>factor has not been satisfied, \u201cthe absence in the legislative history of an expressed intent to create a cause of action will be taken as an affirmative indication that none was, in fact, intended.\u201d <em>Marx, </em>747 F.2d at 1546.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Further, when the statute specifically provides certain remedies the courts should not expand the statute to encompass other remedies. <em>Cort, </em>422 U.S. at 82 n. 14, 95 S.Ct. at 2090 n. 14. <em>Marx, </em>747 F.2d at 1545. However, when the proposed remedy is \u201cnecessary or at least helpful to the accomplishment of the statutory purpose, the Court is decidedly receptive to its implication under the statute.\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>441 U.S. at 703, 99 S.Ct. at 1961 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The Ninth Circuit, while recognizing that \u201c[s]ection 403 confers no such right expressly; it merely <em>permits </em>the return of contributions mistakenly paid,\u201d has held that section 403 of ERISA creates an implied right of action in favor of an employer. <em>Award Service, </em>763 F.2d at 1068. First, the court concluded that the 1980 amendments to section 403 were \u201cclearly designed for the benefit of employers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With respect to the other <em>Cort </em>factors, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">Second, a congressional intent to create a private remedy in favor of the employer is implicit in Section 403(c)(2)(A)(ii). Without such a remedy, the decision to return contributions mistakenly paid would be left solely to the interested trustee. Third, implying a private right of action furthers the congressional scheme of permitting restitution of contributions paid by mistake when equitable factors militate in favor of such restitution. Finally, no principle of federal-state comity renders a federal cause of action inappropriate; Congress preempted all state law regarding employee pension benefits effective with contributions made after January 1, 1975.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\"><em>Id. </em>With respect to the nature of this implied right of action, the court held that the employer \u201cwill have to establish that the equities favor restitution\u201d and that \u201c[a] principal equitable consideration is whether restitution would undermine the financial stability of the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1069; <em>Chase v. Trustees of Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund, </em>753 F.2d 744, 753 (9th Cir.1985).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Another court has reached the opposite conclusion. <em>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal, </em>549 F.Supp. at 311. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">In this case, there is no evidence of Congressional intent to create a cause of action for restitution in favor of employers. Employers were not the group for whose special benefit the statutory scheme was enacted. The statute specifically enumerates other private causes of action yet conspicuously does not list employers within the group of persons entitled to maintain a cause of action. ERISA and the 1980 MEPPA amendments were designed specifically to provide pension benefits for long-time employees and their beneficiaries. No Congressional intent can be discerned to benefit employers as a category.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-12\">The legislative history of section 403(c)(2)(A)(ii), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(2)(A)(ii) (Supp. IV 1980) does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>not indicate that the expansion of the circumstances under which excess contributions could be returned to employers was intended to create a right to such contributions. The language of the statute itself is entirely permissive. It states merely that fiduciaries are not prohibited from returning to an employer contributions made by mistake of fact or law. Congress apparently chose not to use the word \u201cmay,\u201d a word which might suggest, arguably, a direction to the trustees to take affirmative steps to determine and return mistakenly made contributions, or direction to the Secretary of Labor to promulgate implementing regulations. However, the use of the phrase, \u201care not prohibited\u201d expresses an intent to allow, but not require the trustees to return contributions if they choose to do so, as an exception to their strict fiduciary duties to maintain the funds for the benefit of employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">On its face then, the statute imposes no requirement on the trustees to return mistaken contributions. To impose such a requirement by implication would violate the underlying statutory scheme. ERISA\u2019s primary purpose is to protect the integrity of the pension funds for the benefit of employees and their beneficiaries. To that end, fund fiduciaries are strictly required to discharge their duties solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104. To impose a right to restitution in favor of employers could severely undermine the funds\u2019 integrity. Mistaken contributions, once invested, may be just as essential to the funds\u2019 integrity and stability as non-mistaken contributions. The statutory language itself recognizes this by allowing and not requiring a fiduciary to disgorge the funds. ERISA surely did not intend to impose the risk of mistaken contributions on the funds, particularly since the employer is in the best position to monitor the amount of its own contributions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 311-12. <em>See Hardy v.

Ash, </em>that the beneficiary was a party intended to be benefited by the Act and that state law did not bar the implied action due to ERISA\u2019s preemptive effect. <em>Id. </em>at 3092. The Court fqund, however, that Congress did not intend to authorize remedies other than those specifically listed in section 502. \u201cWe are reluctant to \u2018fine-tune\u2019 an enforcement scheme crafted with such evident care as the one in ERISA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3093. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">[t]he six carefully-integrated civil enforcement provisions found in \u00a7 502(a) of the statute as finally enacted, however, provide strong evidence that Congress did <em>not </em>intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly. The assumption of inadvertent omission is rendered especially suspect upon close consideration of ERISA\u2019s interlocking, interrelated, and interdependent remedial scheme, which is in turn part of a \u201ccomprehensive and reticulated statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Id.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">The legislative history of section 403, prior to the 1980 amendment, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1r\">Since the assets of the employee benefit plan are to be held for the exclusive benefit of participants and beneficiaries, plan assets generally are not to inure to the benefit of the employer.

(For example, an employer may have made an arithmetical error in calculating the amounts that were to be contributed to the plan.) Also, if an employer contributes to a plan on the condition that the plan is tax-qualified or on the condition that a current tax deduction is allowed for the contribution, and it is later determined that the plan is not qualified (or the deduction is not allowed), the contribution can be returned if the plan provides for it. In this case, the contribution can be returned within one year after the disallowance of qualification or deduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">H.R. Conf.Rep.

It was the primary intent of Congress that employers not benefit from the assets of a plan. That an employer might benefit from that subsection does not establish a federal right and to so hold would ignore the thrust of ERISA and its purposes. Second, there is no indication of legislative intent to create a remedy other than that specifically set out in section 403. The administrator may return a contribution if the administrator finds that a mistake was made. Further intervention on the part of the courts may implicate meddling in the administrator\u2019s exercise of his fiduciary duties. Third, in light of section 502, it would be inconsistent with ERISA to imply a right of action. Fourth, the fact that regulating pension plans is an area of peculiarly federal concern, does not require implication of a private right of action in favor of an employer. \u201cWhere the first three <em>Cort </em>factors indicate that no cause of action was intended, the mere fact that this legislation is in an area not traditionally relegated to state law cannot change this result.\u201d <em>Marx, </em>747 F.2d at 1550.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Accordingly, Whitworth has no implied right of action pursuant to Section 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Whitworth also asserts that the district court had jurisdiction of this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 because Whitworth\u2019s contract claim for restitution is governed by federal common law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This argument is premised on the assertion that the contract between the parties, the pension plan and incorporated provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, and the rights and remedies implicit therein or necessary to the enforcement thereof, are governed by federal law.

Lueck, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985), the Court held that section 301 preempted a state claim for bad faith handling of an insurance claim by the plaintiffs employer and insurer. State law contract claims are preempted \u201cwhen resolution of a state-law claim is substantially dependent upon analysis of the terms of an agreement made between the parties in a labor contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1916. The Court focused on whether state law \u201cconfers nonnegotiable state law rights on employers or employees independent of any right established by contract, or, instead, whether evaluation of the [state law] claim is inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">In this case, Whitworth\u2019s claim is that both plaintiff and defendant Central States are parties to, and are bound by the terms of, the trust agreement and the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement incorporated therein. Whitworth claims to have made payments to Central States in excess of Whitworth\u2019s contractual obligations, and claims that, in light of those specifically delineated obligations, equity requires the refund of overpayments. Consideration of this claim inevitably requires interpretation of the documents executed by the parties and the provisions made therein for payment and refund of contributions. It is uncontested that the benefit plan in question is covered by ERISA, and it is likewise clear that Whitworth\u2019s claim \u201crelates to\u201d such plan. Accordingly, it is clear that federal, and not state, law applies to Whitworth\u2019s claim based on the contracts between the parties.

We join these courts in recognizing that contract claims like Whitworth\u2019s are governed by federal law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">It is clear that Whitworth\u2019s claim, governed by federal common law, arises under federal law for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. In <em>Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, </em>406 U.S. 91, 92 S.Ct. 1385, 31 L.Ed.2d 712 (1972), the Court squarely held that \u201c\u00a7 1331 jurisdiction will support claims founded upon federal common law as well as those of a statutory origin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 92 S.Ct. at 1391. Thus, since Whitworth\u2019s action for restitution is governed by federal common law, it \u201carises under\u201d federal law for purposes of \u00a7 1331. Accordingly, the district court erred in concluding that it had no jurisdiction over the case. <em>See Northeast Department ILGWU, </em>764 F.2d at 154-59.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">. Defendants will hereinafter be referred to coi-lectively as \"Central States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(5), (6) provides for actions by the Secretary of Labor. Subsection (d)(1) provides that \"[a]n employee benefit plan may sue or be sued under this subchapter as an entity.\u201d Subsection (d)(2) provides that \"[a]ny money judgment under this subchapter against an employee benefit plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in his individual capacity under this subchapter.\" Subsection (e)(2) provides for venue and subsection (g)(1) provides for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\">. In the context of ERISA\u2019s unique jurisdictional provisions, the questions of whether the court has jurisdiction and wheth\u00e9r a party states a claim are intertwined. Section 502(e)(1) grants jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to section 502(a). Accordingly, if a party states a claim pursuant to subsection (a), the court has jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (e). The converse also appears to be true. <em>See Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co. v. Teamsters Pension Fund of Philadelphia, </em>549 F.Supp. 307, 309 (E.D.Pa.1982), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>720 F.2d 661 (3rd Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b305-12\">. This subsection was amended in 1980. The statute, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(2)(A), previously provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">In the case of a contribution which is made by an employer by a mistake of fact, paragraph (1) shall not prohibit the return of such contribution to the employer within one year after the payment of the contribution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b305-19\">. This court and others have held, however, that an employer may maintain an action under ERISA when the employer falls within the statutory definition of a \"fiduciary.\u201d <em>Great Lakes Steel v.

We have reached a similar conclusion with respect to a \"plan,\u201d another party not specifically mentioned in section 502(a). <em>Saramar Aluminum Co. v.

However, the standing question is certainly analytically distinct from the questions of failure to state a claim and lack of jurisdiction. \"The standing doctrine limits the judicial power of the federal courts to parties who demonstrate \u2018injury in fact.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>Allstate Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wayne County, </em>760 F.2d 689, 692 (6th Cir.1985). Pursuant to the standards set out in <em>Allstate </em>and the cases cited therein, it appears clear that an employer who mistakenly pays contributions on behalf of employees which he is not contractually obligated to pay is injured in fact by the trust fund\u2019s refusal to return the contributions, and, therefore, satisfies the requirements of the standing doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">. In <em>Michigan United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union </em>v. <em>Baerwaldt, </em>572 F.Supp. 943 (E.D.Mich.1983), a fund sued the state insurance commissioner for a declaratory judgment that a state statute was preempted. The district court apparently found that jurisdiction existed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1337, but also found that \"ERISA gives plaintiffs an independent basis for suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 946. The court noted that plans or funds are not among the parties enumerated in section 502 and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac2\">[wjhile participants, beneficiaries, and fiduciaries who might otherwise not clearly have standing to bring suit in federal court to enjoin violations of the Act are the only parties addressed, I do not believe the provision\u2019s language should be read to exclude a non-fiduciary plan itself from suing for an injunction, and obtaining federal jurisdiction by presenting a question arising under ERISA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayv\"><em>Id. </em>at 947. The court specifically approved the <em>Fentron </em>analysis, <em>id. </em>at n. 7, while recognizing that its discussion of jurisdiction was unnecessary in light of the addition of the trustees to the action, giving rise to ERISA jurisdiction under section 502 since the trustees were fiduciaries, <em>id. </em>at n. 6. In reversing on the preemption ground, we made no reference to the jurisdictional issue. 767 F.2d 308 (6th Cir.1985). In light of this court\u2019s disposition of the case and the acknowledgment by the district court that jurisdiction was proper because of the addition of the trustees as proper parties, the <em>dicta </em>in <em>Baerwaldt </em>need not be given much deference. Additionally, we have previously indicated that the provisions of section 502 may be limiting. <em>Authier v. Ginsberg, </em>757 F.2d 796, 801 n. 9 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 208, 88 L.Ed.2d 177 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451(a)(1), (c) is inapplicable to this case, and not cited by the parties, since that section only creates an action based on acts or omissions under subtitle E, subchapter III, of the statute.

The Court noted that section 502 is very different from section 301 of the LMRA. While section 502 limits claims and, thereby, jurisdiction, by reference to the particular party, relief sought, and nature of the action, section 301 is much broader. However, the Court noted that even the scope of section 301 is not unlimited. <em>Id. </em>at 25 n. 28. Section 301 only requires reference to the contract in question to resolve the jurisdictional issue. That section grants jurisdiction over \"[s]uits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter____\u201d <em>See Tuvia, </em>717 F.2d at 731; <em>Laborers Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund v.

With respect to section 403, the court held that \"[Ilegit\u00edmate concerns about the stability of the trust fund can be resolved by only allowing restitution when the refund would not affect the fund\u2019s stability.\" <em>Id. </em>at 750.
