City of Tulsa, </em>415 U.S. 697, 94 S.Ct. 1228, 39 L.Ed.2d 693 (1974); <em>In re Little, </em>404 U.S. 553, 92 S.Ct. 659, 30 L.Ed.2d 708 (1972)). Because we find that the appellant\u2019s conduct rose to this level of misbehavior, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">This appeal presents the question whether appellant, Chokwe Lumumba, Esq., was properly held in criminal contempt on two counts. The first contempt citation occurred during the jury voir dire of a lengthy criminal trial in which Lumumba represented one of the codefendants when Lumumba, in the presence of a venireman, declined to obey an order of the court to \u201cbe quiet and sit down.\u201d The second occurred during the course of the trial and was issued after a number of remarks that, to say the least, were disrespectful of the judge, if not downright insulting to him. With regard to each count, the trial judge, Kevin Thomas Duffy, cited Lumumba at the time the conduct occurred, but final adjudication and sentencing was deferred until after the trial\u2019s conclusion. At that time, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 42(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 (1982), Judge Duffy summarily adjudicated Lumumba in criminal contempt and referred the matter to the Assignment Committee pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules for the Division of Business Among Southern District Court Judges for transfer to another judge for sentencing. <em>United States v. Shakur, </em>570 F.Supp. 336 (S.D.N.Y.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">After denying various motions brought by Lumumba, <em>United States v. Lumumba, </em>578 F.Supp. 100 (S.D.N.Y.1983), Judge Robert W. Sweet sentenced Lumumba to three years\u2019 probation with the condition that he perform 350 hours of community service during the first fifteen months of the probationary term. On appeal, this court reversed and remanded. 741 F.2d 12 (2d Cir.1984). We held that where a lawyer is cited for criminal contempt during trial, but adjudication and punishment are deferred until after trial, he is entitled to notice and a hearing pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 42(b), although not necessarily a \u201cfull-blown\u201d trial, before a judge other than the trial judge. <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">On remand, Judge Sweet held that formal notice of the charges was unnecessary since Lumumba had actual notice, that Lu-mumba was not entitled to a jury trial, and that Lumumba could address the appropriateness of his own conduct, but not the alleged bias of the presiding judge. 598 F.Supp. 209 (S.D.N.Y.1984). In accordance with the directions of this court, 741 F.2d at 17, Lumumba was given \u201ca reasonable opportunity to defend or explain his actions or present arguments in mitigation\u201d in a hearing before Judge Sweet. 603 F.Supp. 913, 914 (S.D.N.Y.1985). Lumumba was again convicted of criminal contempt on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>both counts and received the same sentence as before, except the community service is to be performed during the first eighteen months of the probationary term.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The criminal trial at which Lumumba made the comments that are at issue here concerned the so-called Brinks armored-car robbery at Nanuet, New York, and ran from April 4 to September 3, 1983. Lumumba\u2019s client, Bilal Sunni-Ali, was acquitted, although four of the five co-defendants with whom he was tried were convicted as accessories after the fact to armed robbery or of participation in a racketeering enterprise that involved a series of armored truck robberies, two murders, and the prison escape of Black Liberation Army leader Joanne Chesimard, <em>see generally United States v. Ferguson, </em>758 F.2d 843 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 124, 88 L.Ed.2d 102 (1985). We agree with Judge Duffy that \u201cMr. Lumumba ... demonstrated from the start of the trial his conscious desire to obstruct and disrupt the orderly trial of the six defendants on trial____not [as] part and parcel of a vigorous defense of his client but instead [intentionally] to cause significant disruption of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Shakur, </em>570 F.Supp. at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Preliminarily, we note that it is useful for analytical purposes to divide the forms of misconduct in the courtroom by attorneys that are punishable by contempt into three general categories \u2014 (1) refusal to obey a proper court order or proper court procedures; (2) disrespectful remarks to the court, opposing counsel, or other parties; and (3) excessive or repetitive argumentation or other willful delay of the proceedings. The first contempt charge here falls into the first category since it involves disregard of court orders and the second contempt charge falls into the second category because it concerns disrespectful remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">We have little difficulty with the first contempt citation. During the jury voir dire in the mid-morning of April 13, 1983, Lumumba first appeared as co-counsel, with Lynne F. Stewart, Esq., on behalf of defendant Sunni-Ali. Shortly thereafter he orally moved to strike the entire jury panel, a motion which had just been denied when made by another attorney. The motion was denied and the court advised Lumum-ba to put the motion in writing, a procedure to which the court had required all defense counsel to adhere, and stated that the written motion would be made a part of the record. Lumumba persisted in his attempt to make his motion orally, and when the judge attempted to move on to the peremptory challenges Lumumba first accused him of unwillingness to hear the defendant\u2019s contentions and then stated that \u201cwe think perhaps you will continue to taint, to pollute the jury.\u201d When the court excused a black prospective juror who stated that she could not decide the case fairly and impartially solely on the evidence given in court, Lumumba contended that the judge\u2019s action was precipitous and accused him of being inconsistent in his treatment of white and black veniremen. When the court noted that Lumumba had not been present for earlier voir dire and ordered him to \u201csit down,\u201d Lumumba refused, stating, \u201cThat\u2019s the way you give dogs and children instructions,\u201d and insisted he had other \u201cappropriate\u201d motions to make. Finally, later in the day, when, in accordance with the customary practice in the Southern District, the judge was questioning a prospective juror, Lumumba interrupted and attempted to continue to argue matters upon which the court had already ruled. After Lumumba again ignored several orders of the court to \u201cbe quiet and sit down,\u201d and repeated his charge that the court was unwilling to listen to the defendant\u2019s contentions, Judge Duffy excused the venireman from the courtroom and held Lumumba in criminal contempt. The exchange leading to the contempt citation is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>While a lawyer has the right and duty to argue vigorously all points that he believes are properly advanced on behalf of his client, he must obey a direct order of the court, such as an order to cease argument, no matter how arbitrary he may believe it to be. <em>Maness v. Meyers, </em>419 U.S. 449, 458-60, 95 S.Ct. 584, 590-92, 42 L.Ed.2d 574 (1975); <em>In re Weiss, </em>703 F.2d 653, 660 (2d Cir.1983). Justice Jackson stated the law with his typical clarity and succinctness in <em>Sacher v. United States, </em>343 U.S. 1, 9, 72 S.Ct. 451, 455, 96 L.Ed. 717 (1952):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-4\">Of course, it is the right of counsel for every litigant to press his claim, even if it appears farfetched and untenable, to obtain the court\u2019s considered ruling. Full enjoyment of that right, with due allowance for the heat of controversy, will be protected by appellate courts when infringed by trial courts. But if the ruling is adverse, it is not counsel\u2019s right to resist it or to insult the judge \u2014 his right is only respectfully to preserve his point for appeal. During a trial, lawyers must speak, each in his own time and within his allowed time, and with relevance and moderation. These are such obvious matters that we should not remind the bar of them were it not for the misconceptions manifest in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Lumumba was not held in contempt for an \u201cearnest request for voir dire,\u201d as he claims in his brief. Rather, he was held in contempt only after he had been repeatedly ordered to sit down and stop rearguing objections upon which the court had already ruled. His direct disobedience of a court order threatened to delay the proceedings, to interfere with jury selection, and, occurring as it did on the first day of his presence in the courtroom, to disrupt the orderly proceeding of the trial. As the Seventh Circuit explained in the \u201cChicago Seven\u201d conspiracy case, \u201cfailure to heed the directive of the court to desist from arguing, to sit down, or to remain quiet may indeed constitute an actual material obstruction to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Seale, </em>461 F.2d 345, 371 (7th Cir.1972). Any other result would create chaos in the courtroom; while surely \u201c[a] certain amount of leeway must be allowed,\u201d <em>id., </em>when the directive is clear and counsel understands it, he must obey even if he feels his obedience may risk prejudicing his client\u2019s substantive case. Perhaps Lumumba felt it important to establish his defiance of the court and of the judicial system on his very first day in court. At the same time, it was important for the judge to set the pace and tone of the trial and Lumumba, by ignoring a repeated explicit order of the court, clearly obstructed the progress of the voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-18\">The second contempt citation is of a different nature, as it concerns disrespectful remarks rather than disobedience of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>court order. While such remarks or insults should be discouraged so as to preserve a rational thought process in the courtroom, <em>see Disorder in the Court </em>at 149, it is sometimes difficult to draw a line between a comment that is merely disrespectful and one that should be punished as contemptuous for obstructing and imminently threatening the administration of justice under <em>In re Williams, </em>509 F.2d at 960. <em>See also Seale, </em>461 F.2d at 369-70 (improper for a court to slide easily from a finding of disrespect to one of subverting and preventing justice). The Court in <em>Little, </em>404 U.S. 553, 92 S.Ct. 659, also warned against trial judges\u2019 confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction of the administration of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 92 S.Ct. at 660. Although courts cannot uphold the contempt if the cited conduct is not contumacious but other uncited conduct is or has been, <em>Eaton, </em>415 U.S. at 698-99, 94 S.Ct. at 1229-30, a court can nevertheless look at the cited conduct in the context of other closely related behavior in the case to determine if that conduct is in fact contumacious. <em>See United States v. Martin-Trigona, </em>759 F.2d 1017, 1025-26 (2d Cir.1985); <em>In re Dellinger, </em>461 F.2d 389, 401 (7th Cir.1972); <em>Seale, </em>461 F.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">While a written record, even when supplemented, as here, by comments of the trial judge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of course cannot convey the tone of remarks and the physical action or body language accompanying them, nevertheless the appellate court can get the flavor of the trial proceedings from an extended reading of the transcript, which we have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">The specific conduct which prompted the second citation occurred on June 8, 1983, during the making of an offer of proof at the court\u2019s behest outside the presence of the jury or a witness. The offer of proof concerned the alleged FBI attempt to destroy the Black Liberation movement and kill people in it, a matter the court had previously ruled as not relevant. The specific remarks Lumumba uttered were \u201c[a]nother point is I would like some kind of ruling on why you won\u2019t let me do what you let them do and then have the audacity to sit on the bench and claim you are fair.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>While a single isolated remark \u201c \u2018must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice\u2019\u201d to be punishable as contemptuous, <em>see Eaton, </em>415 U.S. at 698, 94 S.Ct. at 1229 (quoting <em>Craig v. Harney, </em>331 U.S. 367, 376, 67 S.Ct. 1249, 1255, 91 L.Ed. 1546 (1947), seen in the light of Lumumba\u2019s prior courtroom conduct, his remark amply justifies a finding of criminal contempt. In Judge Duffy\u2019s recited findings of contempt of September 6, 1983, as amended September 7, he quoted from the transcript other prior examples of Lumumba\u2019s conduct which support the inference that he was making a calculated insult to the judge. <em>Shakur, </em>570 F.Supp. at 342-46. During the course of the trial Lumumba made the following comments to the court: \u201cYou\u2019re not concerned about whether he\u2019s telling the truth\u201d; the judge had \u201cgranted every objection they made and overruled everyone we made. Are you trying to be fair about this?\u201d; \u201cThey don\u2019t need another prosecutor, Judge\u201d; \u201cJudge, is it possible that you could testify as the witness?\u201d; \u201cYou haven\u2019t been fair at this point, why should we take it that you are trying to be fair now. This kind of silly sobbing, patronizing, condescending appeal to the press is ridiculous. There is no way in the world you have been fair\u201d; \u201cAnything that\u2019s come out of this trial has been a response to the ridiculous way that you have been trying to chill people since you first got here, but I will continue to represent this man.\u201d Judge Duffy also noted the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-6\">Mr. Lumumba: Why are you sustaining that objection, Judge? I thought I could inquire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-7\">The Court: Why don\u2019t you look it up in the books?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-8\">Mr. Lumumba: Well, which books were you referring to? Not the ones I have read. I probably finished higher in my law school than you did and they don\u2019t deal with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-9\">(Tr. 2281.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-10\">Mr. Lumumba [out of the presence of the jury]: Did they tell you that you had to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-11\">Mr. Litt [the Government prosecutor]: Your Honor, among other things, could you ask Mr. Lumumba not to sit in the jury box while he asks questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-12\">The Court: Get out of there. Come on. Look, Mr. Lumumba, it doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest bit, but your disrespect for this court is absolutely incredible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-13\">Mr. Lumumba: Well, Judge your disrespect for Black people is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-14\">The Court: No, no. Get up and get back to where you were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-15\">Mr. Lumumba: You have been performing like an outstanding bigot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-16\">The Court: Not in the slightest bit. Mr. Lumumba: That\u2019s what all bigots say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-17\">The Court: Get out of the jury box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-s\">Mr. Lumumba: You have this little puppet on a string up on the stand and you don\u2019t want him asked questions no mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>ter what the questions are and then you have the audacity to\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">(Tr. 2283-84.) Finally, on June 8, 1983, just prior to his cited remarks, Lumumba called the judge \u201ca disgusting bigoted partial joke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Our search of the transcript reveals a few other examples of Mr. Lumumba\u2019s conduct, occurring prior to the second contempt citation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-7\">The Court: Mr. Lumumba\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">Mr. Lumumba: When I get finished you can talk. When I get finished making my record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">The Court: I will talk when I want to, Mr. Lumumba.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-10\">The Court: I will tell you what, Mr. Lumumba. You are just trying to bait me, and apparently you get some kind of pleasure out of that. But I don't really care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-11\">Mr. Lumumba: I am trying to squeeze some justice out of you. I am trying to squeeze some justice out of you. If you will just give a little bit of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-12\">(Tr. 1477-78.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-13\">Mr. Lumumba: Can you explain the basis for that ruling for us, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-14\">The Court: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-15\">Mr. Lumumba: You don\u2019t have a basis or you are just acting as if you don\u2019t know what we are talking about? Which one is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-16\">The Court: You are a graduate of law school, You look it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-17\">(Tr. 1616.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-18\">The Court: Mr. Lumumba, please, be good enough to sit down and be quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-19\">Mr. Lumumba: The other point is that you talk about hearsay. You allow hearsay in, presumably, under some type of connection with conspiracy that has not been established yet and those things, I think, were inappropriate and we would look for a better performance from the court in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-20\">(Tr. 1619.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-21\">Mr. Lumumba: In addition to that, I would object to the questions that the court asked. I think that the U.S. Attorney has enough people at the table to do their job. You don\u2019t have to help them, so those are the objections I would raise. Showing bias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-23\">(Tr. 1725-26.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-24\">Mr. Lumumba: I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-25\">The Court: I don\u2019t care whether you object or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-26\">Mr. Lumumba: I know you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t care about anything we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-27\">The Court: Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-28\">Mr. Lumumba: Don\u2019t tell me to sit down. I haven\u2019t finished yet. I am telling you that we have [a] right to have argument on the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-29\">The Court: Argument on what matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-30\">Mr. Lumumba: You can\u2019t summarily excuse a juror without some argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-31\">The Court: Why not? Would you want to tell me how I can keep the juror here who is not going to get paid for four or five months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-32\">(Tr. 1977.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-33\">Mr. Lumumba: I am just saying that if the people who are sitting out in the audience are laughing in this court, it may not be because we are doing anything that is a sham; they might suspect that the court\u2019s pretense to be objective\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-34\">The Court: Are we going through this nonsense again? I don\u2019t have to sit and listen to this nonsense any more.

What\u2019s the problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-39\">The Court: Come on. Do you have a question to ask?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-40\">Mr. Lumumba: Well, have you received any money prior to coming here today for your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-41\">Mr. Litt: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-42\">The Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-43\">Mr. Lumumba: What\u2019s wrong with that question, huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-44\">The Court: Next question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-45\">Mr. Lumumba: You\u2019re so smart, you can explain it, I know you can, come on. It\u2019s not relevant to you whether the witness don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s getting paid for the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-46\">The Court: Next question. Come on now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-47\">(Tr. 2314-15.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-48\">Mr. Lumumba: I don\u2019t know what you think you are doing. You are trying to intimidate people. I am here trying a case where a man\u2019s life is at stake. You don\u2019t have enough little threats and in-timidations to discourage me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>The Court: No threats or intimi-dations. I want to tell you something. My father used to tell me that you don\u2019t reprimand the village idiot when he is looking for attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-7\">(Tr. 2391.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Lumumba concedes that the remarks for which he was ultimately held in contempt were not provoked by the judge\u2019s comments quoted above: \u201cYou look it up,\u201d and \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look it up in the books,\u201d or by his reference to \u201cthe village idiot,\u201d which Lumumba claims was a direct reference to him but which the court denied referred to Lumumba. The remarks indicate judicial annoyance with Lumumba, and the use of the term \u201cvillage idiot\u201d was unfortunate, even if, as Judge Duffy stated, he did not actually call Lumumba the village idiot. All three remarks, however, occurred more than five weeks before Lumumba\u2019s cited conduct, and thus that conduct can hardly be explained as provoked by the trial judge. Moreover, while it may be considered in extenuation of the offense and in mitigation of any penalty imposed, \u201cimpropriety on the part of the trial judge cannot justify or excuse contemptuous conduct.\u201d <em>Dellinger, </em>461 F.2d at 401. <em>See also Seale, </em>461 F.2d at 362; <em>United States v. Offutt, </em>145 F.Supp. 111, 114-115 (D.D.C.1956), aff<em>'d as modified, </em>247 F.2d 88 (D.C. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 856, 78 S.Ct. 85, 2 L.Ed.2d 64 (1957); <em>cf. Sacher, </em>343 U.S. at 39, 72 S.Ct. at 469 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Because Lumumba\u2019s cited conduct, in the context of his numerous insults and his judge-baiting, disrupted the orderly administration of the trial, and because he clearly intended such (whether or not as part of a \u201cpolitical\u201d trial strategy), the second citation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Lumumba argues that the admission of the transcript of the trial into evidence in his contempt hearing before Judge Sweet was error. This evidence was admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 902(4) as a certified copy of a public record. It is as such \u201cprima facie a correct statement\u201d of the testimony. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b) (1982). Lu-mumba offers nothing to rebut this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Lumumba also claims that the decision below should be reversed because Judge Sweet denied Lumumba\u2019s motion to call Judge Duffy and the Assistant United States Attorneys who represented the Government at the trial as witnesses at his hearing. Judge Sweet\u2019s action, however, was proper. Lumumba was entitled not to a \u201cfull-blown trial,\u201d but only to \u201ca reasonable opportunity to defend or explain his actions or present arguments in mitigation.\u201d <em>Lumumba, </em>741 F.2d at 17. <em>See Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 499, 94 S.Ct. 2697, 2703, 41 L.Ed.2d 897 (1974); <em>Offutt v. United States, </em>232 F.2d 69, 72 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>351 U.S. 988, 76 S.Ct. 1049, 100 L.Ed. 1501 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">In addition, Lumumba asserts that Judge Sweet violated this court\u2019s prior ruling by acknowledging that he could not disregard entirely Judge Duffy\u2019s findings of contempt. Judge Sweet had the candor to say, perhaps inadvisedly, \u201c[w]ere I to state that I have totally disregarded Judge Duffy\u2019s conclusions, such a statement would not be credible. I have, however, sought to view the issue as best I can solely from the written record and the testimony presented to me.\u201d 603 F.Supp. at 919. We agree with the Government that the comment is commendable for its candor and, as we read Judge Sweet\u2019s opinion, even while he was criticizing the previous opinion of this court (\u201cI continue to believe that this remand was not necessary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 920), he nevertheless made independent findings as to both citations of contempt and thus he acted in compliance with this court\u2019s earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-10\">.

I think this is very relevant, especially for this document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-11\">The Court: We will do it outside the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-12\">Mr. Lumumba: We can do it outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-13\">The Court: Okay, fine. Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time for a break.

The jury is not around, Judge. You don\u2019t have to worry about the jury finding out how the FBI treated the black liberation movement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-19\">The Court: If that\u2019s what we are getting into, it has no place in this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-20\">Mr. Lumumba: Why has it no place in this trial? You are here prosecuting the black liberation movement. It has nothing to do with the way your government treated us in the past, right? It\u2019s insane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-21\">The Court: Tell me what you are attempting to prove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-22\">By Mr. Lumumba:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-23\">Q.

That\u2019s one point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-20\">Another point is I would like some kind of ruling on why you won\u2019t let me do what you let them do and then have the audacity to sit on the bench and claim you are fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-21\">The Court: Look Mr. Lumumba, you have been held in contempt more than once and you are held in contempt again.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
