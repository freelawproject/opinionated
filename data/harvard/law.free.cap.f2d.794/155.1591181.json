That court granted the writ upon a finding that Renzi\u2019s trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>had been so unfair as to amount to a deprivation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On October 7, 1982, Fletcher, a confidential informant, arranged a meeting between Kreitzer, a police official working undercover, and Renzi so that Kreitzer could buy PCP from Renzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">According to Kreitzer, Fletcher drove into a High\u2019s parking lot with Renzi in the front passenger seat. Kreitzer got into the back, and Fletcher drove off. Renzi had a plastic bag containing a green plant-like material, and Renzi and Kreitzer negotiated for the sale of two \u201ccans\u201d of PCP by Renzi to Kreitzer. Renzi measured the requested amount, placed it in another plastic bag, and gave it to Kreitzer. In return, Kreitzer paid Renzi $100 as Renzi assured him that the PCP was of excellent quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The entire transaction took no more than two minutes, after which Kreitzer was let out at the parking lot and Fletcher and Renzi drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Renzi took the stand in his own defense and told a very different story. Renzi testified that he had been called by Fletcher and offered a job as a painter. Fletcher picked him up for the purpose, Renzi thought, of taking him to the job site. Fletcher made a stop at a house that was unfamiliar to Renzi, went inside and returned with a container which he placed beneath the driver\u2019s seat. Fletcher then told Renzi that they had to pick up another painter. The third person, of course, was Kreitzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Renzi\u2019s testimony was in general agreement with Kreitzer\u2019s about the meeting in the parking lot and the taking of a two minute ride after which Kreitzer was returned to the parking lot. His version of what happened during that ride, however, differed markedly from Kreitzer\u2019s. He testified that the sale of the two cans of PCP was effected by Fletcher. Renzi\u2019s version was that Fletcher negotiated the sale. Fletcher then reached beneath the driver\u2019s seat and passed a plastic bag to Renzi with instructions to measure out two cans of the vegetable material for Kreitzer. Renzi did that and received $100 from Kreitzer but immediately passed the money on to Fletcher. Thus, according to Renzi, he was not the principal; he only supplied requested manual assistance to Fletcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">Renzi testified that Fletcher never performed his promise of painting employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">During a discovery hearing, Renzi moved to require the Commonwealth to produce the name and address of its confidential informant. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney responded that if any confidential informant had been present at the drug buy, he would be \u201cput under subpoena to appear.\u201d Renzi\u2019s lawyer requested that the informant be produced before trial so that he might be interviewed before testifying. The judge responded to that, expressing confidence that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney \u201ccan work something out to get him here early that morning sometime so you can talk to him. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to talk to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">The Commonwealth did not subpoena Fletcher, but, six days before trial, the Commonwealth gave Renzi\u2019s lawyer Fletcher\u2019s name and an address. Renzi promptly arranged for the issuance of a subpoena, but, on the morning that the trial was to begin, found that the subpoena had been returned marked \u201cNot Found.\u201d Renzi elected to proceed with the trial despite Fletcher\u2019s absence. The lawyer now says that he thought the Commonwealth would still produce Fletcher for examination and cross-examination. He was not produced, and, on hearsay grounds, Renzi was not permitted to testify as to any statements made to him by Fletcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-16\">At a post-trial hearing upon Renzi\u2019s motion for a new trial based upon after discovered evidence, it appeared that Fletcher had been in the drug business. He had experienced a religious conversion and wished to make amends for some of his past transgressions. He became a confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>dential informant and arranged transactions resulting in the arrest of approximately thirty drug dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">At the post-trial hearing, Kreitzer testified that when he gave the address to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney he thought Fletcher was no longer there; he thought Fletcher had left the area, which well might have been the case, but the address he supplied was the last one he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The Commonwealth first contends that Renzi has not adequately exhausted his state remedies, and that the petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus is premature for that reason. It points to the fact that Renzi\u2019s petition for a writ of error charged that the trial court erred in denying a motion for a new trial based upon after discovered evidence. It contends that the identical federal question sought to be presented here was not first presented to the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The contention rests too narrowly upon the caption of the argument presented to the Supreme Court of Virginia and neglects a critical part of its substance. The after discovered evidence that was the foundation of the motion was said to have been the fact that the Commonwealth failed to produce Fletcher during the trial as it had promised, and that it misled Renzi as to Fletcher\u2019s whereabouts. The brief stated all of the relevant facts upon which Renzi relies here. It specifically contended that Renzi \u201cwas denied his due process rights by his inability to get ... [Fletcher\u2019s] testimony.\u201d Finally, there was a citation to <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), in which the Supreme Court had held that when an undercover informer was a participant in, or witness to, a crime and the testimony of the informer would be of substantial help to the defendant, the privilege to withhold disclosure of his identity must give way and a trial without this testimony was so unfair as to amount to a deprivation of due process. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 77 S.Ct. at 629-30. Renzi\u2019s contention was substantially the same as that made in <em>Roviaro. </em>Citation of that case to the Supreme Court of Virginia, coupled with the explicit claim of deprivation of due process, was a sufficient presentation of the federal claim to the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The exhaustion requirement exists, as a matter of comity, to give the state court the first opportunity to adjudicate alleged constitutional defects in its own criminal prosecutions. <em>See Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 518, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1203, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), <em>citing Duckworth v. Serrano, </em>454 U.S. 1, 3, 102 S.Ct. 18, 19, 70 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981) (per curiam). State remedies are sufficiently exhausted when the state court is given a \u201c \u2018fair opportunity\u2019 to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon ... [a] constitutional claim\u201d by fair presentation of the \u201csubstance\u201d of the federal claim. <em>Anderson v. Harless, </em>459 U.S. 4, 6, 103 S.Ct. 276, 277, 74 L.Ed.2d. 3, <em>quoting Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 275-78, 92 S.Ct. 509, 512-13, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The Commonwealth relies upon a narrow reading of <em>Harless. </em>In <em>Harless, </em>the Supreme Court held that state remedies had not been exhausted, though all of the facts underlying the federal constitutional claim had been disclosed, because the petitioner had failed to identify any federal constitutional principle that might be implicated. This case is different, for in addition to disclosure of the facts underlying the federal claim, there was the specific claim of a deprivation of due process and a citation to <em>Roviaro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">We think Renzi sufficiently disclosed his federal claim. He did substantially more than state the bare underlying facts. The claim of a deprivation of due process, coupled with a citation to <em>Roviaro, </em>in which the court held that there had been a denial of federally guaranteed due process upon strikingly similar facts, was enough to have given the state court warning that a federal constitutional claim was being presented. <em>See Graham v. Solem, </em>728 F.2d 1533, 1535-36 (8th Cir.1984) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We reach the merits and affirm the district court\u2019s award of the writ, though with some modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">At the outset, we may recognize that Renzi\u2019s claim of an expectation that Fletcher would support his version of the events seems incredible. Fletcher was engaged in setting up drug dealers for arrest and prosecution. For his cooperation with the authorities, he had immunity from prosecution for his own earlier violations of Virginia\u2019s drug laws, but that immunity would not protect him from a new offense. Moreover, if Renzi is to be believed, Kreitzer, the law enforcement official, was actively engaged with Fletcher in setting up innocent people for arrest and prosecution upon substantially false charges. A serious charge of that nature, though conceivable, is unlikely to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">We, however, are not the fact finders, and this appeal should not be resolved on the basis of our supposition that one set of facts is more probable than another.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The district court accepted the lawyer\u2019s representation that he confidently expected some corroboration of Renzi by Fletcher, corroboration which might be found if Fletcher declined to answer certain relevant questions on the ground of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against self-incrimination. The district court also accepted the lawyer\u2019s representation that when he went to trial knowing that Fletcher was not to be found at the address he had been given, he was nevertheless relying upon the production of Fletcher that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and the trial judge seemingly collectively had promised.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> When the trial opened, the lawyer knew that Fletcher had not been found at the address he had been given, but he did not know that the Commonwealth did not have better information or had made no other arrangements for Fletcher\u2019s production.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney had promised to place Fletcher under subpoena. He did not attempt to do so. The promise was ill kept by giving to defense counsel, six days before trial, Fletcher\u2019s name and an address which Kreitzer knew or thought incorrect. Had defense counsel been told that it was likely that Fletcher had left the area and that the Commonwealth had no information about his whereabouts, he could have initiated his own search for Fletcher. After having procured the arrest and prosecution of so many drug offenders, Fletcher may well have gone into hiding, but the defense was at least entitled to a reasonable opportunity to search for him. The district court reasonably concluded that the conduct of the prosecution deprived the defense of an opportunity to search for Fletcher with the possibility that he might be found and produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">In giving defense counsel what purported to be Fletcher\u2019s address, the defense was misled, and the misleading was intentional, at least on the part of the law enforcement official. The resulting loss of an opportunity to find and produce Fletcher was such unfairness as to amount to deprivation of due process, as the Supreme Court held in <em>Roviaro. See United States v. Pnce, </em>783 F.2d 1132, 1137 (4th Cir.1986); <em>McLawhorn v. North Carolina, </em>484 F.2d 1, 6 (4th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">The district court conditioned issuance of the writ only upon a retrial of Renzi. In that we think it went too far. If Fletcher is an unavailable witness, Renzi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>has been fairly tried once and should not be tried again. We think that issuance of the writ should be conditioned upon a retrial only if, after reasonable opportunity is afforded and cooperation by the Commonwealth provided, the defense is able to locate and produce Fletcher. The decree should be modified to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">With that modification, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\"> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bonilla, </em>615 F.2d 1262, 1264 (9th Cir.1980), is a similar, though distinguishable, case. There the court found no error under <em>Roviaro </em>in the Government\u2019s failure to produce a confidential informant at trial, but it was noted that the defendant never requested that the informant be produced at trial and his presence was not promised. We agree that the Government bears the obligation to exert \"reasonable efforts\" to produce an informant \"only when \u2018his presence had been properly requested by the defendant,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., quoting United States </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>546 F.2d 798, 799 (9th Cir.1976), and that there is no general obligation to corral these government agents. In the instant case, however, reasonable efforts were not exerted and the presence of the witness at trial had been promised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b240-6\">CHAPMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Amu\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">I respectfully dissent. I do not believe the petitioner has exhausted his state remedies, but even if he has done so, I do not think the facts in this case show the deprivation of a right secured by the U.S. Constitution so as to justify the issuance of the Great Writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">In the majority opinion Fletcher is referred to as a \u201cconfidential informant,\u201d but I think this designation is not in keeping with the facts of the case. Fletcher was an informant, and at the time of the drug sale to Officer Kreitzer, the petitioner Renzi did not know that Fletcher was an informant, nor did Renzi know that Kreitzer was a law enforcement officer, but Renzi knew Fletcher. Renzi testified that Fletcher called him on the telephone and offered him a job as a painter, and that Fletcher then picked Renzi up in Fletcher\u2019s automobile. The sale of the drugs took place after Fletcher and Renzi had been joined in the automobile by Kreitzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Renzi was arrested on January 10, 1983, under a warrant alleging that on or about October 7, 1982, he did knowingly and intentionally distribute PCP in violation of the laws of Virginia. A preliminary hearing was held on January 26, 1983. A motion for discovery and inspection was filed, and a hearing was held on February 15, 1983. In response to the request that the Commonwealth attorney produce the confidential informant for interview prior to trial, the record reflects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">THE COURT: Well, if he was present, do you object to giving him the name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfbY\">MR. KIDWELL [Commonwealth attorney]: If he was present I\u2019ll put him under subpoena to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">THE COURT: Is that fair enough?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">MR. MACHEN [Renzi\u2019s attorney]: Yes, Your Honor. That\u2019s what I asked for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2O\">THE COURT: Well, let\u2019s do this, if you would. Number one, let Mr. Kidwell find out if he was present \u2014 and he can convey that to you. If he was in fact present, I don\u2019t know how easy it will be to get in touch with whoever this individual is. But if you can\u2019t work something out beforehand, I\u2019m sure that Mr. Kid-well can work something out to get him here early that morning sometime so you can talk to him. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to talk to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">MR. MACHEN: All right, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">According to the Commonwealth, it provided the name and address of Glendis Fletcher to Renzi\u2019s attorney by telephone on February 24, 1983, and on February 28, 1983, Renzi\u2019s attorney issued a subpoena for Fletcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">The trial began on March 7 and concluded on March 8, 1983. On the morning of the first day of trial, Renzi\u2019s attorney was aware that his subpoena for Fletcher had been returned unserved because Fletcher could not be found. The attorney made no motion for a continuance but elected to proceed to trial knowing that his subpoena had not been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">Officer Kreitzer testified for the Commonwealth and Renzi took the stand in his own defense. While Renzi was being examined by his attorney, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-18\">Q. Do you know a Mr. Glen[d]is Fletcher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-20\">Q. Do you know the officer who testified earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-21\">A. No; not really; from that day there at the parking lot; that\u2019s the only day that I knew him \u2014 knew of him, seen him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Q. Have you seen him since then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">A. Yes; he came to see me in the jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">Q. Tell the jury your involvement with Mr. Fletcher on the day in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">A. I was staying in Falls Church, staying at a friend of mine\u2019s house and Glen[d]is Fletcher called me up and he asked me if I was ready to go to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">MR. KIDWELL: Your Honor, I object to the hearsay unless Mr. Fletcher is here to testify for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Machen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">MR. MACHEN: I think that we should approach the Bench at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">BENCH CONFERENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">MR. MACHEN: Your Honor, I don\u2019t think I have to go into what Mr. Fletcher said at that time and I won\u2019t go into it, but I would like for the record to show that based upon the information that the Commonwealth gave us with regard to Mr. Fletcher\u2019s name and location, we did subpoena him at that location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">He was not found and so he is not able to appear today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">THE COURT: Well, it\u2019s technically hearsay whether in fact he is here or not, and I would note that for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">Your client, of course, can discuss what he did as a result of that conversation, but it\u2019s technically hearsay and I would have to sustain the Commonwealth\u2019s objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">MR. MACHEN: I understand that at this time, your Honor, but I would like the record to reflect that Mr. Renzi was advised that he was not going to be present today and elected to go forward when we found that Mr. Fletcher was not going to appear \u2014 even though he would not appear, so he has made an election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">THE COURT: To go forward, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-17\">MR. MACHEN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">Following the jury verdict of guilty, there was a motion for a new trial based upon the claim that the Commonwealth had failed to keep its promise to produce the confidential informant. At the hearing, Of-fleer Kreitzer was examined by Renzi\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-21\">Q. Did you provide to the Commonwealth Attorney the name and address of your confidential informant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-22\">A. I provided the name and the last address that I had \u2014 yes, sir \u2014 to the Commonwealth Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-23\">Q. Did you state to the Commonwealth that that was \u2014 that is the address of Mr. Glendis Fletcher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-24\">A. I gave him the last known address. I can\u2019t recall the exact conversation I had with him. That\u2019s the last place I knew he was living.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-25\">Q. Okay. At the time that you provided that information to the Commonwealth Attorney, did you in fact know that your confidential informant, Mr. Glendis Fletcher had absconded the area and the state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-26\">A. You will \u2014 -we\u2019d have to back up. He wasn\u2019t my informant. He was \u2014 I used him that day, but he wasn\u2019t working for me per se, and as far as leaving the state, the best of my information was that he was no longer in the area. I don\u2019t know whether he was in or out of the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-27\">Q. When we issued the subpoena, which was immediately after you gave that\u2014 we could look at the court records to see it \u2014 did you in fact know that he had left the area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-28\">A. I knew that he probably did not live \u2014 I had not checked that address, but I don\u2019t know whether he lived there or not. I assumed that he did not from the information I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-29\">Q. And have you discussed this after the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-30\">A. Have I discussed it? I\u2019m sorry\u2014 with who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-31\">Q. Well, who is your other \u2014 is it Mr. Bowman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-32\">A. Mr. Bowers, you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-33\">Q. Bowers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-34\">A. Have I discussed it \u2014 what do you mean? Where he lives?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-35\">Q. Where he lives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>A. No, sir. He\u2019s not my informant; he doesn\u2019t concern me, so I haven\u2019t discussed where he is at or where he lives \u2014 no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">Q. Did you know that that subpoena would not reach him at that address?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbC\">A. Sir, it\u2019s like I said, I had no personal knowledge that he didn\u2019t live there. I had assumed that he did not, because the last I heard, he wasn\u2019t going to be in the area very long after that, but that is, we discussed with you that that was the last known address that I had on him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Following conviction Renzi petitioned for a writ of error in the Supreme Court of Virginia and stated his question as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgX\">Whether or not the court erred in denying the motion for a new trial based upon the after discovered evidence that the Commonwealth had failed to keep its promise to produce the confidential informant after misleading the defendant with regard to the whereabouts of the confidential informant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In the claim for habeas corpus in the United States District Court, the question presented by Renzi was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">Petitioner was denied his right to due process and a fair trial secured by the fifth, sixth, and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution by the unconstitutional failure of the prosecution to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defendant, and that the Commonwealth had in its exclusive possession the name and address of the confidential informant who is integrally involved with, and had arranged, the transaction which resulted in the charges for which the petitioner was tried.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The petitioner and the majority find that the contentions before the Supreme Court of Virginia and this court are substantially the same as those made in <em>Roviaro </em>and that the citation of <em>Roviaro </em>and the claim of deprivation of due process sufficiently presented the federal claim to the state court. I question this reasoning. There is a considerable difference between the question presented to the federal courts and the question presented to the Supreme Court of Virginia, which is a claim of error in denying a new trial based on after-discovered evidence. The Virginia court could have easily decided that this was an abuse of discretion question. It could have also determined that the evidence was not after discovered because Renzi knew and was acquainted with Glendis Fletcher, his attorney knew that the subpoena for Fletcher had been returned \u201cNot Found,\u201d and the attorney advised the trial judge that there was an election to proceed with the trial without the presence of Fletcher. The question presented to the federal courts is clearly a constitutional claim that I do not think has been adequately presented to the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">In <em>Anderson v. Harless, </em>459 U.S. 4, 6, 103 S.Ct. 276, 277, 74 L.Ed.2d 3 (1982), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">In <em>Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270 [92 S.Ct. 509, 30 L.Ed.2d 438] (1971), we made clear that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 requires a federal habeas petitioner to provide the state courts with a \u201cfair opportunity\u201d to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon his constitutional claim. <em>Id., </em>at 276-277 [92 S.Ct. at 512-13]. It is not enough that all the facts necessary to support the federal claim were before the state courts, <em>id., </em>at 277 [92 S.Ct. at 513], or that a somewhat similar state-law claim was made. (Circuit Court citation omitted). In addition, the habeas petitioner must have \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state courts the \u201csubstance\u201d of his federal habeas corpus claim. <em>Picard, supra, </em>at 275, 277-78 [92 S.Ct. at 512, 513]. Cf. <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 518, [102 S.Ct. 1198, 1203, 71 L.Ed.2d 379] (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">I do not think that Renzi\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court of Virginia gave that court the fair opportunity required by <em>Anderson </em>to apply the controlling legal principles to the facts of his constitutional claim, and I would remand with instructions to the district court to dismiss under <em>Rose v. Lundy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">This case is much different from <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). In that case the accused did not know the identity of the informant, the prosecution repeatedly refused to disclose the identity of the undercover informant, and the trial court denied all of the motions of the accused to have the informant identified. Renzi\u2019s trial attorney had only to ask his client for the identity of those persons in the automobile at the time of the drug sale. Renzi was acquainted with Fletcher, so this is not a case in which the prosecution is trying to hide the identity of a witness. Renzi knew that Fletcher and Officer Kreitzer were the two other people in the car at the time of the sale. I fear that under the majority opinion the government is saddled with the burden of guaranteeing the presence of a witness at trial, even a witness hostile to the defendant. The Commonwealth attorney at the motions hearing did not promise to produce the witness; he stated he would put him under subpoena if the witness were present during the transaction. The government could not subpoena Fletcher if he had left the area and his whereabouts were unknown. Is there to be pretrial detention of witnesses to guarantee their appearance?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The government did not mislead Renzi\u2019s attorney, but gave to the attorney the last known address of Fletcher. Since Fletcher had set up the sale from Renzi to Kreitzer, it would have strengthened the prosecution\u2019s case to have Fletcher present to testify. The majority opinion finds incredible Renzi\u2019s claim of an expectation that Fletcher would support his version of the sale, and I join in this finding. This claim by Renzi is just as difficult to swallow as that of his attorney that he expected some corroboration of Renzi by Fletcher, which corroboration might come if Fletcher decided to invoke the fifth amendment protection against self-incrimination. This is nothing more than speculation. A defendant may hope that a government witness will invoke the fifth amendment, and he may hope that the effectiveness of the government witness may be neutralized or destroyed by cross-examination, but this hope does not ripen into a constitutionally protected right. A party does not have a constitutional right to call a witness just so the witness can invoke the fifth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">What has Renzi been denied other than the opportunity to interview a witness who was never called, who in all probability would have been hostile to Renzi\u2019s case, and whose presence would have strengthened the government\u2019s case? In the three years since trial, Renzi has made no showing that, if present, Fletcher would have aided Renzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">It appears to me that this is an obvious case of sandbagging the trial judge. Ren-zi\u2019s attorney on the morning of trial knew that his subpoena for Fletcher had been returned \u201cnot found,\u201d and with Renzi\u2019s help, he could determine whether or not Fletcher was in the courtroom. He made no motion for a continuance but elected to proceed into the trial without saying anything to the trial judge about his unsuccessful efforts to locate Fletcher. He reinforced this election to proceed rather than to move for a continuance when there was a hearsay objection during Renzi\u2019s testimony. An intelligent election was made, and Renzi should be required to abide by the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">This election to proceed knowing that Fletcher would not be present was an obvious trial strategy, and a good one under the circumstances. Without Fletcher\u2019s testimony, there would simply be the word of Kreitzer against that of Renzi. The jury still found Renzi guilty, and he claims a constitutional denial resulted from his election to proceed to trial. I do not think our court should encourage such an obvious ploy. If Renzi and his attorney actually believed they had been misled by the prosecution, they were careful not to mention it until after the jury found Renzi guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">On Page 159 the majority makes reference to certain representations from Ren-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>zi\u2019s attorney that were accepted by the district court. If these are meant to be findings of fact, I would find them clearly erroneous because they are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">I can find no constitutional violation, and I would deny the writ and reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
