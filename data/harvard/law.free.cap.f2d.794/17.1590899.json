Holden of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, which dismissed two class actions brought on behalf of social security disability applicants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first case, <em>Day v. Bowen, </em>No. 85-6315 (hereafter <em>Day), </em>involved the proceedings on remand from the Supreme Court in <em>Heckler v. Day, </em>467 U.S. 104, 104 S.Ct. 2249, 81 L.Ed.2d 88 (1984). On remand, the district judge vacated his injunction, which had imposed 90-day deadlines for reconsideration determinations and administrative hearings reviewing denial of social security disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq. The judge also concluded that <em>Heckler v. Day </em>foreclosed any other form of class-wide relief and dismissed the class action. In the second case, <em>Barnett v. Bowen, </em>No. 85-6252 (hereafter Barnett), Judge Holden also vacated an injunction which had created a 90-day deadline for administrative hearings following denial of disability benefits under Title XVI of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq. He denied further class-wide relief and dismissed the class action. Because we believe that <em>Heckler v. Day </em>does not foreclose all class-wide relief, we reverse those portions of the district court\u2019s orders that deny all class-wide relief and dismiss the class actions. We remand to the district court for further consideration of appropriate remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">The complicated facts underlying these lengthy proceedings are described in our two earlier opinions, <em>Day v. Schweiker, </em>685 F.2d 19 (2d Cir.1982) and <em>Barnett v. Cali-fano, </em>580 F.2d 28 (2d Cir.1978), and in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Heckler v. Day, </em>supra. We set forth below only those facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>essential to an understanding of the appeals now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Plaintiffs in <em>Day </em>are a class of applicants for Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits under Title II of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq. They challenged delays in two stages of the four-step administrative review process for disability claims. That process begins with a state agency\u2019s initial determination of eligibility, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 421(a); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1503; if declared ineligible, the claimant may request a de novo reconsideration of the initial determination. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.907-404.921. If the reconsideration determination is adverse, the claimant is entitled to a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (AU). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.929-404.961. The claimant can appeal an AU\u2019s decision to the Appeals Council of the Department of Health and Human Services. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.967-404.983. After exhausting these four steps, the claimant can seek judicial review in federal district court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Day </em>involved delays in issuing reconsideration determinations and in scheduling hearings. Plaintiffs relied on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b), which entitles OASDI claimants to \u201creasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing\u201d after an adverse determination. The district court certified a statewide class of applicants who experience \u201can unreasonable delay in the scheduling of and/or issuance of decisions in reconsidera-tions and fair hearings.\u201d Finding that delays of more than 90 days for both recon-siderations and hearings violated section 405(b), the district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff class. The court then imposed mandatory 90-day deadlines for both reconsideration determinations and hearings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and provided for payment of interim benefits if certain deadlines were exceeded. This court affirmed. 685 F.2d 19 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Thereafter, the Supreme Court reversed. <em>Heckler v. Day, </em>supra. In his opinion for the majority, Justice Powell relied on \u201cCongress\u2019 continuing concern that mandatory deadlines would subordinate quality to timeliness, and its recent efforts to ensure the quality of agency determinations,\u201d 467 U.S. at 117, 104 S.Ct. at 2257, to strike down the 90-day time limits. The Court held that \u201c[i]n light of the unmistakable intention of Congress, it would be an unwarranted judicial intrusion into this pervasively regulated area for federal courts to issue injunctions imposing deadlines with respect to future disability claims.\u201d Id. at 119. In a footnote, reproduced in full in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court stated that \u201cnothing in this opinion precludes the proper use of injunctive relief to remedy <em>individual </em>violations of \u00a7 405(b).\u201d Id. at 119 n. 33 (emphasis in original). The Court vacated the decision of this court and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. Id. at 119. This court thereafter summarily remanded the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\"><em>Barnett, </em>which was begun in 1974 (several years before Day), challenged similar delays in scheduling hearings to review adverse reconsideration determinations for applicants for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability benefits, pursuant to Title XVI of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>seq. Plaintiffs claimed that these delays violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(1), which states that \u201c[t]he Secretary shall provide reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing,\u201d the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the due process clause. District Judge Coffrin certified a statewide class of \u201call present and future applicants for SSI disability benefits whose initial claims are denied ... and who subsequently request a reconsideration hearing.\u201d Finding violations of section 1383(c)(1) and the APA, he ordered the Secretary to schedule hearings within 90 days of requests by SSI claimants and also provided for payment of nonrefundable benefits if this time limit was exceeded. This court affirmed the judgment except as to the payment of non-refundable benefits. 580 F.2d 28 (2d Cir.1978). Neither side sought review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Turning now to the decisions before us on this appeal, the district court on remand in <em>Day </em>vacated its injunction setting mandatory time limits. As to alternative forms of relief, Judge Holden stated that \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s disapproval of class-wide deadlines on future disability claims casts a shadow upon the finding of class-wide unreasonable delays in reconsideration determinations and hearings.\u201d The district judge denied any class-wide relief and dismissed the action. Citing footnote 33 of the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Heckler v. Day, </em>he indicated that plaintiffs should proceed individually. Several days later, Judge Holden also granted the Secretary\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and dismiss the class action in <em>Barnett. </em>He found plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to distinguish <em>Barnett </em>from <em>Day </em>unpersuasive and, accordingly, declined to fashion alternative class-wide relief. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The principal issue on appeal is the extent to which the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Heckler v. Day </em>precludes class-wide relief in these cases, either explicitly or by implication. Appellants characterize that opinion as deciding only the narrow issue of the validity of mandatory time limits in the administrative review process. They maintain that the Court did not disturb the district court\u2019s determination that section 405(b) requires reasonably prompt hearings and reconsiderations and that the delays suffered by plaintiffs in this case were unreasonable. Accordingly, they argue that <em>Heckler v. Day </em>does not foreclose class-wide relief other than time limits and that, by failing to grant alternative declaratory and injunctive relief to the classes, the district court misinterpreted the Court\u2019s mandate on remand. Appellants contend that the Court\u2019s opinion is not based on principles of deference to the Secretary\u2019s administrative discretion, and that such discretion, in any event, does not preclude other forms of class-wide relief. They propose various alternative remedies, including notice to individual claimants informing them of their rights and reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Appellee Secretary, on the other hand, maintains that <em>Heckler v. Day </em>requires that all actions alleging delay in the adjudication of Title II and Title XVI benefits proceed on an individual basis. Appellee reads the opinion, with particular emphasis on footnote 33, to indicate that invalidation of mandatory deadlines bars all class-wide relief in these cases, since class-wide relief cannot take into account differences in facts and circumstances in individual cases. The Secretary also claims that the alternative forms of class-wide relief proposed by appellants rely on the prohibited time limits to define the class and its rights. Appellee argues that the only way to give form and content to the reasonableness requirement on a class-wide basis is through the use of mandatory time limits. Finally, the Secretary contends that, like time limits, the alternative remedies proposed by appellants would jeopardize the quality and uniformity of agency decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">We agree with appellants\u2019 view of <em>Heckler v. Day. </em>That opinion does not foreclose all class-wide relief designed to minimize unreasonable delays in processing Title II and Title XVI claims. It nowhere</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>addresses the validity of class-wide relief other than mandatory deadlines. In fact, the Court narrowly framed the issue to be decided, indicating that it granted certiorari \u201cto consider whether it is appropriate for a federal court, without statutory authorization, to prescribe deadlines for agency adjudication of Title II disability claims and to order payment of interim benefits in the event of noncompliance.\u201d 467 U.S. at 110, 104 S.Ct. at 2253. See also id. at 105, 104 S.Ct. at 2251 (\u201cThe question presented is the validity of an injunction ... that requires the Secretary ... to adjudicate all future disputed disability claims ... according to judicially established deadlines\u201d). The Court stated that the Secretary did not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that hearings must be held in a reasonable time or that the delays encountered by plaintiffs violated that requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id. at 111 &amp; n. 15,104 S.Ct. at 2253 &amp; n. 15. As Justice Marshall commented in dissent, \u201cthe District Court\u2019s declaratory judgment that the plaintiff class is entitled to relief is not at issue.\u201d Id. at 120, 104 S.Ct. at 2258. See also id. at 121, 104 S.Ct. at 2259 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (the Court\u2019s review was limited to equitable remedy imposed by the district, court); <em>Martinez v. Califano, </em>No. 73 C 900 (EHN), slip op. at 4-5 (E.D.N.Y. May 28, 1985) (because the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment was undisturbed by the Supreme Court, other class-wide relief was allowed). Contrary to the Secretary\u2019s argument, footnote 33 is not a categorical rejection of class-wide relief. The footnote merely makes clear that injunctive relief would still be an appropriate remedy for individual cases involving unreasonable delays, despite the fact that \u201cabsolute periods of limitations applicable to all claims,\u201d 467 U.S. at 119 n. 33, 104 S.Ct. at 2258 n. 33, are now invalid. See <em>Sharpe v. Heckler, </em>No. 79 Civ. 1977 (CSH), slip op. at 11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 1985). Accordingly, we do not believe that footnote 33 requires all claimants seeking relief from delays in the administrative review process to press their claims only on an individual basis, as the district court found.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Under the circumstances, we think that the Court intended to do no more than it claimed to, namely, decide the validity of the district court\u2019s mandatory deadlines. Indeed, it specifically indicated that its decision was limited to this question. See 467 U.S. at 119 n. 33, 104 S.Ct. at 2258 n. 33. We deem it unlikely that the Court would make the important decision to bar class actions in this context by implication, particularly since it allowed class relief in <em>Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 700-01, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 2557, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979) (ordering prerecoupment hearings for OAS-DI recipients who request a waiver under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(b) and upholding certification of nationwide class of recipients subject to recoupment). We also do not believe that, by vacating the judgment of the district court, the Court intended to disturb findings it had previously referred to as unchallenged or to dismiss the class action. Finally, while not dispositive of this question, we note that neither the Supreme Court nor this court on remand saw fit to dismiss the class action, but instead remanded the case for proceedings consistent with the opinion in <em>Heckler v. Day. </em>See 467 U.S. at 119, 104 S.Ct. at 2258. See also <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 347 n. 18, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 1148 n. 18, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979) (Supreme Court\u2019s prior decision foreclosing the award of benefits did hot prevent the district court, on remand, from ordering notice to class members, advising them of their rights). See generally <em>Avery v. Heckler, </em>762 F.2d 158, 163 (1st Cir.1985) (remand order does not usually deprive district court of jurisdiction or require dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">More troubling is the Secretary\u2019s argument, described above, that, even if <em>Heckler v. Day </em>did not address the question of class-wide relief, its prohibition on mandatory deadlines makes definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the class difficult, since \u201cunreasonable\u201d must be defined in relation to some specific time frame. Appellee is correct that the class in <em>Day </em>was defined with reference to unreasonable delays; it encompasses</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">[a]ll present and future Vermont residents seeking ... Social Security disability benefits who, following an initial determination ... that no disability exists, experience an unreasonable delay in the scheduling of and/or issuance of decisions in reconsiderations and fair hearings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">467 U.S. at 107-08, 104 S.Ct. at 2252. However, we do not agree that use of the term \u201cunreasonable delay\u201d in the class definition conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s prohibition on mandatory deadlines as a remedy for unreasonable delay. As discussed above, the Court did not disturb the district court\u2019s conclusion that unreasonable delays violate the statute or its finding of such delays in the case before it. Accordingly, it would still be appropriate to define a class to include all applicants who may experience unreasonable delays in violation of sections 405(b) or 1383(c)(1), despite the fact that the point at which delays become unreasonable may vary with the facts and circumstances of individual cases. We realize that this definition may pose some difficulty for the Secretary in identifying class members, see <em>Crosby v. Social Security Administration, </em>Civil Action No. 81-674-MA, slip op. at 2 (D.Mass. Aug. 21, 1985), but a suitable method of identification seems feasible and should be resolved on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We also note that the class in <em>Barnett </em>was defined without reference to unreasonable delays; the class certified by Judge Coffrin includes \u201call present and future [Vermont] applicants for SSI disability benefits whose initial claims are denied on a finding that no disability exists and who subsequently request a reconsideration hearing.\u201d Under the <em>Barnett </em>class definition, it would be easy for the Secretary to identify class members; all Title II applicants who request a hearing are readily identifiable. Furthermore, since the district court found unreasonable delays pervaded the administrative review process, see, e.g., <em>Heckler v. Day, </em>467 U.S. at 111 n. 15, 104 S.Ct. at 2253 n. 15, the likelihood that claimants may experience extensive delays may make it particularly appropriate to define the class broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">We disagree with appellee\u2019s contention that all of the alternative remedies proposed by appellants necessarily resurrect the prohibited mandatory deadlines. Similarly, since the Court did not reach the argument that the district court had intruded upon the Secretary\u2019s discretion to adopt rules and procedures for the adjudication of claims, 467 U.S. at 118-19, 104 S.Ct. at 2257, we reject the Secretary\u2019s objection to alternative remedies on that ground. A violation of plaintiffs\u2019 rights having already been established, appellants are clearly entitled to declaratory relief. The district court also has a duty to fashion appropriate injunctive relief, using its broad equitable powers. See, e.g., <em>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, </em>402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1275, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). But see <em>Williams v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 63 (8th Cir.1984) (summarily ordering dismissal of SSI class action in light of <em>Heckler v. </em>Day). The Secretary could, of course, introduce evidence of the administrative burden such relief would impose, which the district court should take into account in exercising its discretion with respect to any remedial orders. Although we are remanding to the district court to design appropriate class-wide relief, we will briefly review here various alternatives suggested to us.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The first of these is to require the Secretary to notify all class members of their individual right to reconsideration and hearings in a reasonable time. While ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>mittedly not as effective as mandatory deadlines, such a notice would be of assistance to the class, most of whom \u201care not represented by counsel and are unaware of what remedies they have to challenge unreasonable delays in the disposition of their claims.\u201d <em>Martinez v. Califano, </em>supra, slip op. at 5. In <em>Martinez, </em>Judge Nickerson ordered the Secretary to provide notice to claimants awaiting hearings advising them of procedures available in the event of unreasonable delay. Slip op. at 5. See also <em>Blankenship v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>No. C 75-0185-L(A), slip op. at 4 (W.D.Ky. March 20, 1986) (also requiring notice). Indeed, notice is probably the remedy most likely to facilitate individual suits of the type referred to approvingly in footnote 33 of <em>Heckler v. Day. </em>We anticipate that the parties will work out the specific form and timing of the notice on remand, subject to the district court\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Status reports would also be useful to identify particular instances of delay. See <em>Sharpe v. Heckler, </em>supra, slip op. at 12-13 (ordering parties to work out consensual reporting); <em>Caswell v. Bowen, </em>Civ. No. 76-25, slip op. at 3-4, (D.Me. Jan. 16, 1986) (ordering Secretary to report statistical information). Since appellants do not provide us with a detailed plan for this relief, we recommend to the district court the approach taken by Judge Haight in <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, slip op. at 13-14, and suggest that the parties arrive at some sort of consensual reporting requirement which could also serve as the basis for giving particularly delayed cases priority and expedited treatment. If agreement cannot be reached quickly, however, it would be within the district court\u2019s power to order the filing of reports, the establishment of priorities and the expediting of delayed cases on an individual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the orders of the district court in relevant part, and remand the cases for consideration of appropriate class-wide relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-10\">. These cases were also consolidated on appeal with <em>Chagnon </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>792 F.2d 299. Due to the distinct nature of the facts and issues raised by that case, it will be the subject of a separate opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\">. The district court\u2019s order exempted reconsideration determinations and fair hearings from the 90-day deadline in certain specified circumstances. See <em>Heckler v.
