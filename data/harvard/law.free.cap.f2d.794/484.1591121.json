WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">In this case we must decide whether a property owner, holding title pursuant to a forclosure sale under a second deed of trust, can obtain redemption reimbursement for preredemption payments to a senior lienor. We reverse the district court\u2019s conclusion that the property owner is collaterally estopped from seeking reimbursement. But we affirm its conclusion that the property owner failed to comply with valid Treasury Regulations in seeking reimbursement. We hold that, despite this noncompliance with reimbursement procedures, the government\u2019s title upon redemption is encumbered by the first deed of trust until it reimburses the property owner for his payment to a senior lienor.</p>\n<p id=\"AOW\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b565-16\">Detailed factual background information is presented in this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Little v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 1100 (9th Cir.1983). Key facts and proceedings through the prior appeal are summarized in the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-17\">In this appeal, Little seeks to enforce his right to receive reimbursement from the government for payments made to a senior lienor. On the previous appeal, we remanded the determination of the correct amount of the government\u2019s redemption tender under the Second Trust Deed foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-18\">The district court heard argument on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. Based on stipulated facts, it found that Little had failed to follow Treasury Regulation \u00a7 301.7425-4(b)(4) in requesting reimbursement for his purchase of the First Trust Deed. It concluded also that he was estopped from claiming reimbursement as a result of adverse rulings on this issue in two prior district court proceedings. Judgment was entered for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">Little timely appealed. He presents these issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-20\">(1) Did the district court err in concluding that redemption price determinations in related district court actions barred further claims for reimbursement of payments to a senior lienor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-21\">(2) Is Treasury Regulation \u00a7 301.7425-4(b)(4) invalid as applied by the district court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-22\">(3) Did the district court err in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider reimbursement for Little\u2019s payments to a senior lienor because Little had failed to follow procedural requirements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-23\">(4) Is the government\u2019s title free and clear of any claims of Little?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>(5) Must the government reimburse Little for the value of removing the First Trust Deed encumbrance from its title?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A8HC\">I. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Section 7425(b) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a non-judicial sale of real property to which the government claims a title derived from enforcement of a lien \u201cshall ... be made subject to and without disturbing such lien or title, if notice of such lien was filed ... more than 30 days before such sale and the United States is not given [written] notice [at least 25 days prior to] such sale____\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(b)(1). Both the First Trust Deed and Second Trust Deed foreclosures and sales at issue here were such non-judicial sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">When Section 7425(b) applies, Section 7425(d)(1) gives the government a right to redeem the property within 120 days. The amount to be paid under such redemption is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(d). 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Under Section 2410(d), the redemption price \u201cshall be the sum of \u2014 (1) the actual amount paid by the purchaser at such sale ... (2) interest on the amount paid ... and (3) ... expenses necessarily incurred____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">Treasury regulations implementing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(d) provide that the amount to be paid under a Section 7425(d) redemption is to include \u201cthe amount, if any, of a payment made by the purchaser ... after the foreclosure sale to a holder of a senior lien (to the extent provided under paragraph (b)(4) of this section).\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.7425-4(b)(l)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">Paragraph (b)(4) of the Regulations establishes the procedure by which the purchaser at a foreclosure sale can claim reimbursement from the government for payments made to a senior lienor after the foreclosure sale but prior to the government\u2019s redemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">II. <em>Collateral Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"ArMB\">Little initiated two related actions regarding this property while the prior appeal to this court was pending. In April 1982, Little filed a complaint in California Superior Court for declaratory relief and an equitable lien, alleging that the government was enriched by $76,000 due to repair expenses ($16,000) and the foreclosure sale on the First Trust Deed ($60,000). He sought to have the sale rescinded or declared null and void. The action was removed to federal district court and was dismissed without prejudice in June 1982. <em>Little v. United States, </em>No. CV 82-2679, slip op. (C.D.Cal. June 30, 1982). Little did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>not appeal or attempt to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In August 1982, Little filed an action in federal district court, <em>Little v. United States, </em>No. CV 82-4303, slip op. (C.D.Cal. Dec. 21, 1982), seeking the same declaratory and equitable relief. Again, he alleged that the government was unjustly enriched by his repair expenses and the foreclosure of the First Trust Deed. The action was dismissed with prejudice. The court found that Little had been paid the appropriate amount upon the government\u2019s redemption of the Second Trust Deed (purchase price plus interest). He did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On remand in this action, the district court found that the issue of the correct government reimbursement for Little\u2019s payment to a senior lienor had been raised by Little in these two earlier proceedings. The court concluded that because it had already ruled that Little was fully paid, Little was estopped from asserting any further claims in the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Whether collateral estoppel is available is a mixed question of law and fact in which the legal issues predominate. We review this question de novo. <em>Davis &amp; Cox v. Summa Corp., </em>751 F.2d 1507, 1519 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Collateral estoppel bars relitigation of issues actually litigated and necessarily determined by a court. <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979). The party asserting estoppel bears the burden of pleading and proving the identity of issues decided in the previous action. <em>Hernandez v. City of Los Angeles, </em>624 F.2d 935, 937 (9th Cir.1980). Here, the government \u201cmust introduce a record sufficient to reveal the controlling facts and pinpoint the exact issues litigated in the prior action.\u201d <em>Davis &amp; Cox, </em>751 F.2d at 1518.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The record indicates that the issue actually litigated in the two prior actions was whether to nullify the First Trust Deed foreclosure sale, not whether the government\u2019s tendered redemption under the Second Trust Deed was adequate to reimburse Little for his purchase of the First Trust Deed (prior to the foreclosure sale on the First Trust Deed). \u201cSimilarity between issues is not sufficient; collateral estoppel is applied only when the issues are <em>identical.\" Shapley v. Nevada Board of State Prison Commissioners, </em>766 F.2d 404, 408 (9th Cir.1985) (emphasis added). The district court\u2019s statement in 82-4303-WMB that Little had been appropriately paid upon redemption by the government makes this a close question.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">\u201cNecessary inferences from the judgment, pleadings and evidence will be given preclusive effect.\u201d <em>Davis &amp; Cox, </em>751 F.2d at 1518. But if there is doubt, collateral estoppel will not be applied, especially if the previous decision could have been rationally grounded on an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 1518-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">We find that the government did not carry its burden of showing that the two previous dismissals necessarily decided the issue of the government\u2019s proper redemption reimbursement of Little\u2019s payment to a senior lienor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">III. <em>Validity of Treasury Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWJ\">Little did not challenge the validity of the Treasury Regulations in district court. Issues not raised below will generally not be considered on appeal. <em>Grauvogel v. Commissioner, </em>768 F.2d 1087, 1090 (9th Cir.1985). We conclude that this case falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>within one of the narrow exceptions for exercising discretion to hear such an issue. <em>See Bolker v. Commissioner, </em>760 F.2d 1039, 1042 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cissue presented is purely one of law and ... the pertinent record has been fully developed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Little claims that <em>Equity Mortgage Corp. v. Loftus, </em>504 F.2d 1071 (4th Cir.1974), establishes a substantive right under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(d) to receive reimbursement for payments made to a senior lienor. He claims that this statutory right to reimbursement cannot be limited by requiring compliance with procedural regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7805(a), \u201cthe Secretary or his delegate shall prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this Title____\u201d Little argues that, because Congress did not explicitly direct the Secretary to promulgate regulations implementing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(d) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(d), the Treasury Regulations here are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Regulations promulgated under the Secretary\u2019s authority in Section 7805(a) \u201cif found to \u2018implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner,\u2019 must be upheld.\u201d <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>411 U.S. 546, 550, 93 S.Ct. 1713, 1716, 36 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973) (quoting <em>United States v. Correll, </em>389 U.S. 299, 307, 88 S.Ct. 445, 449,19 L.Ed.2d 537 (1967)). The courts are \u201cnot in the business of administering the tax laws of the Nation.\" <em>Id. </em>That task has been delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7805(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">\u201cTreasury Regulations \u2018must be sustained unless unreasonable and plainly inconsistent with the revenue statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commissioner v. Portland Cement Co., </em>450 U.S. 156, 169, 101 S.Ct. 1037, 1045, 67 L.Ed.2d 140 (1981) (quoting <em>Commissioner v. South Texas Lumber Co., </em>333 U.S. 496, 501, 68 S.Ct. 695, 698, 92 L.Ed. 831 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Little has not shown that the procedures for requesting reimbursement are unreasonable or that requiring documentation for reimbursable expenses is plainly inconsistent with the redemption statutes. His challenge to the validity of the Treasury Regulations as applied here is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">IV. <em>Compliance with Treasury Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">The district court found that Little had failed to follow regulatory requirements in seeking reimbursement for his payments to a senior lienor. Little does not claim that his request satisfied the various requirements of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.7425-4(b)(4)(ii). Instead, he argues that these \u201cprocedural regulations\u201d could not divest the district court of its duty on remand to determine the factual issues relevant to the correct amount of the government\u2019s redemption payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">Little suggests an unusually strict application of the general rule that \u201c[o]n remand, a trial court may not deviate from the mandate of an appellate court.\u201d <em>In re Beverly Hills Bancorp., </em>752 F.2d 1334, 1337 (9th Cir.1984). On remand a trial court may consider issues not decided by the appellate court \u201cexplicitly or by necessary implication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. EEOC, </em>691 F.2d 438, 441 (9th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">Here, we could not decide in the previous appeal the correct amount to be paid by the government to redeem the Second Trust Deed. The question of Little\u2019s compliance with procedural requirements for requesting reimbursement for payments to a senior lienor was left open by our mandate. The district court\u2019s consideration of this issue was within the scope of the remand and did not vary or exceed our mandate. <em>See In re Sanford Fork &amp; Tool Co., </em>160 U.S. 247, 255-56, 16 S.Ct. 291, 293, 40 L.Ed. 414 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">Little\u2019s assertion that the district court was required to ignore the Treasury Regulation procedures in considering the amount-of-redemption issue is without merit. We are aware of no authority in support of such a novel twist on the law of the case doctrine. The district court properly concluded that Little had failed to comply with the procedural requirements govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ing his request for reimbursement of a payment made to a senior lienor.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Y. <em>Application of the Law of the Case Doctrine to Previous Determinations of Government Title</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Finding that Little failed to comply with valid Treasury Kegulations in seeking reimbursement does not end our inquiry. His noncompliance with reimbursement procedures does not mean that the government\u2019s tendered redemption automatically conveyed clear title to the property, free of any encumbrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">It is necessary to determine the government\u2019s interest in the property based on its tendered redemption under the Second Trust Deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In the previous appeal, we affirmed the district court as to the status of the government\u2019s title upon redemption and after foreclosure. <em>Little v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 1100, 1108 (9th Cir.1983). We take this opportunity to resolve an apparent inconsistency between our prior holding and that of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">That court apparently overlooked an important fact in determining the status of the government\u2019s title. The government\u2019s title after redemption under the Second Trust Deed <em>was subject to the First Trust Deed. </em>The court erred when it concluded that the government\u2019s title was \u201cfree and clear\u201d of any encumbrances after the Trust Deed foreclosure and sale. The government\u2019s title remained subject to the First Trust Deed. Section 7425(b) does not require or permit the destruction of this First Trust Deed when the nonjudicial foreclosure sale was held without proper notice to the government. It provides only that such sale \u201cshall ... be made subject to and without disturbing [the government\u2019s] lien or title.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">In the prior appeal we correctly held that \u201cthe <em>title acquired by the United States </em>upon its redemption of the property [under the Second Trust Deed] <em>was not disturbed </em>by the subsequent [First Trust Deed] foreclosure and sale of the property.\u201d <em>Little, </em>704 F.2d at 1107-08 (emphasis added). However, we failed to recognize explicitly that the government\u2019s title upon redemption <em>was subject to the First Trust Deed </em>and remained so encumbered after the First Trust Deed foreclosure (of which the government had no notice). We must interpret our prior holding to mean that the government\u2019s title was <em>not </em>\u201cfree and clear\u201d of encumbrances (specifically the First Trust Deed).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">This interpretation is compelled by the nature of our prior remand. We recognized Little\u2019s claim for reimbursement of the \u201c$60,000 [Little paid] to obtain the beneficial interest in the first deed of trust, <em>a senior encumbrance on the property which was not extinguished by the </em>[Second Trust Deed] <em>foreclosure sale.\u201d Id. </em>at 1108 (emphasis added). We understood that the government obtained an <em>encumbered </em>title upon redemption and that the subsequent First Trust Deed foreclosure, invalid as to the government, left that encumbered title undisturbed. <em>Id. </em>at 1107-OS. This conclusion should be read as a correction of the district court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that the government title was \u201cfree and clear\u201d after the First Deed foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">We find that the government\u2019s title upon redemption under the Second Trust Deed was subject to the First Trust Deed. The subsequent foreclosure of the First Trust Deed and sale (invalid as to the government for lack of notice) did not disturb this title. The government\u2019s title remained subject to the First Trust Deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>VI. <em>Government\u2019s Interest Upon Redemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\">The final question is what property interest was acquired by the government upon redemption. Because Little failed to comply with reimbursement procedures, the \u201ccorrect\u201d redemption amount is equal to the purchase price plus interest and excludes any payments to a senior lienor. The property interest redeemed and acquired by the government is equivalent to that held by Little after the Second Trust Deed foreclosure: title to the property, subject to the First Trust Deed. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(d)(3)(C); Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.-7425-4(c)(3); <em>Olympic Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association v. Regan, </em>648 F.2d 1218, 1220 (9th Cir.1981) (when redeeming under \u00a7 7425(d), the government takes subject to encumbrances existing at the time the redemptionee acquired the property). This encumbered title is unaffected by the subsequent First Trust Deed foreclosure and sale of which the government had no notice. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(b)(1). The \u201ccorrect\u201d redemption amount does not convey clear title to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The government may now obtain unencumbered title only by reimbursing Little for his payments to a senior lienor. <em>See </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.7425-4(b)(4)(iii) (IRS discretion to reimburse \u201cupon the resolution of the disagreement as to the amount properly payable\u201d); <em>Loftus, </em>504 F.2d at 1078 (where government made original tender under good faith belief that payments to senior lienor need not be reimbursed, government should be given reasonable period after decision upon remand to perfect its original redemption tender).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Despite our holding on the issue of Little\u2019s compliance with Treasury Regulations, the government\u2019s title upon redemption under the Second Trust Deed is encumbered by the First Trust Deed until it reimburses Little for his payments to the holder of that First Trust Deed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We find that the district court erred in concluding that collateral estoppel barred Little\u2019s claim for reimbursement. However, it was correct in holding that Little failed to comply with regulatory procedures in requesting reimbursement for his payments to a senior lienor.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Although Little\u2019s request for reimbursement for senior lienor payments was improper, the government\u2019s title upon redemption is not unencumbered, but is subject to the First Trust Deed. To obtain a clear title, it must reimburse Little in the amount of $60,000 for his payments to the senior lienor.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Each party shall bear its own costs for this appeal.

We concluded that the factual record was inadequate to decide the correctness of the amount tendered by the government, specifically whether the Second Trust Deed redemption price should include the amount of Little\u2019s post-foreclosure payment to a holder of a senior lien (First Trust Deed). We remanded this matter for further district court proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\">. The relevant parts of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.7425-4(b)(4), involving these reimbursement procedures, are summarized here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the district director of the IRS \"shall, in any case where a [Section 7425(d) ] redemption is contemplated, send notice to the purchaser [prior to the end of the 120-day redemption period] ... of his right ... to request reimbursement ... for a payment made to a senior lienor.\" The purchaser\u2019s request for reimbursement must be \"mailed or delivered to the office specified\" within 15 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">The request for reimbursement \"shall consist of \u2014 (A) [a] written itemized statement ... of the amount claimed [as] payment to a senior lienor, together with the supporting evidence requested in the notice from the [IRS], and (B) [a] waiver or other document that will be effective upon redemption ... to discharge ... or transfer to the United States, any interest in or lien on the property that may arise under local law with respect to the payment made to a senior lienor.\u201d Paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of the Regulations provides also that \u201d[u]nless a request for reimbursement is timely submitted ..., no amount shall be payable to the purchaser ... [for] a payment made to a senior lienor____\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-18\">Under paragraph (b)(4)(iii), a proper request for reimbursement \"shall be considered to be approved for the total amount claimed by the purchaser ... unless the [IRS] sends notice to the claimant ... within [a prescribed time period]. The notification of denial shall state the grounds for denial.\" Upon denial, \u201cthe request for reimbursement for a payment made to a senior lienor shall be treated as having been withdrawn by the purchaser ... and the [IRS] shall tender only the amount otherwise payable [for purchase price, interest and other necessarily incurred expenses].\u201d Where a request is treated as withdrawn, reimbursement for payments to a senior lienor \u201cmay, in the discretion of the [IRS], be made after the redemption upon the resolution of the disagreement as to the amount [of such reimbursement].\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\">. Little contends that the law of the case doctrine <em>required </em>the district court to determine the correctness of the redemption amount tendered and precluded reliance on collateral estoppel. He contends also that the government waived its right to defend based on collateral estoppel and failure to exhaust administrative remedie? by failing to raise these arguments in the prior appeal. He has cited no authority to support either proposition and we have found none. Moreover, collateral estoppel and exhaustion of administrative remedies are affirmative defenses, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c), and must be pleaded in the trial court. Our prior opinion \"should not be read to preclude assertion of the[se] affirmative defenses ... on remand to the district court.\" <em>Hernandez v.
