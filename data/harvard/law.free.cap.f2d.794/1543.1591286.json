Brown, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1612-10\">HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1612-11\">Dees, a federal prisoner, brought this civil rights action against various state and federal defendants, alleging that they gave and suborned perjured testimony, conspired to manufacture evidence against him and withheld allegedly exculpatory evidence from the grand jury in order to procure his conviction. As relief, he seeks an order adjudicating his arrest, conviction and imprisonment \u201csubstantively violative\u201d of his eighth, fifth, and fourteenth amendment rights and monetary damages. Dees previously challenged his conviction by direct appeal and collateral attack but did not raise the issue of knowing introduction of peijured testimony. The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice, to allow Dees to exhaust available remedies attacking the validity of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-15\">The question whether a federal prisoner must exhaust federal habeas corpus remedies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 before bringing a civil rights action challenging the validity of the prisoner\u2019s conviction has been addressed in only one reported decision. <em>See Lathon v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>358 F.Supp. 558, 560 (E.D.La.1973). With regard to similar actions by <em>state </em>prisoners, the rule in this circuit is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARna\">the propriety of a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action is not to be determined solely on the basis of the relief sought, i.e., monetary damages as opposed to relief from confinement, but instead the federal courts must examine the basis of the complaint and determine whether the claim, if proven, would factually undermine or conflict with validity of the state court conviction which resulted in the prisoner\u2019s confinement. If the basis of the \u00a7 1983 claim does go to the constitutionality of the state court conviction, the exclusive remedy is habeas corpus relief with the comity inspired prerequisite of exhaustion of state remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1612-16\"><em>Richardson v. Fleming, </em>651 F.2d 366, 373 (5th Cir.1981). Although federalism concerns are not present in a suit by a federal prisoner, the exhaustion requirement remains because habeas corpus is the \u201cexclusive initial cause of action\u201d where the claim challenges the constitutionality of the conviction. <em>Fulford v. Klein, </em>529 F.2d 377, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>381 (5th Cir.1976), <em>adhered to en banc, </em>550 F.2d 342 (1977). <em>Cf. Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1836, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (\u201cCongress has determined that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement, and that specific determination must override the general terms of [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-5\">Here, Dees clearly is challenging the validity of his conviction: not only does he request that his conviction be declared constitutionally invalid, but proof of his claim would factually undermine his conviction. Congress provided 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 as the appropriate remedy for collateral attack of a federal conviction. Therefore, we hold that a federal prisoner may not bring a civil rights action directed at the validity of the prisoner\u2019s conviction without first exhausting federal habeas corpus remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
