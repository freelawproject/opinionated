CLAYTON v. THE BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF HUDSON COUNTY.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b392-8\">A writ of certiorari, bringing into court the appointing body alone, is not a lawful mode of trying the title of the appointee to a public office which he has actually assumed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-11\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b392-12\">Argued at June Term, 1897, before Justices Dixon and Ludlow.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-13\">For the prosecutor, <em>Leon Abbett </em>and <em>Flavel McGee.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-14\">For the defendants, <em>Allan L. McDermott </em>and <em>Charles L.

It also appears that when this writ of <em>certiorari </em>was issued, Mr. Green was the actual incumbent of the office of director. He is not a party to the present proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Under these circumstances, the real question for decision obviously is, whether the prosecutor of this <em>certiorari </em>or the actual incumbent of the office is legally entitled to the office of director.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The proper mode of raising such a question is by <em>quo warranto </em>proceedings against the incumbent, and not by <em>certiorari </em>to the body which appointed him. <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Freeholders of Camden, </em>18 <em>Vroom </em>454; <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>23 <em>Id. </em>367; <em>Roberson </em>v. <em>Bayonne, </em>29 <em>Id. </em>325.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The writ must be dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
