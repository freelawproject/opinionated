Cas. </em>*143; <em>Howard\u2019s Administrator </em>v. <em>Burgen, </em>4 <em>Dana (Ky.) </em>137.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">In <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Doremus, </em>1 <em>Vroom </em>399, Mr. Justice Vredenburgh, in delivering the' opinion of the court, said that the statute applies only to cases where neither side is to perform within one year, although the case did not necessarily turn upon that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">The contract must, therefore, be regarded as obligatory, and not within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">The plaintiff, at the time of the breach of the contract, was seventy-four years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,700. This, in the opinion of the court, is clearly excessive, and the verdict will be set aside and a new trial granted unless the plaintiff will elect to accept the sum of $1,000.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
