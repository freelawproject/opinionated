The indictment rests upon a supplement to an act entitled \u201cAn act concerning inns and taverns.\u201d <em>Pamph. L. </em>1869, <em>p. </em>409; <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1795. This supplement makes it a misdemeanor to sell any intoxicating liquor from any \u201cambulatory conveyance.\u201d This object, we think, is in nowise expressed in the title of the act to which it is a supplement. The creation of this offence is a general police law, and while its enforcement may be incidentally beneficial to licensed venders, that is not the object of the act within the meaning of the constitutional requirement. Beyond this it has nothing to connect it with the act to which it is made supplemental.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">If there were no \u201cAct concerning inns and taverns,\u201d it would surely never occur to anyone to select such a title as aptly expressive of a legislative purpose to punish whomsoever sold intoxicating drink from a vehicle. As a statutory enactment the supplement falls under the constitutional ban and is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
