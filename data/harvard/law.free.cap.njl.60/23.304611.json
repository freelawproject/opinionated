STONE.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b51-11\">Judgment of nonsuit ends only the suit in which it is entered.

But as long ago as 1827, Chief Justice Ewing held that a judgment of non-suit in a former action between the same parties is no bar to a subsequent action by the same plaintiff against the same defendant for the same cause of action. <em>Snowhill </em>v. <em>Hillyer, </em>4 <em>Halst. </em>38.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">Since that time it has always been held that a nonsuit, unreversed, is not an obstacle to a new suit between the same parties for the same cause of action. <em>Longstreet </em>v. <em>Phile, </em>10 <em>Vroom </em>63.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">The plea is bad, and there must be judgment for the plaintiff upon the demurrer, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
