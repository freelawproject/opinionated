Pirrone, presents us with the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">(1) Did the lower court err when it denied appellant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and applied the presumption of compensability under Article 101, \u00a7 64A(a)(l) to a Workers\u2019 Compensation claim filed by a nearly two-year retired fire-fighter/paramedic who had voluntarily retired for non-medical reasons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">(2) Did the lower court err when it refused to provide requested jury instructions of appellant when it instructed the jury, and/or when it responded to jury questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">(3) Did the lower court err when it denied appellant\u2019s Motions for Judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Finding no error, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Former Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">On 22 May 1990, appellee filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) claiming to have suffered a heart attack because of his many years as a fire fighter. His claim was based upon Article 101, \u00a7 64(a) of Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law which, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>things, provides a presumption of compensability in favor of fire fighters<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suffering from heart related illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">After a hearing officer determined that Article 101 \u00a7 64A(a)(l) covers retired fire fighters, the Commission concluded that \u201c[a]ppellee had sustained an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Appellant then noted an appeal to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Appellant\u2019s subsequent Motion for Summary Judgment was denied. At trial, appellant once again moved for summary judgment after playing for the trial court a <em>de bene esse </em>video deposition of an expert witness, endeavoring to reveal a lack of connection between appellee\u2019s condition and his years as a fire fighter/paramedic. The motion was denied. Appellant then moved to have the case remanded to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. That motion was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The trial court then granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that appellee had suffered an occupational disease as a result of his employment as a fire fighter/paramedic.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Undaunted, appellant journeyed to Annapolis, where, in an unreported per curiam opinion, we declined to decide whether Article 101, \u00a7 64A(a)(l) applied to retired fire fighters but concluded that appellant had presented sufficient evidence to rebut \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption of compensability. We reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">On remand, appellant again moved for summary judgment which was again denied. Following a three day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee. Appellant again noted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Appellee had been a fire fighter/paramedic for various fire departments for twenty-eight (28) years, twenty-one (21) of those years for Montgomery County. In January of 1988, appellee took an early retirement. On 30 October 1989, he suffered a heart attack. At the time of the attack, appellant was working two jobs for approximately 50 to 55 hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In a hearing before the Commission, appellee presented medical evidence from a board certified cardiologist who opined that appellee\u2019s heart attack was precipitated, at least in part, by his years as a fire fighter/paramedic. Appellee\u2019s cardiologist also testified that there was insufficient time between appellee\u2019s retirement and heart attack to account for the level of progression of appellee\u2019s coronary artery disease. In short, appellee\u2019s expert felt that it had taken more than two years for appellee\u2019s condition to ripen into a heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">At the Commission\u2019s hearing, appellant offered no rebuttal evidence, merely asserting that appellee was not covered by Article 101, \u00a7 64A(a)(l). The Commission, however, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">(1) [Appellee] sustained an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of employment, under the provisions of Article 101, \u00a7 64A(a)(l) (heart disease); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">(2) the first date of the disablement was October 30, 1989; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">(3) the disability of [appellant] is the result of the occupational disease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">(4) as a result thereof, was temporarily totally disabled from October 31, 1989 through March 15,1990 inclusive; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">(5) that the employer and insurer shall pay medical expenses in accordance with the Medical Fee guide of this Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">At trial, appellant also produced a board certified cardiologist. Appellant\u2019s cardiologist opined that appellee\u2019s heart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>attack was more likely to have been precipitated by appellee\u2019s continuing elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as appellee\u2019s having been an incessant smoker since he was 18 years old, concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">[Appellee\u2019s] occupation had nothing to do with what was going on in his arteries. No matter what occupation [appellee] had, he was destined to develop coronary artery disease and have a heart attack ... Patients with high cholesterol, patients with cigarette smoking to this degree, have a great risk of developing coronary artery disease and developing a heart attack, as is commonly known, and that is irrelevant to what occupation a patient is in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Predictably, appellee\u2019s cardiologist concluded otherwise. Although he was unable to apportion the role of multiple risk factors such as smoking, elevated lipid levels, and job stress<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the development of appellee\u2019s coronary artery disease, appellee\u2019s cardiologist nonetheless maintained that appellee\u2019s having been a fire fighter/paramedic for 28 years contributed to his eventual heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Appellant first contends that the trial court erred in denying its Motion for Summary Judgment, having mistakenly concluded that Article 101, \u00a7 64A(a)(l) entitled appellee to a presumption of compensability. As this is a question of law, we must determine whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster, </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"A6e\">Article 101, \u00a7 64A(a)(l) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">Any condition or impairment of health of any paid municipal, county, State, airport authority or fire control district, fire fighter or fire fighting instructor caused by lung diseases, heart diseases, or hypertension, and any condition or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>impairment of health * * * caused by heart diseases or hypertension resulting in total or partial disability or death <em>shall be presumed to be compensable under this article and to have been suffered in the line of duty and as a result of his employment </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">According to appellant, as appellee suffered a heart attack after retiring, he was not a <em>paid </em>fire fighter and therefore not entitled to \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption of compensability. We do not agree. To the contrary, after examining \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s legislative history and the relevant opinions of the Court of Appeals, we do not believe appellee\u2019s retirement deprived him of \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s coverage. In fact, we believe the insidious and often elusive nature of occupational diseases compels the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Although the Court of Appeals has recognized that prior to the enactment of \u00a7 64A(a)(l) \u201cheart disease [was] not generally recognized as an occupational disease,\u201d <em>Lovellette v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 284, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983), the enactment of \u00a7 64A evidenced \u201cthe legislature\u2019s clear intention to afford fire fighters ... a presumption that the disease was work related.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In short, \u201cit does not matter how the fire fighter contracted the disabling heart disease or how it first became evident since it is presumptively compensable as an occupational disease[.]\u201d <em>Montgomery Co. Fire Bd. v. Fisher, </em>298 Md. 245, 256, 468 A.2d 625 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">As in the present case, \u201c[w]hen the issue is who must pay compensation, it is the date of [the] last injurious exposure to the hazard of the disease, and not the date of disability that governs.\u201d <em>James v. General Motors Corp., </em>74 Md.App. 479, 486, 538 A.2d 782 (1988) (citing <em>Shifflett v. Powhattan Mining Co., </em>293 Md. 198, 203, 442 A.2d 980 (1980)). Appellant attempts to circumvent <em>James </em>by asserting that appellee was not suffering from coronary artery disease when he retired, and thus was not suffering from an occupational disease at the time of his last injurious exposure. Both cardiologists con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ceded at trial, however, that appellee was suffering from coronary artery disease<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> while still a fire fighter/paramedic.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Even a conclusion that appellee was not suffering from coronary artery disease on his retirement, would be of no avail to appellant. As the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Montgomery County v. Fisher, </em>\u201c[o]nce the presumption of compensability has been applied, the Commission \u2018must then consider whether it has been rebutted by other evidence in the case showing that non-job related factors either caused or contributed, in whole or in part, to [the fire fighter\u2019s] heart disease ____\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">As appellant sees it, in order to be entitled to \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption, appellant must have been employed as a fire fighter/paramedic on 30 October 1989, the date of his last injurious exposure to the hazard of the disease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">We reiterate that the purpose of Article 101 \u00a7 64A(a)(l) was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>to grant fire fighters a presumption that a disability arising from lung and heart diseases was suffered in the line of duty and as a result of their employment [, and to reinforce the notion that] [t]here is general public knowledge that fire fighters in the course of their daily activities, are exposed to inhalation of smoke or noxious fumes and are subjected to unusual stresses and strains (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><em>Soper v. Montgomery County, </em>294 Md. 331, 335-36, 449 A.2d 1158 (1982). Thus, it would be anomalous to hold that appellee is not entitled to \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In appellant\u2019s view, a fire fighter who works for one year and suffers a heart attack is entitled to \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption of compensability, while one who is a fire fighter for 28 years, retires, and then suffers a heart attack, is not. In our view, however, we believe that \u00a7 64A \u201cshould be construed as liberally in favor of [fire fighters] as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u201d <em>Soper, </em>294 Md. at 335, 449 A.2d 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We are mindful that after the last injurious exposure to a hazard and the conclusion of employment the nexus between an occupational disease and an occupation becomes increasingly remote. In our view, however, this simply makes \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption easier to rebut, but in no way renders it inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that appellee is entitled to \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption of compensability.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Appellant next contends that, even assuming \u00a7 64A(a)(l) applies to appellee, the trial court erred in instructing the jury and in dechning to give appellant\u2019s proposed jury instructions. Once again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">We begin by noting that \u201c[a] trial judge is permitted wide discretion as to the form of jury instructions and, absent a clear abuse of that discretion, will not be reversed on appeal.\u201d <em>Blaw-Knox Constr. Co. v. Morris, </em>88 Md.App. 655, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>667, 596 A.2d 679 (1991) (citing <em>Nora Cloney &amp; Co. Inc. v. Pistorio, </em>251 Md. 511, 515, 248 A.2d 94 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Despite appellant\u2019s principal contention that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s instruction treated \u00a7 64A(a)(l) as an irrebuttable presumption and required a complete non-connection to employment,\u201d we find nothing in the trial court\u2019s instruction supporting such a conclusion. As the Court of Appeals pointed out in <em>Montgomery Co. Fire Bd. v. Fisher, supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxL\">both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion remain fixed on the employer; neither ever shifts to the claimant and the presumption constitutes affirmative evidence on the fire fighter\u2019s behalf throughout the case, notwithstanding the production of contrary evidence by the other side.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><em>Fisher, </em>at 257-58, 468 A.2d 625. Viewing the instructions as a whole, <em>See Nora Cloney &amp; Co., Inc. v. Pistorio, </em>251 Md. 511, 515, 248 A.2d 94 (1968), we conclude that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury. In fact, the trial court pointed out to the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">in this case, the employer responsible for [appellee] for his heart disease and resulted [sic] heart attack, assuming you believe these to be predominantly caused by an occupation, is the last employer for whom [appellant] was working when he was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of heart disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">jj\u00ab H* sfc &amp; \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">In this state a paid fire fighter or a paid fire fighter ... who is a covered employee under this title is presumed as a matter of law to have an occupational disease that was suffered in the line of duty and is compensable under this provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Although the trial court did not expressly declare \u00a7 64A(a)(2)\u2019s presumption of compensability to be rebuttable, we think its instructions adequately conveyed to the jury that \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption of compensability imposes \u201cthe burden of persuasion as well as the burden of production of evidence on the party against whom the presumption oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ates.\u201d In other words, \u201cthe opponent of the presumption must do more than come forward with evidence that might support a finding in his favor.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>298 Md. at 257, 468 A.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Although \u201ca litigant is entitled to have [its] theory of the case presented to the jury, [and] a trial court is required to give the requested jury instructions (1) if it correctly states the law, and (2) if the law is applicable,\u201d <em>Rock v. Danly, </em>98 Md.App. 411, 420, 633 A.2d 485 (1993), appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 2 refers to Article 101, \u00a7 23(c)(1),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as requiring that \u201cit must be shown \u2018that it is more probable than not that the disability is causally related to the alleged employment and that no other intervening agency was responsible for the disease.\u2019 \u201d What appellant apparently fails to understand is that \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption of compensability controls. Thus, appellant has not only the burden of presenting evidence to rebut \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption of compensability, but the burden of persuading the jury that appellee\u2019s heart attack did not result from an occupational disease. In short, it \u201cmust do more than come forward with evidence that might \u2018rebut that presumption.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Fisher, supra. </em>To suggest that appellee need show \u201cthat it is more probable than not that the disability is causally related to the alleged employment and that no other intervening agency was responsible for the disease\u201d would impose the burden of proof on the claimant. To do so would run contrary to the holding in <em>Fisher, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Appellant also complains that the trial court erroneously replied in the negative to the jury\u2019s question, \u201cDoes the cause of the disease have to be <em>predominately </em>his occupation?\u201d resorting again to Article 101 \u00a7 23(c)(1), asserting that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>occupational disease must be proven by \u201cthe weight of the evidence ... more than fifty percent more likely so than not so.\u201d We again point out to appellant that an employee\u2019s occupation need be only a factor in order for the employee\u2019s disease to be presumed compensable under \u00a7 64A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give appellant\u2019s proposed jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Appellant finally contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment. We need not linger long here. \u201cIt is well established in Maryland,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that if there is any competent evidence, however slight, leading to support the plaintiffs right to recover, the case must be submitted to the jury and the motion for \u2018judgment\u2019 denied.\u201d <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. McFarland, </em>21 Md.App. 501, 513, 319 A.2d 824 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Appellant once again overlooks \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption of compensability. As the Court of Appeals said in <em>Fisher, </em>\u201cthe presumption constitutes affirmative evidence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the fire fighter\u2019s behalf throughout the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 468 A.2d 625. While there may well be circumstances under which \u00a7 64A(a)(l) would not generate a question of fact, this is not one of them. That is especially so in light of \u00a7 64A(a)(l)\u2019s presumption of compensability and the conflicting testimony of the parties\u2019 cardiologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Although appellant contends that \u201cboth medical experts agreed that [appellee\u2019s] heart disease was caused by his cigarette smoking and high cholesterol and elevated triglycerides,\u201d we find scant support for that contention in the record. To be sure, appellant\u2019s cardiologist adopted that position, but appellee\u2019s cardiologist simply opined that cigarette smoking was but one of several factors leading to appellee\u2019s heart attack. While it may be true that the stress of being a fire fighter/paramedic neither causes or leads to coronary artery disease or heart disease, the legislature has determined otherwise.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Although appell\u00e1nt invites us to revisit the testimony of the cardiologists, we decline to do so. The jury was entitled, as it obviously did, to accept the opinion of appellee\u2019s cardiologist rather than that of appellant\u2019s cardiologist. <em>See Yellow Cab v. Bisasky, </em>11 Md.App. 491, 506, 275 A.2d 193 (weight of medical expert\u2019s testimony is for jury). In short, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that appellee\u2019s coronary artery disease, leading to a heart attack, resulted from his serving 28 years as a fire fighter/paramedic, thus entitling him to compensation under \u00a7 64A(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-9\">.

Appellant attempts to analogize the case at hand to two Connecticut cases involving a statute somewhat similar to Art. 101 \u00a7 64A. In <em>Gorman v. City of Waterbury, </em>4 Conn.App. 226, 493 A.2d 286 (1985) it was held that two widows were not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7-433c because the first widow\u2019s husband was a retired police officer who died from a coronary occlusion six (6) years prior to the enactment of the statute and was not entitled to its retroactive application; and a second widow\u2019s husband who suffered from no hypertensive condition while a member of the police department as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Likewise, the <em>Adams v. City of New Haven, </em>39 Conn.Supp. 321, 464 A.2d 70 (1983), court determined that the same statute did not apply to a police officer who was not regularly employed by the municipal police department either on the date the statute became effective, or on the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">We fail to see any analogy because Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7-433c differs from Article 101 \u00a7 64A. Section 7-433c requires that the death or disability of the covered employee be \u201ccaused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment and was suffered in the line of duty and within the scope of his employment.\u201d Section 64A has no such requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\">.
