Brandywine Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cBrandywine\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellee, sought a special exception to perform sand and gravel mining in Prince George\u2019s County. Following a public hearing, the Examiner recommended approval of the application, subject to certain enumerated conditions. Unhappy with that result, a citizen who resided near the subject area sought review of the Examiner\u2019s decision by the Prince George\u2019s County Council, sitting as the District Council (\u201cthe Council\u201d), appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>When the Council failed to render a decision within the statutorily specified time, the \u201capplication/appeal\u201d was denied by operation of law, pursuant to Prince George\u2019s County Code (\u201cP.G.\u201d), \u00a7 27-132(d)(2)(1991). Thereafter, appellee sought review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, which reversed. The Council has appealed that decision and presents the following contentions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">I. The scope of review by this court is limited to determining that the Council\u2019s decision was fairly debatable and supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">II. The statutory denial is not arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory and was supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The Brandywine property in issue consists of 75.44 acres, located approximately one mile southeast of the intersection of Aquasco Road (Md. Route 381) and Croom Road (Md. Route 382), in southern Prince George\u2019s County (\u201cthe Property\u201d). Predominately wooded, the Property is surrounded by farmland to the north and west, undeveloped woodlands and land that is surface mined to the east and south, and single family residences to the northeast. By grant of a 2.2 acre easement through the property of Phillip and Linda Hutton, the main portion of the Property is connected to Aquasco Road by a haul road. The Property is Open Space (\u201cO-S\u201d) zoned land,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> located within the area encompassed by the County\u2019s Master Plan for Subregion VI, which was approved in 1973. The Master Plan recommends the removal of the vast sand and gravel deposits in southern Prince George\u2019s County, before the land is developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">On November 14, 1989, Brandywine submitted an application for a special exception, seeking permission to use the Property for surface mining of sand and gravel. On June 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>1990, the Technical Staff of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (\u201cPlanning Commission\u201d) issued a Technical Staff Report recommending approval of appellee\u2019s application, subject to certain conditions. At the conclusion of a public hearing on July 11, 1990, the Examiner remanded the case to the Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board (\u201cthe Planning Board\u201d), <em>de novo, </em>with instructions to amend appellee\u2019s application to include the 2.2 acre easement area.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">On May 1, 1991, the Technical Staff of the Planning Commission again recommended approval of appellee\u2019s amended application, subject to certain conditions, including those proposed by the Natural Resources Division of the Planning Commission in its July 1990 Environmental Impact Report. On June 6, 1991, the Planning Board held a hearing concerning appellee\u2019s application, after which, on June 27, 1991, the Planning Board recommended denial of the application, in Resolution No. 91-202. The Resolution provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">WHEREAS, after consideration of the Technical Staff Report and testimony of its regular meeting on June 6, 1991, the Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board disagreed with the staff recommendation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeZ\">WHEREAS, the Planning Board recommendation is based on the following DETERMINATIONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">A. The traffic generated by this request will adversely affect the surrounding neighborhood due to the already dangerous situation posed by trucks on MD 381.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">B. Limited sight distance at the intersection of MD 381 and MD 382 makes the introduction of an additional 300 truck trips on MD 381 a hazard to motorists and pedestrians traversing the intersection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">C. The above traffic concerns are deemed to present such a potential for deleterious impact to the health, safety and welfare of present and future inhabitants of the neighborhood that a denial of the application is warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Thereafter, a hearing was held on July 16, 1991 before the Examiner, at which opponents and proponents of the application testified. On September 22, 1992, the Examiner issued his decision, recommending approval of the application, subject to twenty-six conditions. A document entitled \u201cNotice of Decision,\u201d which was included with the Examiner\u2019s opinion, stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">On the 22nd day of September, 1992, the attached Decision of the Zoning Hearing Examiner in Case No. SE-3967 was filed with the District Council.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\n<em>The Zoning Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision shall become final SO calendar days after the above filing date unless:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\"><em>(1) Written appeal within SO days of the above date is filed</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> with the District Council by any person of record or by the People\u2019s Zoning Counsel; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">(2) The District Council directs the case to be transmitted to the Council for final disposition by the Council.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The reverse side of the notice provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">\n<em>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acg\">I. <em>Exceptions Taken to the Examiner\u2019s Decision Shall be:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">a) In writing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">b) Numbered in sequence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">c) Specific as to the error(s) which are claimed to have been committed by the Examiner....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-14\">d) Specific as to those portions of the record, including the Hearing Examiner\u2019s Decision, relied upon to support your allegation of error(s) committed by the Examiner</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-15\">II. <em>Requests for Oral Argument:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-16\">If you desire oral argument before the District Council, request must be made, in writing, at the time of filing your exception(s).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>IV. <em>When to File:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">Your request for oral argument and/or exceptions must be filed <em>within 30 days after the Examiner\u2019s Decision has been filed with the District Council.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">(Italics added; underlining in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">On January 26, 1993, pursuant to P.G. \u00a7 27-131, \u201cexceptions\u201d to the Examiner\u2019s decision were noted by Raymond Richards, a resident of Subregion IV. Upon consideration of the exceptions, the Council again remanded the case, <em>de novo, </em>to the Technical Staff for the limited issue of revising the inventory as required under P.G. \u00a7 27-410(a)(8).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After appellee submitted a revised Traffic Impact Report on the basis of the new inventory, another evidentiary hearing was held before the Examiner on January 5,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">On February 1, 1994, the Examiner issued another opinion, again recommending approval of the application, subject to the same twenty-six conditions. In the opinion, the Examiner summarized, at length, the testimony of the many witnesses who appeared in opposition to appellee\u2019s application. The Examiner also relied on the preliminary revised master plan for Subregion VI, which reaffirmed the 1973 policy in favor of extracting natural resources from southern Prince George\u2019s County. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">Because sand and gravel are economically important to the County, because they are finite, because the County is the leading resource area in Maryland, and because once these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>sites are developed extraction is permanently precluded, it is recommended that sand and gravel extraction be given priority over more permanent land uses for the immediate future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">In recommending approval of appellee\u2019s request for a special exception, the Examiner concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">The testimony in the instant case is similar to the testimony which is present in most sand and gravel requests. The case is not unique. All such operations have trucks traveling the roads to and from the mining site and utilize excavation equipment on site. All sand and gravel operations use substantially the same amount and type of equipment and have dust and exhaust that become airborne. The applicant has shown that all potential pollutants are within the accepted governmental standards\u2014even for particularly sensitive individuals. The complaints made by the opposition show no adverse effect upon the neighborhood\u2014the area has been consistently used for sand and gravel mining operations in the past; the existing traffic situation will not be overburdened by the operation; the hours of operation are limited to weekday business hours; the mining operation will operate within the state regulations for noise and state and national standards regarding dust and pollutants; the mining will not affect ground water levels nor pollute the ground water. Any disturbance by this special exception will be routine for sand and gravel mining operations which are permitted by special exception in all residential zones. There is no special characteristic of this neighborhood. Thus, we must follow the guidance of the Court of Special Appeals that unsupported conclusions of lay witnesses that a use would cause traffic problems or noise or pollution are not sufficient to make adverse findings as to those issues. <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Bruce, </em>46 Md.App. 704, 420 A.2d 1272 (1980). Opposition\u2019s probative evidence of hazardousness at the intersection of Rts. 381 and 382 consists only of one picture taken south of the intersection that is advanced as showing a diminished sight distance from Rt. 382 north to the west on Rt. 381. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>This photo is misleading and the remaining opposition photos, as well as applicant\u2019s evidence, show that there is adequate sight distance in all directions at the intersection. Further, the evidence is quite clear that considering all the truck traffic on Rts. 381 and 382, both the routes and intersections studied by applicant and staff operate at more than adequate levels. The fact that children wait for school buses along Rt. 381 is no basis for considering the grant to this special exception as adverse to the neighborhood. Children wait for school buses along numerous streets or roads in this County and State ... and have done so since the first rural school bus was put in service. There is nothing different or unique in this case. To say that trucks on the road at the same time create an adverse condition would mean that all trucks must be taken off all such highways, a ludicrous result____ The numerous conditions placed upon this operation have evolved over the years through the hearing process and are routinely placed upon or required of most all sand and gravel mining operations for the protection of the environment and community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">A \u201cNotice of Decision\u201d was attached to the Examiner\u2019s decision. It provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">On the 1st day of February, 1994, the attached Decision of the Zoning Hearing Examiner in Case No. SE-3967 was filed with the District Council. <em>This is not the final decision, only the recommendation of the Hearing Examiner to the District Council.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\"><em>Within 30 calendar days after the above date, any person of record may file exceptions with the Clerk of the Council to any portion of this Decision, </em>and may request oral argument thereon before the District Council.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the event no exception or request for oral argument is filed with the Clerk of the Council within 30 calendar days from the above date, the District Council may act upon the application and must decide within 120 days <em>or the case will be considered denied.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Subsequently, Mr. Richards again filed \u201cexceptions\u201d to the Examiner\u2019s decision and, on April 25, 1994, the Council heard oral argument and took the matter under advisement. On May 9, 1994, a motion to approve the application did not pass, but a motion was approved to refer the application for preparation of an Order of Denial. Nevertheless, the Council later failed to obtain the requisite number of votes required to pass the Order of Denial. Consequently, on July 1, 1994, the Council issued a \u201cNotice of Denial,\u201d which provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">NOTICE OF DENIAL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\n<em>Pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 27-132(d)(2) of the Zoning Ordinance, a zoning matter shall be considered to have been denied if the District Council fails to render a final decision in accordance with the time limit and voting requirements.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">The above-referenced <em>application!appeal </em>appeared on the District Council\u2019s agenda for final action on May 24, 1994; <em>however, the Council was unable to,render a final decision. </em>You are hereby notified that as of July 1, 1994, <em>said application!appeal is denied by operation of the aforementioned provisions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">(Italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Appellee then sought review in the circuit court. Appellant asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the matter before the Council was the <em>appeal </em>of the Examiner\u2019s decision, not the special exception <em>application. </em>Brandywine maintained, therefore, that the automatic statutory denial of the appeal operated to reinstate the Examiner\u2019s decision. In contrast, appellant argued that the failure of the Council to render a timely decision resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>in a denial of the special exception <em>application. </em>By order dated May 18, 1995, the circuit court reversed the Council\u2019s decision, finding \u201cinsufficient evidence in the record to render the Council\u2019s decision fairly debatable____\u201d The trial court did not address Brandywine\u2019s argument that the Council\u2019s inaction served to deny the <em>appeal, </em>rather than the special exception <em>application. </em>It remanded the case to the Council for further proceedings to approve the special exception, along with any conditions supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Appellant now argues that the scope of our review is limited to deciding if the Council\u2019s decision to deny the special exception <em>application </em>\u201cwas fairly debatable and supported by evidence\u201d in the record. In spite of the lack of factual findings and the absence of a written decision explaining the basis for the statutory denial of the application, appellant claims that we must review the record and, if we find substantial evidence in the record to support the Council\u2019s decision, we must affirm the Council. In contrast, appellee contends that the Council\u2019s \u201csummary denial of [appellee\u2019s special exception <em>application </em>], without any findings of fact or conclusions of law,\u201d is inconsistent with the legislative policy in favor of approving special exceptions. In the alternative, appellee also asserts that \u201cif anything was decided by the the non-decision of the District Council, it was the <em>appeal </em>of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, not the entire special exception application.\u201d (Underlining in original). Therefore, appellee argues that the Examiner\u2019s decision approving the special exception application was the final decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">At the outset, the precise question with which we are concerned is whether the Council denied the special exception <em>application </em>or the <em>appeal </em>from the Examiner\u2019s decision. As we observed, the Council\u2019s \u201cNotice of Denial\u201d stated that the \u201capplication/appeal\u201d was denied by operation of law, because \u201cthe Council was unable to render a final decision\u201d within the time provided by P.G. \u00a7 27-132(d). To the extent that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Notice said the \u201capplication/appeal\u201d was denied, it was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Based on the applicable statutory scheme, however, we believe that it was the <em>appeal </em>from the Examiner\u2019s decision, rather than the special exception <em>application, </em>that constituted the zoning matter pending before the Council.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the Council\u2019s failure to render a timely decision constituted a denial of the <em>appeal, </em>but not a denial of the special exception application. As a result, the denial of appellee\u2019s appeal did not overrule the Examiner\u2019s decision. To the contrary, the denial of the <em>appeal </em>had the effect of sustaining the Examiner\u2019s decision approving the special exception. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In Prince George\u2019s County, the application procedure for special exceptions is governed by Article 27 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code. Pursuant to P.G. \u00a7\u00a7 27-126 and 27-127(b), all applications receive a public hearing conducted by an Examiner, who is appointed by the Council. P.G. \u00a7 27-127(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">After the conclusion of the hearing, the Zoning Hearing Examiner shall prepare and serve upon all persons of record a written decision containing specific findings of basic facts, conclusions of law, and either a recommended disposition of the case, or pursuant to Section 27-312, a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>decision. That decision shall be filed with the District Council at this same time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Further, P.G. \u00a7 27-312 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">(a) The Zoning Hearing Examiner shall have the authority <em>to approve or deny an application </em>for Special Exception ... in accordance with the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">(1) The Zoning Hearing Examiner shall have all the authority, discretion, and power given the District Council in this Part and in Part 3, Division 5, Subdivision 2, in the absence of a provision to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\n<em>(2) The Zoning Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision on an application for Special Exception shall be final thirty (30) days after filing the written decision except: \u25a0</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\n<em>(A) Where timely appeal has been made to the District Council pursuant to 27-131;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">(C) In any case where, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Zoning Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, the District Council, upon its own motion and by a majority vote of the full Council, elects to make the final decision on the case itself____<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">(Italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Appeals from the Examiner\u2019s decision are governed by P.G. \u00a7 27-131. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">(a) Authorization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">(1) Within thirty (30) days after the Hearing Examiner files his written decision in a zoning case, any person of record or the People\u2019s Zoning Council may file with the District Council:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>(A) <em>An appeal from, the Zoning Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision in a special exception case finally decided by the Zoning Hearing Examiner.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">(B) <em>Exceptions to the Zoning Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision in any other zoning </em>case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">(c) Time for Council Action</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">(1) <em>The District Council shall consider the exception or appeal at the time it takes final action on the </em>case....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aao\">(Italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The Prince George\u2019s County Code further provides that, once an appeal is filed, the Council must render a decision <em>on the zoning matter </em>in a timely fashion. P.G. \u00a7 27-132(d) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">(d) Time limits on final action</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">(2) If the District Council fails to render a final decision in accordance with the time limit and voting requirements of this Section, the <em>zoning matter shall be considered to have been denied, </em>unless otherwise specified in this Subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa4\">(Italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">We are mindful that we must read different sections contained in the same statute or regulation in tandem and reconcile their meanings to the extent possible. <em>Curran v. Price, </em>334 Md. 149, 172, 638 A.2d 93 (1994); <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753 (1993); <em>Popham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>333 Md. 136, 148, 634 A.2d 28 (1993). As we said in <em>Barr v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 681, 687, 647 A.2d 1293 (1994),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">[C]ourts must read all parts of a statute together, with a view toward harmonizing the various parts and avoiding both inconsistencies and senseless results that could not reasonably have been intended by the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>In light of the principles of statutory construction, it is apparent that, with respect to special exception cases, a challenge in Prince George\u2019s County to the Examiner\u2019s decision is by way of an <em>appeal </em>to the Council. In the absence of an appeal or timely action by the Council on its own motion, an Examiner\u2019s decision will become final.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, if the matter before the Council was the <em>appeal, </em>then the \u201cdeath clause\u201d of P.G. \u00a7 27-132(d)(2) operated to deny the <em>appeal, </em>not the application. When the appeal is denied, the Examiner\u2019s recommendation necessarily remains intact and becomes the final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Our conclusion as to the effect of the automatic statutory denial in special exception cases is consistent with State and Prince George\u2019s County Code provisions, which require that final dispositions regarding special exception applications must be accompanied by factual findings and legal conclusions. Md. Ann.Code art. 28, \u00a7 8-126 provides that, \u201c[i]n Prince George\u2019s County, no application for a map amendment or special exception, which is contested, may be granted or denied <em>except upon written findings of basic facts and written conclusions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Additionally, P.G. \u00a7 27-141(a) states that \u201c[t]he final decision in any zoning case shall be based on the evidence in the record, and <em>shall be supported by specific written findings of basic facts and, conclusions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Moreover, as we noted, P.G. \u00a7 27-127(c) requires that the Examiner <em>must </em>\u201cprepare ... a written decision containing <em>specific findings of basic facts [and] conclusions of </em>law____\u201d (Emphasis added). We observe that, if the automatic statutory denial operated to overrule the Examiner\u2019s decision, the denial would be unsupported by any factual findings or conclusions of law. Conversely, if the effect of the automatic statutory denial is to deny the appeal, an examiner\u2019s decision, which must include factual findings and legal conclusions, remains intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number> Our view that a statutory denial in a special exception case results in a denial of the <em>appeal, </em>rather than the denial of the <em>application, </em>is also in harmony with the legislative policy in favor of approving special exceptions. Special exceptions are uses of land that the Legislature has determined are beneficial for a specific region, provided certain conditions are satisfied. <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>107 Md.App. 1, 7-8, 666 A.2d 1253 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 649, 672 A.2d 623 (1996). <em>See also Umerley v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>(1996). (\u201cA special exception grants permission to engage in a use that the appropriate legislative authority has sanctioned under certain conditions.\u201d) Further, special exceptions are presumptively valid under zoning law. <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 11, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981) (\u201cThe special exception use is a valid zoning mechanism that delegates to an administrative board a limited authority to allow enumerated uses which the legislature had determined to be permissible <em>absent any fact or circumstance negating that presumption.\u201d) </em>(Emphasis in original); <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Mangione, </em>85 Md.App. 738, 747-48, 584 A.2d 1318 (1991). In <em>Mossburg, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">\u201cThe term \u2018special exception\u2019 refers to a \u2018grant by a zoning administrative body pursuant to existing provisions of zoning law and subject to certain guides and standards of special use permitted under provisions of existing zoning law.\u2019 <em>It is part of a comprehensive zoning plan, sharing the presumption that it is in the interest of the general welfare, </em>and is, therefore valid. It is a use which has been legislatively predetermined to be conditionally compatible with the uses permitted as of right in a particular zone.... In sum, a special exception is a Valid zoning mechanism that ... the legislative body has determined can, <em>prima facie, </em>properly be allowed in a specified use district, absent any fact or circumstance in a particular case which would change this presumptive finding.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><em>Id., </em>107 Md.App. at 11, 666 A.2d 1253 (footnotes and citations omitted in original; emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Mangione, </em>85 Md.App. at 747-48, 584 A.2d 1318).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>To determine whether the presumption in favor of approving a special exception application has been overcome, a zoning body must engage in a case by case factual inquiry concerning the effect of the proposed land use on the surrounding region and its consistency with the policies expressed in the Master Plan governing that region. <em>Moseman v. County Council of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>99 Md.App. 258, 263, 636 A.2d 499 (1994); <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d 1319. In <em>Mangione, </em>we set forth the applicable standard to evaluate a special exception application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\">The duties given the [zoning body] are to judge whether the <em>neighboring properties in the general neighborhood ivould be adversely affected </em>and whether the use in the particular case is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">The extent of any harm or disturbance to the neighborhood areas and uses is, of course, material. If the evidence makes the question of harm or disturbance or the question of the disruption of the harmony of the comprehensive plan of the zoning fairly debatable, the matter is one for the [zoning body] to decide. <em>But if there is no probative evidence of harm or disturbance in light of the nature of the zone involved or of factors causing disharmony to the operation of the comprehensive plan, a denial of an application for a special application is arbitrary, capricious, and illegal. </em>These standards dictate that if a requested special exception use is properly determined to have an adverse effect upon neighboring properties in the general area, [above and beyond that normally associated with such an exception elsewhere, <em>Mossburg, supra </em>], it must be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\"><em>Mangione, </em>85 Md.App. at 748-49, 584 A.2d 1318 (emphasis in original; citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In view of the presumption in favor of special exceptions, a denial of a special exception <em>apyplication </em>must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>supported by factual findings and legal conclusions. But, as we have said, if an automatic statutory denial were construed to result in a denial of the <em>application, </em>the Council\u2019s decision would be unsupported by factual findings and legal conclusions. On the other hand, a denial of the <em>appeal </em>upholds the Examiner\u2019s decision, which must be accompanied by factual findings and legal conclusions. P.G. \u00a7 27-127(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We acknowledge that, in <em>rezoning </em>cases, automatic statutory denials need not be supported by factual findings and legal conclusions. F.or example, in <em>Northampton Corp. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>273 Md. 93, 327 A.2d 774 (1974), the Northhampton Corporation applied for rezoning of certain tracts of land, and the Zoning Hearing Examiner issued a written decision, recommending approval of the zoning changes. When voted upon by the Council, the application failed to receive the required number of votes for approval and was ultimately denied by operation of law after the expiration of the statutory time limit. The Council did not provide a written decision based on its own factual findings and legal conclusions. The Court of Appeals determined that \u00a7 59-14 of the Regional District Act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which required that a final zoning decision must be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions of law, was inapplicable. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj2\">Under the circumstances of this case, the result which was reached was that mandated by law: that an application not granted within [the time limit] would be regarded as having been denied. No findings of fact or conclusions of law by the district council were required, ... because the application failed of passage as a consequence of inaction by the Council. The only issue before the [trial court] was whether a proper application of the law to the facts before the council produced a result which was neither unreasonable, arbitrary, nor capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"><em>Id., </em>273 Md. at 101, 327 A.2d 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Similarly, in <em>County Council for Prince George\u2019s County v. Metro Sites, Inc., </em>86 Md.App. 428, 586 A.2d 834 (1991), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>determined that a statutory denial did not require a written explanation from the agency. There, Metro Sites applied for a change in zoning, and the Zoning Examiner filed a written decision with the District Council, recommending denial of the application. After oral argument, the Council failed to take final action on the matter within the required time limit and, pursuant to P.G. \u00a7 27-132, the application was statutorily denied. Again, the Council\u2019s order of denial did not include any findings of fact or conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">In reviewing the denial, the circuit court observed that it could not determine if the denial of the application was supported by substantial evidence, because the Council failed to provide a written explanation. Therefore, it remanded the case to the Council to prepare factual findings and legal conclusions. Relying on <em>Northampton, </em>we found that the statutory denial did not require the Council to make written factual findings and conclusions of law. <em>Id., </em>86 Md. at 436, 38 A. 932. Accordingly, after determining that the Council\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record, we reversed the trial court and remanded the case with instructions to affirm the Council\u2019s denial of the application. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">We believe that these cases are distinguishable, because the matters before the Council were the rezoning <em>applications, </em>not the appeals, and there is a fundamental difference between a special exception application and a rezoning application. A rezoning lacks the presumption of validity that attaches to a special exception, because a region\u2019s original or comprehensive rezoning plan reflects a policy decision of a legislative branch and is assumed to be correct. <em>Beachwood, </em>107 Md.App. at 641, 670 A.2d 484. In <em>Cadem v. Nanna, </em>243 Md. 536, 221 A.2d 703 (1966), the Court of Appeals distinguished special exceptions and rezoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">The words \u201cspecial exception\u201d are well known in zoning law. They refer to a grant by the zoning administrative body pursuant to the existing provisions of the zoning law and subject to certain guides and standards, of a special use permitted under the provisions of the existing zoning law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Rezoning or reclassification is, of course, a <em>change in the existing zoning law itself, </em>so far as the subject property is concerned. This type of change in the zoning law is governed by quite different provisions of law from those governing the granting of a special exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><em>Id., </em>243 Md. at 543, 221 A.2d 703 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Moreover, a petition for rezoning or reclassification will be denied unless a .party produces strong evidence that the original or comprehensive rezoning plan was predicated upon erroneous evidence or a misapprehension of the existing facts or establishes that the character of the region has significantly changed. <em>Beachwood, </em>107 Md.App. at 639-41, 670 A.2d 484 (citing <em>Boyce v. Sembly, </em>25 Md.App. 43, 50-51, 334 A.2d 137 (1975)). <em>See also Cardon Investments v. Town of New Market, </em>302 Md. 77, 87, 485 A.2d 678 (1984); <em>Mayor and Council of Rockville v. Stone, </em>271 Md. 655, 661, 319 A.2d 536 (1974); <em>Mack v. Crandell, </em>244 Md. 193, 199-200, 223 A.2d 248 (1966); <em>Buckel v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Frederick County, </em>80 Md.App. 305, 308, 562 A.2d 1297, <em>cert. denied, </em>318 Md. 96, 566 A.2d 1112 (1989); <em>Hoy v. Boyd, </em>42 Md.App. 527, 533, 401 A.2d 1047 (1979). Describing the burden placed on a party who seeks rezoning classification, we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u2018It is now firmly established that there is a strong presumption of the correctness of original zoning and of comprehensive rezoning, and that to sustain a piecemeal change therefrom there must be produced strong evidence of mistake in the original zoning or comprehensive rezoning or else evidence of substantial change in the character of the neighborhood .... And, of course, the burden of proof facing one seeking a zoning reclassification is quite onerous.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN8\"><em>Beachwood, </em>107 Md.App. at 641, 670 A.2d 484 (omissions in original) (quoting <em>Wells v. Pierpont, </em>253 Md. 554, 557, 253 A.2d 749 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Additionally, the general principles that govern judicial review of administrative agency decisions make clear that specific findings of fact and legal conclusions are required to support a grant or denial of special exception applications. So <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>long as the automatic statutory denial constitutes the denial of the appeal, a reviewing court would be able to review whatever factual findings and conclusions of law were issued by the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">A reviewing court, of course, may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. <em>Northwest Land Corp. v. Maryland Dept. of Environment, </em>104 Md.App. 471, 487, 656 A.2d 804 (1995); <em>Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>86 Md.App. 179, 186, 586 A.2d 43 (1991). <em>See also United Parcel Serv. Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 576-77, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). Nor is the reviewing court permitted to engage in judicial fact-finding or otherwise supply factual decisions that were not made by the zoning body. <em>Ocean Hideaway Condo. v. Boardwalk Plaza, </em>68 Md.App. 650, 662, 515 A.2d 485 (1986). <em>See also Rodriguez v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>79 Md.App. 537, 551, 558 A.2d 742, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 641, 566 A.2d 101 (1989). Moreover, what we said in <em>Umerley, </em>is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">[Ujnlike our review of a trial court\u2019s judgment, we will only uphold the decision of an agency on the basis of the agency\u2019s reasons and findings. We may search the record for evidence to support a trial court\u2019s judgment; and we may sustain that judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record, even if the reason was not relied on by the trial court. <em>But we may not uphold an agency\u2019s decision \u2018unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency. \u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\"><em>Id., </em>108 Md.App. at 504, 672 A.2d 173 (emphasis added; quoting <em>United Steelworkers of America AFL-CIO v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>298 Md. 665, 679, 472 A.2d 62 (1984)). Similarly, in <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>83 Md.App. 432, 575 A.2d 750, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 164, 582 A.2d 499 (1990) we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">A reviewing court may not ... uphold an agency\u2019s decision if a record of the facts on which the agency acted or a statement of reasons for its action is lacking. Without this reasoned analysis, a reviewing court cannot determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>basis of the agency\u2019s action. If the agency fails to meet this requirement, the agency\u2019s decision may be deemed arbitrary. In such an instance, the case should be remanded for the purpose of having the deficiency supplied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><em>Id., </em>83 Md.App. at 442-43, 575 A.2d 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Applying all of these principles here, we hold that the Council\u2019s automatic statutory denial operated as a denial of the appeal, not the special exception application. Consequently, the denial resulted in the affirmance of the Examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-14\">.
