Hampton, appellant, was employed as an Office Secretary III by the University of Maryland at Baltimore (UMAB), appellee, commencing September 21, 1993. At that time, appellant began a six-month probationary period. UMAB notified appellant, on March 21, 1994, that her initial probationary period was being extended for an additional six months. On June 20, 1994, appellant was notified that her employment was being terminated. Appellant filed a timely appeal of UMAB\u2019s decision with the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). At the hearing thereon, appellant moved to dismiss UMAB\u2019s rejection on probation, arguing that her probation had ended on March 20, 1994, and, thus, she was no longer on probation when discharged. In its Final Decision, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) granted appellant\u2019s motion to. dismiss and denied UMAB\u2019s proposed rejection on probation. On appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Caplan, J., presiding), finding that the ALJ\u2019s conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence, the court reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In this appeal from the judgment of the circuit court, appellant presents the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">1. Whether there was sufficient evidence presented at the Administrative Law Hearing to support the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision!)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">2. Whether the \u201csix-month\u201d probationary period for a University of [Maryland] classified employee in this case ended on a Sunday or on the next business day, Monday[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">3. Whether an employee waives any complaint regarding a personnel action if no grievance is filed with[in] 30 days of the personnel action, as required by statute[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>We hold that the ALJ\u2019s decision was affected by an error of law\u2014namely, the failure to apply Maryland Code (1957, 1995 Repl.Vol.), Art. 94, \u00a7 2 to compute the dates of appellant\u2019s probationary period. Accordingly, we shall affirm the reversal of the ALJ\u2019s decision by the circuit court. Our decision makes discussion of appellant\u2019s first issue unnecessary. Appellant\u2019s third issue is a statement, not an allegation of error. This issue was originally presented to the ALJ by UMAB, not appellant. The ALJ found for appellant on other grounds and did not resolve that issue in its Final Decision. Thus, as to it, there appears to be nothing for us to review. In any event, we perceive no error on the part of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Appellant was hired as an Office Secretary III in the Office of the Dean of the School of Social Work at UMAB on September 21, 1993. As an employee of the University of Maryland system, appellant was a classified state employee, Md.Code (1978,1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), \u00a7 12\u2014111(b) of the Education Article, and, pursuant to Maryland Code (1993), \u00a7\u00a7 4^401, 4-403 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (SP), appellant was placed on an initial probation period of six months,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which, at UMAB\u2019s election, could be extended for an additional six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">On Monday, March 21, 1994, appellant was notified in writing that her initial probationary period was being extended for another six months, through September 21, 1994. On the written notification, which appellant signed, she noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>she disagreed with the decision to extend her probation. Appellant did not, however, file a formal written grievance challenging that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">On June 20, 1994, appellant was notified in -writing that she was being discharged during her probationary period based upon her inability to perform the essential duties and responsibilities of her position, to be effective July 8, 1994. Appellant filed a grievance with UMAB on June 23, 1994. She thereafter filed an appeal with OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">At the administrative hearing, neither party presented testimony or argument regarding the propriety of appellant\u2019s dismissal. Instead, appellant moved for dismissal of UMAB\u2019s rejection on probation on the grounds that her probation had ended on March 20,1994, and, therefore, she was no longer on probation on June 20, 1994, when UMAB dismissed her. UMAB opposed appellant\u2019s motion, contending that it had validly extended appellant\u2019s probationary period on March 21, 1994. UMAB argued that this procedural issue was not properly before the ALJ because appellant failed to file a timely grievance following the extension of her probation. (As we have indicated, we shall not address this issue.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The ALJ found that appellant was hired on September 21, 1993, and, therefore, her six-month probationary period expired on March 20, 1994, although that day was a Sunday. The ALJ concluded, consequently, that the attempt to extend appellant\u2019s probationary period on Monday, March 21, 1994 was ineffectual. Thus, according to the ALJ, because appellant became a permanent state employee \u201cas of the close of business on March 20,1994,\u201d UMAB\u2019s attempt to reject her on probation was ineffective. The ALJ\u2019s decision did not address UMAB\u2019s waiver argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Following an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, UMAB appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The circuit court found that the ALJ had committed reversible error in two respects: first, by failing to consider the issue presented to it by UMAB as to whether appellant had waived her right to appeal by failing to file a grievance regarding the extension of her probation when the probationary period was extended; and, second, by finding that appellant\u2019s probationary period had expired on a Sunday, rather than extending to the next business day.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Appellant has filed a timely appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is authorized by Maryland Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article (SG). Under subsection (h), when exercising such review, the court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">(in) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-15\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In general,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">[a] court\u2019s role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\"><em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v.

This examination seeks to find the substantiality of the evidence. \u201cThat is to say, a reviewing court, be it a circuit court or an appellate court, shall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency....\u201d <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch.

In terms of fact-finding, we must emphasize that under no circumstances may we substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Anderson, </em>330 Md. at 212, 623 A.2d 198. On the other hand, \u201c[w]hen reviewing issues of law, ... the court\u2019s review is expansive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>and it may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Curry, </em>102 Md.App. at 627, 651 A.2d 390; <em>Columbia Rd. Citizens\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Montgomery County, </em>98 Md.App. 695, 698, 635 A.2d 30 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Appellant\u2019s Probationary Status</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Appellant contends that her probation ended on Sunday, March 20, 1994, and, therefore, when she was terminated, on June 20, 1994, she was no longer a probationary employee and could only be terminated for cause. We disagree. Two separate provisions of a statute relating to the computation of time dictate otherwise. We shall first address appellant\u2019s primary contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In support of her position, appellant cites SP \u00a7 4-401, which states that \u201c[a]n employee shall be placed on probation when the employee is first appointed to the classified service.\u201d In conjunction with this section, appellant cites <em>Yingling v. Smith, </em>259 Md. 260, 269 A.2d 612 (1970), where the Court of Appeals applied Maryland Code (1957, 1995 Repl.Vol.), Art. 94, \u00a7 2 to determine what constitutes a six-month period of time for statute of limitations purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Article 94, \u00a7 2 states, in appropriate part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default, after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless: (1) It is a Sunday or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day, which is neither a Sunday or a holiday[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The purpose of this section \u201cwas to establish \u2018a <em>uniform </em>method of computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by the rules of any court, or by order of Court, or by any applicable statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the United States v. Jalowsky, </em>306 Md. 257, 262, 508 A.2d 137 (1986). A uniform procedure for computing statutory periods is equitable for two reasons. \u201cFirst, a set method of time computation brings a degree of certainty to the law. Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>by excluding the first day and counting from the first whole day following the event, a party will not be prejudiced if the triggering event occurs toward the end of the day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265, 508 A.2d 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In <em>Yingling, </em>\u201c[t]he narrow legal question presented [to the Court of Appeals] ... [was] whether or not a bill of complaint filed September 20, 1968, satisfies the statutory requirement of \u2018filing within six calendar months after\u2019 the appointment of an executor on March 19, 1968.\u201d 259 Md. at 261, 269 A.2d 612. Applying Art. 94, \u00a7 2, the Court excluded March 19, 1968, the day the executor was appointed, from the measuring of the prescribed period because the day of the event that triggers the statutory period is \u201cnot to be included.\u201d The Court held \u201cthat a calendar month is the period of time running from the beginning of a certain numbered day up to, <em>but not including, </em>the corresponding numbered day of the next month.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263, 269 A.2d 612. Using this formula, the Court held that the six-month limitations period ran from March 20, 1968 through September 19,1968. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Applying Art. 94, \u00a7 2 and <em>Yingling </em>to the case <em>sub judice, </em>we hold that, because appellant was hired by UMAB on September 21, 1993, her initial six-month probationary period commenced on the next full day, September 22, 1993, and ended, therefore, on March 21, 1994, which is the day her probation was extended. Under this statute, therefore, when UMAB extended appellant\u2019s probation on March 21, 1994, it did so properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In her brief, after relying upon <em>Yingling, </em>a case that itself relied heavily upon Art. 94, \u00a7 2, and applying the formula it sets forth to her situation, appellant goes on to argue that the language of SP \u00a7\u00a7 4-401 and 4-103 mandates that Art. 94, \u00a7 2 is not to be applied to the instant case. She contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEn\">State Personnel and Pensions Article, Section 4-101 ... clearly mandates that a State employee is placed on probation when that employee is <em>first </em>appointed. The statute dictates that an employee is placed on probation on his or her first day of work____ To not count this day as Day 1 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the probation period defies logic and the statute\u2019s intent. Using the counting formula detailed in <em>Yingling, </em>and assuming that the date of appointment for Hampton, namely September 21, 1993, is the first day of the probation period, then her six month probation period ended not on March 21, 1994, but on March 20, 1994. Even if March 20, 1994 was a Sunday, the day should be included in the six month period. To permit the extension of her probation to the next day not a Sunday or holiday in accordance with Article 94, Section 2 would be tantamount to stating that employees must serve a probation period of six months and one day or six months and two days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Appellant\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive. First, appellant\u2019s argument is contradictory: she relies heavily upon a case, <em>Yingling, </em>that was based upon a particular statutory section, Art. 94, \u00a7 2, but then argues that we may only selectively apply those portions of the statute that aid her argument. Simply stated, appellant cannot have it both ways. Second, SP \u00a7 4-401 states that an employee is placed on probation when <em>first appointed </em>to the classified service; the plain statutory language does not command that the first day of work is also the first day of probation. Third, SP \u00a7 4-403 provides that an employee\u2019s initial probationary period lasts for six months and may be extended for one additional six-month period. Both SP \u00a7 4-403 and Art. 94, \u00a7 2 relate, in part, to the same subject matter\u2014time. Section 4-403 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article furnishes the length of the period; Art. 94, \u00a7 2 controls when the counting commences and ends. The Legislature \u201cis presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law.\u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 419, 379 A.2d 1007 (1977). Hence, because Art. 94, \u00a7 2 was enacted prior to SP \u00a7 4-403, we presume that the Legislature was not only aware that Art. 94, \u00a7 2 would be used to compute the time period of SP \u00a7 4-403 when it did not specify otherwise, but approved of its use. <em>See Equitable Life, </em>306 Md. at 263, 508 A.2d 137. Finally, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>lant\u2019s six-months-and-one-day argument \u201cis of no import for it could be asserted each time a statute contains a notice provision and Art. 94, \u00a7 2 is applied to compute the time period. The short answer is that Art. 94, \u00a7 2\u2019s exclusion of \u2018the day of the act, event, or default\u2019 represents the uniform statutory policy of this State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265, 508 A.2d 137 (applying Art. 94, \u00a7 2 and holding that proper method for computing commencement date of two-year period delineated in incontestability provision of life insurance policy was to exclude date of policy issuance and commence counting from first full day following issuance of policy); <em>see also Fischer v. Fischer, </em>193 Md. 501, 505-06, 69 A.2d 51 (1949); <em>Durham v. Walters, </em>59 Md.App. 1, 6-7, 474 A.2d 523 (1984) (applying Art. 94, \u00a7 2 to six-month period to file a caveat against a will). We also note the opinion of the Attorney General:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">Giving effect to the provisions of Section 2 of Article 94 ... the one year period allowed for claim of the prize of a winning State lottery ticket commences on the day following the drawing in which the ticket became a winner and runs up to, <em>but not including, </em>the correspondingly identified month and day of the next successive year</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUu\">despite the fact that ticket may be claimed on same day as drawing. 60 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 439 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Moreover, even if we were to agree with appellant and include September 21, 1993 within her probationary period (which we do not), the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s probationary period expired on Sunday, March 20, 1994, because it began on September 21, 1993, rather than September 22, 1993, is also erroneous as a matter of law because the last day would then fall on a Sunday. Article 94, \u00a7 2 provides that, when that occurs, the period is extended to the following business day: \u201cThe last day of the period ... is to be included unless: (1) It is a Sunday or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day, which is neither a Sunday or a legal holiday.\u201d That next day was Monday, March 21, 1994. <em>See, e.g., D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 536-37 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1, 578 A.2d 1177 (1990) (applying Art. 94, \u00a7 2 and finding that purchaser under land sales contract, who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>fifteen days from August 31,1984 within which to record deed, was one day late when he recorded on Tuesday, September 18, 1984, because September 15th and 16th were a Saturday and Sunday and, therefore, time for recording was extended to the next business day that the clerk\u2019s office was open, Monday, September 17, 1984); <em>see also </em>Md.Rule l-203(a) (\u201cIn computing any period of time prescribed by ... any applicable statute, ... [t]he last day of the period ... is included unless: (1) it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day\u201d on which business is conducted.); <em>In re Stephen </em>J., 48 Md.App. 736, 738, 429 A.2d 307 (1981) (Where rule required juvenile adjudicatory hearing to be held within thirty days from filing of petition, the dismissal of the petition because hearing was held on thirty-first day after filing of petition was improper where thirtieth day was a Sunday.).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Additionally, UMAB has proffered that it is its established policy to calculate probationary periods on a point-to-point basis. In other words, under its policy, UMAB calculated a month to be the period beginning on a particular numbered day and running up to <em>and including </em>the corresponding numbered day of the following <em>month\u2014i.e., </em>UMAB calculated appellant\u2019s six-month probationary period to be from September 21, 1993 through and including March 21, 1994. Thus, UMAB, relying on its own established policy and procedure in calculating appellant\u2019s probationary period, determined that it had until the close of business on Monday, March 21, 1994 to inform appellant that her probation period was being extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We have frequently held that an administrative agency must abide by its own rules, and when an agency fails to follow its rules, its actions are invalid. <em>See, e.g., Kohli v. LOOC Inc., </em>103 Md.App. 694, 718, 654 A.2d 922 (1995); <em>Board of School Comm\u2019rs v. James, </em>96 Md.App. 401, 421, 625 A.2d 361, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 381, 631 A.2d 451, 452 (1993). We recognize, of course, that to the extent UMAB\u2019s policy is not in compliance with the methodology for such calculations set forth by the Court of Appeals in <em>Yingling, </em>UMAB\u2019s policy is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>condoned. However, to the extent that UMAB was required to follow its established rules and did so in this case, its conclusion that, under its point-to-point policy, it had until March 21, 1994 to extend appellant\u2019s probation is supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Finally, according to another of UMAB\u2019s personnel regulations, \u201c[a] request for extension of probation must be received in the institution Personnel Department prior to the probation completion date in order to be considered.\u201d Appellant contends that, based upon this provision, even if her probationary period expired on March 21, 1994, UMAB had to inform her prior to that <em>date\u2014i.e., </em>by March 20, 1994\u2014that it was extending her probation. Appellant\u2019s contention is, however, without merit for several reasons. Principally, we note, this provision does not contemplate that any notification whatsoever must be made to the employee. The regulation does no more than control the internal transmission of a request to extend probation from the employee\u2019s supervisor to the personnel office. Furthermore, in order for an employee\u2019s probation to be extended, the employer must act prior to the expiration of the probationary period; once the period has expired there is, logically, nothing left to be extended. Thus, the employer must act \u201cprior to the probation completion date\u201d\u2014that is, while the employee is still on probation\u2014in order to extend the probation. In this regard, UMAB\u2019s regulation serves to ensure that actions to extend an employee\u2019s probationary period are taken prior to the expiration of that period. Lastly, even if we were to agree with appellant that, under this provision, UMAB had to inform her one full day prior to the expiration of her probation period that it was extending said period (which we do not), we would still not be inclined to hold that UMAB had to act on a Sunday, as opposed to having the period extended by operation of law to the following business day pursuant to the statutes and Maryland Rule we have elsewhere discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In conclusion, construing SP \u00a7 4-403 in harmony with Art. 94, \u00a7 2, leads to the result that UMAB had until Monday, March 21, 1994 to inform appellant that her probation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>being extended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although it would have been prudent for UMAB to have notified appellant that her probation was going to be extended prior to the date upon which the six-month period would run, we hold that the ALJ erred when he ruled that appellant\u2019s probationary period expired on Sunday, March 20, 1994. Through misinterpretation and misapplication of Art. 94, \u00a7 2, this decision was erroneous as a matter of law, and, therefore, the ALJ\u2019s decision is affected by an error of law. Pursuant to SG \u00a7 10\u2014222(f), the ALJ\u2019s decision must be reversed, and, correspondingly, the judgment of the circuit court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">. In her brief, appellant states that she was employed by the University of Maryland system for twenty years before being reassigned to the position at the School of Social Work from which she was terminated. Under Maryland Code (1993), \u00a7 4-401 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, \u201c[a]n employee shall be placed on probation when the employee is <em>first appointed </em>to the classified service.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, it is unclear in the first instance why appellant was placed on probation by UMAB. In any event, appellant did not challenge her placement on probation when she began at UMAB, only whether she was properly rejected during its pendency, and, therefore, any issue in this regard has been waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">. Because this issue will most certainly arise again, we note that Maryland Code (1978, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), \u00a7 13-1A-03(b)(l) of the Education Article does not require that a grievance be in writing: \"An aggrieved employee ... <em>may </em>present the grievance in writing ... for formal consideration.\u201d Thus, whether an employee has in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>presented an employer with a timely grievance is a question of fact that must be passed upon first by the administrative agency, <em>i.e., </em>the ALJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b335-5\">. An application of Md.Rule l-203(a) leads to the same result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
