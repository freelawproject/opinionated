On appeal, he seeks our review of the following questions, which we have reordered and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">(1) Did the trial court err by (a) dismissing appellant\u2019s exceptions for failing to comply with Rule 2-541; and (b) by failing to vacate its order dismissing appellant\u2019s exceptions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">(2) Did the trial court err in concluding that appellant was receiving retirement benefits, rather than workers\u2019 compensation and/or disability benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">(3) Did the trial court err by awarding attorney\u2019s fees to appellee?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">We shall answer the first two questions in the negative, and affirm that portion of the judgment of the circuit court. On the other hand, we shall answer the third question in the affirmative, and remand that portion of the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">The parties had been married for fifteen years when their marriage was ended by a Judgment of Absolute Divorce granted on 26 November 1986, and their separation agreement was enrolled in the Judgment of Divorce. The separation agreement provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-16\">[W]hen and if the defendant John Lebac, Jr. shall be entitled to receive retirement benefits from his U.S. Secret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Service employment, the plaintiff, Theresa Lebac, as alternative payee, as and for marital property, shall receive a sum equal to twenty percent (20%) of any payment received by John Lebac, Jr. as a result of his employment by the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division, District of Columbia Police and Fire Fighters Retirement System.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">On 21 June 1991, appellant retired from the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division under provisions of the District of Columbia\u2019s Police and Firefighters\u2019 Retirement and Disability Act (the D.C. Act). After appellant failed to provide appellee with twenty per cent of his monthly retirement income, she sought entry of a modified order for payment of marital interest in appellant\u2019s retirement benefits, an accounting, and entry of a judgment for arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Testimony was taken before a domestic relations master on 6 January 1995. The master filed her findings of fact and recommendations on 22 February 1995, providing the parties with a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Although appellant noted exceptions, he failed to furnish the circuit court with a \u201ctranscript of so much of the testimony as necessary to rule on the' exceptions.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s exceptions and adopted the master\u2019s recommendations. Appellant then noted this appeal. We shall include such additional facts as may be necessary to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Appellant first contends that \u201cthrough a misinterpretation of the [Md.Rules], the transcript was not promptly ordered by appellant\u2019s counsel and was not filed within the 30 days[.]\u201d Md.Rule 2-541(h)(2) requires in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX6\">... a party who has filed exceptions shall cause to be prepared and transmitted to the court a transcript of so much of the testimony as is necessary to rule on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>exceptions. The transcript shall be ordered at the time the exceptions are filed, and the transcript shall be filed within 30 days thereafter or within such longer time, not exceeding 60 days after the exceptions are filed, as the master may allow. The court may further extend the time for the filing of the transcript for good cause shown. * * * <em>The court may dismiss the exceptions of a party who has not complied with this section. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Appellant freely admits that he failed to comply with Md.Rule 2\u2014541(h)(2), but claims a transcript was not necessary as there are no disputed facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, appellant contends that a transcript would not have assisted the trial court in reaching its conclusions, as it already had before it all of the parties\u2019 pleadings and exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We have often pointed out that we are neither obliged nor inclined to rummage through the record seeking support for a party\u2019s position, <em>see e.g. Hamilos v. Hamilos, 52 </em>Md.App. 488, 497 n. 3, 450 A.2d 1316 (1982). Nor is a circuit court when called upon to deal with appellant\u2019s exceptions. Rule S74A requires an asserted error to be set forth with particularity. Otherwise, an exception \u201c... is waived unless the court finds that justice requires otherwise.\u201d In any event, we fail to see how exceptions can be properly considered without a transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Ironically, not until <em>after </em>the trial court had denied his exceptions and adopted the master\u2019s recommendations did appellant inform the trial court why he had failed to file a transcript. It was only then that appellant filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In view of appellant\u2019s utter failure to comply with Rule S74A, we are unable to find that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s exceptions and adopting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>master\u2019s recommendations, or by denying appellant\u2019s motion to alter or amend. Nonetheless, we shall exercise the discretion bestowed upon us by Rule 8-131(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and consider appellant\u2019s issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Before doing so, we shall review the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s disability retirement. By an order of 24 June 1991, captioned DISABILITY RETIREMENT, appellant retired at the close of business 21 June 1991 on a surgical disability incurred during his service as a K-9 officer with the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, under the provisions of \u00a7 4-616(a) of the D.C.Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Appellant principally contends that his disability benefits are in the nature of workers\u2019 compensation. As they have been received after the termination of his marriage, appellant feels they are not subject to equitable distribution. Although appellant relies on <em>Queen v. Queen, </em>308 Md. 574, 521 A.2d 320 (1987),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we believe his reliance on <em>Queen </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>As we see it, appellant\u2019s disability payments are retirement benefits, and appellee is entitled to twenty percent of any payment received by appellant. We shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Appellant directs our attention to several cases discussing the notion that the D.C.Act is akin to states\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation acts. While we agree that, under some circumstances, benefits received under the D.C.Act may be classified as workers\u2019 compensation benefits, appellant\u2019s benefits do not fall into that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In support of his position, appellant also cites <em>Frye v. United States, </em>72 F.Supp. 405 (1947) and <em>Brown v. Jefferson, </em>451 A.2d 74 (D.C.App.1982). <em>Frye </em>involved an application for a tax refund by an injured firefighter and police officer. Construing the D.C.Act, the Court noted that the D.C.Act had the dual purpose of creating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">(1) a system for the compensation of policemen and firemen who have been disabled through injury received or disease contracted in the line of duty in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">(2) a system for the voluntary retirement of policemen and firemen who have served not less than 25 years and have reached the age of 55, and the involuntary retirement of policemen and firemen who have reached the age of 60. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\"><em>Frye, </em>72 F.Supp. at 408. The Court concluded that to the extent 26 U.S.C.Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 22(b)(5) excludes from gross income \u201camounts received through accident or health insurance or under workmen\u2019s compensation acts as compensation for personal injuries or sickness\u201d benefits received under category (1) <em>supra, </em>are exempt from taxation. <em>Id. </em>at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Appellant contends that, as his disability benefits are exempt from taxation, we must consider them to be workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We remind appellant that we are not here dealing with a tax problem. As we see it, appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>benefits<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> exemption from taxation does not dispose of the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The issue focused on in <em>Brown </em>was whether members of the District of Columbia uniformed services who had preexisting conditions aggravated while on duty were entitled to recover medical expenses. Although the <em>Brown </em>Court said that \u201c[i]t is clear, ... that both FECA and the substitute provisions applicable to the District of Columbia uniformed services are classified generally as workmen\u2019s compensation statutes, and are to be interpreted accordingly,\u201d <em>Brown, </em>451 A.2d at 77, that statement was made in the context of a dispute over the meaning of \u00a7 4r-525 of the D.C.Act, now \u00a7 4-613. Although \u00a7 4-613 does not expressly so provide, the <em>Brown </em>Court concluded that employees who incur medical expenses \u201cresulting from on the job injuries which aggravate pre-existing conditions\u201d are entitled to such benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Appellant\u2019s retirement under \u00a7 4^616(a) of the D.C.Act, however, involves retirement benefits, not medical expenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although we agree that, under some circumstances, certain benefits received under the D.C.Act may be considered as workers\u2019 compensation benefits, we agree with the master and the trial court that the facts in the instant case compel a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The record before us discloses that appellant\u2019s benefits are an \u201cannuity solely drawn from his retirement funds deposited under [the D.C.Act] and does not include any disability insurance or workers\u2019 compensation payments.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, during direct examination of Virginia Mary Hartswick, a Senior Retirement Examiner from the D.C. Office of Pay and Retire-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>merit System, the following colloquy ensued with appellee\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">Counsel: * * * And did [appellant] receive his retirement benefits as some form of compensation for lost wages? Is that what the [retirement] fund is for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">Witness: No, we have nothing to do with workmen\u2019s compensation or any other kind of compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">Counsel: What is the nature of Mr. [appellant\u2019s] retirement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">Witness: It is strictly a disability retirement annuity. Counsel: What is a disability retirement annuity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">Witness: Well, he [appellant] was found disabled. It was incurred in the performance of his duty, and so he was allowed to retire early, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">Counsel: If someone is found disabled in the performance of their duties, are there provisions of the law which allow them to act as their retirement fund earlier than otherwise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">Witness: Well, they can if they are disabled before they are eligible to go as optional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">According to appellant, he could have taken normal retirement based on his twenty years of service despite his injury. Instead, he chose a disability retirement because \u201cthe benefits would have been less\u201d under the twenty year retirement plan. In any event, appellant\u2019s suggestion that he is receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">In <em>Lookingbill v. Lookingbill, </em>the Court of Appeals noted that, under appropriate circumstances, a disability plan may constitute marital property, pointing out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">[t]here are many types of retirement plans under which the rights the beneficiaries possess often differ, depending on a wide variety of factors. <em>Dering [v. Deering, </em>292 Md. 115, 437 A.2d 883 (1981) ], following the dominant trend of the law, rejected such distinctions in making the threshold determination of whether a retirement plan is marital prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>erty. * * * Pension payments are actually partial consideration for past employment whether the maturity of the pension is contingent upon age and service or upon disability. Thus, a disability plan is property and, within the meaning of the [Maryland Marital Property Act], constitutes marital property subject to equitable distribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuR\">301 Md. 283, 289, 483 A.2d 1 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In essence, appellant participated in a non-contributory pension plan funded solely by the United States Secret Service. <em>Deering, </em>292 Md. at 118, n. 3. Among other things, his participation in the plan was contingent upon his disability retirement. As we said in <em>Ohm v. Ohm,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">[e]ven here contributions have been made entirely by the employer, the courts have concluded that retirement benefits are a mode of employee compensation and as such are an earned property right of marriage. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">49 Md.App. 392, 396, 431 A.2d 1371 (1981) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The record reveals that appellant retired under \u00a7 4-616(a) of the D.C. Act, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">... whenever any member<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is injured or contracts a disease in the performance of duty or such injury or disease is aggravated by such duty at any time after appointment and such injury or disease or aggravation permanently disables him for the performance of duty, he shall, upon retirement for such disability, receive an annuity computed at the rate of 2%% of his average pay for each year or portion thereof of his service; provided that such annuity shall not exceed 70% of his average pay, nor shall it be less than 66%% of his average pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Although retirement under \u00a7 4r-616(a) is contingent upon disability, a contingent interest has long been recognized as property. <em>Lookingbill, </em>301 Md. at 289. In fact, appellant\u2019s retirement benefits are tied directly to his years of service. Thus, they are a deferred form of compensation. <em>See Deering, supra. </em>Although appellant strenuously asserts that his dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ability occurred following his divorce, he fails to recognize that his disability retirement rights were acquired during his marriage to appellee.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The D.C.Act does not contain an alternative source of funds, and it in no way suggests that appellant will be required to reapply to another agency or pension plan to continue receiving retirement benefits. In other words, \u00a7 4-616(a) constitutes the only source of appellant\u2019s retirement income. Therefore, he is receiving \u201cretirement benefits\u201d as a \u201cresult of his employment by the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, appellee\u2019s right to receive twenty per cent of appellant\u2019s retirement benefits, vested the moment he retired. His perception that the separation agreement provided otherwise is of no consequence. Thus, we hold that appellant\u2019s retirement income is covered by the parties\u2019 separation agreement. Were we to adopt appellant\u2019s position, his election of a disability retirement rather than a normal \u201cservice\u201d retirement would leave appellee without recourse. We do not believe that such a result was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Notwithstanding, appellant urges us to apply District of Columbia law as the D.C.Act is based on District of Columbia law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>We think the'instant case fits squarely within the District of Columbia\u2019s Spouse Equity Act of 1988 (the Spouse Equity Act).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under the Spouse Equity Act, former spouses of covered members of the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> are entitled to share in a member\u2019s retirement benefits with a \u201cqualifying court order.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section \u00a7 1-3002(c) of the Spouse Equity Act defines \u201cqualifying court order\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">one that by its terms awards to a former spouse all or a portion of an employee\u2019s or retiree\u2019s retirement benefits, [or] a payment from an employee\u2019s or retiree\u2019s retirement benefits[.] The order must state the former spouse\u2019s share as a fixed amount, or a percentage or a fraction of the annuity, and shall indicate whether the former spouse should receive the amount awarded directly from the District. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">As the separation agreement awarding appellee twenty per cent of appellant\u2019s retirement benefits is enrolled in their judgment of divorce, it is a \u201cqualifying court order.\u201d Nothing in the Spouse Equity Act suggests that certain awards are excluded from its coverage. As the District of Columbia must give full faith and credit to the parties\u2019 Maryland judgment of divorce,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> appellee is entitled to twenty per cent of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>retirement benefits, although the benefits are coming from the D.C.Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Appellant finally contends that the trial court erred in awarding appellee attorney\u2019s fees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Although appellee asserts the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cmeets all the criteria set out in [Md.Code Ann. Family Law \u00a7 11-110 (1981, 1984 Repl.Vol.) ],\u201d she overlooks the fact that \u00a7 11-110 only applies to proceedings for alimony, alimony pendente lite, and the enforcement of an award of alimony. The case at hand deals only with the enforcement of the parties\u2019 separation agreement. In essence, appellee sought to have the separation agreement specifically enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">As we have previously said, \u201c[t]he general rule governing the recovery of litigation expenses\u201d is \u201c \u2018that, other than usual and ordinary court costs, the expenses of litigation\u2014 including legal fees incurred by the successful party, are not recoverable in an action for damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archway Motors v. Herman, </em>41 Md.App. 40, 43, 394 A.2d 1228 (1978) (quoting <em>Empire Realty v. Fleisher, </em>269 Md. at 285-86, 305 A.2d 144 (1973). Absent a statutory requirement, contractual agreement, or the application of Md.Rule 1-341<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>, counsel fees are not recoverable as damages, or as ancillary monetary damages in a suit for specific performance. <em>Archway, </em>41 Md.App. at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Appellee has neither directed us to, nor has our own independent research uncovered, any statute permitting an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the case at hand. Nor did the separation agreement contain any such agreement. While we shall vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees and remand the case to the circuit court to consider whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees is appropriate under Md.Rule 1-341, we caution the trial court that an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 1-341 is an extraordinary remedy. In short, such an award of attorney\u2019s fees must be denied absent a finding that appellant had engaged in intentional misconduct or in unnecessary or abusive litigation. <em>See Major v. First Virginia Bank, </em>97 Md.App. 520, 530-31, 631 A.2d 127 (1993), <em>cert. denied, Major v.
