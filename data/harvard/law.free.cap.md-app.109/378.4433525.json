Streett filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Blue Bird Cab Company, Inc. (\u201cBlue Bird\u201d) and Juliette Lamont. Ms. Streett alleged that she had been injured while a passenger in a Blue Bird taxicab driven by Ms. Lamont on August 4, 1989. Blue Bird requested that its insurance carrier, Amalgamated Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cAmalgamated\u201d), defend it and provide coverage for any liability as a result of the accident. Appellee Amalgamated denied coverage. Blue Bird filed a Third Party Complaint for Declaratory Judgment against Amalgamated on April 10, 1991, requesting that the circuit court declare \u201cthat Blue Bird Cab Co., Inc., is covered under the Insurance Policy issued by Amalgamated Casualty Insurance Company for any loss re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>suiting from the Complaint filed [by Ms. Streett] and that Amalgamated is responsible for the defense of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The court heard evidence on the third-party complaint on April 8, 1993. At the close of Blue Bird\u2019s case, the trial judge entered a judgment in favor of Amalgamated, stating, \u201cI have to conclude that [Blue Bird] ha[s] not succeeded in establishing that there was insurance coverage existing under the policy of insurance with Amalgamated Casualty Insurance Company.\u201d Blue Bird appeals from this decision and presents four questions for our resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">I. Is the Amalgamated insurance policy ambiguous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">II. Did Amalgamated waive enforcement of exclusion (g), which excludes coverage when a taxicab is driven by someone who is not listed as an additional named insured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">III. Is exclusion (g) void as against public policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">IV. Is exclusion (g) valid as to coverage above the statutory minimum prescribed by the compulsory insurance law?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">We answer the first two questions in the negative, and the second two in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Ms. Lamont was hired by Blue Bird in August 1988 as a taxicab driver-operator. At the April 8, 1993, trial on the declaratory judgment claim, Stanley Bretner, president of Blue Bird, testified that, on the day Ms. Lamont was hired, he instructed her to go to the Amalgamated offices for approval and listing as an additional named insured on Blue Bird\u2019s taxicab liability insurance policy. Mr. Bretner further testified that shortly thereafter he received a telephone confirmation from Amalgamated that Ms. Lamont had been approved as a driver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">The policy at issue provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>III. PERSONS INSURED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">Each of the following is an insured under this insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">(a) the named insured, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">(b) any other individual named as an additional named insured in the declarations or endorsements issued to form a part of this policy, provided each person holds a valid license to operate a taxicab.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The named insured under the policy was Blue Bird. The term \u201cinsured\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201ca person described above under \u2018Persons Insured.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The policy declaration dated September 20, 1988, listed as insured 157 vehicles,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for which Blue Bird was charged a premium of either $93.79 or $101.44 for each per month. The same policy listed 150 drivers as additional named insureds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Exclusion (g) states that the policy does not apply \u201cwhile the automobile is being driven by a natural person not named in the declarations or endorsements issued to form a part of this policy.\u201d Finally, the cover page of the policy declares: \u201cNOTICE: The names of any person who operates your vehicle must be provided to the insurance company and listed on this policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>On May 17, 1988, Amalgamated sent Blue Bird a letter reminding it that \u201cthe names of any and all drivers must be provided to the insurance company for processing; otherwise, there is no coverage under the policy.\u201d On October 27, 1988, Amalgamated sent a similar letter stating, <em>\u201cthe names of any and all drivers must be provided to the insurance company, </em>and the list must be kept current; otherwise there is no coverage under the policy.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.) Mr. Bretner testified that he was aware that a driver had to be listed to be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">According to Mr. Bretner\u2019s testimony, once Blue Bird sent a potential driver to Amalgamated for approval, Amalgamated never sent written confirmation. Instead, Amalgamated would phone Blue Bird with its approval. Blue Bird would, however, receive, albeit at irregular intervals, declaration pages to the policy that listed the names of all drivers approved by Amalgamated as additional named insureds. Blue Bird received updated declaration pages dated September 6, 1988 and September 20, 1988, but Ms. Lamont\u2019s name did not appear on either list. Blue Bird received no lists in 1989 until three months after the accident. There is no dispute that Ms. Lamont\u2019s name never appeared on a declaration page listing additional named insureds under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">On August 4, 1989, Ms. Lamont was involved in an accident while driving a Blue Bird taxicab. Her passenger, Ms. Streett, was severely injured. Ms. Streett sued Ms. Lamont and Blue Bird, as noted above. Blue Bird filed a cross-claim for indemnification against Ms. Lamont. The tort action went to trial in front of a jury on October 26, 1994. The jury returned a verdict of $415,000 in favor of Ms. Streett. The trial judge entered judgment in favor of Blue Bird on the cross-claim. While post-judgment motions were pending, Blue Bird settled the action that Ms. Streett had filed against it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Blue Bird then filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Blue Bird asks us to determine whether the insurance policy issued to it by Amalgamated was ambiguous. Blue Bird asserts that exclusion (g) is \u201cclearly ambiguous\u201d because it is not \u201cclear if this exclusion applies to <em>both </em>the named insured, as well as the driver operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u201cWe have made it clear that where an insurance company, in attempting to limit coverage, employs ambiguous language, the ambiguity will be resolved against it as the one who drafted the instrument, as is true in the construction of contracts generally.\u201d <em>Haynes v. American Casualty Co., </em>228 Md. 394, 400, 179 A.2d 900 (1962). Where there is no ambiguity in an insurance contract, however, the Court has no alternative but to enforce the policy\u2019s terms. <em>Howell v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., </em>305 Md. 435, 505 A.2d 109 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We see no ambiguity in the language of the policy. The exclusion plainly applies to both Blue Bird and any natural person who is not listed as an additional named insured in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Blue Bird also argues that Amalgamated waived the condition that a driver be listed as an additional named insured. Blue Bird contends that it sent Ms. Lamont to Amalgamated to be listed and that it received confirmation of her approval by phone. Blue Bird further contends that Amalgamated\u2019s practice of never sending a written confirmation of a listing constitutes a waiver of the exclusion, even though it would receive, at irregular intervals, declaration pages, which purported to list all additional named insureds. Blue Bird argues that it was \u201cled to believe that [it was] following the standard procedures in order to list Lamont as an additional named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Waiver is \u201cthe intentional relinquishment of a known right, or such conduct as warrants an inference of the relinquishment of such right, and may result from an express agreement or be inferred from circumstances.\u201d <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Blumberg, </em>234 Md. 521, 531, 200 A.2d 166 (1964), <em>quoted in GEICO v. Medical Servs., </em>322 Md. 645, 650, 589 A.2d 464 (1991). \u201cAny acts or conduct of the insurer or its representatives, that are, under the circumstances, calculated to mislead the insured and to induce him to believe that performance of the condition will not be required, or that proofs of loss would be ineffectual and nugatory, will, if he is thereby misled, amount to a waiver.\u201d <em>Citizen\u2019s Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Conowingo Bridge Co., </em>113 Md. 430, 440, 77 A. 378 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">There was no action by Amalgamated that can be construed as evidencing an intent not to enforce the additional named insured exclusion. According to Mr. Bretner, he sent Ms. Lamont to Amalgamated for approval in August of 1988. Amalgamated sent Blue Bird two declaration sheets listing additional named insureds in September 1988, neither of which listed Ms. Lamont as an insured. The cover page of the policy in question notifies the insured that the \u201cname of any person who operates your vehicle must be provided to the insurance company <em>and </em>listed on this policy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We find that the trial judge was correct in rejecting appellant\u2019s argument that it had proven a waiver in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Blue Bird also argues that exclusion (g) is void as against public policy and should not be enforced to deny coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The Maryland statutory insurance scheme requires, with a few narrow exceptions, that every owner of a registered motor vehicle maintain liability coverage for personal injury of $20,000 for any one person, $40,000 for any accident, and $10,000 for property damage. Md.Code (1977, 1992 Repl.Vol.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u00a7 17-103(b) of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The required insurance attaches to automobiles, not to persons. <em>Neale v. Wright, </em>322 Md. 8, 14, 585 A.2d 196 (1991). The Maryland Code also requires that every owner of a registered motor vehicle maintain personal injury protection (PIP) benefits of $2,500, and uninsured motorist (UM) insurance in specified minimum amounts. Md.Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 539-541.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u201cThe purpose of Maryland\u2019s compulsory insurance law is to ensure that those who own and operate motor vehicles registered in the State are \u2018financially able to pay compensation for damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Enterprise Leasing Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>341 Md. 541, 549, 671 A.2d 509 (1996) (quoting <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 154, 416 A.2d 734 (1980)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201c[0]nce an automobile liability policy is certified as proof of financial responsibility ... it becomes an insurance policy for the benefit of the public using the highways of this State. Therefore, it may not contain exclusions which destroy the effectiveness of the policy as to any substantial segment of that public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><em>Larimore v. American Ins. Co., </em>314 Md. 617, 626, 552 A.2d 889 (1989) (quoting <em>Makris v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>267 So.2d 105, 108 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u201c[A] clause in an insurance policy which is contrary to \u2018the public policy of this State, as set forth in ... the Insurance Code\u2019 or other statute, is invalid and unenforceable.\u201d <em>Jennings v. GEICO, </em>302 Md. 352, 356, 488 A.2d 166 (1985). Where the legislature has mandated insurance coverage, this Court will not create exclusions that are not specifically set out in the statute. <em>Enterprise Leasing Co., supra, </em>341 Md. at 547, 671 A.2d 509; <em>see also Larimore, supra, </em>314 Md. at 622, 552 A.2d 889; <em>Jennings, supra, </em>302 Md. at 358-59, 488 A.2d 166. We refuse to do so because \u201cif any and all exclusions from this required liability coverage are valid as long as they are not expressly prohibited by statute, the purpose of the compulsory automobile liability insurance could be frustrated to a significant extent.\u201d <em>Jennings, supra, </em>302 Md. at 360, 488 A.2d 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Maryland courts have invalidated insurance policy exclusion clauses that are inconsistent with the public policy of this State. <em>See Larimore, supra, </em>314 Md. at 622, 552 A.2d 889 (holding \u201cfellow employee\u201d exclusion invalid); <em>Jennings, supra, </em>302 Md. at 356-60, 488 A.2d 166 (holding \u201chousehold\u201d exclusion invalid); <em>Gartelman, supra, </em>288 Md. at 156-57, 416 A.2d 734 (holding that exclusion from PIP and UM coverage for an insured who is injured while occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured invalid); <em>West Am. Ins. Co. v. Popa, </em>108 Md.App. 73, 86-87, 670 A.2d 1021 (1996) (holding that exclusion of government-owned vehicles from the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d is void). This problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>was very recently addressed in <em>Enterprise Leasing Co., supra. </em>The Court of Appeals held that, where a leased motor vehicle is involved in an accident while driven by a person having the lessee\u2019s permission, the lessor of the motor vehicle must cover damages to third parties under its required security. <em>Enterprise Leasing Co., supra, </em>341 Md. at 547-52, 671 A.2d 509. The Court based its holding on the language of section 18-102(b) of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court held that public policy demanded this result regardless of whether the person driving was authorized or unauthorized to drive the leased vehicle under the terms of the rental agreement, even though section 18-106 of the Transportation Article specifically allows a leasing company to exclude drivers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The Court of Appeals has reasoned that, to uphold exclusions not found in the compulsory insurance statutory scheme, \u201cwould result in a large class of claimants being without liability insurance coverage and in a large class of uninsured motorists.\u201d <em>Larimore, supra, </em>314 Md. at 625, 552 A.2d 889; <em>see also Jennings, supra, </em>302 Md. at 360 n. 9, 488 A.2d 166 (\u201cThe instant case deals with a policy exclusion that would exclude classes of people.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The exclusion here at issue would result in a large class of claimants\u2014the entire public\u2014being without liability insurance coverage and in a large class of uninsured motorists\u2014a taxicab owner as well as his or her authorized drivers whenever that cab driver is not listed on the policy. As shown by the letters Amalgamated sent to Blue Bird, it is foreseeable that Blue Bird might permit someone whose name did not appear on the declarations page regularly to operate one of the 157 taxicabs insured. This could happen if Blue Bird, either intentionally or unintentionally, did not notify Amalgamated of a new driver, or if Amalgamated was notified but inadvertently failed to list a driver on the declaration sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">It is also foreseeable by the insurance company that there are quite a number of other occasions in which Blue Bird taxicabs would be on the road but not operated by regularly assigned drivers, who, under Amalgamated\u2019s theory, would be uninsured. <em>Cf. Enterprise Leasing Co., supra, </em>341 Md. at 550-51, 671 A.2d 509; <em>Motor Vehicle Accident Indem. Corp. v. Continental Nat\u2019l Am. Group Co., </em>35 N.Y.2d 260, 360 N.Y.S.2d 859, 861-62, 319 N.E.2d 182, 184 (1974). For instance, Mr. Bretner testified at trial that people other than additional named insureds drove Blue Bird taxicabs to biannual state inspections and to county inspections. Often, he would drive cabs to such inspections himself, or \u201csomeone from the shop would do so.\u201d Cabs might also be driven by garage personnel in the course of determining mechanical problems or testing to see if repairs have been properly made. If these drivers are not covered by the required security, accidents in which they are involved could result in injured claimants who would have no recourse to compensation from a private insurance fund. <em>See Larimore, supra, </em>314 Md. at 625, 552 A.2d 889; <em>Jennings, supra, </em>302 Md. at 360, 488 A.2d 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We recognize that the Court of Appeals stated in <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694, 399 A.2d 877 (1979), that \u201cthere is no provision in any Maryland statute ... which requires an omnibus clause to appear in any motor vehicle liability insurance policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704-05, 399 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>A.2d 827.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. Bullock, </em>68 Md.App. 20, 509 A.2d 1217, <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 237, 517 A.2d 1120 (1986), we said that \u201cit has not been regarded against public policy in this State for an insurer to disclaim or deny coverage when an insured vehicle is being used by someone other than the \u2018named insured\u2019.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 509 A.2d 1217. We went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">It is certainly arguable, however\u2014and we think meritoriously so\u2014that where, as here, the vehicles are owned by a corporate-type entity, which has acquired them specifically for use by its employees, i.e., persons other than the named insured, public policy would indeed demand the kind of extended coverage normally provided in an omnibus clause.... We shall assume, therefore, that the Court\u2019s statement [in <em>Pinkney, supra </em>] was not intended to apply to this kind of case, and that extended coverage to employees, at least while using company vehicles within the scope of permission granted by the company, is required in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 30 n. 7, 509 A.2d 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Ms. Lamont was hired as an independent contractor and was given permission to drive a Blue Bird taxicab. The accident involving Ms. Lamont occurred while she was using the Blue Bird taxicab within the scope of permission granted to her by the company. Neither Ms. Streett nor the public generally had any way of knowing that Ms. Lamont was not covered under Blue Bird\u2019s insurance policy. We find that the situation at issue in this case is analogous to that discussed in <em>Bullock, </em>and we find the language quoted above instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">No statutory provision authorizes an insurer to exclude those who are not additional named insureds. It is the General Assembly\u2019s role to determine whether such persons are to be excluded from coverage. <em>See Enterprise Leasing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Co., supra, </em>341 Md. at 551-52, 671 A.2d 509. We will not read an exclusion into the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Appellee argues that <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Miller, </em>305 Md. 614, 505 A.2d 1338 (1986), supports its contention that exclusion (g) is not void as against public policy. In <em>Miller, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the named excluded driver endorsement prevented a passenger, who was otherwise covered as an additional insured, from collecting UM benefits when the insured vehicle was in a collision while being driven by the excluded driver. This result is mandated, however, by Maryland Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 240C-l(b)(l), which states that an \u201cinsurer may issue [a] policy but exclude all coverage when a motor vehicle is operated by the specifically named excluded person.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>sub judice, </em>Ms. Lamont was not mentioned in the policy. She therefore was not a \u201cspecifically named excluded person\u201d in the policy issued by Amalgamated. Section 240C-1 has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Appellee also argues that <em>Neale, supra, </em>supports its contention that exclusion (g) is not void as against public policy. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Neale </em>decision, like <em>Miller, </em>dealt with the \u201cnamed driver exclusion provision of the Maryland Insurance Code, Art. 48A \u00a7 240C-1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 585 A.2d 196. The Court of Appeals found in <em>Neale </em>that the purpose of the named driver exclusion provision is to allow a family automobile to remain insured, instead of having the insurance policy cancelled, by excluding from coverage a member of the household whose driving record would have warranted a cancellation of the policy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">Since the insurance policy on the vehicle remains in effect, the statutorily required security is maintained and the other spouse remains insured under the policy. If the insurer of the family car were still liable under the policy if the excluded driver operates the vehicle, on a theory of negligent entrustment by the non-excluded insured spouse, the purpose of the named driver exclusion provision would be defeated. Insurers would be indirectly liable for the injuries caused by the negligent driving of the excluded drivers despite the legislative intent to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 22, 585 A.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Amalgamated argues that <em>Miller </em>and <em>Neale </em>are apposite because Ms. Lamont was a \u201clawfully excluded\u201d driver. This argument simply begs the question. Ms. Lamont can be termed \u201clawfully excluded\u201d only if some provision of the Maryland Insurance Code explicitly or implicitly allows for such an exclusion. Article 48A, \u00a7 240C-1 does not either explicitly or implicitly allow exclusion (g) as set forth in the Blue Bird policy. As a consequence, reliance on <em>Miller </em>and <em>Neale </em>is completely misplaced.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The insurance policy issued to Blue Bird provided liability limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident. Mandatory coverage, as noted above, is only $20,000. Maryland courts have held \u201conly that an exclusion that eliminates mandatory coverage is invalid as against public policy.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>307 Md. 631, 638, 516 A.2d 586 (1986). Thus, exclusion clauses (such as exclusion (g) in this case) that are held void as against public policy are void only to the extent of the minimum statutory liability coverage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See Larimore, supra, </em>314 Md. at 622 n. 2, 552 A.2d 889; <em>State Farm, supra, </em>307 Md. at 644, 516 A.2d 586; <em>Walther v.

The policy covered 69 vehicles that were listed as part of the \"Blue Bird\u201d fleet at the $93.79 premium. It also covered 20 vehicles listed as part of the \"Suburban\" fleet, all at the same $93.79 premium. Another 68 covered vehicles were listed as part of the \"Yellow\u201d fleet. The premium on most of these was $93.79; the premium on the rest was $101.44. We are not sure what the various \"fleet\u201d designations indicate. We note, however, that on cross-examination, Mr. Bretner stated that he was running several taxicab companies besides Blue Bird in 1989, including Action Cab, Yellow Cab, and Laurel Cab.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-12\">.

In fairness to the trial judge, this issue was not briefed by either party in the trial court. The only mention of the void as against public policy argument came when appellant responded to appellee\u2019s motion for judgment at the close of appellant's case. The attorney for Blue Bird stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">Your Honor is well aware of the cases such as <em>Jennings </em>vs. <em>GEICO, State Farm </em>vs. <em>Nationwide, </em>and other cases in the Court of Appeals.

It's in the policy. You will also look at that policy in which there is a policy provision that says that we are issuing you Blue Bird, our policy, and we are complying with the Financial Responsibility Act of your State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Appellant\u2019s attorney then segued into a discussion as to why Blue Bird\u2019s waiver argument had merit.

Exclusion of named driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">(a)(1) In any case where an insurer is authorized under this article to cancel or nonrenew or increase the premiums on an automobile liability insurance policy issued in this State to any resident of a household, under which more than 1 person is insured because of the claim experience or driving record or 1 or more but less than all of the persons insured under the policy, the insurer shall in lieu of cancellation, nonrenewal, or premium increase offer to continue or renew the insurance, but to exclude all coverage when a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>vehicle is operated by the specifically named excluded person or persons whose claim experience or driving record would have justified the cancellation or nonrenewal. The policy may be endorsed to specifically exclude all coverage for any of the following when the named excluded driver is operating the motor vehicle(s) covered under the policy whether or not that operation or use was with the express or implied permission of a person insured under the policy:</p>\n<p id=\"A7d\">(1) The excluded operator or user;</p>\n<p id=\"A1o\">(ii) The vehicle owner;</p>\n<p id=\"Ajp\">(iii) Family members residing in the household of the excluded operator or user or vehicle owner; and</p>\n<p id=\"Amt\">(iv) Any other person, except for the coverage required by \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541(c)(2) of this article if such coverage is not available under any other automobile policy.</p>\n<p id=\"AUY\">(2) The premiums charged on any policy excluding a named driver or drivers under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not reflect the claims experience or driving record of the excluded named driver or drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"AgC\">(b)(1) In any case where an insurer could legally refuse to issue a policy of automobile liability insurance under which more than 1 person is insured because of the claim experience or driving record of 1 or more but less than all of the persons applying to be insured under the policy, the insurer may issue the policy but exclude all coverage when a motor vehicle is operated by the specifically named excluded person or persons whose claim experience or driving record could have justified the refusal to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AUZx\">(2) The policy may be endorsed to specifically exclude all coverage for any of the following when the named excluded driver is operating the motor vehicle(s) covered under the policy whether or not that operation or use was with the express or implied permission of a person insured under the policy:</p>\n<p id=\"A2A\">(i) The excluded operator or user;</p>\n<p id=\"Ags\">(ii) The vehicle owner;</p>\n<p id=\"AB9\">(iii) Family members residing in the household of the excluded operator or user or vehicle owner; and</p>\n<p id=\"AFA\">(iv) Any other person, except for the coverage required by \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541(c)(2) of this article if such coverage is not available under any other automobile policy.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Q\">(3) The premiums charged on any policy excluding a named driver or drivers under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection may not reflect the claims experience or driving record of the excluded named driver or drivers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\">. Appellee cites only one other case in support of its position that the exclusion is not void as against public policy, <em>i.e., Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund v. Sun Cab Co., Inc., </em>305 Md. 807, 506 A.2d 641 (1986). In that case, the Court of Appeals held that Maryland Code (1957, 1994 Repl.VoL), Art. 48A, \u00a7 538(b) clearly and unambiguously exempts taxicabs from carrying UM insurance. <em>Sun Cab Co. </em>plainly has no relevance to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b419-5\">. Appellant never contended in the lower court that Blue Bird was entitled to coverage above the statutory minimum. It argued the opposite in response to appellee\u2019s motion for judgment, stating that the trial court should declare that \"[t]he Financial Responsibility Act in this ambiguous phrase, requires to the Court [sic] to define that there is coverage for Blue Bird Cab Company in the amount of $20,000 per person, $40,000 per occurrence in this accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\">. This Court recently recognized this rule in <em>Popa, supra, </em>108 Md.App. at 86-88, 670 A.2d 1021, as applied to liability limits. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">When applied in the context of <em>liability </em>coverage, as illustrated by <em>State Farm, Larimore, </em>and <em>Walther, </em>this rule allows for the application of an otherwise invalid exception above the $20,000/$40,000 threshold. The reason for this is the legislature's intent that each insured have coverage in at least those amounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">By contrast, when applied in the context of uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, the principle announced in the cited cases does not necessarily allow for the application of an otherwise invalid exception above the $20,000/$40,000 minimum. The legislature intended that an insured be allowed to collect up to the limits of his uninsured motorist coverage. The difference between the liability coverage context and the uninsured motorist coverage context was implicitly recognized in <em>Powell. </em>There, we noted that if an exclusion in an uninsured motorist policy were invalid, it would only be invalid up to the $20,000/$40,000 minimum; but we immediately qualified this statement by inserting a footnote recognizing the legislative intent that an insured be paid up to the limits of his uninsured motorist coverage. <em>See Powell </em>[v. <em>State Farm Ins. </em>Co.], 86 Md.App. [98] at 113 n. 4 [585 A.2d 286 (1991) ] (citing <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Souras, </em>78 Md.App. 71, 75-76 [552 A.2d 908] (1989)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The provisions in West American\u2019s policy that exclude government-owned vehicles from the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d are void because they violate the legislatively-announced public policy of Maryland.
