(Safeway). She presents two issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-13\">1.

Beyond the double doors is a storage area or stockroom, described by one witness as the store\u2019s back room. Whatever its characterization, it is clearly a nonretail area designed to support the public, retail areas of the store. In that nonpublic area, beyond the doors bearing the \u201cNo Admittance\u201d signs, is a nine-foot wide, ninety-foot long passageway. Appellant was directed to walk down that passageway to reach the rest room. Notably, the store is equipped with two other rest room facilities, adjacent to an employee lounge area on an upper floor, which are accessible by a stairway located just beyond the rest room at issue. Appellant indicated at trial that she went up and down the path three times in search of the facility; it was on her third pass that she slipped and fell on what she described as a piece of twine or rope, sustaining severe injuries, resulting in the amputation of a toe.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Appellant brought suit against appellee on negligence grounds, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellee had breached its \u201cduty to reasonably maintain and inspect the premises in issue.\u201d The issues of liability and damages were bifurcated, and the four-day trial commenced on February 27, 1995. At the close of appellant\u2019s case-in-chief, appellee moved for judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ment, relying largely on CJ \u00a7 5-378 and the immunity granted thereby. The trial court reserved ruling on the motion, and appellee presented its case. At the close of all the evidence, appellee renewed its Motion for Judgment, relying on the same grounds as previously iterated. The trial court again reserved ruling thereon, and the case was submitted to the jury, which returned a verdict in favor of appellant. By special verdict, the jury found as fact the following: that the rest room at issue was not an employee facility; that the facility was a public rest room; that Safeway was negligent; and that appellant was not contributorily negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Appellee then filed a Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, Motion for a New Trial, Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment, and Motion to Vacate Judgment. Safeway argued that CJ \u00a7 5-378 was designed to shield retailers from liability in precisely the situation presented by the case at bar. It also claimed that appellant had failed to present sufficient proof that the rest room at issue was a public, rather than an employee, facility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A hearing on the Motion was held May 10, 1995, after which the trial court, stating that the statute \u201cwas designed exactly for this situation,\u201d ruled in favor of appellee on the Motions for Judgment upon which it had earlier reserved ruling. Judgment was entered accordingly, notwithstanding the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Appellant filed the instant appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">APPELLATE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">We note at the outset that Maryland Rule 2\u2014532(b) provides that a motion for judgment, made at the close of all the evidence and upon which the trial court reserves ruling, \u201cbecomes a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the verdict is against the moving party.\u201d <em>See also McSlarrow v. Walker, </em>56 Md.App. 151, 154 n. 1, 467 A.2d 196 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 137, 472 A.2d 1000 (1984). \u201c[A] motion ... n.o.v. tests the legal sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d <em>Impala Platinum Ltd. v.

Tighe, </em>100 Md.App. 655, 663, 642 A.2d 309 (1994). To this end, we \u201cassume[ ] the truth of all credible evidence and all inferences of fact reasonably deducible from the evidence supporting the party opposing the motion. If there exists any legally competent evidence, however slight, from which the jury could have found as they did, a j.n.o.v. would be improper.\u201d <em>Huppman, </em>100 Md.App. at 663, 642 A.2d 309; <em>see also Dennard v. Green, </em>335 Md. 305, 322-23, 643 A.2d 422 (1994) (quoting <em>Impala Platinum, </em>283 Md. at 328, 389 A.2d 887); <em>Levine v.

Hornbeck, </em>285 Md. 84, 92, 400 A.2d 1091 (1979); <em>Mazor v. Department of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 360, 369 A.2d 82 (1977); <em>Board of Supervisors of Elections v. Weiss, </em>217 Md. 133, 136, 141 A.2d 734 (1958). \u201cThe language of the statute itself is the primary source of this intent....\u201d <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744, 580 A.2d 188 (1990); <em>see also Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730 (1986). Where the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts do not normally look beyond the words of the statute itself. <em>Giant of Maryland, Inc. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>267 Md. 501, 512, 298 A.2d 427, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>412 U.S. 915, 93 S.Ct. 2733, 37 L.Ed.2d 141 (1973); <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 414, 237 A.2d 35 (1968). <em>But see Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387-88, 614 A.2d 590 (1992); <em>Kaczorowski v.

To this end, the words are to be accorded their ordinary and generally understood signification, absent evidence to the contrary. <em>Brodsky v. Brodsky, </em>319 Md. 92, 98, 570 A.2d 1235 (1990); <em>Privette, </em>320 Md. at 744-45, 580 A.2d 188; <em>Mazor, </em>279 Md. at 360, 369 A.2d 82. Care must be given to avoid construing a statute by forced or subtle interpretations. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., </em>303 Md. 280, 284, 493 A.2d 341 (1985).

Moreover, \u201c[i]f reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, phrase, clause or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless.\u201d <em>Mazor, </em>279 Md. at 360, 369 A.2d 82. \u201cStatutes are enacted to further an underlying goal, aim, or purpose, and must be interpreted in accordance with their general purposes and policies.\u201d <em>Toft v. State of Nevada ex rel. Ali Pimentel, </em>108 Md.App. 206, 671 A.2d 99 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">In tracing the legislative history of the relevant statute, CJ \u00a7 5-378, since its inception and the inception of its predeces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>sors, we note that, prior to 1987, retail establishments in Maryland were not required to allow customers or patrons access to their nonpublic rest rooms. Generally, prior to 1987, a merchant could protect himself from liability toward invitees in respect to rest room facilities by denying customers access to those private rest rooms. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 332 cmt. 1 (1965); 62 Am.Jur.2d <em>Premises Liability </em>\u00a7 102 (1990) (\u201cIf a person ... goes to a place not covered by the invitation, the ... duty of care owed to such person as an invitee ceases forthwith.... [Tjhere can be no recovery for resulting injury, even though he is an invitee to other parts of the premises.\u201d (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In 1986, in an attempt to capitalize upon a statute that required businesses to maintain one bathroom for every fifteen employees, proponents of a measure to require businesses to allow patrons to utilize those rest rooms prompted introduction of a bill in the Maryland Senate that read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">At the request of a customer, each retail business establishment that has a toilet facility for its employees shall allow the customer to use the facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">S.B. 516 (1986). Notably, as written, Senate Bill 516 provided customers unlimited access to private rest room facilities without regard to the retailers\u2019 potential liability for injuries sustained by patrons concurrent with their use of the facilities. As initially written, therefore, it would have required retailers to expose themselves to substantial liability. The bill met with strong opposition in both the Legislature and the retail community. Proposed amendments limiting the scope of the statute to businesses with twenty or more employees were not able to assuage its opponents\u2019 security and liability concerns. The bill did not pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The bill was rewritten and reintroduced in 1987, with significantly more limitations, \u201c[i]n an attempt to exempt the \u2018Mom and Pop\u2019 operations, and to limit the extent of the bill to those who were truly in need of immediate access to toilet facilities because of a medical problem.\u201d Retail Establishments\u2014Toi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>let Facilities: Hearings on S.B. 413 Before the Environmental Matters Committee (1987) (Testimony of Senator Barbara Hoffman). Specifically, under Senate Bill 413, only <em>certain </em>retail businesses with employee rest room facilities were required, under <em>certain </em>limited circumstances, to permit customers to use those rest rooms.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">The intent of th[e] bill [was] to require a retail establishment with 20 or more employees to allow a customer access to the establishment\u2019s toilet facility if the customer has a medical condition that requires immediate access to a toilet facility ... [and] to provide access to toilet facilities for a small part of the population whose medical conditions require such access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee, Summary of Committee Report, S.B. 413 (1987). Enacted as Maryland Code (1982, 1987 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 24-209 of the Health-General Article (HG),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chapter 351 of the 1987 Laws required an \u201cestablishment with 20 or more employees that ha[d] a toilet facility for its employees ... [to] allow the customer to use the facility,\u201d when a public rest room was not available. At the same time, the statute responded to other concerns earlier expressed by the statute\u2019s opponents. First, the statute narrowly defined a \u201ccustomer\u201d as an individual who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">(1) Suffers from Crohn\u2019s Disease, ulcerative colitis or any other inflammatory bowel disease, or any other medical condition that requires immediate access to a toilet facility; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">(2) Utilizes an ostomy device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">HG \u00a7 24-209(a). Then, for the first time, this bill incorporated the provisions with which we are primarily concerned in the instant case in then subsection (d) of HG \u00a7 24-209. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>prior section shielded the business as well as its employees from civil liability</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">for any act or omission in allowing a customer to use a toilet facility that is not a public toilet facility[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">(1) The act or omission is not willful or one of gross negligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">(2) The act or omission occurs in an area of the retail establishment that is not accessible to the public; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">(3) The act or omission results in an injury to or death of the customer or anyone other than an employee accompanying the customer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">While the bill mandated that a business owner allow access to special-need customers under certain circumstances, thus exposing those businesses to significant liability, it further granted them immunity, in the absence of willful or gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">In 1989, the immunity of HG \u00a7 24-209 was \u201cexpanded] ... to retail establishments of any size which voluntarily allow[ed] any customer to use an employee toilet facility.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report, H.B. 162 (1989). House Bill 162<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> fashioned two separate and independent sections, HG \u00a7 24-209 and HG \u00a7 24-210, out of what had theretofore been one section, namely HG \u00a7 24-209. In moving subsection (d) of HG \u00a7 24-209, House Bill 162 created the new HG \u00a7 24-210, providing that it applied not only to employee facilities but also to all nonpublic facilities and separated the provisions conferring immunity from those requiring a retailer to provide certain special-need customers access to rest rooms maintained primarily for employee use. This separation was largely in response to the Legislature\u2019s pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>pose and intent to \u201cexpand[ ] the circumstances under which retail establishments are immune from civil liability ... and generally relating to the use of nonpublic restrooms in retail establishments.\u201d 1989 Md.Laws, Chap. 387. The remaining sections of HG \u00a7 24-209, <em>i.e., </em>subsections (a), (b), and (c), remained substantively unchanged in the separation. On the other hand, the scope of those customers to which the provisions of HG \u00a7 24-209 had applied was significantly altered to include any person \u201clawfully on the premises of a retail establishment.\u201d HG \u00a7 24-210(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We note' that House Bill 162 was captioned: <em>Retail Establishments\u2014Toilet Facilities\u2014Immunity from Civil Liability. </em>When HG \u00a7 24-210 was first codified, however, the codifiers entitled it, \u201cSame\u2014Civil Liability of Retail Establishment or Employee.\u201d By inserting \u201cSame,\u201d the codifiers were saying that HG \u00a7 24-210 related to, and incorporated, the provisions of the next preceding section\u2014HG \u00a7 24-209. This use of \u201cSame,\u201d as relating back to HG \u00a7 24-209, appeared to limit the applicability of <em>both </em>sections to employee facilities. In using that titling, the codifiers erred. While House Bill 162 reenacted HG \u00a7 24-209 in respect to employee rest rooms and the special class of customers it had previously affected, it also added a completely separate, new section, HG \u00a7 24-210, that did not limit its provisions solely to \u201cemployee\u201d rest rooms. It created immunity in respect to the use of <em>any </em>nonpublie facility. Both sections shared the same legislative history until House Bill 162 was enacted; that bill created wholly separate statutory sections. To simplify the difference, HG \u00a7 24-209 only applies when employee facilities are used by those suffering from certain disorders. HG \u00a7 24-210 applies in all other instances. There is no evidence that appellant qualifies under HG \u00a7 24-209, as she does not suffer from the maladies therein described; her suit, of necessity, was based on her use pursuant to HG \u00a7 24-210, as later restated in CJ \u00a7 5-378.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In 1990, the Legislature, consolidating related immunity statutes in House Bill 206, repealed and reenacted the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>stance of HG \u00a7 24-210 as CJ \u00a7 5-378.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 1990 Md.Laws, Chap. 546. The consolidation parroted the language of HG \u00a7 24-210, but included no title. Because, however, the codifiers had improperly titled HG \u00a7 24-210, as we have previously indicated, they similarly improperly titled CJ \u00a7 5-378 to indicate that the section applied to a customer\u2019s use of employee facilities. HG \u00a7 24-210 had never been so limited and neither is C J \u00a7 5-378. Thus, our primary concern, as we indicate elsewhere, is the public or private nature of a facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Prior to the consolidation, HG \u00a7 24-210, with the titling error omitted, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">Civil liability of retail establishment or employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">(a) <em>\u201cCustomer\u201d </em>defined.\u2014In this section, \u201ccustomer\u201d means an individual who is lawfully on the premises of a retail establishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">(b) <em>In </em>general.\u2014A retail establishment and any employee of a retail establishment are not civilly liable for any act or omission in allowing a customer, including a customer as defined in \u00a7 24-209 of this subtitle, to use a toilet facility that is not a public toilet facility, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">(1) The act or omission is not willful or one of gross negligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">(2) The act or omission occurs in an area of the retail establishment that is not accessible to the public; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">(3) The act or omission results in an injury to or death of the customer or anyone other than an employee accompanying the customer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-12\">(c) <em>Employee toilet not public </em>restroom.\u2014Notwithstanding any provision of this section, an employee toilet facility is not to be considered a public restroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">That same language is now found in CJ \u00a7 5-378. It is that statute and that language that we apply in resolving the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A88\">THE STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">It is clear that the original statute\u2019s passage would not have been possible had it not been modified to afford retail businesses partial immunity from liability for injuries sustained by patrons utilizing their rest room facilities. Our review of the legislative history has provided us with important insights, which illustrate an increase in the scope of the current statutes from the original statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Not only have the statutes been amended to apply to all retail establishments, but the kind of customers to whom the statutes apply has also been expanded. Originally applying solely to those suffering from various medical disorders, the statute currently encompasses any person \u201clawfully on the premises of a retail establishment.\u201d CJ \u00a7 5-378(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">More important, however, is the evolution of the statutory language, particularly that which specifically sets forth the requirement of accessibility. It demonstrates a move away from requiring access for a limited class of persons solely to rest rooms maintained for employees, HG \u00a7 24-209, to include any permissive use of facilities that are not available for general, unrestricted use by the general public. As it stands, CJ \u00a7 5-378(b) requires compliance in respect to facilities that are \u201cnot ... public toilet facilities].\u201d In so doing, the current formulation clearly contemplates that not every nonpublie facility to which a customer will be directed will be an employee facility. Thus, what had begun in 1986 (in Senate Bill 516) as an attempt to mandate that all retail businesses allow all customers unlimited access to their rest rooms, without regard to their liability therefor, evolved into two statutes that currently provide that certain customers with specified physical disorders <em>must </em>be allowed access to employee rest rooms, HG \u00a7 24-209, and that all others <em>may be </em>allowed access to any nonpublic facility. HG \u00a7 24-210 and now CJ \u00a7 5-378. In either event, the retail establishment will be immune from suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>in respect to such use of its private and/or employee rest rooms so long as its actions are not willful or grossly negligent, CJ \u00a7 5\u2014878(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">It is appellant\u2019s position that the rest room is, in fact, one available for use by the general public, thus stripping appellee of any immunity. Appellee approaches the issue from a different angle, claiming that appellant failed to introduce sufficient evidence to establish that the rest room was not an employee facility. The appropriate distinction under the statute that applies in the instant matter, CJ \u00a7 5-378, is between <em>public </em>and <em>private </em>facilities. The parties, however, distinguished between <em>public </em>and <em>employee </em>rest rooms. Within this statutory framework, subsection (c) of CJ \u00a7 5-378, regarding employee facilities, functions merely as a predetermination of the status of employees\u2019 facilities: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of this section, an employee facility is not to be considered a public restroom.\u201d Employee rest rooms, no matter where situated, are never to be considered \u201cpublic.\u201d This confusion may have resulted from the erroneous titling of the statutory sections by the codifiers. Thus, as to employee facilities, the immunity provisions will always apply, even if they are located in the public area of a retail establishment. In other words, while an employee rest room will always be a private, <em>i.e., </em>nonpublic, rest room, it cannot be said that a private rest room will always be an employee rest room. That said, there still remains some question as to what exactly differentiates a public facility from a private one.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u201cPUBLIC\u201d DEFINED</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The indices of many reference works are replete with numerous references to various types of public entitlements and functions, but there are few references to conceptual definitions of the term \u201cpublic.\u201d We shall set forth a number of those references:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">Generally speaking, a public place is a place or area where the public, as a whole, has a right to be.

Rafala, </em>141 Conn. 121, 104 A.2d 214 (1954), in which the plaintiff was patronizing the grocery store of the defendant. There was a rest room in a nonpublic area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>of the store, which she sought permission to use. She was told, \u201cRight that way in back of you.\u201d In route to the rest room, she took a wrong turn into a storeroom and then into a doorway and fell into the basement, injuring herself. There was no sign in the store indicating the location of the rest room. It was intended for employee use, but patrons were generally permitted to use it as well. Because customers were permitted and accustomed to use the rest rooms, the court found that it was thus within the scope of the invitation extended to customers. It went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">The present case is therefore distinguishable from cases where, in an isolated instance, permission to use a private toilet was extended to an individual customer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">104 A.2d at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">We further note the definitions of the term \u201cpublic\u201d as recognized in various dictionaries. The term has been defined as \u201c[o]pen to all,\u201d \u201copen to common use,\u201d \u201cnot limited or restricted to any particular class of the community.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>642 (Abr. 5th ed. 1983). In setting forth the meaning of matters that are public in nature, <em>Black\u2019s </em>differentiates them from any others using the term \u201cprivate.\u201d Indeed, a \u201cpublic place\u201d is defined as one \u201cto which the general public has a right to resort; not necessarily a place devoted solely to the uses of the public, but a place which is in point of fact public rather than private.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644. The words \u201copenly ... as opposed to private\u201d are used in defining the term \u201cpublicly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643. <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>1162 (Unabr.1983 ed.) proffers these relevant definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">for ... the community as a whole ... open to all the people ... open to the public generally ... open to the view or knowledge of all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-9\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1836 (Unabr.1961 ed.) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">accessible to or shared by all members of the community ... for the benefit of the people as a whole ... exposed to general view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary </em>690 (1972 ed.) and <em>Merriamr-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>944 (10th ed. 1993) define \u201cpublic\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">accessible to or shared by all members of the community ... exposed to general view ... open.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We thus summarize the various definitions of the term \u201cpublic\u201d that we have discussed: A place open to the general circulation of the public; a place where all persons have a right to go; a place open to all; a place to which the general public has a right to resort; a place accessible or visible to all members of the public; a place used by the general community; where all persons are entitled to be; a place patently to be used by members of the public; a place designed for public use; a place exposed to public view; and the right to unrestricted use by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">A review of these definitions, the cases we have cited, and the history of the statutes at issue leads us to formulate a more concise definition of \u201cpublic\u201d as it relates to the characterization of rest rooms within the parameter of the applicable statute. We hold that a public rest room is one that is (1) generally unlocked<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and devoid of other barriers to its entry, (2) available for the unrestricted use of the general public, (3) situated in an area of the retail establishment to which the general public is invited to participate in the primary activities of the establishment, (4) duly identifiable as a public rest room by way of signs, such as \u201cRest Rooms,\u201d \u201cMens,\u201d \u201cLadies,\u201d in open view in the retail areas of the store, and (5) for which no permission need be obtained before use. With this in mind, we turn to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">THE INSTANT APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Both on brief and at argument, appellant contends that appellee failed to meet its burden of proving the applicability of the immunity granted by CJ \u00a7 5-378, citing <em>Yost v. Early, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>87 Md.App. 364, 380, 589 A.2d 1291, <em>cert. denied, </em>324 Md. 123, 596 A.2d 628 (1991), in support thereof. We disagree. To meet its burden, Safeway must have presented facts that supported its claim that the facility at issue is not a public rest room. We hold that it did. Uncontradicted evidence adduced at trial clearly established the following: Customers sought permission or at least directions to utilize the rest room while in the store; a key, located at the front office, was generally needed to gain entrance to the facility;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cNo Admittance\u201d signs delineated the area not accessible to the store\u2019s patrons and the rest room at issue was in that area; no signs in the retail portion of the store indicated the location of the rest room; and appellant herself saw the need either to request whether she could use a rest room on the premises or to request directions to the facility. Moreover, as we have indicated, the facility was in a storage or stockroom area where no retail sales activity occurred. Additionally, it was clearly in the nonretail area of the store where management could not normally be expected to take special precautions for safe transit by patrons invited to the retail sales area of the store. Each of these facts militate against characterizing the facility as public in nature. They run counter to the precepts that compel the characterization of something as public. Thus, the facility to which appellant was directed on the day in question cannot reasonably be characterized as a public rest room available for use by the general public. In the context of this case, whether the rest room at issue was an employee rest room, or whether it was occasionally used by employees, is not significant. The trial court simply determined that it was not a \u201cpublic\u201d rest room. Indeed, it is the purpose of the statute to encourage use by its provision of immunity in the first instance. Moreover, the fact that the store, with some regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>larity,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> directed patrons to that rest room, does not render the facility accessible within the meaning of the statute. There was no substantial evidence, other than the use that the statute was intended to facilitate, that supported appellant\u2019s contention that the facility was a public rest room. Moreover, the statute cannot be logically interpreted to mean that a store\u2019s permissive (\u201callowing\u201d) use, pursuant to the statute, renders the rest room \u201caccessible\u201d and, thus, the statute inapplicable. We, therefore, reject, as a legal oxymoron, appellant\u2019s contention that the very use the statute was designed to promote negates the immunity granted thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In pertinent part, the court stated, in granting appellee\u2019s two motions for judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">[Y]ou recall that during the course of the trial at the end of the plaintiffs case and the defendant\u2019s case, I reserved ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment. And that\u2019s precisely why I did, because I took a long look at that statute. And there was not much help ... in the precedent. It\u2019s state law. And it seems to me it was designed exactly for this situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The trial court\u2019s ruling expressed its belief that the rest room at issue was private and, because the statute confers immunity on a business that permits use of its private rest rooms, appellant was not entitled to recovery. We agree. \u2022 Moreover, there was insufficient evidence that appellee acted, or failed to act, in a willful or grossly negligent manner. The trial court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Under the statute, employee rest room facilities, those provided for the sole use and convenience of employees, cannot be public facilities. CJ \u00a7 5-378(c). Other types of facilities may, or may not, be public depending upon the facts of a specific case. That determination will most often be made by an evaluation of such factors as ease of access, ease of entry, necessity for permission, location and signs indicating same, and barriers to entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In arguing its motion, appellee\u2019s trial counsel stated in respect to appellant\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">Their argument is use, that the use of this rest room therefore made it a public rest room [and made it accessible]. And that argument defies the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We agree. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">And according to the statute, an employee toilet facility does not become a public toilet facility through customer use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">And to read that into the statute defies the purpose and the logic of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">While the status of the rest room as an employee rest room is not determinative in the case at bar, if it were relevant, we would agree that appellant\u2019s position in respect to it would defy logic.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">Judge Melbourne then opined:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">I took a long look at that statute---- It\u2019s state law. And it seems to me it was designed exactly for this situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">... [A]nd I\u2019m going to grant a judgment in favor of the defendant. And let\u2019s see what our Appellate Courts do with that statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">This opinion, we trust, will satisfy Judge Melbourne\u2019s curiosity.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">We hold that occasional use by customers of an otherwise private rest room does not render it a public rest room. To hold otherwise would defeat the purpose of the statute and would be counter to the public policy established thereby, which was to encourage retail establishments to permit cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tomers to use private bathrooms by conferring partial immunity on them when such use is permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-14\">.

Appellant notes that there was evidence that the facility might have been used upwards of 2,000 times a year by patrons of the store. At first impression, this would appear to be a sizeable number. Upon closer examination, however, the numbers translate into approximately five to six uses per day. Given the propensity of supermarkets to remain open up to twelve, sixteen, or even twenty-four hours a day, the figure quoted by appellant is further reduced to one use every three to five hours. Clearly, a genuinely \"public\u201d restroom, situate in the active retail area of a supermarket, would be in use exponentially more often. The minimal use of the rest room at issue, z.e., five times a day, is, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, simply further evidence of its nonpublic nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
