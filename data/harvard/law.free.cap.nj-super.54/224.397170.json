J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AiQ\">This is an appeal, taken by leave granted pursuant to <em>R. R. </em>2:2-3, from an order of the Superior Court, Law Division, striking as insufficient in law <em>(R. R. </em>4:12-6) the affirmative defense interposed in each of eight consolidated actions. Eour were commenced in the district court and the rest in the Law Division; all eight were consolidated in the Superior Court. The cases present identical questions of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Plaintiff in each case is a distributor of motion pictures and is suing defendant, which operates a drive-in motion picture theatre in Somerville, N. J., for the balance of license fees allegedly due under license agreements for the exhibition of plaintiff\u2019s films. The complaints are identical except for plaintiff\u2019s name and the amount of damages sought. We may therefore treat one complaint as typical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>of the others and, for the moment, refer to the respective plaintiffs as \u201cplaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The complaint, as amplified by the pretrial order, alleges that plaintiff, by means of license agreements, granted defendant the right to exhibit at its theatre and at certain fixed times various copyrighted motion pictures distributed by it. Defendant was to pay a license fee, known as a percentage rental, in an amount determinable by a percentage of the gross box office receipts. Defendant\u2019s original admission charge was <em>70&lt;f, </em>for each patron over 12 years of age. Beginning with the fall of 1954 defendant concededly charged 80^, except for certain brief periods. In accounting to plaintiff for gross box office receipts for the purpose of computing and paying percentage rentals, defendant reported its receipts at only 70$\u00bf per patron. Plaintiff claims the unpaid percentage balance due on the remaining 10jh Defendant alleges that the unreported 10^ represented a charge to patrons for the use of car heaters supplied during cold weather, or for the privilege of their children\u2019s use during the summer months of a small playground located on the theatre premises. It contends that such charges should not be considered part of the admission fee. Defendant concedes that if this contention is not upheld, the eight plaintiffs will be entitled to claims aggregating $9,020.57. However, in addition to denying liability, defendant raises the affirmative defense that plaintiff cannot recover because the license agreements sued upon are illegal and unenforceable, in that they violate the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1 to 7, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Plaintiffs distribute over 90% of the films available for exhibition at defendant\u2019s theatre. The business of distributing and licensing motion pictures is conceded to be in interstate commerce. The defense alleges that the \u201crun\u201d and \u201cclearance\u201d provisions in the license agreements \u201cset the time when a theatre operator may exhibit a certain picture in relation to the time when said picture is exhibited in other theatres\u201d; that these provisions are integral parts of the agreements and substantially affect the license fee terms; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>and that \u201cclearance\u201d is legal only when reasonable. Defendant further alleges that it requested, but was refused, \u201ca run free and clear of clearance over defendant\u2019s theatre from any other theatre\u201d; that any run in its theatre which was based on clearance in favor of any other theatre, or which conditioned the time when defendant could exhibit a picture upon the time when any other theatre exhibited, or upon any fact other than the general release of the picture in New Jersey, is unreasonable, arbitrary and illegal. Defendant also claims that the refusal of the several plaintiffs to agree to license their pictures on the terms defendant had requested, was the result of a conspiracy among them (in which certain unnamed exhibitors also participated) to impose upon defendant a uniform system of runs and clearances which it was obliged to accept in order to obtain films. All these actions, it is alleged, effected an unreasonable, restraint on interstate commerce, and hence violated the Sherman Act. Defendant demanded judgment dismissing the several complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike the defense as insufficient, the trial judge held it to be settled law that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">\u201c* * * the contracts of an unlawful combination, or its members, which are collateral to and independent of the unlawful contract by which the conspiracy was created, and which are not in furtherance of its unlawful purpose, are valid and enforceable. It is generally agreed that the mere fact that the plaintiff is a member of an unlawful conspiracy or combination, created with the intent and purpose of restraining trade or' establishing a monopoly, will not disable or prevent it in law from selling goods or services within or affected by the provisions of such trust or combination, and recovering their price or value, either at common law or under statutes making unlawful contracts in restraint of trade or commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">He concluded that the alleged illegality pleaded by defendant was collateral to the contracts in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Plaintiffs argue, and defendant readily concedes, that the system of staggered releases of motion pictures, whereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>certain theatres exhibit a particular picture ahead of others, <em>i. e., </em>on an earlier \"run,\u201d is an economic necessity in the motion picture business and has judicially * been sanctioned when reasonably employed. <em>Fanchon &amp; Marco v. Paramount Pictures, </em>100 <em>F. Supp. </em>84, 89 <em>et seq. (D. C. S. D. Cal. </em>1951), affirmed 215 <em>F. 2d </em>167 (9 <em>Cir. </em>1954), <em>certiorari </em>denied 348 <em>U. S. </em>912, 75 <em>S. Ct. </em>293, 99 <em>L. Ed. </em>715 (1955). It is also well settled that no exhibitor has a right, as a matter of law, to a priority of run. <em>Paramount Pictures Theatres Corp. v. Partmar Corp., </em>97 <em>F. Supp. </em>552, 559 <em>(D. C. S. D. Cal. </em>1951), affirmed on opinion below 200 <em>F. 2d </em>561 (9 <em>Cir. </em>1952), affirmed 347 <em>U. S. </em>89, 74 <em>S. Ct. </em>414, 98 <em>L. Ed. </em>532 (1954), rehearing denied 347 <em>U. S. </em>931, 74 <em>S. Ct. </em>527, 98 <em>L. Ed. </em>1083 (1954); <em>Orbo Theatre Corp. v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., </em>156 <em>F. Supp. </em>770, 779 <em>(D. C. D. C. </em>1957). Defendant, however, insists that the clearance and run provisions inserted in the licenses in suit are unreasonable and arbitrary, and therefore illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Clearance and run provisions in a film license contract fix the time when a theatre may exhibit the licensed picture. The meaning of \"clearance\u201d was set out in the leading case of <em>United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., </em>66 <em>F. Supp. </em>323 (statutory court <em>D. C. S. D. N. Y. </em>1946); findings, conclusions and decree published in 70 <em>F. Supp. </em>53 <em>(D. C. S. D. N. Y. </em>1947); affirmed in part and reversed in part, 334 <em>U. S. </em>131, 68 <em>S. Ct. </em>915, 92 <em>L. Ed. </em>1260 (1948). The lower court there said (66 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>page </em>341):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201cAmong provisions common to the licensing contracts of all the distributor-defendants are those by which the licensor agrees not to exhibit or grant a license to exhibit a certain motion picture before a specified number of days after the last date of the exhibition therein licensed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The United States Supreme Court in the same case (334 <em>U. S. </em>at <em>page </em>144, 68 <em>S. Ct. </em>at <em>page </em>923) said that \"Clearances are designed to protect a particular run of a film against a subsequent run.\u201d In the findings of fact of the statutory court, reported in 70 <em>F. Supp. </em>53, at <em>page </em>54, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>clearance is defined as \u201cthe period of time, usually stipulated in license contracts, which must elapse between runs of the same feature within a particular area or in specified theatres.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><em>We </em>note, in passing, that a clearance is not illegal <em>per se, </em>even though it may restrict trade to some extent. As was squarely held by the statutory court in <em>United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., </em>above, 66 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>page </em>341 <em>et seq.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201c* \u00ab * a grant of a clearance, when not accompanied by a fixing of minimum prices or not unduly extended as to area or duration, affords a fair protection to the interests of the licensee without unreasonably interfering with the interests of the public. * * * [L]icenses between one distributor and one exhibitor with reasonable clearance provisions do not, in our opinion, involve anything unlawful. Such provisions are no more than safeguards against concurrent or subsequent licenses in the same area until the exhibitor whose theatre is involved has had a chance to exhibit the pictures licensed without invasion by a subsequent exhibitor at a lower price. It seems nothing more than an adoption of the common law rule to restrict subsequent exhibitions for a reasonable time within a reasonable area.\u201d (The court was here referring to its comment that at common law \u201ca vendor of income-producing property may validly covenant with his purchaser not to compete for a given time or within a given area so long as the restrictions are reasonably necessary to protect the value of the property purchased.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">This holding was left undisturbed on appeal, 334 <em>U. S. </em>at <em>page </em>145, 68 <em>S. Ct. </em>at <em>page </em>923. And see <em>Fanchon &amp; Marco v. Paramount Pictures, </em>above, 100 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>page </em>89. The rule accords with our law relating to negative restrictive covenants of a similar character. <em>Voices, Inc. v. Metal Tone Mfg. Co., </em>119 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>324 <em>(Ch. </em>1936), affirmed 120 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>618 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1936), <em>certiorari </em>denied 300 <em>U. S. </em>656, 57 <em>S. Ct. </em>433, 81 <em>L. Ed. </em>866 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\u201cRuns\u201d are defined as \u201cthe successive exhibitions of a feature in a given area, first-run being the first exhibition in that area, second-run being the next subsequent, and so on.\u201d <em>United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., </em>70 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>page </em>55. In short, the \u201crun\u201d determines the sequence in which a theatre may exhibit a particular pic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ture with reference to the sequence of exhibition in other theatres which enjoy a prior run, and \u201cclearance\u201d sets the time which must elapse between the showing of the picture at different theatres.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In elaboration of its affirmative defense, defendant contends that plaintiffs have violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Act in two separate and independent particulars: (1) the clearance and run provisions of the license agreements in suit are unreasonable and arbitrary, and hence illegal, even in the absence of a conspiracy between and among the several plaintiffs: and (2) the uniform clearance and run provisions inserted in license agreements were determined and imposed upon defendant as a result of a conspiracy and agreement to which all the plaintiffs were parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">To meet the first branch of defendant\u2019s argument, plaintiffs use as their goint of departure the definition of \u201cclearance.\u201d given in the <em>Paramount Pictures </em>case, above, and argue that defendant mischaracterizes as \u201cclearances\u201d the contract provisions in suit. Clearances, they contend, are negative covenants in the exhibition contracts made by a distributor with <em>prior-run </em>exhibitors, to protect for limited times and within a certain area the exclusivity of the prior-run exhibition right therein granted. But the issue raised by the defense, they say, is actually directed toward the delivery date or availability of the film print, and not to the legal validity of any clearances granted in contracts with third parties for prior-run protection. Plaintiffs point out that defendant pleads no such clearance clauses in the contracts in suit; it does not claim that it agreed, conspiratoriallv or otherwise, with any plaintiff unreasonably to withhold any picture from any theatre, or that it made any negative covenants in its contracts to obtain exclusive and unreasonable protection by way of clearance for itself over later-run theatres. What it is claiming is that it was held back to a later delivery date or run than it desired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>because of unreasonable protective clearance granted to prior-run theatres. Plaintiffs state that such clearances, by definition, could only be found in the agreements between plaintiffs and such <em>prior-run </em>exhibitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, on first impression, carries a measure of persuasion. Since no exhibitor has a right, as a matter of law, to a priority of run, there could be no inherent illegality in a license agreement which fixes the availability or time for delivery of the film print licensed for exhibition. The contract and any breach thereof, say plaintiffs, can be established on its own account; one need not go outside the contract into other and collateral contracts and transactions. It is only when one finds a \u201cclearance\u201d provision as defined and described in the <em>Paramount Pictures </em>case, that one encounters anything in the nature of a restraint of trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">There is language in the <em>Paramount Pictures </em>case (see 66 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>page </em>341 and 334 <em>U. S., </em>at <em>page </em>144, 68 <em>S. Ct. </em>at <em>page </em>923, quoted above) thgt would appear to lend support to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a true clearance provision can be found only in the license agreements of a prior-run theatre which grant that theatre clearance or protection over a subsequent-run theatre. In most antitrust actions, the emphasis would probably be on agreements with prior exhibitors, in an effort to show that the protection granted thereby was unreasonable because unduly extended as to area or duration. However, our examination of the cases, particularly the <em>Paramount Pictures </em>case, nowhere reveals a statement by the court that clearance <em>must </em>be stipulated in the contracts of the prior-run theatre for whose benefit the clearance was granted. In considering clearances, the objectionable feature is the fact that there is an arrangement to give an unreasonably broad protection. The fact that the clearance appears in one document rather than another cannot reasonably or logically be considered material.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The definitions of \u201cclearance\u201d given in the briefs, all taken from Paramount, do not compel the narrow inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>pretation advanced by plaintiffs. In that case the courts were concerned with clearance provisions that already appeared in contracts with preferred exhibitors, and references would naturally he to those contracts. In logic and in practice, clearance provisions may be expressed in license agreements with prior-run theatres which have the benefit of the clearance, or in those with later-run theatres on which the clearance is imposed. They might more informally be included in letter agreements, or even effected by verbal arrangements, with the understanding that the terms would subsequently be incorporated in the executed license agreements of a prior-run theatre, later-run theatre, or both. The search always is for evidence of clearance, no matter how or in what form expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We pass to another aspect of the first branch of defendant\u2019s argument. Defendant rests its case for holding the so-called clearance and run provisions of the license agreements in suit illegal on the fiat assertion that these provisions are in violation of section 1 of the Sherman AntiTrust Act, even in the absence of a conspiracy between and among the several plaintiffs. This contention vitiates defendant\u2019s entire argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The question posed is simply this: whether an individual distributor\u2019s refusal to agree to license a particular theatre on any but a subsequent run can ever be illegal for any purpose, in the absence of conspiratorial or joint wrongful action with third parties underlying such refusal, under conditions which render that refusal unreasonable as a matter of law. The firmly established rule, as has already been indicated, is that an exhibitor has no right <em>per se </em>to a priority of run enforceable against an individual distributor under the anti-trust laws, <em>Paramount Pictures Theatre Corp. v. Partmar Corp. </em>and <em>Orbo Theatres Corp. v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., </em>above.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Section 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act condemns \u201cEvery contract, combination * * * or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, * * 15 <em>U. S. C. </em>A. \u00a7 1. A plurality of actors is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>required. <em>Orbo Theatre Corp. v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., </em>above, 156 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>page </em>779; <em>Fanchon &amp; Marco v. Paramount Pictures, </em>above, 100 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>page </em>89; <em>Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>340 <em>U. S. </em>211, 71 <em>S. Ct. </em>259, 95 <em>L. Ed. </em>219 (1951), rehearing denied 340 <em>U. S. </em>939, 71 <em>S. Ct. </em>487, 95 <em>L. Ed. </em>678 (1951). If each plaintiff, through sheer perversity, and acting independently, refused to grant runs to defendant except following an unreasonable clearance, there would be no ground for relief under the Sherman Act. In claiming the protection of the anti-trust laws against the imposition of allegedly unreasonable clearances upon its theatre, defendant must show as an essential part of its case that the clearances were imposed as the result of an agreement or some kind of joint action among the distributors, or between a distributor and a prior-run exhibitor or exhibitors. <em>United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., </em>above, did not, as defendant contends, hold to the contrary, for the illegality relating to runs and clearances which the decree in that case struck down was squarely rested upon findings of joint wrongful action. 70 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>pages </em>62 and 71 \u2014 72 (Findings of Pact Nos. 79-82, and Conclusions of Law Nos. 7(b), 8(c) and (e), and 9(c) and (d)). In our review of the cases cited by both parties we have found none where the court has undertaken to restrict a distributor\u2019s freedom individually to determine what run it will grant to an exhibitor. Only where the distributor conspires or acts jointly, either with other distributors or with one or more exhibitors, to impose a subsequent run upon an unwilling exhibitor under conditions deemed to be unreasonable as a matter of law, does the Sherman Act come into operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Although defendant has attempted to present its affirmative defense under two headings, the first fails for the reasons stated. The only legitimate claim defendant raises is its second one \u2014 that plaintiffs conspired to set unreasonable runs and clearances, to its detriment. We proceed to a consideration of that basic issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">It will be recalled that defendant claims the Sherman Act has been violated in that the so-called uniform clearance and run provisions inserted in the various license agreements it had with the several plaintiffs were determined and imposed upon it as a resnlt of a conspiracy and agreement to which all the plaintiffs were parties. The allegations of its affirmative defense so summarized were taken almost verbatim from the findings of fact and conclusions of law by the statutory court in the <em>Paramount Pictures </em>case, where the court held that it was a violation of the Sherman Act when distributors acted in concert in the formation of a uniform system of clearances for the theatres io which they licensed their films. 66 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>page </em>343, and see the case on appeal, 334 <em>U. S., </em>at <em>pages </em>146, 147. 68 <em>S. Ct. </em>at <em>pages </em>923, 924. Defendant concedes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201c* &gt;:= * jf the contract sued upon was collateral to the illegal conspiracy, the violation of the Sherman Act is not available as a defense to an action on that contract, but that if tlxo contract upon which the pending actioxx is based is iixherexxtly a part of the conspiracy, or to put it coxxversely, the illegality is inherexxt in the contract itself, tlxexx a violation of the Shermaxx Act is available as a defense to an action on the said contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">It also concedes that the distinction between what is \u201cinherent\u201d and what is \u201ccollateral\u201d illegality in this connection depends upon an analytical comparison of the two leading decisions in point, both written by the late Mr. Justice Harlan: <em>Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., </em>184 <em>U. S. </em>540, 22 <em>S. Ct. </em>431, 46 <em>L. Ed. </em>679 (1902), dealing with collateral illegality, and <em>Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Louis Voight &amp; Sons Co., 212 U. S. </em>227, 29 <em>S. Ct. </em>280, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>486 (1909), dealing with inherent illegality. The trial court, after a consideration of these cases and the citation of others in support of its conclusion, held that defendant\u2019s affirmative defense was legally insufficient because the claimed illegality was collateral to the contracts in suit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>under the <em>Connolly </em>rule. On appeal defendant argues, as it did below, that the defense should be sustained because the illegality claimed was inherent to the contracts, under the <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We note, parenthetically, that neither party to this appeal has considered whether state, or federal law is determinative of the question before us, namely, under what conditions does a breach of a federal statute, which breach influenced the amounts allegedly due under state law, constitute a defense to the state law claim for the balance of license fees \u25a0 due ? Both parties assume that federal law governs. We consider that the question of whether a violation of the federal anti-trust laws may constitute a defense to a state cause of action in contract is a federal question. <em>Cf. Bruce\u2019s Juices v. American Can Co., </em>330 <em>U. S. </em>743, 67 <em>S. Ct. </em>1015, 91 <em>L. Ed. </em>1219 (1947). The determination of under what conditions the violation constitutes a defense would also be a federal question, since otherwise the additional remedy under the federal statute might be distorted beyond what the interpreting authority <em>(i. e., </em>the United States Supreme Court) deemed that Congress intended. The cases seem so to hold, although the issue has never been discussed. We turn to a consideration of the <em>Connolly </em>and <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Plaintiff in <em>Connolly </em>sued upon notes which defendant had given it in purchase of a quantity of sewer pipe. Defendant pleaded, among other things, that plaintiff, by agreement of various persons, Arms and corporations engaged in the sewer pipe trade, had been incorporated to act, and did act, as their agency in effectuating an illegal trust, combination or conspiracy to monopolize the sewer pipe trade and fix prices at which pipe could be sold. Further, that plaintiff\u2019s sales to defendant were made at prices so unlawfully fixed, and were therefore illegal and void under the Sherman Act. The court held the defense invalid, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201c* * * plaintiff, even if part of a combination illegal at common law, was not for that reason forbidden to sell property it acquired or held for sale. The purchases by the defendants had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>necessary or direct connection with the alleged illegal combination; for the contracts between the defendants and the plaintiff could have been proven without any reference to the arrangement whereby the latter became an illegal combination * * * The contracts between the plaintiff aud the respective defendants were, in every sense, collateral to the alleged agreement between the plaintiff and other corporations, firms or associations whereby an illegal combination was formed for the sale of sewer pipe.\u201d (184 <em>U. S., </em>at <em>page </em>549, 22 <em>S. Ct. </em>at <em>page </em>485)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>plaintiff sued for a balance due on account of wallpaper sold and delivered to defendant jobber. As in <em>Connolly, </em>defendant pleaded that plaintiff had been organized and incorporated by various wallpaper manufacturers as a common selling agency, in order to restrain trade and fix wallpaper prices at all levels of distribution. Defendant further alleged that plaintiff, in pursuance of the objects of the conspiracy, compelled defendant to become a party to the conspiracy by entering into a written agreement to buy all of its wallpaper requirements exclusively from plaintiff, at prices illegally fixed by the conspiracy, and compelled defendant to agree illegally to maintain the seller\u2019s list prices and not to resell the wallpaper so purchased at prices lower than a fixed schedule of minimum prices. Defendant claimed that plaintiff should be denied recovery of the unpaid purchase price because the purchase orders were inherently unlawful in that they were made in furtherance of the illegal price-fixing scheme to which it had been made a party. The court sustained defendant\u2019s contention by a narrow majority, Justices Holmes, Brewer, White and Peckham dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Speaking for the majority in <em>Continental Wall Paper, </em>Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u2018\u2018The present ease is plainly distinguishable from <em>Connolly Case. </em>In that ease the defendant, who sought to avoid payment for the goods purchased by him under contract, had no connection with the general business or operations of the alleged illegal corporation that sold the goods. * * * <em>His </em>contract was to take certain goods at an agreed price, nothing more, and was not in itself illegal, <em>nor part of nor in execution of any general plan or scheme that the law condemned. </em>* * *\u201d (212 <em>U.

The Continental Wall Paper Company seeks, in legal effect, the aid of the court to enforce a contract for the sale and purchase of goods which, <em>it is admitted by the demurrer loas in fact and was intended by the parties to be based upon agreements that were and are essential parts of an illegal scheme. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">The present suit is * * * based upon * * * agreements, to which both the plaintiff and the defendant were parties, and <em>pursuant to which </em>the accounts sued on were made out, and which had for their object, and which it is admitted had directly the effect, to accomplish the illegal ends for which the Continental Wall Paper Company was organized. If judgment be given for the plaintiff the result, beyond all question, will be to give the aid of the court in making effective the illegal agreements that constituted the forbidden combination. These considerations make it evident that the present case is different from the <em>Connolly Case. </em>* * *\u201d (212 <em>U. S., </em>at <em>page </em>261, 29 <em>S. Ct. </em>at <em>page </em>291; italics the court\u2019s)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The fact that defendant received a windfall was held not material \u2014 it is the public welfare that is uppermost \u2014 and following the long established rule the court refused to give its aid in any measure whatsoever to a party seeking to realize the fruits of an agreement tainted with illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">The parties on this appeal propose various rationales for distinguishing <em>Connolly </em>and <em>Continental Wall Paper. </em>Plaintiffs contend that the cases turn on whether defendant was a participant, however unwillingly, in the conspiracy pursuant to which the contracts in suit were made (as in <em>Continental Wall Paper), </em>or not (as in <em>Connolly). </em>Pursuing this ground of distinction, plaintiffs logically argue that for a purchaser simply to agree to buy what the seller has every right to sell, but at prices illegally fixed by a sellers\u2019 conspiracy, as in <em>Connolly, </em>is not to become an active party to the wrong, even though such a contract may serve the unilateral purpose of the seller to carry out the objects and purposes of the conspiracy. <em>Connolly </em>squarely held such an agreement not to be inherently illegal. On the other hand, a would-be purchaser\u2019s agreement, made as part of the consideration for all future sales, not to resell the purchased goods at less than the prices fixed by a conspiracy, and thus to make himself a party to the illegal conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to maintain resale prices, and himself to agree to further the wrongful objects and purposes of that price-fixing conspiracy*, as in the <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>ease, <em>is </em>a direct participation by the purchaser in such wrongful objects and purposes, and makes all purchase contracts entered in any pursuance of such an unlawful arrangement inherently illegal. The courts denyT enforcement to such purchase agreements on public policy grounds, and accordingly leave the parties where they find them. <em>Volk v. Paramount Pictures, </em>91 <em>F. Supp. </em>902, 905-906 <em>(D. C. Minn. </em>1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The United States Supreme Court has, in later cases, apparently recognized this as the true ground of distinction between the two cases. See, <em>e. g., Bruce\u2019s Juices v. American Can Co., </em>above, 330 <em>U. S., </em>at <em>page </em>755, 67 <em>S. Ct. </em>at <em>page </em>1020. <em>Cf. Bell v. Lamborn, </em>2 <em>F. 2d </em>205 (4 <em>Cir. </em>1924); <em>Turner Glass Corp. v. Hartford Empire Co., </em>173 <em>F. 2d </em>49, 52-53 (7 <em>Cir. </em>1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Defendant resists this basis for distinguishing the <em>Connolly </em>and <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>cases, claiming that it would be \u201can anomalous situation if the courts were to grant relief to a party who was both a participant in and the victim of an illegal conspiracy and in another situation were to deny relief to a party who was a non-participant in but a victim of an illegal conspiracy because of such non-participation.\u201d This ignores two considerations. The first is that the defense of illegality is not allowed as a \u201crelief\u201d to a defendant. This was pointed out in <em>McMullen v. Hoffman, </em>174 <em>U. S. </em>639, 669, 19 <em>S. Ct. </em>839, 43 <em>L. Ed. </em>1117 (1899) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201cThe court refuses to enforce such a contract, and it permits defendant to set up its illegality, not out of any regard for the defendant who sets it up, but only on account of the public interest. Tt has been often stated in similar cases that the defense is a very dishonest one, and it lies ill in the mouth of the defendant to allege it, and it is only allowed for public considerations and in order the better to secure the public against dishonest transactions. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">And see the <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>case, above, 212 <em>U. S., </em>at <em>pages </em>262-263, 29 <em>S. Ct. </em>at <em>page </em>292, where <em>McMullen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>is quoted with approval. In short, whether defendant is the victim of a wrong is of no moment in granting or denying the defense; indeed, the defense is not allowed out of any sympathy for either party\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Another answer to defendant\u2019s claim of \u201canomoly\u201d is that the Sherman Act provides relief for the alleged wrong it has pleaded by way of affirmative defense. Defendant may sue for treble damages in the federal jurisdiction. 15 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15 and 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Plaintiffs also suggest that the two leading cases may be distinguished on the basis of whether illegality appears on the face of the contract. Although that rationale has some support in the cases, see <em>Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., </em>46 <em>F. 2d </em>511 <em>(D. C. S. D. Me. </em>1931), and would minimize excursions into side issues, it would appear to be somewhat unrealistic. Such a criterion might well make the issue of enforceability depend upon the artfulness of the draftsman of the contract, or upon whether, the illegality was apparent or disguised. It would invite conceptualistic distinctions as to whether illegality did or did not appear on the face of the document, and how much (if any) interpolation could be made in the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Defendant offers its own rationale for distinguishing between the two cases, namely, that the alleged conspiracy in <em>Connolly </em>had no impact upon the contracts there involved. The distinction disregards the facts in both cases. The impact of the conspiracy on the contracts in suit was just as direct in <em>Connolly </em>as in <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>\u2014 disregarding for the moment defendant\u2019s direct participation in the illegal conduct complained of in the latter case by his agreement to maintain resale prices to his customers at levels fixed by the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">We find that defendant\u2019s contention that the instant case be regarded as within the rule of <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>because the clearance provisions of the contracts substantially affected the schedule of license fees, proves too much. In <em>Connolly </em>the defense was that the prices imposed upon defendant, although lawful on their face, were unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>because they were the result of concerted action. Certainly in that case the unlawfully fixed prices were as vital a part of the contract as are the unlawfully fixed clearances here. The cases are not materially different in this respect. And the argument that the unlawfully fixed clearances influenced the license fees can only mean that <em>Connolly, </em>where the unlawfully fixed prices not only influenced the contracts in suit but were the actual provisions sued upon, was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Although there is merit in, as well as support for, plaintiffs\u2019 contention that <em>Connolly </em>and <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>turn on whether or not defendant was a participant in the conspiracy, the basis for distinguishing the two cases might better be stated in this way: that in the latter the contract sued upon called for some further unlawful act. The contract in <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>required defendant to charge fixed resale prices. This, of course, was illegal. In <em>Connolly </em>no such restriction appears; once the defendant had the sewer pipe he could do with it as he wished. This distinction is meaningful when related to the theory of the court iu <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>\u2014 that the court would not further an illegal scheme by granting a judgment that validated a contract requiring some further activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">We cannot say, as defendant would have us hold, that a judgment for plaintiffs in the instant case would further an illegal scheme, unless we expand this concept beyond the meaning of <em>Continental Wall Paper </em>to include the scheme in <em>Connolly. </em>That is, to support the proposition just stated we would have to say that any judgment in favor of one who is a party to a conspiracy to restrain trade, in a suit on a contract whose terms partly resulted from his unlawfully dominant position, \u201cfurthers the illegal scheme.\u201d This the <em>Connolly </em>court refused to do, as did the court in all the eases set out in the opinion of the court below and in the briefs. We find no case cited to us which supports the broad proposition for which defendant contends, and none is so similar to this ease as to compel a particular result.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>We hold, as in <em>Connolly, </em>that the alleged illegality pleaded by defendant was collateral to the contracts in suit. Although we decide this matter as a question of applicable federal law, we find three Hew Jersey cases which, although not precisely in point, tend to support the conclusion that the illegality here alleged does not render the contracts unenforceable. See <em>Trenton Potteries Co. v. Oliphant, </em>58 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>507, 520-525 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1899); <em>Voices, Inc. v. Metal Tone Mfg. Co., </em>above, 119 <em>N. J. Eq., </em>at <em>pages </em>335-337; <em>cf. Brennan v. United Hatters, </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>729, 739 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1906). There is no reason why, even if state law were to govern, the distinction between <em>Connolly </em>and <em>Continental Wall Paper, </em>as discussed above, should not be held applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
