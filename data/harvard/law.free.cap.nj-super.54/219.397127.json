There was summary judgment against plaintiff and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The specifications provided that \u201cIn all cases where fluorescent lighting fixtures are specified, they shall be Pittsburgh \u2018Norwin,\u2019 40 watt fixtures or Equal approved.\u201d The \u201csummary of equipment required\u201d contained in the specifications identified \u201cPittsburgh\u201d as Pittsburgh Reflector Company and gave the model numbers of the Pittsburgh fixtures, the lengths and the shielding. In capital letters headed \u201cNOTE,\u201d the specifications warned that \u201cA BIDDER INTENDING TO FURNISH AN \u2018OR EQUAL\u2019 IN PLACE OF THE ITEM SPECIFIED MUST SUBMIT THE NAME ON THE PROPOSAL SHEET OF THE \u2018OR EQUAL\u2019 THAT HE INTENDS TO FURNISH UNDER THE BID.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s bid was (emphasis ours) \u201c* * * to furnish all labor and materials for ELECTRIC WORK \u2014 LIGHTING FIXTURES for the various schools in Linden, New Jersey, according to specifications dated July 7, 1958, prepared by Mrs. B. Evans, Purchasing Agent, Board of Education for Ten Thousand one hundred seventy, thirty three Dollars ($10,171.33). [sic] <em>Alternate bid if Smithcraft is used. Nine Thousand Four Hundred Twenty Seven. One Cent </em>($9,427.01).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">It seems to us beyond dispute that an adequate description of the fixture offered as the equal to Pittsburgh \u201cNorwin\u201d was required by these specifications, and essential. The description by \u201cname\u201d called for by the specifications obviously meant the model name (like \u201cNorwin\u201d) if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>manufacturer made more than one model. By the use of such a name in the bid the bidder\u2019s obligation would have been made certain and the board would have been able, by the advice of its experts or otherwise, to determine whether the named fixture was the equal of the Pittsburgh \u201cNorwin.\u201d Here there was nothing in the bid to indicate whether Smith-craft was the name of a manufacturer or of a fixture, nor was there any description of the fixture which plaintiff proposed to furnish. In the proofs submitted upon the motion for summary judgment it developed that Smithcraft is not the name of a fixture but the name of a manufacturer \u2014the \u201cSmithcraft Lighting Division of A. L. Smith Iron Company.\u201d Moreover, the literature of Smithcraft showed that it manufactured nine different types of fixtures which it recommended for school use. It was therefore impossible, even for an expert, to determine from the bid which fixture plaintiff proposed to furnish.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">On its face this bid is too uncertain to be valid. However, appellant argues that the bid was saved from invalidity because (1) plaintiff had previously installed Smithcraft \u201cFederal\u201d fixtures (and no others) in the Linden schools and therefore the board knew that he meant to install \u201cFederal\u201d again and (2) even if the board cannot be held to have known what fixture he meant, plaintiff should have been afforded an opportunity to produce a Smithcraft fixture and prove that it was \u201cequal.\u201d Plaintiff argues that it was not necessary to identify the proposed fixture at all\u2014 that it would have been sufficient if the bid said \u201cI will supply an equal.\u201d As plaintiff puts it in his brief \u201cThe only substantive requirement of the specifications, where a bid on a fixture other than \u2018Pittsburgh Norwin\u2019 was involved, was that it be an \u2018equal.\u2019 * * * As applied to this case, this means that if, after the bids are opened, plaintiff * * * does in fact supply an \u2018equal,\u2019 the plaintiff, as the lowest bidder, is entitled to the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We find no merit in plaintiff\u2019s position. When essential information is missing from a bid when it is opened it may not be supplied then or thereafter by the private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>understanding of the bidder and the board, nor otherwise. Any other rule would not only be contrary to the letter of <em>R. S. </em>18:6-26, but subversive as well of the purpose and intent of the statute for the reasons fully stated in <em>Hillside Township, Union County v. Sternin, </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>317, at <em>pages </em>322-323 and 324-328 (1957). As was pointed out in that case, the two paramount aims of such statutes are that all bidders bid upon the same thing, and that the public know clearly what the bidder must give and the municipality receive, for a consideration plainly stated. These aims would be defeated if a bidder were permitted to supplement his bid in essential details by private understandings or otherwise. The opportunities for favoritism if this were permitted are as obvious as they would be enormous. As has frequently been said, \u201cIn this field it is better to leave the door tightly closed than to permit it to be ajar.\u201d <em>Hillside Township v. Sternin, supra. Cf., Case v. Inhabitants of Trenton, </em>76 <em>N. J. L. </em>696 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1909); <em>Armitage v. City of Newark, </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>5 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1914); <em>Tufano v. Borough of Cliffside Park, </em>110 <em>N. J. L. </em>370 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932); <em>Albanese v. Machetto, </em>7 <em>N. J. Super. </em>188 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">If plaintiff\u2019s second contention were correct, no bidder would have to describe the proposed fixture. He could wait until he saw what his competitor offered, and then offer a better one. On the other hand if he had no competition he could offer the cheapest one that would still be equal to the minimum required by the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Since the bid was invalid for the reasons stated, no hearing was required, nor would one have been justified. <em>Cf., William A. Carey &amp; Co. v. Borough of Fair Lawn, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>159, 169 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
