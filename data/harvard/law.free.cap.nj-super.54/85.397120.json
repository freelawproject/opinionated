A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AtL\">This appeal is by one of the defendants below, William D. Eoeger, Jr., from an order of the Superior Court, Law Division, denying for the second time, on rehearing, the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate and set aside a judgment by default entered on December 10, 1957 against William D. Eoeger, Sr., and William D. Eoeger, Jr., trading as G. P. Eoeger &amp; Son, and C. P. Eoeger &amp; Son, Inc. Eoeger, Jr., seeks to have the judgment set aside as to him as void under <em>B. B. </em>4:62-2(d) on the ground that he was never personally served with a summons and complaint and, as a result, the court lacked <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over him. <em>Garza v. Paone, </em>44 <em>N. J. Super. </em>553 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). In the alternative, Eoeger, Jr., aspires to have the judgment opened under <em>R. R. </em>4:62-2 (a) so that he may interpose a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>In September 1952 young Roeger came out of military service and resumed work in his father\u2019s business, assisting in office administration and sales work. The firm of C. F. Roeger &amp; Son was engaged in the building and construction trade and had been started by young Roeger\u2019s grandfather; this allegedly accounts for the \u201c&amp; Son\u201d in the name. Roeger, Jr., at first received a salary of $85 per week which by 1957 had climbed to $135. Both father and son in their testimony vigorously deny that Roeger, Jr., was anything other than an employee in the firm. The firm became incorporated under the name C. E. Roeger &amp; Son, Inc., on April 1, 1957. Roeger, Jr., is an officer, director and stockholder of this corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The action here was brought to recover the balance owing on a sub-contract under date of November 6, 1956, pursuant to which plaintiff was to do the carpentry work in connection with the erection of a parish hall in Woodbridge, for which the Roeger firm had the general contract. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint, filed on October 31, 1957, named four parties as defendants: the two Roegers, individually, the firm, and the corporation. A deputy sheriff of Camden County, plaintiff contends, delivered a summons to Roeger, Jr., on November 8, 1957 at 644 Haddon Avenue, Collingswood, N. J., the old office of the dissolved C. E. Roeger &amp; Son and present office of the corporation. On this date Roeger, Jr., resided at 345 Haddon Avenue. The sheriff\u2019s return of summons, signed by the deputy and filed on November 18, 1957, states that both Roegers and the registered agent of the corporation, William Dickey, Jr., Esq., were \u201cduly served * * * personally\u201d on November 8, 1957. The Roegers were stated to have been served at the 644 address; Dickey, at 122 Haddon Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">None of the defendants answered the complaint, and on December 10, 1957 a judgment by default was entered in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $7,136.42, the balance claimed on the sub-contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Since January 1958 Roeger, Jr., has been attempting to have the judgment vacated as to him for lack of service. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In March 1958 his motion was denied, the matter having been disposed of upon conflicting affidavits tendered by Koeger, Jr., and the deputy sheriff. Young Koeger then moved for a rehearing on the ground that the facts contained in the affidavits were \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d and, under such cases as <em>Missell v. Hayes, </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>348 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914); <em>Vredenburgh v. Weidmann, </em>14 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>285, 183 <em>A. </em>459 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936), and <em>Romano v. Maglio, </em>41 N. <em>J. Super. </em>561, 573 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956), resolvable only after an oral hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">At the oral hearing on April 25, 1958 Koeger, Jr., testified, in addition to the matters previously set forth, that on and for some time prior to November 8, 1957 (when the summons was delivered) he had been employed as a draftsman in an architect\u2019s office in Philadelphia; that he liad not been present at 644 Haddon Avenue during business hours since September 23, 1957; and that consequently he could not have been served with the summons and complaint as the deputy stated in his affidavit. He testified he knew, from conversations with his father, that plaintiff had filed a complaint, but did not know he had been named as a party defendant until he attended a conference at his attorney\u2019s office, shortly after the entry of the default judgment. Koeger, Sr., testified to the same effect, explaining that he was bad on dates and memories and simply had not noticed that the summons handed him on November 8 included his son as a defendant. Upon cross-examination, plaintiff\u2019s counsel elicited that the defendant corporation filed a petition in bankruptcy some time in late 1957 or early 1958. The Boegers were the only witnesses to testify on behalf of either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The trial judge stated at the end of the hearing that he was \u201cfaced with a record\u201d and needed \u201csome rather convincing evidence to overcome that record.\u201d He concluded that Boeger, Jr., had failed to sustain the burden of proof and that the judgment would stand. This appeal followed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201cThere is conflict of authority on the question of the eonclusiveness of a return of process, some authorities holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>it is conclusive between the parties as to all matters of which the return is evidence, whereas other authorities hold that it may he rebutted or impeached.\u201d 72 <em>C. J. S. Process </em>\u00a7 100, <em>p. </em>1140.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">In this jurisdiction, it is settled that the strict English common-law rule does not prevail, and the sheriff\u2019s return is not conclusive. <em>Sweeney v. Miner, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>361, 366 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1915); <em>C. &amp; D. Building Corporation v. Griffithes, </em>109 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>319, 323 <em>(Ch. </em>1931); <em>Atlantic Mortgage Co. v. Rosenfeld, </em>2 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>861 <em>(Ch. </em>1924). Although it is rebuttable, the sheriff\u2019s return is part of the record and raises a presumption that the facts as therein recited are true. <em>Hotovitsky v. Little Russian Greek Catholic St. Peter &amp; Paul Church, </em>78 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>576, 577 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1911); <em>Seymour v. Nessanbaum, </em>120 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>24 <em>(Ch. </em>1936) (set aside only on \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that return is false); <em>Blair v. Vetrano, </em>12 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>462, 172 <em>A. </em>604 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934) (evidence held insufficient); <em>Vredenburgh v. Weidmann, supra, </em>14 <em>N. J. Misc, </em>at <em>page </em>287 (entitled to every presumption of its correctness); 5 <em>Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. </em>1940), \u00a7 1664(b), <em>p. </em>652. <em>Cf. N. J. S. 2A</em>:15 \u2014 24. It is generally held that the uncorroborated testimony of the defendant alone is not sufficient to impeach the return. 72 <em>C. J. S. Process </em>\u00a7 1026, <em>p. </em>1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The first question before us is whether or not the trial judge soundly determined that the defendant should be held to have been served. This requires a determination as to whether the evidence adduced at the oral hearing below is so \u201cclear and convincing\u201d as to impeach the sheriff\u2019s return of service and the affidavit in support thereof. As to this, we are not persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s argument that there is something \u201cinherently improbable\u201d in the Roegers\u2019 testimony to the effect that they knew a suit has been instituted but not against Roeger, Jr. The only plausible basis for holding it to be contrived is that Roeger, Sr., had been in business for a long time and, as a result, could be expected to have read \u2022 more carefully the summons given him. The mere fact that the Roegers were interested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the matter in controversy does not, in and of itself, compel the conclusion that they are unworthy of belief, see <em>Ferdinand v. Agricultural Ins. Co., 22 N. J. </em>482, 496 (1956), and this is especially so when we consider the testimony that Eoeger, Jr., is a \u201cnot ordained minister * * * of his own church * *</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">However, the principal reason, overlooked by plaintiff, for regarding the Eoegers\u2019 case as suspect, is not that their own testimony was improbable or inconsistent, but rather that they failed to present at the hearing other witnesses presumably available to them who could have corroborated their version as to the whereabouts of Eoeger, Jr., on November 8. In this connection, Eoeger, Sr., testified that his daughter and two other employees were in the office on the day the deputy claimed to have served young Eoeger personally. Nor has there been suggested any reason why young Eoeger\u2019s employer or fellow-employees in Philadelphia were not produced to corroborate the contention that Eoeger, Jr., was with them on the date in question. See <em>Michaels v. Brookchester, Inc., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>379, 391 (1958); <em>Snyder v. I. Jay Realty Co., </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>336 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">On the other hand, we cannot in good conscience neglect to mention the obvious deficiencies in plaintiff\u2019s case. As noted, plaintiff produced no witnesses at the hearing but was, aside from cross-examination of the Eoegers, content to rest upon two instruments: the sheriff\u2019s return of summons and the affidavit of the deputy submitted earlier in connection with young Eoeger\u2019s first motion to vacate the default judgment. (Plaintiff did, however, introduce a number of the Eoeger firm\u2019s letters and documents in an effort to establish that Eoeger, Jr., even if aware that a suit was pending against him, could not have offered a meritorious defense to the action). Especially in view of the cases cited <em>supra, </em>holding the sheriff\u2019s return as not giving rise to a conclusive presumption and those holding an oral hearing to be the proper procedure by which to resolve such questions, we cannot discount plaintiff\u2019s unexplained failure to produce the deputy to establish the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of Ms return and to withstand the rigors of cross-examination, as did the Eoegers.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In view of the inconclusiveness of the proofs, we are not prepared to substitute our own appraisal of the credibility of the witnesses for that of the trial judge. <em>R. R. </em>1:5-4(b); <em>R. R. </em>4:53-2. The trial judge did not state that he disbelieved the defendants; his conclusion that young Eoeger had not sustained the burden of proof was undoubtedly due to his own uncertainty as to where the truth lay and to a determination that, in such a state of affairs, the sheriff\u2019s return outweighed defendants\u2019 affirmative testimony. We affirm the determination not to interfere with the record of service on Eoeger, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"> Notwithstanding the foregoing, since there is at least some doubt as to whether the defendant was in fact served with process, we think the circumstances require a more liberal disposition of defendant\u2019s alternative application to have the judgment reopened so that he may interpose a defense. <em>R. R. </em>4:62-2 calls for the exercise of a sound discretion by the trial judge, guided by equitable principles, and in conformity with the prescription that \u201cany doubt should be resolved in favor of the application to set aside the judgment to the end of securing a trial upon the merits.\u201d <em>Loranger v. Alban, </em>22 <em>N. J. Super. </em>336, 342 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952). See also <em>Wilford v. Sigmund Eisner Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. Super. </em>27 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). In the present case, there is no question but that the motion to vacate was brought within a reasonable time after the entry of the default and that young Eoeger\u2019s asserted defense to the effect that he as a mere employee was not liable for the firm\u2019s debts is not technical or frivolous. Compare <em>Garza v. Paone, supra, </em>44 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>page </em>558; <em>New Jersey Cabinet &amp; Mill Co. v. Creedon, </em>24 <em>N. J. Super. </em>553, 557 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1953). All the circumstances of the case, taken with the fact that no great disservice is done plaintiff except for the delay in enforcing the judgment against this defendant, virtually compel the conclusion as a matter of equity that Eoeger, Jr., be given his day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The judgment is reversed only for the purpose of giving Boeger, Jr., the opportunity of filing an answer and proceeding with the matter on the merits. The appellant is therefore directed to file an answer to the complaint within ten days from the filing of this opinion, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
