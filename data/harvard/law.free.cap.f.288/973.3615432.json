The bill of lading provided that the consignee should discharge the cargo, which it did, and the time saved in unloading, as ascertained by the lower court, was 3 days 9 hours and 43 minutes, which at 16 cents, named as dispatch money, amounted to $3,325.06. The two cases were considered together by the District Court, and also here, as they relate to the same subject-matter; that is, whether dispatch money should be paid, and, if so, to whom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-17\">Three questions were earnestly pressed for consideration, namely: First, whether dispatch money was recoverable under the circumstanc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>es; second, whether a libel in rem against the ship would lie therefor; and, third,' to whom the amount properly recoverable should be paid, as between the consignor, the ship\u2019s charterer, and the consignee. These questions were fully considered by the trial court, with the result that 3 days 9 hours and 43 minutes was ascertained as the time for which dispatch money should be allowed, at the rate before mentioned, that an action in rem against the ship did lie for the same, and that the amount ascertained by the court was recoverable by the consignee, Direzione Generate Combustibili, charged with the obligation of unloading the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">With these conclusions of the District Court (282 Fed. 939), we are in full accord, and do not desire to add anything to the reasons given. The decrees of that court in the respective cases will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
