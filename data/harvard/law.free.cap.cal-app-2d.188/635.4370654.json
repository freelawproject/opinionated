McCarthy for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b656-4\">DUNIWAY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axq\">Plaintiff appeals from a judgment against her in an action upon a promissory note. The court found that the signature on the note was not the signature of defendant executor\u2019s decedent, but was a fraudulent writing placed thereon by some person unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Appellant attacks the finding. However, it is fully sustained by the testimony of an expert who described his qualifications at length. Appellant then stipulated that he was qualified. The expert compared the signature with photostats of two exemplars on documents signed by decedent and filed in the United States District Court. (Decedent Ernest Torregano, of whose will the respondent bank is executor, was a practicing attorney.) The note is dated July 28, 1937. The exemplars were dated April 8, 1939, and May 7, 1937. The witness stated \u201cthe person who signed\u201d the note \u201cis not the same writing and not the same person who signed\u201d the exemplars.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Appellant claims that respondent\u2019s counsel admitted that the signature was genuine, and that the opinion is worthless because the expert took only 15 minutes, in the courtroom, to compare the signatures, used photostats as exemplars, did not make photographs or photographic enlargements of the questioned signature, and did not make microscopic examinations of it. The witness\u2019 answers were, in substance, that in some eases such things are necessary, and that in some cases photostats are not adequate for comparison, but that in this case none of these things were important because the forgery ivas so crude and obvious. \u201cI think the answer in this case is a very simple problem and I think it could be done that way [by looking at the photostats and the original] and has been so far as I am concerned, and that\u2019s the way I did it. \u201d \u201c An d these signatures on this note are just about, well, in my opinion, somebody just didn\u2019t know how to even go about it. .It isn\u2019t even a close imitation of the genuine handwriting.\u201d Nor did respondent\u2019s counsel admit the genuineness of the signature. He merely stated that he thought appellant was \u201ctelling the truth, generally\u201d and that he personally could not say whether the signature was genuine or not. There being ample, competent testimony to sustain the finding, we are bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The only other contention is that the court erroneously excluded appellant\u2019s testimony under Code of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Procedure, section 1880, subdivision 3. The record, however, shows that, after a colloquy, all of the testimony came in, over respondent\u2019s objection. There is nothing in the point. Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Bray, P. J., and Tobriner, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
