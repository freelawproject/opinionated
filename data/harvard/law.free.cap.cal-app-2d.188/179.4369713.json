McClendon and Paul A. Brunk or order.\u201d Subsequently, someone crossed out the word, \u201cAssigned,\u201d and substituted therefor the word, \u201cPay.\u201d A pretrial conference was held and on February 6, 1958, the pretrial conference order was filed. The order read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">\u201cIt was stipulated and agreed between Counsel that the only issue to be tried is whether the word \u2018pay\u2019 or the word \u2018assigned\u2019 was in the endorsement at the time it was made or whether the word \u2018pay\u2019 was later inserted with the consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>of plaintiffs [obviously should be defendants], the endorsers, it appearing that the word \u2018assigned\u2019 was first used and then stricken and the word \u2018pay\u2019 inserted. It was further stipulated that if the word \u2018assigned\u2019 was used by the endorsers then plaintiffs are not responsible for payment but that responsibility follows if the word \u2018pay\u2019 was used by the endorsers, either originally or later, with their consent. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The clerk\u2019s record shows that the trial was completed on April 7, 1958. On May 1, 1958, appellants filed a motion to amend the pretrial conference order so as to limit the issue as to whether the alteration of the endorsement had been made without the consent of the respondents. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in refusing to grant their motion because their counsel never intended to stipulate that respondents would not be liable if the alteration of the endorsement was made without their knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The trial court found \u2018 \u2018 [t] hat subsequent to the execution of the Assignment of said Promissory Note, and without the knowledge or consent of the defendant assignors, the word \u2018pay\u2019 was inserted above the assignors\u2019 signature in lieu of the word \u2018assign\u2019 which was there when the assignment was executed, \u2019 \u2019 and \u2018 \u2018 [t] hat at the time of the execution of the assignment of the notes and Chattel Mortgage as shown by the evidence at the trial and the stipulation entered into at the pre-trial conference which is a part of the pre-trial conference order herein it was the intent of the parties that the use of the word \u2018assign\u2019 was meant in the same sense as it is used in the law of assignment of a non-negotiable chose in action or as a qualified endorsement of the notes.\u201d The evidence amply supports these findings. The weight and effect of the evidence was, of course, a matter for the trial court to determine and is binding upon this court. <em>(Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>3 Cal.2d 427-429 [45 P.2d 183] ; <em>Beckmann </em>v. <em>Beckmann, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 717, 720 [345 P.2d 121].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Such being the state of the record, we find no merit in appellants\u2019 contention hereinabove stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">We deem it unnecessary to discuss other points presented in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Peek, Acting P. J., and Sehottky, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b199-17\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
