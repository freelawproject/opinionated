AUCHMUTY. I shall consider first the Act of 15 Car. 2. (<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) The Words are confined to <em>Importation. </em>Importation is to be a Forfeit; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>this four Times mentioned in the same Act; from this I reason that \u2019tis not a Landing that is required, but that a bare Importation will be a Forfeit. 15 Car. 2, ch. 7, \u00a7 6, p. 16. Acts of Parliament are to be construed as we find them; Courts have no Power to controul them. Foster\u2019s Crown Law, 20, 21, <em>Alexander Kinlock Chas. Kinloch, </em>two Persons indicted for Treason; ipecial Plea, that, by Custom, they were to be tried in Scotland : \u2014 This, only to show how Acts are to be construed. \u2014 The Offence is allowed to be within the Letter, but not within the usual Construction. That the Vessel has imported these Goods is very certain. She was some Time below, was above the Castle (<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) some Time. (He then observes upon the Evidence to shew there was a Design of fraudulent Importation.)</p><p id=\"AqxR\">2. Whether she is within the Meaning of this Act, which is for the Encouragement of Trade: What the Trade is that is to be encouraged, Sec. 5 shews: It is to render Great Britain the Staple. The only sensible Meaning of Importation is <em>Bringing in, </em>exclusive of Landing. 13 &amp; 14 Car. 2, ch. 13, shews this ought to be the Construction. In the same Sense \u2019tis taken in 13 <em>&amp; </em>14 Car. 2, ch. 19, and in 13 <em>&amp; </em>14 Car. 2, ch. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, and in 22 &amp; 23 Car. 2, ch. 26. From thefe Acts, I think it was evident that <em>Bringing in </em>is all they meant by Importa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>tion, as all these Acts use the Words. The Statute 6 Geo. 2, ch. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 2 &amp; 3, makes a Distinction between Landing and Importing: They designed to make a Distinction between Goods that are customable, and not forfeited till Landing, and those which, being prohibited, are forfeited by bare Importation. If these Laws should be otherwise construed, they would be compleatly evaded. \u2014 For, if they have not a fair Opportunity of Running, they will <em>Report. </em>The Confequences of this Act to any particular Plantation cannot now be considered. There is a great Difference between Goods that may be imported and pay a Duty, and those which are absolutely prohibited.</p><p id=\"A-p\">I ask no Favour against Law. There is a Preliminary to be settled before the Merits. 1 question the Power the prefent Libellant had to seize \u2014 and, if so, the Seizure is abfolutely void. (Upon this, Capt. Bishop\u2019s Commission was read, which was from three of five Commissioners of the Customs \u2014 and a Power to seize such and such contraband Goods wherever he should find them.) By the 13 &amp; 14 of Car. 2, ch. 11, \u00a7 15, none but an Officer can seize. 2 Strange, 952, <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Boosey. </em>If seized and condemned, the Owner shall afterwards recover in Trover, if the Person who seized was not a proper Officer. Now, every Officer is to be over fome Port, Harbour, Town, &amp;c.; Captain Biihop\u2019s Commiffion is general. No Plantations are mentioned, but it extends through the Globe. Have the Commissioners alone a Power to grant fuch Commiffions? I can\u2019t find their Appointment, therefore suppofe that it is by the King\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Prerogative, and that he might farm the Customs or appoint Commissioners. This, with Regard to the Realm, not the Plantations, as their Planting is within Memory. There were no Officers for a long Time known as Officers of the Customs, but they were ordered to the Governour, or Officers by him appointed. And \u2019tis by expreis Ads of Parliament that their Appointment here is. 2y Car. 2, ch. 7, \u00a7 4. I find by the Records in the Council-Chamber, that the Commiffioners ground themfelves upon this Ad, which relpeds only Collection of Customs. \u2019Tis 7 &amp; 8 W. 3, ch. 22, \u00a711, this Warrant is grounded, if upon any. By this Ad, Power is given to the Lord Treasurer or Commissioners of the Treasury (these are synonymous) and the Commiffioners of the Customs, jointly. This Warrant is only from the Commiffioners of the Customs, whereas no exclusive Power is given to either. Further, Officers who shall be thus appointed shall be particularly limited, they are still to appoint in fome particular Place, and over fome particular Department. By the 13 &amp; 14 Car. 2, ch. 11, \u00a7 14, it feems that the Officers, even in England, are limited <em>; </em>and it feems to be divided into Districts Officers are obliged to reside in; so that, had there been no Claim, the Party might have brought his Action. This late Ad gives no new Power, but only to appoint Ships. There is an Ad in 10 of Wm. 3, which impowers Ships to seize, which is only on the Coasts, and this is only to extend that coasting Power to the Plantations.</p><p id=\"b398-4\">Let us consider whether it comes within the Letter of this Ad. If any Vessell approaches or comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>into a Port, without any Intent to unload, shall her Cargo be said to be imported ? Can a Thing be said to be imported, because the Vessell that holds it comes into Port ? What Mischief do they mean to suppress ? \u2019Tis lawfull for us to be Carriers from one French Port to another. Shall then an English Vessell, Carrier for other Nations, leaking and wanting Provisions, with Liberty from the Owner to touch at an English Port for a few Days to procure Stores, not be permitted to touch at such English Port ? I challenge an Instance of a Seizure on this Aft, till Landing or Bulk broken. Can it be said that this Stopping is the Mischief? \u2019Tis supplying the Colonies that is intended to be prevented. This will be still plainer from several Acts the Advocate has cited. 13 &amp; 14 Car. 2, ch. 13, \u00a7 2. What they mean by Importation is bringing in as Merchandize, ch. 19, \u00a7 2. The Meaning must still be the same.</p><p id=\"A3-J\">The Expression in this Libel, that they are imported into the Port, is different from the Language of the Act, which generally runs, \u201cimported into any Lands, Territories,\u201d &amp;c. The importing into a Port, is quite a different Thing from importing into a Land or Territory. In the 15 Car. 2, upon which this is grounded, it is, <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> imported into any Island,\u2019 &amp;c. and to say any Thing is imported into any Land without Landing, seems to be downright Solecism. The Wisdom of the Nation has seen fit to gain a Profit from Merchandize, but still that the greatest may still remain with the Merchant. Shall such a Catch as this be the Defign of the Wisdom of the Na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>tion? 28 Edw. 3, ch. 13. 20th R. 3, ch. 4. These were before the feudal Tenures were taken away, and, upon their cealing, Cuiloms were introduced. Carkefle, Book of Rates, 767, 772. In the Act of Tonnage and Poundage, inftead of importing, it is faid, brought into England, 12 Car. 2, ch. 4. 15 Car. 2, ch. 7, \u00a7 8, ihews there is <em>importing by </em>Land, fo that the Word can\u2019t have a necessary Regard to Port. 7 &amp; 8 of Wm. 3, ch. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 14, it is, to put on Shore. 9 &amp; 10th of Wm. 3, ch. 43, \u00a7 1, is an Importation into a Port. 10 &amp; 11 W. 3, ch. 10, \u00a7 19, Export is by Land, \u2014 fo is n &amp; 12 W. 3, ch. 10, \u00a7 3. Never was an Instance of importing into a Port being an Importation. (<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>)</p><p id=\"b395-9\">(1) This was a libel by Captain Bishop as a Custom House Officer, against the Freemason, as forfeited for importing European goods not shipped in Great Britain, in violation of the Act of 15 Car. 2, ch. 7, \u00a7 6. See note at the end of the case. <em>Auchmuty </em>was Advocate General\u2014 <em>Gridley </em>&amp; <em>Thacher </em>for the claimants. No copies of the proceedings can be found, for most of the Admiralty records and files of Court prior to 1765 were destroyed in the stamp act riot of the 26th of August, in that year, (2 Minot\u2019s Hist. Mass. 215. <em>Ante, </em>169,) and what remained are supposed to have been carried away, either to Halifax or England. 10 John Adams\u2019s Works, 205, 354.</p><p id=\"b395-10\">(2) The act of 15 Car. 2, c. 7, \u00a7 6, provides that \u201c no Commodity of \u201c the Growth, Production or Manufacture of <em>Europe </em>shall be imported <em>\u201c </em>into any Land, Island, Plantation, Colony, Territory, or Place to His \u201c Majesty belonging \u201d \u201c in <em>Asia, Africa, </em>or <em>America, (Tangier </em>only ex- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201c cepted) but what all be <em>bona fide </em>and without Fraud laden and \u201c shipped in <em>England, Wales </em>or the Town of <em>Berwick </em>upon <em>Tweed, </em>and \u201c in <em>English </em>built Shipping.\u201d</p><p id=\"b400-4\">(4) The report of this cafe in the MS. here breaks off. A full statement of the facts, the questions raised, and the decree of the Court, appears in the following letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Halifax, for a copy of which the editor is indebted to the kindnefs of Hon. Jared Sparks.</p><p id=\"b400-6\">\u201c Pursuant to the order received from Lord Egremont to fend to his \u201c office exact accounts of what shall happen in the execution of the \u201c Laws of trade, I proceed to give an account of the prosecution of the \u201c Brigantine &amp; cargo, of the seizure of which I gave a short information \u201c in my letter dated Octr. 25.</p><p id=\"b400-7\">\u201c The Brigantine Free Mason laden with french goods, chiefly wines, \u201c at Bourdeaux took her departure for Bolton at which place she ar- \u201c rived (having first touched at Liverpool in Nova Scotia,) on fryday \u201cthe 21 ft of Octr. &amp; came to anchor within the harbour about <em>6 </em>miles \u201c distance from the Town. There the lay at anchor all the rest of that \u201c &amp; the next day untill the Evening when it was dark, when he went \u201cup to town. Being hailed in passing the Castle, they answered, from \u201c Newcastle ; &amp; being boarded by the Man of War\u2019s barge They an- \u201c swered from Newcallle laden with Coals. But it appearing that she \u201c had a Cargo of Wine, Capt. Bilhop commander of the Hoop of War \u201c Fortune, who had qualified himfelf in this Province as a Customhouse \u201c Officer, seized her. Soon after file was feized they owned that the Brig- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u201c antine was loaded with french Wines &amp;c. &amp; came from Bourdeaux Being \u201c bound to St. Eustatia. And on the monday following, being the first \u201c time the Custom house was open after the feizure, the Master made a \u201c report of his Cargo, (which in the course of the tryal was falfified) &amp; \u201c his destination &amp; praied that he might be permitted to proceed to St. \u201c Eustatia. But the Captain, as a Custom houfe officer, by the advice of \u201cthe Advocate General, libelled the Vessell &amp; Cargo in the Court of \u201c Vice Admiralty as forfeited for importing European goods not shipt \u201c in Great Britain, contrary to the Act: of the 15th of Cha. <em>2. </em>Upon \u201cwhich the Veffell was claimed by owners living in this Province, &amp; as \u201c for the Cargo, a claim was entered on the behalf of Mr.</p><p id=\"b401-4\">\u201c a french Merchant at Bourdeaux &amp; Mr. a Dutch Mer- \u201c chant at St. Eustatia; and it was alledged that these goods were \u201c freighted by one to the other, and that leave was given for this Vessell \u201c to take Boston in her way to St. Eustatia and that they had a Right \u201c to come into this Port fo long as they reported &amp; did not break bulk.</p><p id=\"b401-6\">\u201c This produced a Question very interesting to the Crown, that is, \u201c whether a Vessell laden with prohibited goods &amp; pretended to be bound \u201c from a foreign European port to a foreign American port, might come, \u201c ever fo much out of their way, into a British American port &amp; there \u201c lie at anchor upon the credit of reporting her Cargo &amp; pretended des- \u201c tination. The affirmative of this Question had been pronounced to be \u201c law in fome popular declamations in the causes which were carried on \u201c here against the Custom houfe officers about 3 years ago : but there \u201c never was a caule, that I know, in which this point was adjudged. I \u201c therefore determined, whenever a Case should happen in which this \u201c Doftrine should come into Question to oppofe it with all my power; \u201c lince it is obvious, that if this was determined to be law, it would be \u201c necessary to apply to Parliament for an amendment of the 15th of \u201c Char. 2, fince it would be impoffible to prevent foreign European goods \u201c coming into America, if Vessels laden with such goods had a right to \u201ccome to British American ports only by reporting the Cargo &amp; a pre- \u201c tended destination to a foreign Port.</p><p id=\"b401-7\">\u201c Upon this account I took upon me the overlooking the conduct of \u201c this prosecution in a manner more earnest &amp; public than I have used in \u201cother causes of this kind. The advocate general conducted it with a \u201c Spirit &amp; Judgment not to be enough commended. The most mate- \u201c rial Question was whether there could be an importation (fo as to for- \u201c feit) without landing. The judge having heard Council for two whole \u201c days, gave his opinion that landing was not neceffary to make an im- \u201c portation contrary to that Aft, &amp; having shown how effeftually the \u201cAft would be defeated if a liberty for Vessells laden with prohibited \u201c goods, to come into British Ports at their own discretion was allowed, \u201c &amp; having mark\u2019t out feveral particular Circumstances which showed a \u201c fraudulent intention in the prefent cafe, decreed the Veffel &amp; Cargo to t\u2018be forfeited.</p><p id=\"b402-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201c From this Decree the Claimers have appealed to the High Court of \u201c Admiralty. Upon this occasion I must, <em>in pursuance of the orders I </em>\u201c <em>have received to impart to your Lordship, fetch hints as may occur to me \u201cfor the better execution of the laves of trade, </em>earnestly recommend to \u201c your Lordship, that the defence of this Decree against the appeal may \u201c be supported at the expence of his Majesty. As one third part of this \u201c forfeiture is decreed to his Majesty, his interest in it requires thess support \u201c of his Officers <em>pro tanto. </em>But that is not all: if these extraordinary \u201c Custom house officers, whose service, as it\u2019s new, is the more invidious: \u201c do not appear to have the public support of the Crown in what they \u201c do according to the best advice they can procure, I am convinced that \u201c a Combination will soon be made to distress &amp; embarrass them by ap- \u201c peals &amp; actions at common law for doing their duty in the most plain \u201c &amp; positive cases. This I have seen experienced in the confederacy \u201c which was formed against the ordinary custom hous officers of this port \u201c about 3 years ago, which was effectually discouraged by one instance \u201c only of a defence being carried on at the expence of the Crown.</p><p id=\"b402-3\">\u201c Copies of the proceedings are making out, which, together with an \u201c abstracted state of the case &amp; of the arguments used for the forfeiture, \u201c will be lent by the first opportunity. Captn. Bishop has also seized a \u201c ship for loading with Rice without giving bond. I advised &amp; assisted \u201c him in this prosecution, &amp; the ship was condemned together with the \u201c Rice without any defence.</p><p id=\"b402-4\">\u201c I am with great regard</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
