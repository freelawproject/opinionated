The Reason for this Admission was, that this Court had no Power to compell any one in another Province to give Evidence in a Cause pending before this Court.

Justice <em>seemed </em>to doubt.</p><p id=\"b171-12\">(1) It appears by the record that the prisoner was acquitted, the attorney general having agreed that the might give marriage in evidence, \u201c tho\u2019 the answers to an indictment wherein the has the addition of spinster given her.\u201d</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
