On the 26th of March, 1917, she was injured while cleaning up the toilet. The injury was caused by the fall of the water tank which was used for the flushing of the toilet; and her case was rested solely upon the averment that the defendant improperly, and without the use of reasonable care, had caused the tank to be unskillfully repaired and fastened, so that the same fell upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">It is conceded on the part of the plaintiff that, normally, the obligation to make repairs to the toilet rested upon the tenant, in the absence of any agreement on the part of the landlord to make them; and no attempt to prove the making of any such agreement was made. Her case rests upon the doctrine laid down by this court in <em>LaBrasca </em>v. <em>Hinchman, </em>81 <em>N. J. L. </em>367, which is that where a landlord undertakes to make repairs to leased premises, and performs the work so negligently that the tenant suffers damage by reason of such negligence, the,landlord is liable for that damage, notwithstanding the fact that he was under no legal obligation <em>to </em>make them. This principle was approved by the Court of Errors and Appeals in the case of <em>Broame </em>v. <em>N. J. Conference, </em>83 <em>Id. </em>621. The case went to the jury upon this theory, and they rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The question is whether that verdict is supported by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The only evidence upon the point was given by the plaintiff herself, and by one Dill, a witness called for the defendant, and is in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">(Plaintiff\u2019s testimony.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Was the tank out of order before the date you were injured F</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>It was fixed twice already while I was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Who fixed it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-12\"><em>\"A. </em>The plumber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Who sent the plumber?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>The landlord sent the plumber \u2014 the agent, I mean\u2014 the agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Had you complained about the condition of the tank? <em>\u201cA. </em>Yes; twice already. It never was in good order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\"><em>\"Q. </em>How long before the accident was the plumber there ? <em>\u201cA. </em>Five months, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Five months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You say the tank had always been out of order since you were in the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes; it was fixed twice already.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Fixed twice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>How was it out of order? What was the trouble with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-14\"><em>\"A. </em>It was all the time leaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Leaking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-16\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-17\">Mr. Dill was asked as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-18\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Are you employed by Lembeck &amp; Betz?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-19\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-20\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Do you have charge of the repairs of the properties? <em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-21\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Prior to March 26th, 19.17, were there any requests for repairs made there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-22\"><em>\"A. </em>On February 1st, I believe, I got the first word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-23\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And what was the nature of the trouble?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-24\"><em>\u201cA. </em>They said the tank was leaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-25\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-26\"><em>\"A. </em>I \u2019phoned to Dodd\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-27\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>The plumber?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-28\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, on the same day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-29\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Do you know whether the work was done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-30\"><em>\u201cA. </em>It was done on the second, according to his bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-31\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>The following day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-32\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-33\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Any other complaint between that time and March 26th, 1917?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>Not that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Would you know it if it had been made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I certainly would.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Considering this proof in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the situation would seem to be this: The tank having been continuously out of order during her occupation of the premises, and complaint of that fact having been made by her to the defendant, the latter sent a plumber some five months before the accident to repair the leaks. The repairs not having been properly made, the defendant\u2019s agent, Dill, at the request of the plaintiff, again sent the plumber to stop the leaks. This second attempt at repair was made a little more than seven weeks prior to the day of\u2019 the accident. What caused the accident was not shown; nor was there any evidence as to what the plumber did in his effort to stop them; nor was there anything to show that the negligent work of the plumber in making these repairs had any connection with the insecure condition of the tank. The doctrine of the LaBrasea case is that the landlord is liable for injuries to the tenant when he undertakes to make repairs, performs the work negligently, and injury comes to the tenant by reason of that -negligence. The pith of the decision is in the last clause, namely, that the plaintiff\u2019s injury results from the landlord\u2019s negligence. No such conclusion can be drawn from the testimony above recited. Whether the fall of the tank was the result of the negligence- of the plumber in making the repairs necessarily depends upon what he did, and how he did it. The burden rested upon the plaintiff to prove the causal connection between the negligence and the accident. The mere fact that the one followed the other is not sufficient. As was said by the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Suburban Electric Co. </em>v. Nugent, 58 <em>N. J. L. </em>658, \u201cIn an action for personal injury, the plaintiff,. in order to recover damages, must do more than show the possible responsibility of the defendant for the injury. In the absence of direct evidence he must show the existence of such circumstances as would justify the inference that the injury was caused by the wrongful act of the defendant, and exclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>idea that it was due to a cause with which the defendant was unconnected.\u201d The doctrine thus laid down is, in our opinion, applicable to the ease in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The rule to show cause will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
