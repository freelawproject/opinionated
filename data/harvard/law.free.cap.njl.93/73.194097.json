Said defendants also sold to plaintiff another ear of hay, but the hay received was not the same quality as ordered.\u201d Then follows a bill of particulars giving car numbers and amounts claimed as \u201cdamages\u201d on each car.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Prosecutors make the point, and we think it-well taken, that the claim is manifestly not for any debt, but for unliquidated damages. If this be so, plainly, attachment will not lie. <em>Jeffery </em>v. <em>Wooley, </em>10 <em>N. J. L. 123; Heckscher </em>v. <em>Trotter, 48 Id. </em>419.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">It is said that the right to attach is supported by the more recent eases of <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Moffat, </em>68 <em>N. J. L. </em>211, and <em>Laura </em>v. <em>Puncerelli, </em>91 <em>Id. </em>38; affirmed without opinion, 92 <em>Id. </em>518; but neither case-is in point. In Sullivan <em>v. </em>Moffat the court dealt with the state of facts set up on the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, and which it intimated he might hot be able to prove at the trial. It pointed out that there was a specific promise to pa.y a certain sum, from which plaintiff allowed certain deductions for cash, \u201cand for materials to be furnished and labor to be performed at the expense of the defendants, the cost of which appears <em>on the face of the account </em>to be certain, and, presumably, can be ascertained by some definite standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>In Laura <em>v. </em>Puncerelli tlie writ was supported (apart from ci reurustances indicating a general appearance) on the theory, which there was evidence to sustain, that, although at first the claim was purely for unliquidated damages in tort, it was turned into a contract obligation by defendant agreeing for lawful consideration to pay the cost of. making the damage good.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In proceedings under the Attachment act <em>(Comp. Stal., p. </em>332), or cognate legislation, such as sections 69 <em>et seq. </em>of the District Court act <em>(Comp. Stal., p. </em>3977), the rule in <em>Jejfery </em>v. <em>Wooley, supra,, </em>is still'in force. In that ease the suit was for a breach of covenant, and it not appearing that the covenant was to pay a sum of money or was otherwise liquida,ted, the writ was quashed. So, where the claim was for a penalty for broach of covenant, the writ was quashed <em>(Brown </em>ads. <em>Hoy, </em>16 N. <em>J. L. </em>158), and the same result was reached <em>in </em>a case of douht whether the clause in the contract provided for a penalty or for liquidated damages <em>(Cheddick </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>21 <em>Id. </em>463), though, apparently, attachment will lie on a <em>quantum meruit </em>for work and labor. <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>King, </em>36 <em>Id. </em>134, 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The case at bar rests on principles similar to those controlling the covenant cases cited above. According to plaintiffs claim, the prosecutors agreed to furnish hay of a certain quality; they furnished hay of inferior quality, thus violating their agreement;' and plaintiffs below were damaged. How much were they damaged? Who is to decide the amount? They have not agreed to pay any sum certain as damages, or any damages at all; they have not admitted the existence of damages. Manifestly, the questions whether there is damage, and, if so, its amount, are for settlement hy a jury, or by a court if jury be waived; and this is dispositive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The judgment brought up is reversed and the writ of al1 achuren t quashed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
