Accordingly, he instructed the jury that the plaintiff was a holder in due course. Of course, if such-assumption as to the facts was right, the instruction was right, for it was correct in law. <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>3741, \u00a7 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The judge, however, considered that it -was open to the jury to find from the evidence, if they saw fit, that the note had been altered from $55 to $550 by the agent of the payee without the assent of the maker before it was negotiated to the plaintiff. That question he therefore submitted to the jury, and in connection therewith charged that when a note has been materially altered, and is in the hands of a holder in due course, not a party to the alteration, he may enforce payment according to the original tenor. That was correct in law. <em>Comp. </em>Stat., <em>p. </em>3749, \u00a7 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Finally, the judge instructed the jury to determine from the evidence whether or not the note was altered from $55 to $550; that if it was altered the plaintiff could recover $55 only; that if not altered the plaintiff should recover &lt;$550 with due allowance for interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">It is, therefore, manifest that the verdict for the defendant was contrary to the law of the case as declared in the charge of the court and must be set aside for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">The other reasons assigned we have not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">The rule will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
