This service the plaintiff alleges it rendered in accordance with the provisions of these regulatory acts of congress, known as the- Elkins act, and its amendments, and that for the service thus rendered the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $3-000. To this claim the- defendant alleges in seventeen separate counts, a counter-claim for loss and damage, to the shipment while in transit.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s insistence in this situation'is, that the claim of the defendant cannot be asserted in this character of action, but must be&gt; sued upon separately, as a. distinct and independent action; because of the- public policy inherent in the acts of congress to which reference has been made. While the question thus presented is one of first impression in .this ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>risdiciion, it ims received rather extended consideration in the federal courts. The question <em>sub judice </em>is not unlike that presented in <em>L. &amp; N. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>247 <em>U. S. </em>201, in which it was held that a claim based by an interstate carrier upon the provisions of a tariff duly filed, published and approved as required by the Interstate Commerce act, the result of which necessarily depended upon the construction and effect of that act, was a subject-matter peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the federal court, as a case \u201carising under the laws of the United States or such as grow out of the legislation of congress.\u201d That adjudication followed the determination on <em>Adams Express Co. </em>v. <em>Cronniger, </em>226 <em>Id. </em>491, in which it was declared that \u201cthe parties in such a status are held to the responsibilities imposed by the federal law, to the exclusion of all other rules of obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In consonance with this declaration of jurisdiction, the identical question presented here has received consideration in <em>Illinois Central Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Hoopes &amp; Sons, </em>233 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>135, where the court, deciding adversely to the counterclaim, declared the obviorrs purpose of the Elkins act and its amendments to be, in effect, a legislative mandate against rebates and discriminations, in conformity with a public policy \u201cwhich had that purpose as its pronounced object; the effect of which was that in construing the acts of congress \u201cthe courts and the interstate commerce commission have uniformly frowned upon every device and subterfuge adopted, which in any manner permitted any discrimination whatsoever between shippers.\u201d That adjudication, after referring to the genesis of this legislation, and its manifest purpose, concluded that \u201cso important was it that the collection of freight charges should be uniform as to all shippers; so important is it that it be above suspicion of favoritism that it is against public policy to permit a counter-claim of this kind to be pleaded,\u201d and the- counter-claim was struck out.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">A similar result was reached, and upon the same ground, in <em>Chicago and North, Western Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Stein Company, </em>233 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>716, and <em>Johnson-Brown Co. </em>v. <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co., </em>239 <em>Id. </em>590.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>It </em>is urged by the defendant that these determinations, involving a question of statutory construction based upon a question of federal public policy as <em>ratio decidendi, </em>should not be followed in the state jurisdiction, if the personal interests of the local suitor should thus be inconvenienced. That argument overlooks the fundamental concept of our constitutional form of government, which concedes to the federal government exclusive jurisdiction, except as permitted by federal legislation to the states, in all matters of interstate commerce. It also assumes that the public policy thus declared may, in its results, run counter to an evolution of state public policy;' but it is obvious that as against the clear constitutional right of the general government to legislate there can be recognized no legally independent antagonistic state policy which would in its results be destructive of the fundamental conception of our national policy, based upon the constitutional prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">It also ignores the settled rule of adjudication, that as between the federal and state courts, the determinations of the former, upon the construction of a federal statute, in a cause arising \u201cunder the laws of the United States or'growing out of the legislation of congress,\u201d is conclusive and determinative upon the latter in suits instituted in the state jurisdiction. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>13 <em>Pet. (U. S.) </em>498; <em>Missouri K. &amp; T. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>184 <em>U. S. </em>530; <em>In re Lennon, </em>166 <em>Id. </em>548; <em>Robb </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>111 <em>Id. </em>624.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The question <em>sub judice </em>therefore resolves itself into one which is to be determined upon the well-settled doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>which for the reasons given must control here in favor of the motion to strike out, which will be granted, with costs, the plaintiff thereby being relegated to the vindication of his claim in a separate action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
