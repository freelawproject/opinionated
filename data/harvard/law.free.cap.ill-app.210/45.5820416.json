Municipal Court op Chicago, \u00a7 13<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when statement of claim sufficient after judgment. A statement of claim in an action for breach of contract in the sale of an automobile was sufficient after judgment entered where it set up an express oral warranty by defendants to plaintiff of a certain automobile purchased by plaintiff of defendants that it was a certain model in first-class condition, that it was not such model nor in such condition, that it had certain defects, -that plaintiff expended a certain amount for repairs, and that it was wholly worthless.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AB3\" pgmap=\"72\">2. Municipal Court op Chicago, \u00a7 13*\u2014when use of word defendant in plural in statement of claim without amendment not error. The fact that the word defendant appeared in the plural in a statement of claim, in an action against two defendants, did not prevent the trial judge from properly concluding that the statement of claim without amendment would support a judgment against one defendant after his default where the other defendant was dismissed out of the case.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AvM\" pgmap=\"72\">3. Municipal Court op Chicago, \u00a7 13*\u2014what constitutes sufficient Verification of statement of claim. An affidavit, attached to a statement of claim, reciting that the cause is an action upon contract for the payment of money, and that the nature of plaintiff\u2019s demand is upon a contract \u201cas above stated,\u201d constituted a sufficient verification to comply with rule 16 of the Municipal Court, requiring a plaintiff to file with his statement of claim an affidavit sworn to by him stating he has knowledge of the facts, showing the nature of his demand or verifying the statement of claim.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b72-9\" pgmap=\"72\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
