Instructions, \u00a7 87*\u2014when instruction on preponderance of evidence in action for negligent death not erroneous. In an action for negligent death, an instruction that plaintiff, to recover, must establish her case by a preponderance of the evidence, .that if the evidence was equally balanced or if the jury were in doubt or unable to say on which side the preponderance of the evidence lay, or if the preponderance was against the plaintiff, the verdict should be not guilty, was not misleading on the ground that it did not restrict the evidence to the issues essential to the maintenance of the action, nor point out the issues necessary to be established by a preponderance of the evidence to entitle the plaintiff to recover, the jury being specifically advised that all the instructions must be considered as a whole and that they should apply them to the facts and not detach or separate one instruction from any of the others.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
