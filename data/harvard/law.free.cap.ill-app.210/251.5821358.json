In an action by an employee to recover for personal injuries due to a fall out of a window in defendant\u2019s plant, the evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that plaintiff fell out of the window while in the act of lifting a wagon wheel to place it on the table of the machine he was operating, where plaintiff\u2019s evidence was vague and indefinite, and, in light of the surrounding circumstances, incredible, it appearing that the sill of the window was 12 inches wide; that a rivet bin 18 inches wide was located immediately in front of the window and on a level with the sill; that the machine on which plaintiff was working was,4 or 5 feet from the window; and the testimony of other witnesses tended to show that he fell out after he had opened the window and.was attempting to get some air.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b278-6\" pgmap=\"278\">2.
