Defendant, Emil M. Weber, filed a cross-bill, individually and as successor in trust to Charles Weber, trustee, to foreclose a trust deed to the same premises, executed by Peter Hoff and his wife, said Sophie, February 2, 1907, to secure a debt of $1,000 to a firm, of which said Webers were members. The acknowledgment of the last-mentioned trust deed was taken before Bertha Weber, another member of that firm.

From a decree for defendants, complainant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-11\" pgmap=\"255\">G. A.
