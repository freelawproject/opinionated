Where a lease, after naming the sum payable for the entire term, proceeds: \u201cPayable as follows: One Hundred ($100) dollars on the 15th day of October, 1916, and .............. ($......) on the 15th day of each and every succeeding month of the term,\u201d it is to be interpreted as meaning that $100 shall be paid on account of rent on the 15th day of each month during the term, and the objection that this construction might operate to compel the payment eventually of $50 more than the sum payable for the entire term is of no force where plaintiff\u2019s brief disclaims any intention of demanding more than the total sum specified, and admits that plaintiff would have no such right.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
