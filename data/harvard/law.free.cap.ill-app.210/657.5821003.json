Interurban railroads, \u00a7 4*\u2014What care required of one approaching interurhan railroad crossing.

Interurban railroads, \u00a7 4*\u2014when exerpise of care by driver of buggy in approaching crossing not shown. In an action against an interurban railroad to recover for the death of the driver of a buggy, due to a collision at a crossing, where the only eyewitnesses of the accident were the conductor and ihotorman and a person coming up the track in the opposite direction to that in which the car was going, and they all testified that deceased was driving, that both he and his companion had their heads down, and were not looking in any direction or making any efforts to ascertain whether or not any car or train was approaching from either direction, and the pedestrian testified that as he came near he shouted a warning of the approach of the train to which they paid no attention, and it further appeared that it was necessary to cross four parallel tracks in close proximity in approaching the interurban track, evidence held to show that deceased did not exercise due care for his own safety.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b684-7\" pgmap=\"684\">4. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1410*\u2014when judgment reversed because verdict against manifest weight of evidence.

Appeal and error, \u00a7 1410*\u2014when verdict not sustained because against manifest weight of evidence. While ordinarily the yerdicts of juries who have seen the witnesses upon the stand and heard them testify will not be disturbed, yet where such verdicts are against the manifest weight of the evidence, it is the duty of the Appellate Court to set them aside.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b684-9\" pgmap=\"684\">6.
