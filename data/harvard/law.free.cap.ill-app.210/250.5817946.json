In an action by a street car passenger to recover for personal injuries received while alighting from a street car where the verdict was based upon plaintiff\u2019s unsupported testimony that she was injured by the sudden starting of the car while attempting to alight therefrom at a street intersection, but the evidence was undisputed that she was picked up near the middle of the next block at a considerable distance from where she claimed to have fallen, and plaintiff became unconscious immediately after the fall, and there was no evidence that plaintiff was dragged any distance, evidence held insufficient to sustain the verdict for plaintiff and to show that she stepped off the moving car in the middle of the block.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b276-6\" pgmap=\"276\">Appeal from the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.
