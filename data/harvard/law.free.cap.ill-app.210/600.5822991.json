On a creditor\u2019s bill by creditors of a husband to subject to payment of judgments against him land quitclaimed by both husband and wife to the latter before the rendition of such judgments, evidence held sufficient to show that although a deed was made by heirs of the estate of the wife\u2019s father, in the course of a partition of the estate in the name of the husband, it was the intention of the parties that the fee should rest in the wife and that a subsequent quitclaim deed made by the husband and wife to the latter before the rendition of judgments against the husband was not made to hinder, delay and defraud creditors, but was made to effectuate such intention.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b627-6\" pgmap=\"627\">\u25a03.

Where a sworn answer is required and filed denying the material allegations of a bill, it is evidence for the defendant of such force that the complainant can have no decree against him until the same is disproved by evidence amounting to that of one witness and in addition thereto a preponderance of proofs sufficient to have sustained the bill if the oath to the answer had been waived.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b627-7\" pgmap=\"627\">4.
