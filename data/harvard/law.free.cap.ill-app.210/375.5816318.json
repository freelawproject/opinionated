Master and servant, \u00a7 110*\u2014when negligence of employer in requiring employee to operate crane near electric wires not proximate cause of death of employee 6y shock. The negligence of an employer in requiring an employee to operate a crane so near electric wires as to bring it in contact with the wires is not the proximate cause of his death, where it appears that an electric wire was broken by coming in contact with the crane cable and that after the wire had fallen, against the warning of his fellow employees and while it was clear that it was a \u201clive\u201d wire, he picked it up and held it, though there was no emergency or danger to others requiring him to do so, and received- a shock which killed him.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-11\" pgmap=\"402\">3.

If the negligence complained of, in an action for the death of an employee, merely furnished a condition by which the injury was possible and a subsequent independent act caused the injury, the existence of the condition was not the proximate cause of the injury, and if the act which was the immediate cause of the injury was such as in the exercise of reasonable diligence would not be anticipated, the first act or omission was not the proximate cause of the injury.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-5\" pgmap=\"402\">O.
