In an action by a passenger in an automobile against a street railroad to recover for personal injuries due to the collision of one of defendant\u2019s street cars with the automobile, an instruction, that even though the jury believed from the evidence that the driver of the automobile in which plaintiff was riding was guilty of negligence, that fact alone would not relieve defendant from liability if the jury believed from a preponderance of the evidence that defendant was negligent and plaintiff was free from negligence, was proper.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b175-7\" pgmap=\"175\">6.
