Where a trust deed is given to the vendor of land to secure the balance of the purchase price and it is agreed that the premises should be improved by the erection of a building and that a loan not exceeding a certain per cent, of the cost of the improvements might be made and the loan secured by a trust deed which should be a first lien upon the premises, and an agreement is made that the proceeds of the loans should not be paid to the purchaser until the liens of contractors and subcontractors should be paid, waivers of liens and receipts furnished by unpaid contractors and subcontractors to the purchaser for the purpose of enabling him to obtain the proceeds of the mortgage loan are based on sufficient consideration.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-6\" pgmap=\"283\">2.

Mechanic\u2019s lien claimants who furnish fictitious receipts and waivers of lien to the owner to enable him to procure the proceeds of a trust fund which was to be used in improvements, and the amount of which was secured by a trust deed which was a first lien upon the premises, are estopped by their receipts and waivers from claiming a lien superior to that of the vendor under a second mortgage to secure the payment of the purchase price.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-7\" pgmap=\"283\">3.

Mechanics\u2019 liens, \u00a7 135*\u2014when contention that second mortgagee did not act upon fictitious waivers of liens is untenable. The contention that the holder of a second mortgage on premises, the first mortgage on which was given to secure a loan for improvements, did not act upon fictitious waivers of liens by contractors and materialmen given to the mortgagor to enable him to procure funds out of the loan, is untenable where the second mortgagee relied upon the trustee having charge of the funds to protect him and such trustee in acting upon these representations in fact acted for the second mortgagee.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-9\" pgmap=\"283(19) 284(122)\">5. Mechanics\u2019 liens, \u00a7 135*\u2014when second mortgagee injured by procurement by mortgagor of false waivers of liens and receipts. A second mortgagee is injured by the procurement by the mortgagor of false waivers of liens and receipts from contractors and subcontractors for the purpose of obtaining proceeds of a loan to be used for improvements from a trustee holding such funds, where such procurement was in violation of an agreement between the mortgagor, mortgagee and such trustee that the funds should not be paid to the mortgagor until he had made advancements sufficient to take care of all claims of contractors and subcontractors that might imperil the lien of the second mortgagee, and it is immaterial that the liens of the claimants might be superior to the lien under the trust deed if the waivers had not been executed.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b283-10\" pgmap=\"283\">See Illinois Notes Digest; Yolg.
