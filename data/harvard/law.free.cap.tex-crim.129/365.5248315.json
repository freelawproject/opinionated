In the indictment ownership, etc., of said hog was laid in Irene Ruff. Mrs. Ruff was a married woman living with her husband on a 1600 acre ranch. Mr. Ruff was not at his house when the hog was taken, but was somewhere out on the ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-24\">Mrs. Ruff testified that she saw appellant carry the alleged stolen pig from where it was shot and put it in a car which she had met ten or fifteen minutes before that, and in which were appellant and one Jess Walker. She saw three of her pigs rooting by the road near a fence on her property just before she met appellant and Walker. She and her husband went the next morning to where she had seen appellant carying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the pig, and inside their fence was blood and brains, and on the fence blood and black hog hair, and a trail of blood led to where the car stood. Jess Walker testified that he was with appellant when appellant shot the pig, and that they later divided same. This witness was treated as an accomplice. The testimony is sufficient to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In various ways appellant raises the propriety of the averment of ownership in Mrs. Ruff. He asserted that Mrs. Ruff being a married woman, living with her husband on the ranch at the time, it should have been alleged that Mr. Ruff was the owner of the hog. Also that the proof showed theft, if at all, of community property, in which case a conviction could not stand where the indictment charged ownership in the wife. Our State\u2019s Attorney takes the position that the proof in this case fails to show that the hog was community property, but most strongly supports the conclusion that it was the separate property of - the wife, \u2014 and that in any event all the testimony shows a special ownership in her, in that she had the exclusive care,-control -and management of said hog at the time it was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Mrs. Ruff testified: \u201cI had fourteen head of hogs, I had fed them that morning in the pen * * * I saw three of these pigs down by the fence * * * They were' on my property. *' * * He (appellant) was sarrying a pig from the fence- and putting it in the car. * * * I saw the defendant raise up the back lid of his car, \u2014 it was a coupe, \u2014 and put the pig in there. * * * That night when I fed the hogs I counted them and I only had thirteen. * * * That was my hog. * * * I owned the mother of the pig. The mother of the pig was not raised on o\u00far ranch but the pig itself was. * * * I missed the pig on the night of the 15th. I fed the pigs that night and there were only thirteen there. * - * * The mother of this pig that was taken is my hog. She belonged- to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Mr. Ruff .testified: \u201cMy wife owned some hogs out there. On the 15th of June I was not at the house but was out in the pasture. I got back to the house about five o\u2019clock in that afternoon.\u201d No questions were asked this witness on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Walker, the accomplice witness who was with appellant when the latter shot the pig in question, got same and put it in the car, and later skinned it and divided with witness,\u2014 testified for the State. He said that appellant, while they had the pig in the car, told Fritz Wilheim that he had killed one of old lady Ruff\u2019s shoats; also that when they got to the home of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>witness, appellant there told the wife of witness that it was old lady Ruff\u2019s hog. Witness admitted hauling the hog in his car after appellant told him that it belonged to \u201cOld Lady Ruff.\u201d Mr. Highsmith testified that he recalled the incident wherein Mrs. Ruff was supposed to have lost a hog.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We have set out all the testimony appearing in this record shedding light on the question of ownership of the alleged stolen hog.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Art. 402, C. C. P., lays down statutory rules in reference to how ownership should be alleged in an indictment. There is no direction regarding such allegation in case the ownership be in the community composed of the husband and wife, further than the inference arising from the statutory statement therein that when property is owned in common or jointly by two or more persons, the ownership may be alleged to be in all or either of them. It is also said that where property belongs to an estate, ownership may be alleged in the administrator, executor or in any one of the heirs. It is also provided that ownership of the separate\u201d property of a wife may be alleged to be in her or in her husband. When we look to our laws defining theft, we note that Art. 1414, P. C., provides that possession may be in one person and ownership in another,\"and possession is defined in Art. 1415, id., as having the actual care, control and management of the property at the time same is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Mrs. Ruff testified positively that the pig stolen was her property, and she so stated again and again. Mr. Ruff also so testified. In a case such as this, where we are not called on to decide the issue of ownership in a contest between rival claimants for the property, and in which no defensive theory rests on a claim that the accused took the property relying on gift or purchase from the husband, there seems little room for controversy as to what we should hold. Whether Mrs. Ruff\u2019s separate ownership of the pig in question came about by gift from or agreement with her husband, \u2014 which under all the authorities could make it separate property, (see Arp v. State, 70 S. W. (2d) 997), was not developed in the record, and hence is not before us; but the fact remains that both Mrs. Ruff and her husband swore that the pig was hers. But one slight circumstance appears in testimony supporting appellant\u2019s contention that said pig was community property. This was Mrs. Ruff\u2019s statement that the mother of the pig was not raised on their ranch, but the pig was. We note that Mrs. Ruff does not say that she owned the mother of the pig before the pig <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>was born; nor does she state when, how or in what manner both mother and pig became her property; nor did appellant see fit to go into such inquiry either of Mr. or Mrs. Ruff, both of whom were witnesses. If it was satisfactory to appellant to rest the question of ownership on the testimony of each and both of these people to the effect that the pig was Mrs. Ruff\u2019s property, it must be satisfactory to this court, as it appeared to be to the trial court. The averment of ownership in Mrs. Ruff was met by the proof, and is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\">In Arp\u2019s case, supra, the alleged stolen property was a calf, the increase of a cow, which was the separate property of Mrs. Arp. Inquiry developed that there was an agreement between Mr. and Mrs. Arp that all increase of the separate property of the wife should' also be her separate property. This we held sufficient to support a conviction where the allegation was that the property taken was the separate property of the wife. In the record before us it is not shown that the sow, the mother of the pig, was the property of Mrs. Ruff before said pig was born, and both sow and pig could have become hers by gift, and since both Mr. and Mrs. Ruff swore that the pig was hers, and such fact was not disputed, \u2014 this seems to fully satisfy the law of averment of ownership in the wife in a case of theft of separate property of the wife. The proposition of being separate property of the wife is further strengthened by what Mrs. Ruff said as set out in our discussion of bill of exceptions No. 2, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Appellant\u2019s bill of exceptions No. 1 is qualified by the statement of the trial court who says that the testimony does not show that the property in question was community property, but on the contrary shows it to be the separate property of the wife. On this same point, in considering bill of exceptions No. 2, we note when Mrs. Ruff was asked the question as to whom this hog belonged, \u2014 after some wrangling between counsel,' the question finally propounded was \u201cWas this hog your property or was it yours and your husband\u2019s?\u201d to which witness' replied: \u201cNo, sir, it was mine.\u201d Another question was asked as follows: \u201cIt was your hog?\u201d Witness answered \u201cYes sir.\u201d We can not agree with appellant that any of his bills of exception, \u2014 all of which revolve around and bear upon the proposition we have been discussing, \u2014 reflect error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We deem it not necessary to go into the other proposition advanced by the State\u2019s Attorney, viz: that in any event the care, control and management of the pig in question was shown to be in Mrs. Ruff at the time it was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b391-7\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A0W\">Appellant moves for a rehearing. If we properly understand this record appellant\u2019s motion. appears to be predicated not on the lack of proof that the stolen pig was the property of Mrs. Ruff at the time it was stolen, but upon a complaint that there was no explanation of how it became her property. The record is silent as to how or when Mrs. Ruff acquired the sow that was the mother of the stolen pig. This sow is mentioned twice in the record, each time by Mrs. Ruff. In the first paragraph of her cross-examination she testified: \u201cI owned the mother of the pig. The mother of the pig was not raised on our ranch, but the pig was.\u201d Again, on re-direct examination, Mrs. Ruff swore: \u201cThe mother of this pig that was taken is my hog, she belonged to me.\u201d As to the ownership of the stolen pig Mrs. Ruff swore: \u201cOn the morning of the 15th of June, 1933, I had fourteen head of hogs * * * They were just pigs and would weigh something like fifty or sixty pounds apiece. I had fed them in the pen that morning, and they were all there. * * * That night when I fed the hogs I counted them and I only had thirteen. * * * That was my hog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Bill of exception number two shows the following: Mrs. Ruff was asked: \u201cWho did this hog belong to?\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney, in the presence of the witness and the court, objected and said, \u201cWe object to that as calling for an opinion and conclusion on the law of ownership.\u201d The State\u2019s attorney said: \u201cShe can testify if she knows who it belongs to.\u201d Defense counsel also further objected and said: \u201cShe can tell the facts and let the court and the jury say who the hog belongs to.\u201d The State\u2019s attorney then asked the witness the question: <em>\u201cWas this hog your property, or was it yours and your husband?\u201d </em>The witness answered: \u201cNo, sir, it was mine.\u201d \u201cQ. It was your hog?\u201d \u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-17\">This bill bears the following qualification: \u201cIt must be apparent that had defendant\u2019s counsel pursued his cross-examination of the fact of the birth of such pig before the acquisition of its mother in which case it . would have been separate property or to the fact of its birth after the acquisition of its mother in which case it would have been community property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Defendant\u2019s counsel omitted to make such inquiry, and thereby failed to disprove Irene Ruff\u2019s ownership of the alleged stolen pig as her separate property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\">When Mr. Ruff took the stand he swore on direct-examination: \u201cOn or about the 15th of June, 1933, my wife owned some hogs out there.\u201d On cross-examination no questions were asked. The witness Walker testified that appellant told him he had killed one of \u201cold lady Ruff\u2019s\u201d shoats over there, and later repeated in the presence of the wife of witness that it was \u201cold lady Ruff\u2019s\u201d hog. The above is all the record on the question of separate or community ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">There can be no dispute of the fact that by gift from the husband of his interest in community property to the wife, such property could become her separate property. The Supreme Court of this State has so said in many cases. Sorenson v. Bank, 121 Texas, 479; Cauble v. Refining Co., 115 Texas, 1; Cox v. Miller, 54 Texas, 16, and authorities cited. This court has also so said in a recent theft case. Arp v. State, 70 S. W. (2d) 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Clearly the pig in question was owned by one or both of these two persons. No other person had any interest whatever in the animal. These two persons were both grown and mature citizens. They both testified. It would be an unwarranted conclusion for this court to say that they intentionally falsified, or that they did not know what they affirmed under oath; namely; that on June 15, 1933, this pig was the property of Mrs. Ruff. No showing appears of curtailment of appellant\u2019s right of cross-examination of either of said witnesses in order to draw out the details of how the pig became the property of Mrs. Ruff.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">This court has held in many cases that the owner of alleged stolen property may give parol testimony as to its ownership, and it is likely that resort to such proof of ownership is had in a large majority of theft cases. It would be most novel to here state and lay down as a rule that when all parties who may have owned interests in a specific property have sworn in open court that its ownership is in <em>A </em>on a date in question, that a person convicted of the theft of such property \u2014 not defending on the ground that he owned any interest therein, or had been given any right to take same by someone claiming an interest \u2014 may have his case reversed on the proposition that said parties did not know what they were talking about, and that this court should assume that they did not so know, and that they swore what was not true. We can not agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>that appellant is now entitled to have us grant his rehearing and reverse this case simply because Mr. and Mrs. Ruff did not explain how the pig became the property of Mrs. Ruff.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">This court must give effect to Mrs. Ruff\u2019s declaration that the pig was her property and not that of her husband and herself. Such ownership \u2014 when it could legally come about in more ways than one \u2014 when affirmed to exist by both Mrs. Ruff and her husband, must stand as far as this court is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">If it had been developed that Mrs. Ruff was claiming ownership in the stolen pig solely because its mother was her separate property, the pig having been born after coverture of Mr. and Mrs. Ruff, the law would fix the status of the pig as community property, and we would have a different question to deal with.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">But, as we understand the record, the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
