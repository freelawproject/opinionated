A careful review of the testimony adduced by the State leads us to a different conclusion. The testimony shows that late in the afternoon the deceased in company with Claudie Johnson and Eddie McCuin was going down the road when they observed the appellant coming up the road carrying a single barrel shot gun. When they met, the deceased said to appellant, \u201cLet me see your old gun,\u201d to which appellant replied, \u201cI will let you see it across your head if you fool with me.\u201d At this remark deceased laughed, advanced toward appellant and again asked to see the gun, and when within four or five steps of appellant, he, deceased, reached for it. Appellant retreated and said, \u201cGet back, get back,\u201d cocked the gun and fired striking deceased in the body inflicting a mortal wound. Deceased then said, \u201cRich, I never thought that you would have done that,\u201d to which appellant replied, \u201cI did not, the gun went off.\u201d Appellant said he would not have shot the deceased for anything, whereupon the deceased requested the appellant to summon a doctor, which he did. Appellant\u2019s expression, \u201cI will let you see it across your head if you fool with me,\u201d would indicate that he was not in the best of humor and did not manifest a spirit of friendliness. It is true that after the boy was mortally wounded he, appellant, expressed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>regret of the occurrence. It is obvious from the testimony that, whether or not the killing was accidental or intentional, was a fact issue to be determined by the jury, and they determined it adversely to appellant\u2019s contention. We think that the testimony is sufficient to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Bill of exception No. 2, shows that no objection was made to the court\u2019s charge until after the verdict was returned and the jury was discharged. Obviously, under Article 660, C. C, P., this was too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Bill of exception No. 3, shows that appellant objected to a statement alleged to have been made by the deceased just preceding the killing to the effect that deceased wanted to see appellant; that he was on his way to see him, because appellant wanted to jump on him the night before. The court sustained the objection, but failed to withdraw the answer already made from the jury; however, appellant made no request to have it withdrawn. We do not believe that the court\u2019s failure to withdraw the objectionable testimony after having sustained appellant\u2019s objection to same was of such prejudicial nature as to require a reversal of this case. In view of the fact that the minimum punishment was imposed, and finding no reversible error in the record the judgment of the trial court is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
