He did not testify, nor did he introduce any evidence in his behalf. The State\u2019s testimony is sufficient to show the theft of the box containing the meat chopping machine, and its attempted sale to Mr. M\u00f3dica by the appellant, who left the box containing the machine at Mr. Modica\u2019s place of business where it was recovered by the owner. The evidence seems to justify the conclusion of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b299-14\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b299-15\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A_U\">The prosecuting witness Arterberry testified to the loss of a meat chopper of the value of $110.00. John Modica, a merchant, testified that the meat chopper was left in his store by the appellant. A detective later took the meat chopper from Modica\u2019s place of business. As the record is understood, Modica made no claim to the machine. He testified that appellant sought to use the meat chopper in payment for some groceries.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">The motion for rehearing is based upon the contention that the witness M\u00f3dica was an accomplice as a matter of law. That contention, it is thought, was properly rejected. The court, however, gave an adequate charge, leaving to the jury the question as to whether M\u00f3dica was an accomplice or an accomplice witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">Upon the record before us, we are constrained to overrule the motion for rehearing, which is accordingly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-18\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
