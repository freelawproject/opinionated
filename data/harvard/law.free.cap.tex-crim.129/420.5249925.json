State, 81 S. W. (2d) 87, wherein this court held that an indictment for assault with intent to murder not embracing an averment that the assault was made with malice aforethought would not supportt a conviction for assault with intent to murder upon malice aforethought. In Jessie v. State, 70 S. W. (2d) 743, we said: \u201cAn indictment for assault with intent to murder need not allege that the assault was with malice aforethought, unless the State seeks a conviction for assault to murder upon malice aforethought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
