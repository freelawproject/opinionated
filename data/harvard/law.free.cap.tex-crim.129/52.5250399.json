Appellant did not testify and introduced no witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-22\">Two bills of exception are brought forward. It is shown in bill No. 1 that an officer testified, over appellant\u2019s objection; that he returned to the scene of the burglary in the early morn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ing and found a pinch bar. It appears that the bar was found along the course appellant traveled when he was attempting to escape. Bill No. 2 recites, in effect, that the State proved, over appellant\u2019s objection, that one of the witnesses went back to the drugstore several hours after the burglary and found some ten inch pliers. We think the testimony shown in said bills was relevant and material.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Morrow, P.

They have again been considered and were correctly disposed of in the original opinion. The facts amply show the alleged burglarized house to have been under the care, control and management of the alleged owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
