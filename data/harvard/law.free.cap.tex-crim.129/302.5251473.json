Graves, Judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>In addition to the foregoing information, the statement of facts shows that several parties, who were aware of the facts involved in the charge of forgery against relator, made affidavits before notaries public in which they detailed the testimony they would give against relator on his trial. It is shown in the statement of facts that there were no instruments accompanying the demand other than the information and the affidavits to which we have referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">It is well settled that a charge lodged solely by informain the demanding State will not authorize an extradition warrant from the governor of the fugitive State. Ex parte Holt, 244 S. W., 1016; Ex parte Yawman, 18 S. W. (2d) 647. We quote from Ex parte Holt, supra, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\u201cThe authority for the extradition is found in the statutes of the United States, in which it is said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201c \u2018Whenever the executive authority of any state or territory demands any person as a fugitive from justice, of the executive authority of any state or terrtiory to which such person has fled, and produces a copy of an indictment found or an affidavit made before a magistrate of any state or territory, charging the person demanded with having committed treason, felony, or other crimes,\u2019 etc. R. S. of the United States sec. 5278 (U. S. Comp St. Sec. 10126).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cIt is to be noted that this statute requires the production of a copy of an indictment found or affidavit made. The executive warrant in the instant case purports on its face to issue for one who is charged by information with an offense. The statement of facts also shows that the relator was charged under an information filed by the county attorney and not upon an affidavit or indictment. Whether, in the absence of an affidavit or indictment, extradition proceedings may be had upon an information filed, is a subject upon which the authorities are conflicting. In this State, in the case of Ex parte Bergman, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 8, 130 S. W., 174, it was held that, where the information was followed by a conviction, and the requisition was accompanied by the judgment of conviction of an offense, the law was satisfied. It is to be noted that the words used in the Constitution of the United States are these: \u2018A person charged in any State\u2019 \u2014 while the statute is in the languge which we have quoted in the quotation, supra. In the case of Ex parte Lewis, 75 Texas Crim. Rep., 320, 170 S. W., 1098, after a review of many authorities, this court decided that an \u2018information\u2019 would not suffice. In that case, as in the one at bar, there had been no conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of the offense charged in the information. Upon these authorities, we are constrained to hold that the extradition warrant in question did not justify the refusal of the trial court to discharge the relator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The judgment is reversed and relator is ordered discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Reversed and relator discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
