Upon his arrest relator made application for writ of habeas corpus, which was awarded. After a hearing he was remanded to custody. Hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">It is relator\u2019s contention that the evidence upon which the State is seeking to convict him is incompetent, and that a conviction cannot be supported by sufficient evidence. It is well settled that the merits of a case involving the guilt or innocence of an accused is not a proper subject of inquiry in a writ of habeas corpus. Ex parte Drenner, 67 S. W. (2d) 870; Ex parte Rogers, 201 S. W., 1157. From Branch\u2019s Annotated Penal Code, sec. 239, we quote the following: \u201cThe writ of habeas corpus will not lie where the remedy at law is adequate, nor will it lie after indictment to prevent a trial on the merits although the agreed statement of facts shows that the accused is not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">The judgment remanding relator is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
