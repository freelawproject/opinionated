He also asked a number of special charges. The complaint of the court\u2019s charge was directed at the propositions of the law of accomplice testimony. We have carefully gone over the court\u2019s charge in regard to such matter. The charge of the court was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-19\">\u201cI instruct you that the witness Guy Alexander is an accomplice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-20\">\u201cYou are instructed that you cannot convict the defendant upon the testimony of said Guy Alexander unless you first believe that his testimony is true, and shows that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged, and then you cannot convict the defendant upon said testimony unless you further believe that there is other testimony in the case, corroborative of the testimony of said Guy Alexander tending to connect the defendant with the offense charged; and the corroboration is not sufficient if it -merely shows the commission of the offense charged.\u201d We think this is a correct statement of the law. Appellant\u2019s requested charge No. 2 erroneously sought to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the jury told that they could not convict upon the testimony of the accomplice alone, etc. We have uniformly condemned charges which tell or seek to tell the jury that they cannot convict upon the testimony of the accomplice alone. See Lightfoot v. State, 80 S. W. (2d) 984. The remainder of said special charge appears to be covered by the charge given. We regard requested charge No.. 3 as erroneous because upon the weight of the evidence, which criticism applies also to requested charges Nos. 4 and 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The testimony of the accomplice fully and completely made out a case of burglary against the appellant. A number of corroborative facts and circumstances were testified to by other witnesses, the effect of which was to connect appellant with the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Morrow, P.
