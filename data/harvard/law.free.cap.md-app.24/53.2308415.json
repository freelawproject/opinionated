The indictment grew out of a racially based escapade by three young white men who, for a \u201clark\u201d, decided on the night of August 18, 1972 to \u201craise a little hell\u201d with the black people who lived in the Ken-Gar area of Montgomery County. As the three youths drove along Plyers Mill Road they threw firecrackers at the people they saw. The vehicle in which the youths were riding was driven by Mark Stephen Murray who was eighteen years old. According to the testimony of one of the youths, the perverted form of entertainment decided upon by the three young men was Murray\u2019s idea. After the firecrackers were hurled at various pedestrians and bystanders, the vehicle continued on Plyers Mill Road to what proved to be a cul-de-sac. There the three observed that they were being approached by a group of black men. One of the trio fled afoot, the other two, including Murray, remained in the vehicle. When the group of black men surrounded the vehicle they told the two remaining white youths to get out of the car. Murray responded with the question, \u201cCan\u2019t we talk this over?\u201d One of the group of black persons possessed a gun and discharged the gun three times in a downward motion into the ground. Either ricochets or gravel came in contact with the underside of the motor vehicle. Instead of alighting from the car, Murray began to drive the car forward and the person with the gun fired twice. The vehicle ground to\u2019 a halt, and Murray exclaimed that he had been hit. He slumped forward over the wheel. The other white youth got out of the car and was beaten about his head and body. Murray died as a result of a gunshot wound that entered his back, punctured both lungs and his aorta vein. The youth who was beaten by the group of black men positively identified the appellant, Hopkins, as the person who discharged the firearm into the ground. As a result of a search and seizure warrant, a .25 caliber pistol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>was recovered from the residence of Hopkins, and that weapon was positively identified by a ballistics expert as the weapon from which the fatal projectile was fired. The jury convicted Hopkins of manslaughter, assault and wearing or carrying a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Prior to trial Hopkins moved for a dismissal of his indictment on the ground that \u201cthe Grand Jury was not an impartial body, in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and of Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, for the reason that a Montgomery County police officer was a member of the Grand Jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">At the hearing before the three-judge panel, on November 16, 1972, Matthew Hyatt, a Montgomery County police officer, testified that he had been summoned as a grand juror for Montgomery County, and that when he appeared before the jury judge he stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think that. . . [he] would be able to serve and observe in an unbiased manner.\u201d He stated that he knew most of the police officers who would appear before the grand jury panel, and that in his view when an arrest was made he felt that that in itself was sufficient to warrant an indictment. The officer acknowledged that from time to time his advice was sought by members of the grand jury, and that on at ldast one occasion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his vote had been the crucial one. The officer further said that he believed it was impossible for him to serve as a police officer six days a week and be an impartial member of the grand jury on the seventh day. He opined that he lived in dread of making a felony arrest and then having to appear as a State witness before the self-same grand jury of which he was member. This latter eventuality did not occur, however. Officer Hyatt also told the panel that there were occasions when his \u201cright to express\u201d himself \u201cmight have been a factor involving persuading other people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>to change their vote\u201d for indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officer Hyatt was asked: \u201c. .. [W]ould it be fair to say that in every case that came before that grand jury, that you evaluated the testimony of each and every witness honestly and fairly and as completely as you could pursuant to your oath as a grand juror? \u201d Mr. Hyatt responded: \u201cI did serve as best I could under the oath of being a grand juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">When the jury judge was called to testify he told the panel of judges that he remembered Officer Hyatt because Hyatt had initially returned the grand jury questionnaire unanswered with the notation \u201cacross the top . . . that he was a police officer and that he wasn\u2019t subject to grand jury service.\u201d The officer was instructed as a result of the jury judge\u2019s phone call to the police officer to send a completed jury questionnaire. Thereafter according to the judge\u2019s \u201conly clear recollection\u201d, Officer Hyatt stated that service on the grand jury would require him \u201cto give up his day off each week.\u201d Jury service, he said, \u201cwould deprive him of accompanying his wife on shopping trips and doing other errands\u201d, and that such service \u201cwould be very inconvenient to him and a hardship upon him.\u201d The judge said that he had \u201cno independent recollection\u201d of any reference to \u201cbias on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>account of [Hyatt\u2019s] employment.\u201d The judge also testified that he was \u201cunconvinced that [Hyatt] would not be able to render impartial service.\u201d There was testimony that two other law enforcement officers had been excused from the grand jury because their excuses were found to be \u201ccredible\u201d. The record reveals the following questions put to the jury judge and his answers thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201cQ. He was qualified to be a grand juror by the fact that you didn\u2019t think he was a truthful person; is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">A. I thought he was emotionally upset and he wasn\u2019t presenting a credible story as to why he should be excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Q. But this was at least his second or third attempt to be excused; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">A. Well, his first attempt was to not fill out the questionnaire, and he cited in his questionnaire respondent filled out that he was a police officer and he wasn\u2019t supposed to serve on a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">Q. Did any information come to you after he served, after he was sworn, that he still wanted to get off, that at this time he wanted to get off the grand jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">A. I don\u2019t recall any request made during the jury service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">Q. Do you know if your office received any letters from him or an attorney who represented him, or telephone calls from an attorney who represented him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">A. I don\u2019t recall any. My secretary would have the letters, if they were received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-13\">Q. Did you receive any letters or requests from any of his superior officers in the Police Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">A. Any requests that he be excused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-15\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-16\">A. None whatever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The three judge panel, on December 22, 1972, denied the appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">On appeal to this Court appellant attacks the ruling of the three judge panel. He argues that the Due Process Clause of the Constitution of the United States \u201cprotects a defendant from jurors who are actually incapable of rendering an impartial verdict based on the evidence and the law.\u201d Further, he asserts that \u201cthe U.S. Supreme Court has held that a State may not subject a defendant to indictment and trial by grand and petit juries that are plainly illegal in their composition.\u201d In support of his contention appellant cites <em>Jordan v. Massachusetts, </em>225 U. S. 167, 32 S. Ct. 651, 56 L. Ed. 1038 (1912); <em>Moore v. Dempsey, </em>261 U. S. 86, 43 S. Ct. 265, 67 L. Ed. 543 (1923) and <em>Peters v. Kiff </em>407 U. S. 493, 92 S. Ct. 2163, 33 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972). We think appellant misreads <em>Jordan, Moore </em>and <em>Peters, </em>and then misapplies them to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\"><em>Jordan </em>dealt with a member of the petit jury who was insane. <em>Moore </em>was concerned with a petit jury\u2019s being intimidated by \u201cthreat of mob violence.\u201d <em>Peters </em>involved a Caucasian\u2019s challenge to the systematic governmental exclusion of black persons from both the grand and petit juries. Clearly, <em>Jordan </em>and <em>Moore </em>are inapposite and need no discussion. <em>Peters </em>does not stand for the proposition that in order for an indictment to be valid the grand jury must be free of bias. Mr. Justice Marshall, writing for the plurality, opined at 501:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201c.. . [I]f a State chooses, quite apart from constitutional compulsion, to use a grand or petit jury, due process imposes limitations on the composition of that jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Long before this Court held that the Constitution imposes the requirement of jury trial on the States, it was well established that the Due Process Clause protects a defendant from jurors who are actually incapable of rendering an impartial verdict, based on the evidence and the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In our view, <em>Peters v. Kiff, supra, </em>does not modify the holding of the Supreme Court in <em>Beck v. Washington, </em>369 U. S. 541, 82 S. Ct. 955, 8 L.Ed.2d 98 (1962). In that case the Court upheld the State of Washington\u2019s high Court\u2019s affirmation of Beck\u2019s conviction. Beck had argued that the grand jury was biased because of adverse magazine and newspaper publicity in which Beck\u2019s guilt was accepted as having been established as fact. The Supreme Court said that there had been no showing of actual prejudice. It went on, however, to state flatly that it did not \u201cremotely intimate any view\u201d on whether an accused is entitled under the Due Process Clause to an unbiased grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Appellant\u2019s reading of <em>Peters v. Kiff, supra, </em>appears to be overly broad. Patently a grand jury does not \u201crender a verdict\u201d, but merely determines from the one-sided presentation of facts whether there is sufficient proof before it upon which to bring a charge. It is the trier of fact, the petit jury, that hands in a verdict. Had the Supreme Court intended to depart from its decision in <em>Beck, supra, </em>and intimate its view, it would, in our opinion, have done so. Significantly, the Supreme Court did not deviate from the course it chose in <em>Beck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Although historians disagree as to the origin of the grand jury,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> G. Edwards <em>The Grand Jury 2 </em>(1906) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">\u201cStrictly speaking there is no obscurity surrounding the origin of the \u2018grand jury\u2019, for it was not until the 42nd year of the reign of Edward III (A.D. 1368) that the modern practice of returning a panel of twenty-four men to inquire for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the county was established and this body then received the name of <em>\u2018le graunde inquest\u2019. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The Englishmen who first settled in the colonies brought with them \u201call the civil rights which they enjoyed in their native land, and with them came the grand jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. The Constitution of the United States, as originally adopted,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> contained no provision guaranteeing a presentment or indictment by a grand jury. The omission was corrected by the ratification of the Fifth Amendment, December 15, 1791.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Fifth Amendment provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201cNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger, . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The above-quoted portion of the Fifth Amendment has not been held to be applicable to the several States, <em>Peters v. Kiff, supra, Hurtado v. California, </em>110 U. S. 516, 4 S. Ct. 111, 28 L. Ed. 232 (1884), although it is indubitably binding upon the Federal Government.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The grand jury system has been both praised and damned. There are those who view the grand jury as the \u201csecurity of Englishmen\u2019s lives\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cthe grand bulwark of his liberties\u201d,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and \u201cthe noblest check upon the malice and oppression of individuals and states\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the other hand, its critics view it as \u201cpurely mischievous\u201d,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a \u201crelic of barbarism\u201d,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">As Chief Judge Murphy noted in his address to the General Assembly of Maryland, n. 7, <em>supra, </em>there is nothing in the Maryland Constitution that mandates indictment by a grand jury as a prerequisite to trial. Moreover, the Legislature heeded the advice of Chief Judge Murphy and conferred upon State\u2019s Attorneys a qualified right to elect to proceed against an accused either by way of indictment or information. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 592.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The Court of Appeals and this Court have stated that a grand jury is: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>Hopkins v. State, supra. See also Coblentz v. State, </em>164 Md. 558, 166 A. 45, 88 A.L.R. 886 (1933). In <em>Coblentz </em>the Court of Appeals considered a case wherein the president of a bank was charged with accepting deposits even though he knew that his bank was insolvent. The Court, speaking through Chief Judge Bond said at 570:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201c . . . [A]n inquisitional and accusatory body. It does not determine the guilt or innocence of the accused as that decision is vested in the petit jury or court, if there be a non-jury trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u201cA second objection advanced in the plea was that nine members of the grand jury were disqualified from serving in the investigation and from finding this particular indictment because they had been subject to losses as depositors in the Central Trust Company, or in other depositaries which had been merged with that company, and were embittered against the defendant; and because the foreman, one of those depositors, had publicly declared his hostility to the defendant and charged him with fraud. This objection we find insufficient to support the plea. The grand jury, as has been observed, is not a judicial body; it is an accusing body, permitted to act upon knowledge obtained by its members from any source. Under the requirements of the statute law of the state, Code, art. 51, secs. 7 to 10, they are chosen with judgment and discretion with reference to their intelligence, sobriety, and integrity; and they are sworn to present no person for envy, hatred, malice, or ill will. But there are no statutory provisions in Maryland, as there are in some other states, prescribing additional cautions or qualifications, and we find no ground for imposing a requirement that they must be unprejudiced, as the objection demands. On the contrary, such a requirement would seem inconsistent with their freedom to accuse upon their own knowledge, for persons who come with knowledge sufficient to serve as a basis of indictment are likely to come with the conclusion and prejudice to which that knowledge leads. They must act upon their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>convictions, after conferring secretly and without any interference; but they are not required to come without any prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">It has been held that a person is not disqualified to serve as a grand juror on the ground that: (a) he was the prosecutor of the case, <em>U. S. v. Williams, </em>28 F. Cas. 666 (No. 16,716) (C.C.D. Minn. 1871); (b) he was a relative of the person the accused was alleged to have injured, <em>Collins v. State, </em>3 Ala. App. 64, 58 So. 80 (1912); (c) the complaining witness, <em>Holmes v. State, </em>160 Ark. 218, 254 S. W. 470 (1923); (d) the son-in-law of the murder victim, <em>Oglesby v. State, </em>83 Fla. 123, 90 So. 825 (1922); (e) the father of a rape case prosecutrix, <em>Zell v. State, </em>15 Ohio App. 446, 32 Ohio C. A. 385 (1922); (f) the committing magistrate, <em>State v. Chairs, </em>9 Baxt. (Tenn.) 196 (1877); (g) a member of a petit jury before whom perjury was alleged to have been committed, <em>State v. Wilcox, </em>104 N. C. 847, 10 S. E. 453 (1889); (h) a special police officer, <em>Commonwealth v. Hayden, </em>163 Mass. 453 (1895); (i) a member of an organization the object of which was to detect crime, <em>Musick v. The People, </em>40 Ill. 268 (1866); (j) that he had previously issued a warrant for and expressed an opinion as to the guilt of the accused, <em>United States v. Belvin, </em>46 F. 381 (1891); (k) a deputy sheriff, <em>Owens v. The State, </em>25 Tex. App. 552 (1888).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\"><em>Note, </em>111 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1000,1001-02 (1963) discussed the reason that the general rule as to impartiality of grand juries has not been superseded by the Supreme Court in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>recent grand jury racial discrimination cases. The author stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">\u201cThe asserted right [by Beck] to an unprejudiced grand jury was based primarily upon the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Cassell v. Texas </em>[339 U.S. 282, 70 S.Ct. 629, 94 L.Ed. 839 (1950)]: \u2018Review was sought in this case to determine whether there had been a violation by Texas of petitioner\u2019s federal constitutional right to a fair and impartial grand jury.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\"><em>Cassell </em>marked the culmination of the development, in a long line of racial discrimination cases, of a rule that \u2018a Negro is denied the equal protection of the laws when he is indicted by a grand jury from which Negroes as a race have been intentionally excluded.\u2019 This principle is not applicable by analogy to the \u2018impartiality\u2019 question in the instant case. Systematic discrimination against the race is the sole issue in the Negro cases, and there is no inquiry as to the state of mind of the grand jurors concerning the defendant. Mr. Justice Douglas\u2019 interpretation of <em>Cassell </em>as insuring impartiality towards the defendant overlooks the fact that it is the manner of selection \u2014 as opposed to the mental attitude of those selected \u2014 that violates the equal protection rule enunciated in <em>Cassell. </em>Exclusion of Negroes from the panels is not indicative of the mental attitude of the white persons actually selected, and the Court has never held that a defendant has a vested right to representation of his race.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">The majority opinion expressly disclaimed any intimation on whether due process requires impartiality vis-a-vis the defendant, but did cite dicta in three recent cases<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to show that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>colorable argument to this effect might be made. But until the Court either adopts Justice Douglas\u2019 position and extends the meaning of \u2018impartiality\u2019 beyond protection of minority groups, or reverts to a viewpoint that has been criticized in the past half century \u2014 that the function of the grand jury is to stand between the prosecutor and the accused \u2014 , due process does not seem to require that grand jurors be completely impartial toward prospective defendants.\u201d (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">By Laws of 1969, ch. 408, the legislature repealed and reenacted Md. Ann. Code art. 51, <em>Ju\u00f1es.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In doing so it eliminated all exemptions from jury service. Subsequently at the next legislative session two exemptions were added, <em>viz., </em>\u201cmembers of the organized militia duly certified as such by the military department\u201d, and those persons \u201cseventy (70) years or older\u201d who are exempted if they in writing so prove.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We observe that then Md. Ann. Code art. 51, \u00a7 9<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> provided that a person could be excused from jury duty,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u201c(ii) ... by the court on the ground that such person may be unable to render impartial jury service or that his service as a juror would be likely to disrupt proceedings, or . . . (vi) excluded upon determination by the court that his service as a juror would be likely to threaten the secrecy of the proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect the integrity of the jury deliberations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The quoted provisions of \u00a7 9 are by the permissive language utilized directed to the sound discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">It is apparent from the record that the jury judge, who considered Officer Hyatt\u2019s request to be excused from jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>duty, believed that the officer\u2019s request was motivated by: (1) the officer\u2019s desire not to perform jury duty on his \u201cday off\u201d, and (2) the officer\u2019s desire to be with his wife, and to go shopping with her. The fact that Officer Hyatt was a police officer did not, as we have already observed, <em>per se </em>disqualify him from grand jury duty, and Mr. Hyatt\u2019s status as a policeman did not in and of itself demonstrate bias or prejudice, nor is there anything in the record before us that shows that Mr. Hyatt\u2019s jury service disrupted those proceedings, threatened their security or adversely affected the integrity of the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Although we think the jury judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to exclude a policeman from grand jury service, we believe the better course of action would have been to have excused the officer. We repeat, however, that there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States or the State of Maryland, nor the statutes of the State of Maryland that exempts police officers from grand or petit jury service. If such a provision is to be written, it is for the General Assembly to do so and not the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We note that permitted attacks on the composition of grand juries, because of alleged prejudice or bias on the part of a grand juror or grand jurymen, would wreak havoc with the orderly administration of criminal justice, impede speedy trials and generally create a chaotic condition. Each person who had been indicted might, in an effort to have that indictment dismissed, seek to challenge the membership of the grand jury upon the hopeful ground that at least one of the grand jurors had some bias toward the accused as the result of ingrained prejudice, adverse publicity, a relationship to the victim or a witness or some other type of kindred connection with the State\u2019s charges. Needless to say, such a procedure could result in each member of the grand jury\u2019s possibly being subjected to a <em>voir dire </em>\u201cfishing expedition\u201d by each and every accused indicted by that grand jury. In our view the Due Process Clauses of the Constitution of the United States do not require us to substitute a chaotic condition for the orderly administration of criminal justice. Moreover, as we see it, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>long as the accused is indicted by a grand jury that is chosen without systematic exclusion of any race or creed, and the accused is afforded a right to a petit jury that he may subject to <em>voir dire </em>in order to eliminate the possibility of prejudice, the constitutional protection of due process is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Next, appellant asserts that the trial judge erred when he allowed into evidence irrelevant testimony that was highly prejudicial to the appellant. Richard Clarence Dorsey was jointly indicted with the appellant, but apparently he struck some sort of \u201cbargain\u201d with the State. Seemingly in exchange for Dorsey\u2019s testimony he was to be allowed to plead guilty to \u201cassault\u201d and the State would recommend imposition of a sentence of less than one year. The record reveals that when Dorsey was called as a witness the prosecutor asked him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">\u201cQ. When you saw me last night, what were you concerned about or were you worried about anything at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">A. At that point I was a little bit worried because</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">[Defense counsel]: Objection. He has answered the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">(The Court): Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">By [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">Q. Why were you worried?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">[Defense counsel]: I object, irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\">(The Court): Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-14\">(The Witness): Well, I was worried because if I come and testified against Mr. Hopkins, that maybe some things I would say would probably help him, <em>but that a lot of people would get the wrong idea about the thing and probably would do something to my family instead of me. </em>\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">Appellant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>denied. Counsel then requested the court for a clarifying instruction to the jury. The court declined to give it. In this Court appellant contends that the testimony of Dorsey as to his mental state was designed to show that appellant was a violent man.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We do not see it that way. The above quoted questions posed to the witness by the State are, in our view, improper, and the objections should have been sustained on the ground of irrelevancy. Nevertheless, we do not perceive the answers to the questions to have conveyed to the jury an inference that Hopkins was a violent man. On the contrary, the witness\u2019s answer makes it pellucid that he was not referring to Hopkins, but to a \u201clot of people\u201d who would misconceive the witness\u2019s motive in testifying. Although the State was patently engaged in a bootstrap operation in that they were endeavoring to elevate the witness\u2019s credibility, we cannot, on the basis of the record before us, hold that the questions were designed \u201cto blast\u201d Hopkins\u2019s character before it had been put in issue by him. <em>Cf. MacEwen v. State, </em>194 Md. 492, 504, 71 A. 2d 464 (1950). In the course of a trial, and particularly a lengthy trial, errors may be committed in ruling on evidentiary matters. All errors, however, are not reversible as some are deemed, under the totality of the circumstances of the particular case, to be harmless. This is such a case. Even though the trial judge erred in overruling the objections to the above quoted questions we cannot find, in the light of the totality of the evidence, that the jury was misled or likely to have been misled by the witness\u2019s answer as to why he was worried. In actuality, Hopkins opts for a perfect trial. While ideally that lofty aim is desired, it is not required. Hopkins, as are all other accused, is entitled to receive a fair trial, not a perfect one. <em>Moore v. State, </em>23 Md. App. 540, 329 A. 2d 48 (1974); <em>Burnett v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 550, 275 A. 2d 176 (1971); <em>Shotkosky v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 492, 261 A. 2d 171 (1970); <em>Boblits v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 391, 256 A. 2d 187 (1969). <em>See also State v. Babb, </em>258 Md. 547, 267 A. 2d 190 (1970). The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States commands that the several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>states shall afford an accused \u201cdue process of law.\u201d Judge Morton, for this Court, in <em>Burnett v. State, supra, </em>stated that, \u201cThe sphere of [the Fourteenth] Amendment mandates that every individual accused of a crime shall receive no less than a fair and impartial trial.\u201d In our view Hopkins received the fair and impartial trial which he was constitutionally guaranteed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Hopkins next argues that the trial judge committed reversible error when the judge interrupted the jury argument of appellant\u2019s counsel. The record reveals that defense counsel had stated to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201cDo you really think that the State of Maryland and the Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney thinks that Dorsey is truthful? If they thought he was truthful, they would have to think he was telling the truth, that he might be wrong, but they would have to think he was telling the truth when he testified, did you hear Dorsey say that Gene Davis had bribed the police \u2014 excuse me \u2014 that the police had bribed Gene Davis with twenty-five dollars and a bottle of wine in order <em>to get him to give false information to them so they could get a search warrant, or words to that effect. </em>He used the word \u2018bribe.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Thereafter the trial judge interposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: [Counsel], I feel compelled to present to the jury that the confusion was solely yours and not the Court\u2019s. The Court out of courtesy to you gave your instruction, . . . and on the rule of law that the jury is the judge of the law as well as the fact, the Court has permitted you to argue it to them. I gave them as a courtesy to you your instruction, and I am tired of hearing you comment on matters that are not in the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury: I also am compelled to tell you that counsel a few minutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ago told you in relation to the testimony of Mr. Dorsey, who testified that Davis told him that the police bribed him with twenty-five dollars and a bottle of wine, [Counsel] commented to you that the police bribed him to get him to give false testimony, to perjure himself so that they could get a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">I instruct you at this stage, and I am sorry to have to interrupt counsel to do it, that there is <em>no such evidence that those police bribed Davis or paid him to get him to suborn perjury so they could get a search warrant. </em>\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In order to place the judge\u2019s comments upon the argument of counsel in proper perspective, we quote from pertinent portions of Dorsey\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cREDIRECT EXAMINATION (Resumed)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">By [the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">Q. Would you like to explain the answer to the last question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">A. Yes. The reason why I was locked up, anyway, is because two of the police had bribed Mr. Davis and gave him twenty-five dollars to tell him who was in the crowd down there the first night, the night that the incident happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">Q. The night this happened, did you talk with the police or did the police try to talk with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">A. Yes, sir. The police had tried to talk to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">RECROSS-EXAMINATION (Resumed)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">By [Defense Counsel]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">Q. Did I understand when you mentioned Gene Davis, that was just asked you by the prosecutor, that you were expressing indignation that the police had gotten Gene Davis to talk to them and give them false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>information by giving him twenty-five dollars, is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] I object. That is just outrageous, to characterize it that way. He said nothing of the kind, and I object to that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">[Defense Counsel] He said they \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">(The Court) I am going to overrule the objection. It is cross-examination. I think it is proper. Do you understand the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">(The Witness) Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">By [Defense Counsel]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">Q. And they also gave Gene Davis not only twenty-five dollars but twenty-five dollars and a bottle of wine, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">(The Court) What was that answer? Yes? They not only gave him twenty-five dollars but that \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">[Defense Counsel] He is testifying that the police bribed Gene Davis with twenty-five dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-14\">(The Court) I know what he said. You said something. I cannot understand half of what you say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-15\">[Defense Counsel] I\u2019m sorry, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-16\">(The Court) Read me what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-17\">(Whereupon, the Court Reporter read back the last question.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-19\">By [Defense Counsel]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-20\">Q. By \u2018they,\u2019 you meant the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-22\">(The Court) That is what I didn\u2019t understand, about the sneaky-pete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-23\">By [Defense Counsel]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-24\">Q. The point is you were angry that Mr. Davis became an informer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>A. No, I\u2019m not angry with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">Q. All right. Let me ask you this: Did you testify that you considered, Mr. Dorsey, when you are testifying, and when you talked to [the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] that you were doing so for a bribe of getting a sentence not to exceed one year imprisonment and a dropping of all other charges against you? Can you answer that yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">A. I did not quite understand the whole thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">Q. Do you think that you have been bribed the way Gene Davis has been bribed, except that instead of getting twenty-five dollars and a bottle of wine, you are getting a first degree murder charge dropped against you at the top risk of one year imprisonment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">REDIRECT EXAMINATION (Resumed)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">By [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">Q. Mr. Dorsey, the information that Mr. Davis may have given to the police, did you hear him talking to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">A. Well, he had come and told me his self after two other people had called me that \u2014 early that morning and saw him in the car with the police, which I saw him, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\">Q. Okay. So you talked to Gene Davis after it happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-14\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-15\">Q. And he told you, I presume, that the police gave him twenty-five dollars and a bottle of wine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-16\">A. Yes, that morning he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-17\">Q. And to you that is a bribe, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-18\">A. I guess that is what you call it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-19\">Nowhere in the testimony of Dorsey is there a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>to the effect that the police had bribed Davis in order to get false information from him in order to obtain a search warrant. It is beyond question that Dorsey considered the payment of twenty-five dollars and a giving of a bottle of wine to Davis as a \u201cbribe\u201d, but notwithstanding what he considered it, he did not say nor did he imply that the information supplied by Davis was false or that it was for the purpose of getting a search warrant. According to Dorsey the \u201cbribe\u201d was offered to elicit \u201cwho was in the crowd down there . . . the night that the incident happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">This Court has on occasion commented upon the jury remarks of prosecutors. <em>Fryson v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 320, 301 A. 2d 211 (1973); <em>Reidy v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 169, 259 A. 2d 66 (1969); <em>Conway v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 400, 256 A. 2d 178 (1969); <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 265, 250 A. 2d 904 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In <em>Holbrook </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\u201cOf course, the prosecutor may not make statements to, the jury which exceed the limits of permissible comment. What exceeds the limits of permissible comment depends a good deal upon the facts of each case.... It is the duty of the prosecutor to confine himself in argument to facts in evidence, and he should not state or comment upon facts not in evidence or to state what he could have proven.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">For an in-depth discussion of permissible and impermissible jury argument by prosecutors, see the comprehensive opinion of Judge O\u2019Donnell in <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 326 A. 2d 707 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">While our discussions have heretofore been confined, basically, to those instances of alleged impermissible prosecutorial jury argument, what we have said applies equally to arguments of defense counsel. It is no more permissible for defense counsel to engage in improper jury argument than it is for the State\u2019s prosecutorial arm. Trial judges are under an obligation to see that the rights of the parties, both the State and the accused, are protected so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>judicial proceedings are conducted in a fair and unprejudicial manner. <em>Fryson v. State, supra; Little v. Duncan, </em>14 Md. App. 8, 284 A. 2d 641 (1971); <em>Ferry v. Cicero, </em>12 Md. App. 502, 280 A. 2d 37 (1971). <em>See also DeMay v. Carper, </em>247 Md. 535, 233 A. 2d 765 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Although the appellant sees error in the judge\u2019s interruption of defense counsel\u2019s jury argument, we do not see it in the same light. It is the obligation of a trial judge to \u201cmaintain strict control over the trial\u201d, <em>Ferry v. Cicero, supra, </em>and, the judge \u201cshould have no reluctance to exercise, <em>sua sponte </em>if necessary,\u201d that duty. <em>Ibid. </em>In the instant case it is apparent that defense counsel\u2019s argument as to what Dorsey had stated exceeded the bounds of what Dorsey, in fact, said. Counsel was wrong. Dorsey did not testify that Davis gave \u201cfalse information\u201d nor did he indicate that such information was for the purpose of police obtention of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We think the judge acted correctly and in accordance with his duty to conduct a fair and impartial trial. <em>Fryson v. State, supra; Ferry v. Cicero, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\">. The particular occasion was not specifically identified because of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\">. The officer was asked by one of the judges of the panel why he took the oath that was given to the grand jury. Officer Hyatt responded that he felt compelled to take the oath in view of the jury judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss him from grand jury service. He stated, \u201cWhat other choice did I have? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">\u201c[The judge]: Officer, I would say the choice you would have had was to stand up to your full height and say, \u2018Go to hell. I can\u2019t serve.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">The witness: As I remember, I almost did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">[The judge]: We are not going to have an America if you people and the rest of you don\u2019t start doing that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Perhaps the officer was more cognizant of the jury judge\u2019s summary contempt power than the jury judge\u2019s colleague. <em>See </em>State v. Roll, 267 Md. 714, 298 A. 2d 867 (1973); Thomas v. State, 21 Md. App. 572, 320 A. 2d 538 (1974), <em>cert, denied </em>by the Court of Appeals, September 11, 1974; Meyers v. State, 23 Md. App. 275, 326 A. 2d 773. We cannot help but observe that we may not \u201chave an America\u201d if everyone decides to take the law into his own hands and judges advocate, from the bench, disrespect for law. In short, the judge was wrong. He would have done well to remember the words of J. Locke, <em>Second Treatise of Government, </em>\u00a7 57 (1690), where it is written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">\u201cThe end of law is not to abolish or to restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom; for in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where there is no law, there is no freedom.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">. The Motion to Dismiss was joined into by twenty-four other accuseds, but their cases are not before us. The motion contained other grounds for dismissal. The other grounds/are not raised in this appeal. We have previously considered the issues, however, in other cases, and we have decided them adversely to the position taken by the twenty-five accused. <em>See </em>Wilkins v. State, 16 Md.

I do not suggest abolition of the grand jury; I would preserve the institution, but make it more responsive to the needs of the public by utilizing it, not as it is presently primarily utilized \u2014 to screen cases about which the grand jurors have absolutely no information other than what the State\u2019s Attorney and police present to them, but instead to concentrate its energies on its historical investigatory function, considering matters of real importance where no prior arrest has occurred, such as cases involving allegations of public corruption....\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b82-9\">.
