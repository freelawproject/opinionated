There is a delicate balance to be maintained in assuring expeditious prosecution which is not an exclusive benefit of an accused.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\">. . there is a societal interest in providing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>speedy trial which exists separate from, and at times in opposition to, the interests of the accused. The. inability of courts to provide a prompt trial has contributed to a large backlog of cases in urban courts which, among other things, enables defendants to negotiate more effectively for pleas of guilty to lesser offenses and otherwise manipulate the system.\u201d <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U. S. 514, 519.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In part to obviate defense manipulation by hyper-technical application of this right and yet assure its protective application, the Supreme Court \u201cattempted to set out the criteria by which, the speedy trial right is to be judged.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U. S. at 516. The keystone among those criteria was the question of whether the accused was prejudiced. The Court recognized that \u201cunlike the right to counsel or the right to be free from compelled self-incrimination, deprivation of the right to speedy trial does not per se prejudice the accused\u2019s ability to defend himself.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The case at bar provides a novel twist to that much-litigated issue.

The court instructed the <em>State\u2019s Attorney </em>to do whatever was necessary to provide defendant with his request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201cYes. I am going to put the burden on you [the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] to do the secretarial work on this. You can do the same thing, Mr. Becker, you can issue a subpoena to them. But I think you can get it if you simply write to them and explain the situation, Mr. Austin, [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] and tell them if they don\u2019t provide it \u2014 tell them you are willing to pay for a copy \u2014 but if they don\u2019t provide it, then they will be put to the trouble \u2014 we will issue an out-of-state subpoena, and require them to produce somebody here. I think when you tell them that, that you will get it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The court then considered defendant\u2019s evidentiary needs for trial, item by item, recommending to the State\u2019s Attorney the procedure to follow in <em>assisting </em>the accused. The case was assigned for trial on the 29th of April, which the State expressed as one reason it had \u201cbeen pushing hard\u201d and was so willing to assist Defendant at the court\u2019s suggestion. The court deferred discussion on the out-of-state witnesses motion and marked it \u201chearing had on Becker\u2019s request to subpoena out-of-state witnesses, continued to 4/24/74 at 3: P.M.\u201d This was done because the State\u2019s Attorney \u201cknows what follow-up he has to do and you [Becker] know what follow-up you have to do .... By that time you ought to know whether you can get these things or not.\u201d Defendant then did another about face on his request for counsel. In response to the court\u2019s question after admonishing him \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make up your mind. Do you want counsel or don\u2019t you? The defendant responded \u201cI want to represent myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\"><em>April 25, 197k </em>\u2014 Hearing on motion to sever trial from that of a co-defendant and on request for out-of-state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>witnesses. The trial date was postponed partially because of the unavailability of the witnesses and partially because of the unavailability of the co-defendant who requested a postponement. The court denied the motion to sever but because of defendant\u2019s complaint that this caused him a delay in trial the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cThe case will not be further postponed, Mr. Austin. On May 31st the State will proceed to trial or the Court will direct an entry of a nol pros. Understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">MR. AUSTIN: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">THE COURT: That is for sure. If I am sick in bed or if I am dead or dying, if I have a broken skull or something, I am going to send a memorandum to Judge Barrett and Judge Proctor that if anything happens to me, that some other judge would be appointed to preside so that the case can go forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">MR. BECKER: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">THE COURT: This man is entitled to get his case tried. Now, I recognize there have been an awful lot of pleadings going on here since he filed a motion for a speedy trial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a lot of it has been instigated by him, which has the effect of postponing a trial, and for that reason I don\u2019t think Mr. Becker\u2019s constitutional rights have been injured in any way. Assign it for May 31st, it will not be taken out of the assignment, and will be tried....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">THE COURT: All right. Motion for Severance denied. Motion Re Subpoenas for Out-of-State Witnesses denied, this motion having been adjusted by the State and defendant in open court. Case assigned for 5/31/74. No further postponements to be granted. Of course, if someone dies that will be a different proposition, and I will reverse myself, but I don\u2019t want anybody to die.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>MR. BECKER: Your Honor, do I make another application for the two witnesses that we agreed on for the new date, the 31st, or does that cover that, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">THE COURT: Which two?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">MR. BECKER: Mr. Sarsfeld and Mr. Gililand he said they are going to appear voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">THE COURT: He [the State\u2019s Attorney] is going to notify them, and you also notify them of the trial date, and tell them it is your understanding that they will come voluntarily, and that you want them here, and please to respond to your correspondence, and advise you that they will be here. And if they say, no, they are not coming, let me know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">MR. BECKER: Thank you, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-10\"><em>May 28, 197k </em>\u2014 In addition to receiving defendant\u2019s waiver of his demand for jury trial, defendant\u2019s request for out-of-state witnesses was reheard. When the State refused to stipulate to the testimony of the witnesses the court said the witnesses would be made available:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: I will afford Mr. Becker the necessary wheels, whatever they are, I don\u2019t know, I am not going to look it up, whatever is necessary for him to issue a subpoena action, and I will grant it as to these two individuals. That is all you want now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">MR. BECKER: That is all I want.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">THE COURT: If that is so, it is obvious the case cannot go forward tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-15\">MR. BECKER: This again was a delay on his part, your Honor, on the State\u2019s part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-16\">THE COURT: I understand that. But you want them here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-17\">MR. BECKER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-18\">THE COURT: So the delay has been given for your benefit. You can\u2019t get a subpoena in their hands \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>MR. BECKER: He\u2019s in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Gililand is in the Federal Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">THE COURT: You can\u2019t get a subpoena in their hands today, that is obvious. But I will assign the case for trial \u2014 any other pretrial motions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">THE COURT: Do you need an order for issuance of subpoenas for these two out-of-State witnesses? MR. AUSTIN: I will prepare it, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">THE COURT: Prepare an order, and get Mr. Becker \u2014 you have been very cooperative, Mr. Austin \u2014 and give Mr. Becker further cooperation to get the names and addresses, if you don\u2019t already have them, and see to it that a subpoena, the necessary order is signed, and a subpoena is issued. How long will it take non-jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">THE COURT: Why don\u2019t the two of you go back in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office and get these gentlemen separately on the phone, and find out when they are available, and assign it for a time when they can be here? And if necessary I will recess this jury case, say, from a Tuesday to a Thursday or a Monday to Wednesday, or something like that, and fit this in so we can get rid of it; I want to get rid of it, you want to get rid of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">MR. BECKER: One other question, your Honor. Again, Mr. Austin indicated to me again this morning that Mr. Lano will appear voluntarily. Do you remember, we talked about the F.B.I., and you said notify the local office here? Again I ask you the same question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">MR. AUSTIN: To my knowledge, he said as long as we give him sufficient notice he would be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">THE COURT: Talk to him today on the phone, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>and say, look, we appreciate your willingness to appear voluntarily, don\u2019t get mad with us, we are going to issue you a subpoena anyway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><em>June 3, 197k </em>\u2014 Defendant filed Motion to Dismiss Indictments for Lack of Prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\"><em>June 7, 197k </em>\u2014 The hearing on Motion to Dismiss Indictments for Lack of Prosecution was treated by the court as being a motion to dismiss on grounds of lack of speedy trial. The motion was granted by the court which placed the blame for delay on the State seemingly because the State had not produced the defendant\u2019s out-of-state witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: The case was set for February 7th, and it was postponed at the State\u2019s request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We had a hearing before me on April 16th relative to getting these out-of-state witnesses present for trial on the 29th, and at the hearing I told you that you would have until April 24th to notify Mr. Becker\u2019s out-of-state witnesses so that the trial could go forward on April 29th. And there was a further hearing on April 25th, at which time the case was postponed because, in my opinion because of the lack of vigor and industry on the part of the State in getting this case ready for trial, it was postponed until May 31st. Implicit in all this conversation relative, for example, to Mr. Sarsfeld, on page 7: \u2018Mr. Austin: He is in Washington, D. C., with the Federal Energy Office, your Honor. I can call him back and tell him we would like to have him here, and it would be up to Mr. Becker to discuss his testimony with him.\u2019 \u2018The Court: Call him, and arrange to have him here. That takes care of that.\u2019 At that time on page 15 of the transcript the May 31st date was postponed because of your request, because you said Mr. Corbin was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>custody out in Missouri, and you couldn\u2019t get him here. You could have gotten him here, you have just told me you could have, you answered my question directly, yes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">MR. AUSTIN: Your Honor, as I recall, if I may be heard briefly, your Honor came into criminal jury with the April term of court. As soon as your Honor got into criminal jury I contacted your office, got a trial date of the 29th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">THE COURT: We had preliminary hearings so that it could go forward on the 29th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">MR. AUSTIN: Your Honor, the interstate agreement on detainers gives the prisoner whose ' custody is requested 30 days to object. And acting as fast as I could, there was not 30 days between the time we requested him and the time of the trial; although we had thought that perhaps \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">THE COURT: Wait a minute, Mr. Austin. Don\u2019t quibble on this. We had a hearing, and I assigned this case for hearing on April 29th, and you could have notified him any time after that case was assigned for hearing on April 29th. Thereafter it was postponed until May 31st. So you had well more than 30 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">MR. AUSTIN: Not prior to the 29th trial date, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">THE COURT: You had plenty of time prior to the May 31st trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">MR. AUSTIN: He was here for the 31st trial date, your Honor. As you recall, Mr. Goldberg could not be present, and \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">THE COURT: But the State wouldn\u2019t go forward as to this man without going forward as to Corbin. I don\u2019t care about Corbin, he is not before me. This</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>man is entitled to a speedy trial. And I told you at that time, and I will read it. \u2018The case will not be further postponed, Mr. Austin. On May 31st the State will proceed to trial or the court will direct an entry of a nol pros. Understand that? Mr. Austin: Yes, your Honor. The Court: That is for sure. If I am sick in bed or if I am dead or dying, if I have a broken skull or something, I am going to send a memorandum to Judge Barrett and Judge Proctor that if anything happens to me, that some other judge would be appointed to preside so that the case can go forward.\u2019 It is now June 7th, and Mr. Becker has made a motion for a dismissal of the charges against him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">MR. AUSTIN: May I be heard briefly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">THE COURT: You have been heard, I heard you until you sat down, Mr. Austin; you can\u2019t get five or six bites at the same apple. Sit down, Mr. Austin. You have a right to take an appeal from my ruling. The Defendant has made a motion to dismiss the indictments for lack of prosecution. There eventually has to be a time when under the law and under the decisions of the Supreme Court a person who is asking to be tried has a right to be tried or have the charges dismissed. That time has been reached in this case. The motion will be granted. You can still go forward as to the co-defendant. The entry will read \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">MR. BECKER: I think he\u2019s left the courtroom, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">THE COURT: What? Tell him to come back here, Mr. Tormino.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">MR. SEIBERT: He thought you were finished, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">MR. BECKER: Your Honor, on behalf of myself and my family I\u2019d like to thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-11\">THE COURT: Don\u2019t thank me, I am simply doing the duty that is imposed upon me by my oath of office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>MR. BECKER: Thank you, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">THE COURT: The docket entry will read: Defendant Becker\u2019s motion to dismiss granted. Indictment dismissed as to the Defendant Becker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The judge was correct when he advised the State that it had a right to appeal. <em>State v. Hunter, </em>10 Md. App. 300, 307. We do not agree as readily that appellee was denied a right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Constitutional Dimension and Length of Delay</p>\n<p id=\"Aj5\">In order to decide whether or not appellee has been denied a speedy trial we must first determine whether there has been any true \u201cdelay\u201d in the constitutional sense. <em>State v. Jones, </em>18 Md. App. 11. That case points out at 22-23:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201cIf, upon preliminary examination, we may determine that there has been no \u2018delay\u2019 of \u2018constitutional dimension\u2019 \u2014 if the claim of \u2018speedy trial\u2019 denial is clearly frivolous \u2014 if the passage of time is patently not inordinate \u2014 we are relieved of all necessity to make further analysis. If this threshold of \u2018constitutional dimension\u2019 has not been crossed, there is no need for the delicate weighing of social values in order \u2018to balance the right of the individual to obtain a speedy trial against the right of society to punish those who are properly shown to have committed a crime against it.\u2019 There is no need to look to the subtle interaction of the four factors: (1) length of delay, (2) reason for delay, (3) prejudice to the accused, and (4) assertion of the right by the accused. <em>State v. Lawless, </em>[13 Md. App. 220,] 229-232.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">The time to be counted runs from the time \u201cthe putative defendant in some way becomes an \u2018accused\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U. S. 307, 313; <em>Jones, </em>18 Md. App. at 16. For appellee this came as a result of his indictment on August 27, 1973. The only trial dates shown in the record were to have been April 29, 1974 and then May 31, 1974. Neither eventuated because the defendant\u2019s witnesses were not made available and the State did not bring a co-defendant from a Missouri prison in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Whether we view the period as nine and a half months or measure it from when trial was first set makes some, but little, difference. While we recognize that the Legislature, attempting to expedite criminal trials, has given us guidance by establishing six months from arraignment as a benchmark, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 591, that is but a single factor to consider in resolving the question of denial of a speedy trial. <em>Young v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 707; <em>Hunter v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 306. On more than a dozen occasions we have held as insubstantial delays from four months in <em>Britton v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 70, to twenty-three months in <em>State v. Williams, </em>6 Md. App. 5. The length of the delay is simply \u201c. . . a triggering mechanism .... [T]he length . . . that will provoke ... an inquiry is necessarily dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of the case. . . . [T]he delay that can be tolerated for an ordinary street crime is considerably less than for a serious, complex conspiracy charge.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U. S. at 530-531.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Nine and one-half months standing alone may get us over the threshold of constitutional dimension but is, alone hardly \u201csubstantial\u201d unless intentional or at least the result of utter disregard or irresponsible neglect on the part of the State. It is, however, sufficient to persuade us to look deeper in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The Reason for Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">In seeking the reasons for delay we again find in <em>Barker </em>that different weights should be assigned to different reasons, the heaviest being ascribed to deliberate attempts to delay whether to hamper the defense or to gain a tactical advantage. No such intentional delay is asserted. To the contrary, the record negates any such inference. \u201cA more neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded courts should be weighed less heavily but nevertheless should be considered since the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U. S. at 531. It is within the latter category the State finds itself, at least as to the more suspect period after hearing April 25, 1974 when the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>admitted it would be unable to produce the co-defendant for trial on the date set. In looking to the record we find that the accused filed over a dozen pro se petitions and demands which required three hearings. Had these issues not been resolved pre-trial, the accused could properly have complained about their delayed resolution and undoubtedly would have done so. These motions, while proper, placed an additional burden on a court already overtaxed by numerous and complex cases. In our overburdened judicial system defendants regrettably must upon occasion forego expedition in return for added attention. Even if we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was a degree of dilatoriness on the part of the State in acquiring the defendant\u2019s witnesses (notwithstanding the State\u2019s expressed reason for agreeing to do so in order to attempt to meet the assigned trial date) appellant\u2019s claim would still not rise above the \u201cmore neutral reason\u201d which is \u201cweighed less heavily . . . but nevertheless should be considered.\u201d <em>Barker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">A great portion of the delay, even after April 16,1974, (the first hearing on appellee\u2019s request to subpoena out-of-state witnesses) was directly attributable to appellee and could largely have been averted had he not declined assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>5A</footnotemark> Appellee wanted certain witnesses summonsed for his trial. The record indicates that the prosecutor agreed to aid appellee in securing the attendance of these witnesses in order to expedite proceedings. The judge who dismissed the indictment had denied Mr. Becker\u2019s request to summons them in the belief that both appellee and the State, under his direction had either agreed that certain of the witnesses would not be necessary or that the witnesses would come without a subpoena. As it turned out, and as the prosecutor pointed out at the June 7, 1974 hearing, at least two of the witnesses needed subpoenas. There was no evidence of any culpable attempt to stall the trial on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>of the prosecutor, especially since he was attempting to help appellee who did not have counsel and who had waived his right to counsel. This we think is at the heart of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Appellee had every right to waive counsel; however, the judge was wrong in then directing the State to assist the man it was prosecuting. The State in turn was equally in error by offering \u2014 or even accepting \u2014 that responsibility. The record indicates that both judge and prosecution were tactically outsmarted by appellee who step by step led them to the course they eventually pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The expressed <em>reason </em>for the delay at the final hearing was the absence of defendant\u2019s witnesses. We think the appellee must equally share responsibility with the State whose wrongful conduct was no 'more than ineffective, but well-intentioned aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The Assertion of the Right</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The \u201cfailure to assert the right will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U. S. at 532. At no time does the record disclose that appellee demanded or requested an early trial until his objection to postponement of the April 29, 1974 date.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This belated lament which came in the form of oral argument was asserted to reinforce a motion for severance. Encouraged by the \u201ccome hell or high water\u201d remarks of the trial judge, <em>supra, </em>four days prior to the June 7,1974 hearing he filed the Motion to Dismiss the Indictment for Lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Conviction which was granted. While the right was not waived, it could hardly be said that it was asserted either.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Substantial Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We must now consider whether appellee has demonstrated \u201csubstantial delay.\u201d If so, there was created a rebuttable presumption of prejudice which would have shifted the burden of going forward with the evidence to the State. <em>Lawless, </em>13 Md. App. at 232-233. To determine the \u201cquantitative and qualitative degree of delay\u201d which will give rise to the presumption of prejudice causing the burden to shift, we have noted that the factors used in the overall <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>weighing process are the same ingredients which must be weighed and analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Our preceding analysis indicated that there was no inordinate length of delay, that the reasons for it were neutralized by the State\u2019s submission to the judge\u2019s erroneous direction to acquire the accused\u2019s witnesses, and that the right was belatedly asserted. Appellee makes no allegation that the reasons for delay by the State were deliberate. Additionally, our independent review reflects \u201cno likelihood of prejudice to the person of the appellee and no demonstrated prejudice to [his] defense.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>18 Md. App. at 28. This adds up to a failure to show either the \u201cquantitative or qualitative degree of delay [which] will give rise to a rebuttable presumption of prejudice and will shift the burden of going forward with the evidence from the accused to the State.\u201d <em>Lawless, </em>13 Md. App. at 233. Having failed to shift the burden to the State, there rests upon the accused, as the moving party, the burden of demonstrating actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">At this juncture, however, the trial judge incorrectly treated the burden as having shifted and called upon the State to justify the delay. Even were we to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the State was burdened to explain its actions, we think it adequately did so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">\u201cYour Honor, not having had the transcripts before me, I forget exactly which hearing it was Mr. Becker raised these same points previously about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>his having been denied a speedy trial. At that time I argued to the court that Mr. Becker could have been tried last December; he came in, the witnesses were here, we were ready to go to trial, but he prayed a jury trial at that time. Since then, of course, he has changed attorneys, he has gotten out on parole, he has asked the witnesses be summonsed, all of which I would think would have worked to his benefit and not to his detriment. I would think the delay in bringing him to trial had not hurt him but benefited him in this regard. Even if there is some prejudice, it has not been brought on by any acts of lack of diligence on the part of the State, rather by Mr. Becker\u2019s own acts, especially in view of the fact that he has now elected to proceed before the court without the aid of a jury, which he could have done on December 7th.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Whether or not the delay had reached substantial proportions, after hearing the State\u2019s proffered justification the court never called upon the accused to meet his burden of showing actual prejudice. Instead, it continued to shelter him with the judicial mantle. Despite the absence of an affirmative showing, we turn to the record for indications of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Prejudice to Appellee</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Deprivation of the right to speedy trial may adversely affect three primary interests of a defendant. <em>Barker, </em>407 U. S. at 532. Here only one of these interests we find to have been adversely affected and then we know not for which period.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The first interest affected is prevention of oppressive pre-trial incarceration. Although initially confined for other causes in federal prison, it may be inferred from the record that the detainer for this case suspended appellee\u2019s eligibility for parole notwithstanding bail was set for this offense. Beyond that inference from unexplained papers filed in the record, we have no evidence of the period during which he was so detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The second interest is minimization of the accused\u2019s anxiety and concern. We find nothing in the record to indicate anxiety and concern beyond that which might be expected. Each day following an indictment must hang heavily over any accused person. In this instance it did not appear so discomforting as to distinguish it from the apprehension inherent in any case of like nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The third interest is the most serious and is the core of prejudice, <em>viz., </em>\u201cto limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U. S. at 532. This element of prejudice certainly cannot be relied upon by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">We note in passing that it is not always essential to affirmatively demonstrate prejudice, since it is but one of the factors to be considered; nor is prejudice confined to one\u2019s inability to defend, <em>Moore v. Arizona, </em>414 U. S. 25. In the absence of appellee\u2019s proof of prejudice inferable from the mere length of delay or from the reasons for the delay, together with his failure to assert his right, we are left only the possible presence of actual prejudice. As we have noted, appellee has failed to demonstrate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Having adhered to the admonition of the Supreme Court in <em>Barker, </em>to consider each case on ad hoc basis in light of the criteria espoused, we have carefully reviewed the record, we have analyzed that which we have reviewed, and we reverse the decision of the trial court. Indeed we find appellee barely negotiated the initial threshold of \u201cconstitutional dimension,\u201d if indeed he did so. Concededly, it may have been the very paternalism we sought to avoid, rather than the factual posture of his case, which compelled us to extend the review prescribed by <em>Barker. </em>We have done so nonetheless and can find nothing to justify the dismissal. If there were additional evidence or issues not brought to our attention because of absence of counsel, appellee is solely at fault. The society that provided him counsel if he chose, has a right to expect absolute impartiality on the bench and vigorous advocacy on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">\n<em>Order dismissing indictment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">\n<em>Cost to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-14\">. While distinguishing the speedy trial right from other constitutional rights, Mr. Justice Powell recognized \u201cthat deprivation of the right may work to the accused\u2019s advantage. Delay is not an uncommon defense tactic.\u201d Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. at 521.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-21\">. The issuance of the writ filed subsequent to the petition was dated as issued and filed 13 days before the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-11\">.

The only motion aimed at that result is the June 3,1974 motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">.

We are unable to find in the record any indication that the trial judge conducted the waiver inquiry required by Md. Rule 719 c. prior to permitting defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel.
