Md. St. Bd. of Censors, </em>19 Md. App. 300, 302-303, Chief Judge Orth viewed with relief the long awaited Supreme Court effort, <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U. S. 15, to thin the tangled thicket of obscenity regulation which had grown up around the \u201cRoth-Memoirs test.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The most troublesome aspect of the <em>Memoirs </em>refinement of <em>Roth </em>was the requirement that the state prove the alleged obscene matter to be \u201cutterly without redeeming social value.\u201d Judge Orth called that test \u201cunworkable\u201d and \u201cnot the law of the land because it did not represent a majority of the court.\u201d <em>Ebert, </em>19 Md. App. at 303. The overwhelming burden placed on the prosecution when required \u201cto prove a negative\u201d is self-evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In <em>Miller, </em>using the term \u201cguidelines\u201d as opposed to \u201ctest,\u201d five members of the Court reformulated the obscenity criteria, and thereby substantially lessened the prosecutorial burden. The jury must now consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\u201c(a) whether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest. . .;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>(c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">413 U. S. at 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">When the present case was tried before Judge Harry Dyer, presiding over a jury in the Circuit Court for Harford County, the State\u2019s Attorney, confident of a conviction under either the \u201cimpossible\u201d <em>Roth-Memoirs </em>test or the easier to prove <em>Miller </em>guidelines, chose to err if at all on the side of prudence, by asking the court to instruct the jury under the <em>Roth-Memoirs </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The offenses occurred October 17th and November 1st of 1972, prior to <em>Miller </em>which was decided June 28, 1973. The case was tried, however, after <em>Miller, </em>beginning November 13,1973. Appellant applies only one edge of the <em>Miller </em>sword. It argues that <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U. S. 87, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 entitles it to all of the benefits of <em>Miller, </em>but that retroactive enforcement of <em>Miller </em>would deny it due process, citing <em>Bouie v. City of Columbia, </em>378 U. S. 347 for the lack of adequate notice principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Inasmuch as appellant\u2019s conviction was not final in the sense that it had not exhausted its channels of direct review when the Supreme Court opinion came down, we agree that <em>Miller\u2019s </em>benefits are due. <em>Hamling, supra, </em>41 L.Ed.2d at 611. Regarding the adequate notice argument, appellant concedes there was no attempt to convict it retroactively under the <em>Miller </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The <em>Roth-Memoirs </em>Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">We disagree, however, with appellant\u2019s further contention that in <em>Miller </em>the Supreme Court declared a moratorium between June 21,1973 (the date <em>Miller </em>was decided) and such time as the Legislature shall by statute, or the appellate courts by judicial interpretation proscribe that which was the subject of appellant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This argument hinges upon but two sentences <em>o\u00ed Miller, </em>413 U. S. at 27:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201cUnder the holding announced today, no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive \u2018hard-core\u2019 sexual conduct specifically defined by regulating state law, as written or construed. We are satisfied that these specific prerequisites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that his public and commercial activities may bring prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Three observations strongly militate against any finding that the Supreme Court meant these words to provide a period of pornographic freedom. First, <em>Miller\u2019s </em>express purpose in redefining obscenity was to ease the all but impossible prosecutorial burden under the <em>Memoirs\u2019 </em>restriction on <em>Roth, </em>and <em>a fortiori </em>increase the probability of successful prosecution. Second, Chief Justice Burger added a footnote to the sentences excerpted by appellant, <em>Miller, supra, </em>at n. 10, in which he quotes Justice Brennan\u2019s discussion in <em>Roth </em>of the due process-engendered specificity requirement of obscenity laws. That to us clearly indicates that the above-quoted sentences serve only to reiterate the now-familiar due process theme, rather than to invite the States to engage in prospective formulation of obscenity statutes. Third, and perhaps most telling, is the material in n. 6, <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 24. After alluding to Oregon and Hawaii as states with sufficiently specific obscenity statutes, the Chief Justice wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201cWe do not hold . . . that all States other than Oregon must now enact new obscenity statutes. Other existing state statutes, as construed heretofore or hereafter, may well be adequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We conclude that the <em>Miller </em>court did not invalidate preexisting obscenity standards; on the contrary, it superimposed a test which lessens the prosecutor\u2019s evidentiary burden and thus will in all likelihood result in the expansion of obscenity restrictions. The latest pronouncement of the Court bears out this view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201cBut our opinion in <em>Miller </em>plainly indicates that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>rejected the <em>Memoirs </em>\u2018social value\u2019 formulation, not because it was so vague as to deprive criminal defendants of adequate notice, but instead because it represented a departure from the definition of obscenity in <em>Roth, </em>and because in calling on the prosecution to \u2018prove a negative,\u2019 it imposed a \u2018[prosecutorial] burden virtually impossible to discharge\u2019 and which was not constitutionally required. <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. at 22. Since <em>Miller </em>permits the imposition of a lesser burden on the prosecution in this phase of the proof of obscenity than did <em>Memoirs, </em>and since the jury convicted these petitioners on the basis of an instruction concededly based on the <em>Memoirs </em>test, petitioners derive no benefit from the revision of that test in <em>Miller. Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 41 L.Ed.2d at 620.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Chief Justice Burger\u2019s <em>Miller </em>opinion is far from the initiation of an epoch when pornographers may flaunt their figleaves. The trial court\u2019s overall instruction, conforming as it did to the <em>Roth-Memoirs </em>standard, was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">By analogous reasoning, we conclude that the <em>Miller </em>court did not hold pre-existing obscenity law violative of first amendment protections. If the broader <em>Miller </em>restriction on obscenity did not encroach on constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression, obviously the lesser <em>Memoirs </em>restriction did not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cIf a state law that regulates obscene material is .. . limited [by the Memoirs\u2019 standard] as written or construed, the First Amendment values . . . are adequately protected by the ultimate power of appellate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims when necessary. . . .\u201d <em>Miller, </em>413 U. S. at 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">In enacting its obscenity law, Maryland chose not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>define \u201cobscene\u201d but to permit courts to apply whatever definition the Supreme Court supplied from time to time, using the term, however, to describe that which is proscribed. <em>Cf., Dunn v. Md. Bd. of Censors, </em>240 Md. 249. Similarly, the obscenity statute construed in <em>Roth </em>and <em>Hamling, supra, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461, left to the courts the delineation of proscribed depictions. We have held, <em>Donnenberg v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 591, 605, as has the Supreme Court, <em>Hamling, </em>418 U. S. 87, 41 L.Ed.2d at 617, that the use of that term gives adequate warning of the forbidden conduct and marks boundaries sufficiently distinct for judges and juries fairly to administer the law. While a more specific statutory definition may have been preferred by the <em>Miller </em>Court, it was not mandated. \u201cWe emphasize that it is not our function to prepare regulatory schemes for the states.\u201d <em>Miller </em>at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Appellant acknowledges that we have decided the constitutionality of Md. Code, Art. 27, Sec. 418 but contends that doing so constituted a \u201cjudicial rewriting of the Maryland statute, and this court should have declined to do so.\u201d We now decline to review our decision for the reasons heretofore assigned. <em>Village Books, Inc. et al. v. State of Maryland, </em>22 Md. App. 274 and <em>Ebert v. Md. St. Bd. of Censors, </em>19 Md. App. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Appellant contends that the magazines and movie are not obscene in the constitutional sense as a matter of law. Either appellant reviewed different material than did we or it refers to a different constitution. There is no purpose served by any of the evidence but to depict explicit, closely photographed scenes of ultimate and climactic acts of fellatio, cunnilingus, sodomy and an occasional more conventional act of sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Appellant urges that two of the magazines colloquially characterized as \u201cbondage\u201d or \u201csado-masochistic abuse\u201d magazines do not fall under the Miller guidelines because they \u201cdo not portray sexual conduct, and secondly they do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>not portray (a) representations or descriptions of ultimate sex acts, normal or preverted, actual or simulated; (b) representations or depictions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of genitals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">These two magazines are primarily devoted to pictures of perverted sex acts under simulated forced conditions. Every picture contains \u201clewd exhibitions of genitals,\u201d in various positions of exposition. In each case the genitals are accompanied by rope or chain binding the anatomy in their proximity, or by persons whipping or handling them. Some photographs show the internal insertion of objects, close-up images of genitals and persons of like sex titillating each other by coupling various parts of their bodies. The fact that these scenes happen to be accompanied by ropes and chains or leather-booted models does not redeem them any more than would any other stage prop.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Each of the exhibits is \u201chard-core pornography\u201d which we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201c . . .is material which focuses predominantly upon what is sexually morbid, grossly perverse and bizarre without any artistic or scientific purpose or justifications.\u201d <em>Levin v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 139, <em>cert, denied, </em>247 Md. 740.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">When pornography is so \u201chard-core\u201d that it revulses the prurient interest in sex that it was intended to stimulate, little can be said to describe it without using terms so crude as, to be themselves, \u201cobscene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AZus\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-10\">. Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476; Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 418.
