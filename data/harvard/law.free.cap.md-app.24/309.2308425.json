Allen, Assistant Attorney General, Milton B. Allen, State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>and <em>William Guiffre, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b330-12\">Thompson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABi\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Victor John Wright, appellant, was convicted for murder in the first degree and the unlawful use of a handgun by the Criminal Court of Baltimore, Judge Solomon Liss presiding with a jury. He received a life sentence for the murder and a five year consecutive sentence for the handgun violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">Stephen Christian testified that on June 9, 1973, at approximately 1 a.m., he and the victim, Gerald Miller, were sitting together behind an apartment complex in Baltimore City. The appellant approached the witness and asked him what relation the victim was to him. Upon being informed that Miller\u2019s brother was his brother-in-law, the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>said he was going to kill Miller and the witness should remain seated and not run or else he would \u201cget\u201d him. The appellant drew a handgun from his belt, walked behind the victim and shot him in the back of the head from a distance of 10 to 15 feet. The victim was seated with his head in his hands, apparently under the influence of narcotics. The appellant thereupon fled the scene. Christian then went to his mother\u2019s apartment, called the operator and reported the shooting without giving his name. Christian identified the appellant, whom he had known for 6 years, as Miller\u2019s murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Miss Julia Taylor, the appellant\u2019s girlfriend, testified that the appellant was with her at the time the murder was committed. The appellant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>I Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions because the testimony of Stephen Christian, the eyewitness, was \u201cso fraught with inconsistencies regarding the critical issue of this case that it should be entirely disregarded.\u201d Once again an appellant has attempted to come within the confines of what has become known as the <em>Kucharczyk </em>doctrine. <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, 201 A. 2d 683 (1964). <em>See Bailey v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 83, 294 A. 2d 123 (1972). Once again we hold that <em>Kucharczyk </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The appellant bases his contention on what he asserts are four inconsistencies in Christian\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">(1) On direct examination Christian testified that after the appellant told him he was going to kill the victim, \u201cHe (appellant) told me I had better sit down, I better not run or he will get me.\u201d This was said just prior to the murder. On redirect Christian testified that the appellant also said that if he (Christian) said anything he would kill him. We find no material discrepancy in this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">(2) On direct examination Christian was asked if he had said anything to the appellant after being informed that the appellant intended to kill the victim. Christian answered,</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cNot that I can remember, I was shocked. I didn\u2019t really believe him.\u201d On cross-examination Christian testified that he said, \u201cThink about it, something like that. \u2018Don\u2019t do that,\u2019 I can\u2019t remember what it was. It was so long ago.\u201d This discrepancy clearly dealt only with minor or peripheral details and not with the core issues of the very occurrence of the <em>corpus delecti </em>or of the criminal agency of the appellant. As such <em>Kucharczyk v. State, supra, </em>does not apply. <em>Bailey v. State, supra </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">(3) On direct examination, Christian said that after the shooting he ran up to his mother\u2019s apartment and called the police to inform them of the shooting. On cross-examination, it was disclosed that he did not in fact talk with the police but that he gave the information to the operator. Here again the discrepancy goes to a very minor point and <em>Kucharczyk </em>does not apply. <em>Bailey v. State, supra </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">(4) Several days after the murder Christian told the police that he had been at a store at the time of the murder and that when he returned to the scene Miller was already dead. He added that he had not come forward earlier with correct information because he was threatened. At appellant\u2019s trial, however, Christian testified that he did not inform the police of what he knew because his mother would not allow him out. <em>Kucharczyk </em>does not apply because a witness\u2019s trial testimony is contradicted by other statements which the witness has given out of court. <em>Bailey v. State, supra </em>at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\n<em>II Juror Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The appellant also contends that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial. That motion was based on an allegation that the foreman of the jury fell asleep during the court\u2019s advisory instructions at the close of the case. There is no record of this occurrence in the transcript of appellant\u2019s trial. The trial judge during the course of the hearing on appellant\u2019s new trial motion clarified the situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">\u201cThe Court: Let the record show that for a moment the foreman of the jury dozed and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>awakened him immediately and there was no question whatsoever concerning his attention before or after.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The disposition of a new trial motion is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of that discretion is shown. <em>White v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 58, 67, 299 A. 2d 873 (1973). We find no abuse in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In <em>Hall v. State, </em>223 Md. 158, 162 A. 2d 751 (1960), the Court of Appeals dealt directly with the problem of a sleeping juror. The Court held that if a defendant alleges that a juror, or jurors, were guilty of misconduct, he is required to prove that the misconduct actually occurred and that he was prejudiced thereby. <em>See also Holt v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 544, 547, 240 A. 2d 355 (1968). In affirming Hall\u2019s conviction the Court, discussing his failure to show prejudice, stated at page 178:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201cIn addition, \u2018[t]he length of time the juror was asleep is not shown, nor does it appear what testimony was introduced during that time, nor that it was of any importance or extent, nor whether favorable or unfavorable to the accused. There is no showing that the defendant was in any way prejudiced.\u2019 <em>Braunie v. State, supra, </em>105 Neb. at 358.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">In the instant case, while there is evidence that the foreman of the jury fell asleep, the trial judge stated that he \u201cdozed for a moment\u201d, the appellant has in no way shown how he was prejudiced by the foreman\u2019s momentary inattention. We hasten to add that the problem could easily have been rectified if the appellant had objected at the time the foreman fell asleep and had asked the court to repeat the portion of the instructions, if any, the foreman had missed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\n<em>Ill Verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">In the case at bar, when the jury returned with its verdict, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cThe Clerk: Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">The Jury: Yes, we have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">The Clerk: Who shall say for you? Stand up, Mr. Wright. Members of the jury, how say you, is Victor J. Wright guilty of the matter wherein he stands indicted or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">The Foreman: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">The Court: Now, as to the first count, what is your finding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">The Foreman: First degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">Mr. Cohen: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">The Foreman: Guilty of murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">The Court: As to the fourth count, what is your finding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\">The Foreman: We didn\u2019t render a decision on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">We never even considered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-15\">The Court: I had indicated you would consider the first and fourth counts of the indictment, so I will ask you to go back and talk about that count. That is the count of the indictment which charges the Defendant with having used a handgun in the commission of a crime. Let me have the indictment. If you remember, members of the jury, I called your attention to the fact that you were to consider the first and fourth counts. The fourth count charges the Defendant with unlawfully using the handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. I\u2019ll ask you please to retire to consider that particular count.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">Appellant objected to the jury being sent back to deliberate and moved for mistrial. The motion was denied. At the appellant\u2019s request, the jury was polled as to the first count. The jury was then harkened to the verdict and sent back to deliberate as to the fourth count. They subsequently returned a verdict of guilty as to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-19\">Appellant contends that the action of the trial judge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>sending the jury back to deliberate on the fourth count was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">A verdict, finding an accused guilty under one count of a multi-count indictment and being silent as to the remaining count or counts is a valid verdict and is equivalent to a verdict of not guilty as to the remaining counts. <em>Glickman v. State, </em>190 Md. 516, 523, 60 A. 2d 216 (1948); <em>Hechter v. State, </em>94 Md. 429, 50 A. 1041, 56 L.R.A. 457 (1902); <em>Gaskins v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 666, 671, 272 A. 2d 413 (1971), <em>cert, denied, </em>404 U. S. 1040; <em>Gibson v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 1, 4, 256 A. 2d 890 (1969); <em>Agresti v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 278, 280 n. 1, 234 A. 2d 284 (1967). This rule, however, does not apply to the instant case because the trial judge immediately upon learning that the jury had failed to consider the fourth count of the indictment in their original deliberations directed them to return to the jury room and deliberate upon that count. This action was proper under the rule laid down in <em>Heinze v. State, </em>184 Md. 613, 42 A. 2d 128 (1945):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201cWhere a verdict is ambiguous, inconsistent, unresponsive, or otherwise defective, it is the duty of the trial judge to call the jury\u2019s attention to the defect and to direct them to put the verdict in proper form either in the presence of the court or by returning to their consultation room for the purpose of further deliberation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The rule was approved and enlarged in <em>Glickman v. State, supra, </em>where the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201cCertainly then, when the jury have arrived at no verdict and so state, it is equally the duty of the trial judge to require them to retire, deliberate upon the case, and arrive at a verdict if possible.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 525.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\n<em>IV Allocution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The appellant finally contends that he was denied his right to allocution prior to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>A defendant\u2019s right to allocution is given by Md. Rule 761 a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201cSentence shall be imposed without unreasonable delay. Before imposing sentence the court shall afford an accused or his counsel an opportunity to make a statement and to present information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The dictates of Rule 761 a have been held to be mandatory. <em>Brown v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 27, 31-32, 272 A. 2d 659 (1971). If allocution has been denied a defendant, the remedy in the appellate court is to vacate the sentence and remand the case for resentencing with the proper formalities, <em>i.e. </em>with allocution. <em>Brown v. State, supra </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In the instant case the right of allocution was denied. The State argues, however, that the error was harmless because the sentence imposed for the murder conviction (life imprisonment) was mandatory and because the sentence imposed for the handgun violation (5 years consecutive) was the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 297 A. 2d 696 (1972), the Court of Appeals, as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U. S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) declaring the death penalty unconstitutional in certain situations, remanded Bartholomey\u2019s murder conviction for resentencing. The Court directed the lower court to impose a life sentence and specifically declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">\u201cAt the resentencing hearing, Bartholomey has the right to be present and represented by counsel, <em>additionally, he should he afforded his right of allocution under Rule 761 a.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). <em>Bartholomey v. State, supra </em>at 186.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Thus in spite of the apparent mandatory nature of the sentence to be imposed on Bartholomey, the appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>entitled to allocution. The same rationale applies to the instant case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Relative to the handgun sentence, the State argues that the statute defining the crime, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 36B (d), makes a 5 year consecutive term the minimum that can be imposed. Art. 27, \u00a7 36B (d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201cAny person who shall use a handgun in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article, shall be guilty of a separate misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall, in addition to any other sentence imposed by virtue of commission of said felony or misdemeanor, be sentenced to the Maryland Division of Correction for a term of not less than five nor more than fifteen years, and it is mandatory upon the court to impose no less than the minimum sentence of five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">It has recently been held that a sentencing judge has no power to impose less than a 5 year sentence or to suspend a sentence for a conviction under Art. 27, \u00a7 36B (d). <em>State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 325 A. 2d 573 (1974). That case does not provide guidance, however, as to the question of whether the mandatory 5 year sentence must be consecutive to any other sentence which is imposed. For that we must look to the words of the statute. The statute, after generally defining the crime, designates it as a \u201cseparate misdemeanor.\u201d It then provides that the sentence, which may range from 5 to 15 years, shall be \u201cin addition to any other sentences\u201d which may be imposed. The dominant purpose of this language and of all of Section 36B is to stop the alarming rise in the use of handguns in the commission of crimes of violence. Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 36 (a). There is, however, a world of difference between creating a new substantive offense and providing that the penalty for such an offense in all cases be consecutive. The legislature, if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>had wanted to accomplish the latter, would have used express language to do so. In the absence of such express language, we think the sentence imposed for violations of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B (d) may be either concurrent or consecutive as the sentencing judge in his discretion sees fit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This conclusion does not defeat the legislature\u2019s purpose. A concurrent sentence for the handgun violation is certainly \u201cin addition to\u201d any other sentence which may also be imposed and presents serious consequences to the person sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Our conclusion is also supported by the two well established rules of statutory interpretation. The first of these is that a statute will be strictly construed where it is in derogation of the common law. <em>MacBride v. Gulbro, </em>247 Md. 727, 729, 234 A. 2d 586 (1967); <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>242 Md. 459, 460, 219 A. 2d 254 (1966), <em>cert, denied, </em>385 U. S. 876; <em>City of Baltimore v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>232 Md. 123, 135, 192 A. 2d 87 (1963); <em>State v. Gibson, </em>4 Md. App. 236, 247, 242 A. 2d 575 (1968), <em>aff\u2019d. </em>254 Md. 399; 3 <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 61.01 (4th ed. 1973). The Court of Appeals in <em>Gleaton v. State, </em>235 Md. 271, 277, 201 A. 2d 353 (1964) stated the rule thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cStatutes in derogation of the common law are strictly construed, and it is not to be presumed that the legislature . . . intended to make any alteration in the common law other than what has been specified and plainly pronounced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">While the legislature has the inherent power to specify the penalties to be imposed by a court for the commission of a given crime, <em>State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, supra </em>at 513, the court has the common law power to impose the sentence it sees fit so long as it comports with the statutory and constitutional mandates. <em>Gleaton v. State, supra </em>at 277; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>Reynolds v. Warden, </em>229 Md. 623, 625, 182 A. 2d 875 (1962); <em>Reid v. State, </em>200 Md. 89, 92, 88 A. 2d 478 (1952); <em>Washington </em>&amp; <em>Walker v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 633, 634, 236 A. 2d 32 (1967). This judicial power also extends with the same limitations to the determination of whether a sentence will be consecutive or concurrent. <em>Martin v. State, </em>227 Md. 407, 410, 177 A. 2d 247 (1962); <em>Long v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 256, 263, 254 A. 2d 707 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In the case at bar, the argument advanced by the State is in essence that by Article 27, \u00a7 36B (d) the legislature stripped the judiciary of its discretion to impose a concurrent sentence and thus changed the common law in that regard. While the legislature clearly has the power to do so, a legislative change in the common law should never be presumed except where the change is specifically and plainly pronounced by the legislature. <em>Gleaton v. State, supra. </em>In this case such a specific and plain pronouncement is not contained in Art. 27, \u00a7 36B (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The second rule of statutory construction which supports our conclusion that Section 36B (d) does not mandate consecutive sentences is stated in 3 <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 59.03 at 6-7.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201cIt is an ancient rule of statutory construction and an oft-repeated one that penal statutes should be strictly construed against the government or parties seeking to exact statutory penalties and in favor of persons on whom such penalties are sought to be imposed. When the law imposes a punishment which acts upon the offender alone, and it is not a reparation to the party injured, and the punishment is entirely within the discretion of the law giver, it will not be presumed that the legislature intended the punishment to extend farther than is expressly stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cAnd as a corollary of the rule, in case of doubt concerning the severity of the penalty prescribed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>a statute construction will favor a milder penalty over a harsher one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">This rule has been followed in Maryland. <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 617, 224 A. 2d 677 (1966); <em>Grimm v. State, </em>212 Md. 243, 246, 129 A. 2d 128 (1957); <em>Fowel v. State, </em>206 Md. 101, 107, 110 A. 2d 524 (1955); <em>Wanzer v. State, </em>202 Md. 601, 611, 97 A. 2d 914 (1953); <em>Allen v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 459, 468, 307 A. 2d 493 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">While the rule is most often applied to situations in which the question is what is or is not criminal conduct under a statute, we think the purpose and rationale for the rule apply with equal force to the question presented here. Where, as here, the statute does not make clear on its face the type of sentence which can be imposed, it should be construed so as to allow either consecutive or concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We therefore vacate the appellant\u2019s sentences and remand the case to the lower court for resentencing with directions that at the resentencing hearing he be present, have the assistance of counsel and be given his right to allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\n<em>Sentences vacated; case remanded for resentencing; judgments otherwise affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">. Cases are now pending which involve the question of probation, where a life sentence is the required punishment. We express no opinion on the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">. We note that there have been numerous cases in which the sentence imposed for a violation of \u00a7 36B (d) was in fact concurrent. <em>See e.g. </em>State <em>ex rel. </em>Sonner v. Shearin, <em>supra; </em>Bremer v. State, 18 Md. App. 291, 307 A. 2d 503 (1973), <em>cert, denied, </em>415 U. S. 930.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
