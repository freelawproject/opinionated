He had received labels, not from the Worumbo Company, but from those who manufactured Worumbo cloth into garments to whom the Worumbo Company furnished labels. He had in his possession both genuine and false labels. From the fact that he had spurious labels in his possession, it was inferred that he knew the true from the false. Such might have been a reasonable inference if the false label had been attached to a garment made of a cloth other than that manufactured by the Worumbo Company. Plainly the principal purpose of the Legislature was to protect the manufacturers and the public from deceptive labels attached to goods that were not what the label represented them to be. Strict proof of knowledge of falsity should appear when only the letter of the law is disregarded and the false label is not used to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">For all that appears, defendant, when he sold the over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>coat, knew not which was the true label and which the false, and knew not that either was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Division and that of Special Sessions should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Pound, Crane, Andrews and Lehman, JJ., concur; Kellogg, J., absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
