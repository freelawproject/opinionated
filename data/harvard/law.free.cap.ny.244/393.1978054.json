Fluegel, Deceased, Appellant, <em>v. </em>Frederic R. Coudert, Respondent, Impleaded with Another.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b433-12\">(Argued January 19, 1927;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"APV\">decided February 23, 1927.)</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-14\"><em>Sidney S. Bobbe </em>and <em>Clarence W. Roberts </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALG\">Since the enactment of section 282-e of the Highway Law, there is a presumption arising from the ownership of an automobile that it is being used with the consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>express or implied, of the owner; and since there was a complete failure to show through Ryan that the respondent had not given him express consent to his use of the car, the presumption remained unrebutted. <em>(Norris </em>v. <em>Kohler, </em>41 N. Y. 42; <em>Gulliver </em>v. <em>Blauvelt, </em>14 App. Div. 523; <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>214 N. Y. 249; <em>Van Blaricom v. Dodgson, </em>220 N. Y. 111; <em>Orlando </em>v. <em>Pioneer B. Towel Co., </em>239 N. Y. 342.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-5\"><em>Alfred M. Bailey </em>and <em>Frank J. O\u2019 Neill </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A4MQ\">The presumption arising from ownership of the automobile driven by Ryan is not that its owner gave him permission to use it. <em>(Ferris </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>214 N. Y. 249.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AOl\">We think the uncontradicted evidence necessitates the conclusion that the driver of the motor car was using it at the time of the accident for his own purposes exclusively, without the permission and against the commands of the defendant, his employer <em>(Der Ohannessian </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>233 N. Y. 326).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">This being so, the plaintiff gains nothing from section 282-e of the Highway Law (Consol. Laws, ch. 25), which provides that \u201c every owner of a motor vehicle operated upon a public highway shall be liable and responsible for death or injuries to person or property resulting from negligence in the operation of such motor vehicle, in the business of such owner or otherwise, by any person legally using or operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of such owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The effect of this statute is to render obsolete the doctrine of such cases as <em>Van Blaricom </em>v. <em>Dodgson </em>(220 N. Y. 111) and <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Pardee </em>(220 N. Y. 431, 436). Liability is no longer dependent upon use or operation by a servant in the \u201c business \u201d of a master. Liability is dependent upon legal use or operation in business <em>\u201c </em>or otherwise,\u201d with permission or consent. The owner who loans a car to a friend or an employee will be liable hereafter for the negligence of the operator though the loan is unrelated to employment, a mere friendly accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>modation. The father will be liable for the negligence of the son to whom he has intrusted the use of the family automobile <em>(Van Blaricom </em>v. <em>Dodgson, supra). </em>We make no attempt at exhaustive enumeration. What has been said will suffice for illustration and example.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The driver employed by this defendant was not using or operating this car with the owner\u2019s permission, express or implied. He was not using or operating it legally. Use or operation without the consent of the owner may now constitute a crime (Penal Law, \u00a7 1293-a).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Pound, Crane, Andrews, Lehman and Kellogg, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
