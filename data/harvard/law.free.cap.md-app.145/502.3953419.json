The State presents the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">Did the circuit court err in granting Coley\u2019s motion to suppress evidence where (1) there was probable cause to justify the warrant to search Coley\u2019s residence, and (2) the . officers relied on the warrant in good faith?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the decision and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">On October 17, 2001, Trooper A.L.

THE CI WAS SEARCHED AND FOUND FREE OF MONIES/CONTRABAND. A DRIVE-BY OF THE TARGET RESIDENCE WAS DONE AND THE CI VISUALLY POINTED OUT COLEY\u2019S RESIDENCE AS 13206 CAPE SHELL COURT, LARGO, PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY, MARYLAND. A GOLD COLORED CADILLAC BEARING DC REGISTRATION BA 9241 WAS OBSERVED IN THE DRIVEWAY. THE CI STATED THAT COLEY HAS RESIDED ALONE AT 13206 CAPE SHELL COURT, LARGO, PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY, MARYLAND FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THE CI WAS GIVEN AN AMOUNT OF U.S. CURRENCY IN ORDER TO MAKE A PURCHASE OF CDS FROM COLEY. CONTACT WAS MADE WITH COLEY VIA THE TELEPHONE AND COLEY ADVISED THE CI TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HIM IN THE AREA OF HIS RESIDENCE, NOT AT THE RESIDENCE. YOUR AFFIANT POSITIONED HIMSELF TO OBSERVE COLEY LEAVE HIS RESIDENCE TO THE LOCATION WHERE HE WAS TO CONTACT CI. COLEY DID LEAVE THE RESIDENCE OPERATING THE GOLD CADILLAC BEARING DC REGISTRATION BA 9241 AND WAS OBSERVED BY CO-AFFIANT MCDONOUGH MAKE CONTACT WITH THE CI. COLEY THEN BECAME MOBILE WITH THE CI.

The warrant was executed on October 18, 2001. During the search of his residence, officers found Coley in an upstairs bedroom. They found approximately 34.5 grams of crack cocaine and 7 grams of marijuana. Officers also found a stolen .38 Taurus revolver, ammunition, and $1,736 in cash.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Coley was arrested and subsequently indicted on seven charges, including: possession of CDS with intent to distribute (cocaine), possession of CDS (cocaine), possession of CDS (marijuana), possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, theft under $500, possession of a firearm after conviction of a felony drug offense, and conspiracy to distribute CDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">On February 15, 2002, Coley filed a Motion to Suppress Evidence. A suppression hearing was held on March 1, 2002, at which Trooper McClendon was the only witness. After argument from counsel, the judge asked the trooper to reenter the courtroom, because he \u201cwanted Trooper McClendon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>to know why\u201d his affidavit lacked probable cause. The court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">All right. Court has before it a motion to suppress evidence that deals with the issue of probable cause for the search warrant. The Defense counsel wishes to go beyond the bounds of the affidavit. I concluded that I cannot do that because no illegality has been alleged here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">The issue is whether or not within the four corners of the search warrant there\u2019s probable cause for the court to believe that the residence known as 13206 Cape Shell Court, Largo, Prince George\u2019s County housed controlled dangerous substances. There is no disputing the experience of the affiant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">Trooper McClendon and Corporal McDonald on page four of the affidavit, the affirmative focus on the specifics of this case. McDonald advised me, meaning Trooper McClendon, that the target of his investigation in Prince George\u2019s County is Coley, Victor currently resided in the Largo area of the County. Cl known Coley for a long period of time. Has personal knowledge that Coley runs CDS, crack cocaine schedule two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">The following information was obtained on Coley utilizing the computer system and information obtained from the Cl. And then it says Coley, Victor Leon, date of birth, 2005 East Wilson Place, Landover, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland has a criminal history in terms of record. There was prior distribution of cocaine, which shows a guilty finding back in June of 1998.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">All right. Thus far the confidential source has not stated anything regarding specifics about the address itself. Nor does the confidential source say anything about having personal knowledge that the residence itself is being used to house or sell drugs out of. Moreover Mr. Coley\u2019s address is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>listed, at least in the record check portion of this affidavit, as being an address other than the address on Cape Shell Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">The affidavit begins: Between the dates of September 12 and October 6, 2001\u2014we know now, I might add, that this search warrant focuses upon a time frame. That it was presented to [the issuing magistrate] on October the 17th, executed on October 18th. It continues. I met with Trooper McDonald to talk. So the I here will he Trooper McDonald and the CI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">CI, confidential informant, on two separate occasions at predetermined locations in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland for the purposes of conducting a controlled purchase. The CI was searched and found free of money/contraband. A drive by the target residence was done on CI, visually pointed out Coley\u2019s residence at 13206 Cape Shell Court, Largo, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. A gold colored Cadillac bearing DC registration B-A-9-2-1 was observed in the drive by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">The confidential informant stated that Coley resided alone at 13206 Cape Shell Court, Largo, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland for a long period of time. The CI was given an amount of U.S. currency in order to make the purchase of CDS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">Page five it continues. Purchase of CDS from Coley, excuse me. Contact was made with Coley via the telephone and Coley advised\u2014the CI made contact with him in the area of his residence. Not at the residence. It\u2019s clear to this court, at this point, that there\u2019s no involvement of this residence in criminal activity at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">Continuing at page five. Further affiant positioned himself to observe Coley leave the residence to the location where he was to contact the CI. Coley did leave the residence operating the gold Cadillac bearing DC registration B-A-9-2-1 was observed by co-affiant McDonald making contact with the CI. Coley then became mobile with the CI. Surveillance unit momentarily lost visual contact with Coley and the CI, but had audio contact with the CI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>After a short period of time, though, Coley was observed with co-affiant McDonald drop the Cl off in the area of Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Surveillance units recontacted Cl, but could not stay with Coley. The Cl gave me a white substance suspected to be crack cocaine that he/she had just purchased from Coley. Cl was again searched and found free of money, contraband and contact was subsequently terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">This court opines at this point that does not provide, up to this point, probable cause to believe that the residence in question housed, contained, or was involved in criminal activity regarding the distribution of any controlled dangerous substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">The second paragraph of page five continues. I responded to the Maryland State Police College Park Barracks where the suspected cocaine was field tested and showed a positive reaction to the presence of cocaine. That obviously related to the first purported buy which was outside of the residence and was made clear by the verbiage in first paragraph of page five that contact with the Cl and Coley did not occur at the residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">Continuing. Before the second contact with Coley your affiant made a drive by of the target residence. Your affiant observed the same gold colored Cadillac in the driveway that was used by Coley in the first meeting. Even the second occasion the Cl was searched and found free of any monies/contraband. The Cl made contact with Coley via the telephone. Surveillance units observed the Cl and Coley make certain contact in the area of Largo, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">This court notes at this point in time that the contact was clearly not at the residence. Somewhere in the area of Largo, Prince George\u2019s County. Continuing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">The affidavit reads your affiant observed Coley along with the Cl go to 13206 Cape Shell Court, Largo, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. This court opines that there\u2019s .no way of determining how they went to that residence, whether it\u2019s by car, walking, whatever, but it\u2019s clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>they were at a different location before they went to the residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Continuing. Coley was observed going into the residence. A short time later Coley was observed exiting the residence, making contact with the CL There is contact with the defendant and Cl after leaving the residence, the court notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">Continuing. Contact with Coley and the Cl was subsequently terminated. It\u2019s not more detail provided. The following paragraph read, I recontacted the Cl at a predetermined location. It doesn\u2019t say where it\u2019s the same date or not. At this point affiant gave me an off white substance suspected of being crack cocaine. The Cl stated that Coley sold him/her suspected crack cocaine. There is absolutely no indication as to where that substance was sold. He was again searched, I\u2019m continuing my reading, and found free of any money, contraband. Contact with Cl was subsequently terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">I, Troop[er] McClendon, responded to the Maryland State Police College Park Barracks where the suspected crack cocaine was field tested and that showed the positive reaction to the presence of cocaine. Your affiant thereafter states at the bottom of page five, your affiant knows that persons engaged in unlawful distribution of controlled dangerous substance and the use of controlled dangerous substance used their residence in Prince George\u2019s County to create their contraband and their storage for the associated records kept in the drug trade. That is general averment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">The court has read this search warrant now at least two times, and gone over it almost word by word on the record, and I cannot find any evidence that the residence known as 18206 is the subject of any detailed information that would lead this court [an] independent tribunal, so to speak, looking at this search warrant for the first time to conclude that the residence housed or contained dangerous substances. It\u2019s pure speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">I\u2019m certainly not blinded to the facts that what I may suspect. Certainly not blinded to the fact that there had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>been one controlled buy. It was outside the residence. It\u2019s crystal clear in this affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">Secondly the same two buys is not specifically earmarked as to date. And I appreciate the fact it may not be because the police officers in question don\u2019t want to provide any details that may lead one to conclude who the identity of the confidential source, but the reality is what\u2019s lacking in the search warrant is elemental in being specific. What should have been here, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s an oversight, is when that confidential source returned to the presence of the police after the second buy. Wherein it reads at page five I recontacted the confidential source at a predetermined location. It doesn\u2019t tell me in the statement the date. It doesn\u2019t tell me it\u2019s made in there. I certainly suspect it\u2019s immediately thereafter, but it\u2019s not stated down here. The confidential source stated that [Coley] sold him or her the suspected crack cocaine. It doesn\u2019t say that that sale occurred in the residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">Is there probable cause for the defendant? Yes, there\u2019s probable cause to arrest the defendant, but there\u2019s' not probable cause to search the residence. Accordingly this court is going to grant the motion to suppress evidence seized at the residence as it relates to this defendant. My ruling is not focused upon the co-defendant. Nobody has argued that this defendant does not have standing. In fact it\u2019s, clear that he was the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">So that is my ruling Ms. [Prosecutor], and I wanted Trooper McClendon here to know why I ruled that way. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The State noted a timely appeal pursuant to Md.Code Ann. (1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), \u00a7 12-302(c)(3)(i) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, this case has not yet proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Procedural Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In his brief, Coley chose to attack perceived procedural shortcomings, rather than to address the merits of the State\u2019s arguments. In particular, Coley argues that the State failed to place the appropriate exhibits, <em>i.e., </em>the warrant application and affidavit, in the record before us and that, therefore, this Court cannot review the affidavit in deciding this case. These documents were not originally transmitted by the circuit court, apparently because of confusion resulting from the court\u2019s instructions that \u201cthe exhibits [are to be] returned to the State. The original search warrant will be filed in the court file.\u201d It is unclear what transpired or why the warrant file was not placed in the jacket with the rest of the proceedings, but somehow the two were separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">On June 10, 2002, the State filed a Motion to Correct Omission in the Record, to include the warrant application and affidavit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Coley opposed that motion, and we entered an order on June 26, 2002, granting it in part and denying it in part. That order states, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah7\">the motion to supplement the record be granted in part and denied in part; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">ORDERED that the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County promptly transmit to this Court all of the exhibits in the possession of the Clerk that were marked for identification during the motions hearing that has resulted in this appeal; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">ORDERED that the motion to supplement the record with exhibits that were marked for identification but not retained by the Clerk is DENIED <em>WITHOUT PREJUDICE </em>to the State\u2019s right to obtain relief in conformity with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the requirements of Md. Rule 8-413(a)[.] [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Coley believes that this Court\u2019s order granting in part and denying in part the motion to correct omission in the record means that only the search warrant itself is properly before us. When we received the supplemental materials, all four exhibits presented at the motion hearing were included, each marked with the court reporter\u2019s original exhibit stamp. Only four items were marked as exhibits at the suppression hearing and are numbered one through four. Exhibit One is \u201cthe original of the documents referenced in two, three, four.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Exhibit Two is a photocopy of the original search warrant application and affidavit. Exhibit Three is a photocopy of the search warrant. Exhibit Four is the search warrant inventory report and return. The original warrant documents, Exhibit One, were intended to be kept with the court file but were apparently returned to the judge who had issued the warrant.

In <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238-29, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), the Supreme Court stated that the \u201cduty of a reviewing court [in cases like this one] is simply to ensure that the [issuing] magistrate had a \u2018substantial basis for ... [concluding]\u2019 that probable cause existed.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317. \u201c[Thus,] after-the-fact scrutiny by courts of the sufficiency of an affidavit should not take the form of <em>de novo </em>review. A magistrate\u2019s \u2018determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (quoting <em>Spinelli v.

In making that determination, the magistrate\u2019s decision is to be afforded great deference. <em>Birchead, </em>317 Md. at 701, 566 A.2d 488; <em>Gates, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The substantial basis standard involves \u201csomething less than finding the existence of probable cause,\u201d <em>Amerman, </em>84 Md.App. at 470-71, 581 A.2d 19 (citing <em>Massachusetts v.

One judge may give a circumstance great weight; another may give it slight weight; each is entitled to weigh for himself and neither will be legally wrong in so doing.

Coley, on the other hand, argues that the lower court did not err and there was no probable cause to search his residence. In addition, the State contends that even if probable cause was lacking, the good faith exception to the. exclusionary rule applies in this in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>stance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Coley counters that the good faith doctrine does not apply because the State failed to raise the issue before the motion court.

State, </em>368 Md. 506, 796 A.2d 90 (2002), a decision the circuit court did not have the benefit of in reaching its conclusion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Coley, at oral argument, posited that <em>Holmes </em>has little impact on this case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In <em>Holmes, </em>the question, as in this case, was \u201cone of nexus: could a neutral magistrate\u2014the issuing judge\u2014reasonably infer from [the] observations [made in the warrant affidavit] that drugs and other evidence of controlled dangerous substance violations [were] likely to be found in [the residence]?\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 519, 796 A.2d 90. Holmes was convicted, <em>inter alia, </em>of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He had the misfortune of being seen with a man whom the police had under surveillance, Brian Coveil, on the date the police were to arrest Coveil and execute a search warrant for his residence and car. Holmes and Covell were stopped while driving in Holmes\u2019 car. A police officer observed a plastic bag containing marijuana in Holmes\u2019 pocket, and Holmes was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>arrested. The police then escorted Holmes and Coveil back to Holmes\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The officers wished to obtain a search warrant for Holmes\u2019 residence but intended initially to secure the house by way of a warrantless entry, to which Holmes\u2019 father consented. When they secured the house, in which nothing was disturbed or opened, an officer noticed a safe. The officers memorialized in their warrant application the fact that there was a safe in the house. The warrant was issued and the subsequent search revealed, <em>inter alia, </em>several bags of cocaine and other paraphernalia.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 508-11, 796 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Although <em>Holmes </em>involved drugs, the Court of Appeals, in deciding that the warrant application established probable cause, turned to two cases involving the search of residences for weapons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\"><em>Mills [v. State, </em>278 Md. 262, 363 A.2d 491 (1976) ] and <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Ward </em>[, 350 Md. 372, 712 A.2d 534 (1998)] approached the nexus issue in terms of pure deductive reasoning: a particular kind of weapon was used in the crime; there was evidence linking the defendant to the crime; the weapon was of a kind likely to be kept, and not disposed of, by the defendant; when arrested shortly after the crime, the defendant was not in direct possession of the weapon; <em>ergo, </em>it was likely to be found in a place accessible to him\u2014his home or car. That same kind of deductive approach, based on reasonable factual assumptions, has been used by a number of courts in finding a nexus between observed or documented drug transactions and the likelihood that drugs or other evidence of drug law violations may be found in the defendant\u2019s car or home. The reasoning, supported by both experience and logic, is that, if a person is dealing in drugs, he or she is likely to have a stash of the product, along with records and other evidence incidental to the business, that those items have to be kept somewhere, that if not found on the person of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>they are likely to be found in a place that is readily accessible to\u2019 the defendant but not to others, and that the defendant\u2019s home is such a place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">Direct evidence that contraband exists in the home is not required for a search warrant; rather, probable cause may be inferred from the type of crime, the nature of the items sought, the opportunity for concealment, and reasonable inferences about where the defendant may hide the incriminating items. The thrust of [the aformentioned cited] decisions was characterized in <em>[United States </em>v.] <em>Thomas, </em>[300 U.S.App. D.C. 380, 989 F.2d 1252, 1255 (D.C.Cir.1993),] in a unanimous <em>per curiam </em>opinion by a panel that included now Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that \u201cobservations of illegal activity occurring away from the suspect\u2019s residence, can support a finding of probable cause to issue a search warrant for the residence, <em>if there is a reasonable basis to infer from the nature of the illegal activity observed, that relevant evidence will be found in the </em>residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\"><em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 521-522, 796 A.2d 90 (some citations omitted; italicized emphasis in original; bold emphasis added). The <em>Holmes </em>Court emphasized that something more than \u201cmere observation, documentation, or suspicion of a defendant\u2019s participation in criminal activity\u201d is usually necessary \u201cto establish probable cause that inculpatory evidence will be found in the home.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In this case, the suppression court scrutinized the language contained in the affidavit and presented eight problems it had with the averments therein: first, the Cl never stated that Coley stored drugs in or sold drugs from the residence; second, a record check on Coley revealed that Coley\u2019s address was different from the target residence; third, the first controlled buy clearly did not involve the residence; fourth, the initial contact made during the second controlled buy did not occur at the residence; fifth, the affiants do not state whether Coley and the Cl went back to Coley\u2019s residence during the second buy, by walking or driving; sixth, the affidavit does not state whether the controlled buys occurred on the same date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>or not; seventh, it is unclear how long it took for the affiants to re-contact the Cl after the second buy, thereby inferring that the second buy may not have been controlled; finally, the court noted that the Cl told the affiants that Coley sold CDS to him, but did not state that the sale occurred in the residence. This scrutiny was tantamount to requiring more than a \u201cfair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in\u201d Coley\u2019s residence. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">First, the circuit court appeared to require that the affidavit actually state that a controlled buy occurred <em>in </em>Coley\u2019s residence, or that either the Cl or the affiants knew that Coley stored contraband <em>in </em>his residence. Direct statements like these are not necessary. The affiants needed only to .show a reasonable basis to infer from the nature of the illegal activity that evidence of a crime would be found in Coley\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 522-523, 796 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The affiants stated, and the circuit court did not dispute, that, in their experience, those engaged in distributing CDS store it in their homes, which they view as \u201csafe havens.\u201d Furthermore, during the second controlled buy, Coley was witnessed escorting the Cl to his residence, which he entered alone. Coley was then seen leaving his residence to \u201cre- ' contact\u201d the Cl. This could lead one to reasonably infer that Coley entered the residence to pick up the CDS, left the residence, and subsequently sold the CDS to the Cl. Nevertheless, the court concluded that the entire affidavit is \u201cpure speculation\u201d as to whether Coley\u2019s \u201cresidence housed or contained dangerous substances.\u201d We believe that it can reasonably be inferred that the affidavit, taken as a whole, supports the inference that 'Coley used his residence to support his criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Next, the circuit court pointed out that the address for Coley that was obtained by a.record check was different from the 13502 Cape Shell Court address. A \u201cpast, proven and reliable\u201d Cl informed the affiants that Coley resided at 13502 Cape Shell Court ... for a long period of time.\u201d Accordingly, one could reasonably infer that the computer system may not have been updated,- or that Coley maintained one \u201cofficial\u201d residence but actually resided elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Third, the circuit court believed the first controlled buy, did not involve the residence. While it is true that the first buy described in the affidavit clearly did not occur <em>at </em>the resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>dence, Coley was seen exiting his residence prior to contacting the Cl and making the sale. Coupled with the circumstances surrounding the second buy, a reasonable person could infer that the drugs later sold to the Cl were kept at the residence prior to sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The fourth problem the motion court had with the affidavit is similar to the third. Again, while the initial contact between Coley and the Cl during the second buy did not occur at the residence, Coley was observed leaving his residence to make contact with the Cl and subsequently returning to the residence with the CL</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Fifth, the circuit court noted that the affiants did not state whether Coley and the Cl returned to Coley\u2019s residence during the second buy by walking or by automobile. It can easily be inferred that, whether driving or walking, Coley\u2019s intent was to return to the residence to obtain the CDS that the Cl was willing to purchase. The point is that the affiants witnessed them returning to Coley\u2019s residence together prior to the buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Sixth, the circuit court is concerned that the affidavit does not state whether the buys occurred on the same date, but the court does explain the significance of that concern. The affidavit provides the Court with a time frame of approximately one month, and the warrant was applied for on October 17, 2001,11 days after the last surveillance. It can reasonably be inferred that the buys occurred on different dates within the time frame provided and ar\u00e9 indications of a present violation. The court itself noted that the dates were likely purposely omitted in order to protect the Cl\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Seventh, the circuit court had a problem with the fact that the affidavit did not state how long after the second buy the Cl was re-contacted. Specifically, it noted that the post-buy contact could have occurred the next day or even later. But a commonsense approach to this issue would lead one to conclude that the officers were diligent in re-contacting the CI. It is common knowledge that many CIs are current or former drug users. It is reasonable to believe that the officers would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>be diligent in making every effort to contact the Cl immediately after the controlled buy for a number of reasons, including the safety of the Cl and the officers, as well as the desire to prevent the Cl from using or selling the narcotics he or she has just purchased with money provided by an officer. The Maryland State Police Patrol Manual charges a state trooper with advising any person approved as a Cl with, <em>inter alia, </em>being \u201csubject to a search of their person and vehicle <em>before and after </em>the operation.\u201d Maryland State Police Patrol Manual, \u00a7 11\u20145(d), Revised 8-1-97 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Finally, the circuit court noted that the Cl never stated that a controlled buy occurred <em>in </em>the target residence, but it is clear that Coley was in and out of his residence before each controlled buy. The Cl identified 13502 Cape Shell Court as Coley\u2019s longtime residence. This is particularly noteworthy considering the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In <em>Holmes, </em>the nexus test was satisfied with very little, if any, direct evidence. Instead, there was adequate circumstantial evidence that, when combined with reasonable inferences generated from that evidence, would support the finding of probable cause by the issuing magistrate. We can infer probable cause based on \u201cthe type of crime,\u201d i.e., possession and distribution of CDS; \u201cthe nature of the items sought,\u201d i.e., contraband and other drug trafficking materials (usually found in a drug dealer\u2019s home); \u201cthe opportunity for concealment,\u201d i.e., most likely in a residence considering the nature of the itemization and packaging of CDS and record-keeping materials; \u201cand reasonable inferences about where the defendant may hide the incriminating items,\u201d i.e., small packages of crack-cocaine sold to a Cl under controlled buys after Coley left his home and near his home. <em>See Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 522, 796 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">If, as the circuit court said, the warrant application was sufficient to support Coley\u2019s arrest, then it is sufficient to support Coley\u2019s involvement in narcotics trafficking in violation of Maryland Law. Trooper McClendon and Corporal McDonough stated that, in their experience, persons engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>in drug law violations in Prince George\u2019s County are likely to store contraband and documents related to drug activity at their residences. Deference is to be given to the experience of police officers. Moreover, the officers used a \u201cpast, proven, and reliable\u201d Cl who proffered direct statements involving Coley\u2019s CDS distribution history and place of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Furthermore, while we do not know from the affidavit exactly where or when either controlled buy occurred, we do know that Coley was seen exiting his residence prior to both controlled buys.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> During the second controlled buy, Coley actually returned to his residence with the Cl, went inside alone, re-contacted the Cl outside, and then terminated contact with the CL The Cl then reported that Coley sold him crack cocaine during this period. <em>See Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d 90 (The fact that Holmes \u201cwas in and out of his house immediately prior to meeting his customer\u201d was one of several factors considered in the probable cause analysis.).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Additionally, the circuit court seemed to give no weight to the fact that Coley had several prior arrests listed in the warrant application, including one conviction for distribution of CDS. <em>See West v. State, </em>187 Md.App. 814, 350, 768 A.2d 150, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 536, 774 A.2d 409 (2001) (numerous arrests within ten years of the issuance of the warrant are relevant to the probable cause determination); <em>Amerman, </em>84 Md.App. at 484-85, 581 A.2d 19 (prior arrests, convictions and prior criminal reputation may be considered in probable cause analysis); <em>Birchead, </em>817 Md. at 703, 566 A.2d 488 (suspects charged in the past with possession of CDS with intent to distribute is a factor to consider in the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test from <em>Gates.); Malcolm v. State, </em>814 Md. 221, 282-33, 550 A.2d 670 (1988) (knowledge of prior convictions is a proper consideration in determining level of probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Taken as a whole, this search warrant application does not reflect \u201cpure speculation.\u201d Indeed, the affidavit provides a substantial basis for the issuing magistrate to believe that illegal narcotics activity was occurring in Coley\u2019s residence. Here, as in <em>Holmes, </em>\u201c[a]t the very least, this would fall within the realm of a marginal case in which, under <em>Jones </em>and <em>Ventresca, </em>deference must be given to the warrant.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d 90.

We note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>however, that this appeal is proper under CJ \u00a7 12-302(c), which does not require the State to object or take exception to the ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\">. In its motion, the State noted that the record provided to this Court by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County did not contain either the original or a photocopy of the search warrant application and affidavit. It requested that the record be supplemented with either the original documents or photocopies thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">.

Even if there was merit to Coley\u2019s claims that the original search warrant application and affidavit may not be considered by this Court because of some perceived failure of the State to place those exhibits properly in the record, we note that we have a near verbatim account of the contents of the search warrant affidavit before us in the transcript of the motion hearing. The motion court was careful to identify that it was reading the affidavit \"almost word by word on the record.\u201d At oral argument, Coley\u2019s counsel indicated that he had not done a word for word comparison but he had no reason to believe that tire documents submitted were not the correct documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">. Coley also assigns error to the fact that all exhibits used at the suppression hearing were originals and those submitted to this Court are \"various types of xerox copies.\u201d We note, however, that the exhibits before us appear in fact to be both the original warrant documents in addition to the photocopies used during the suppression hearing. Originals of the warrant, its application, and return bear the original signatures of the issuing judge, affiants, and slate's attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\">. \"The protections of the Fourth Amendment are applicable to the State of Maryland through the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>State v.

The Fourth Amendment states: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to'be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d. Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of. Rights states: \"That'all warrants, without oath or affirmation, to search suspected places, or to seize any person or property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants to search suspected places, or to apprehend suspected persons, without naming or describing the place, or the person in special, are illegal, and ought not to be granted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b545-5\">. Somewhat surprisingly, this issue was not raised or addressed in the trial court. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), and its companion case, <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984), established the good failh exception to the exclusionary rule. Under the good faith doctrine, \"evidence seized under a warrant subsequently determined to be invalid may be admissible if the executing officers acted in objective good faith with reasonable reliance on the warrant.\u201d <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>State, </em>347 Md. 452, 467, 701 A.2d 675 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1151, 118 S.Ct. 1173, 140 L.Ed.2d 182 (1998). <em>Leon </em>set out four sets of circumstances under which suppression remains the appropriate remedy: (1) when the judicial officer issuing the warrant was misled by an affidavit that \"the affiant knew was false or would have known was false excepl for his reckless disregard of the truth;\u201d (2) when the magistrate \"wholly abandoned his judicial role;\u201d (3) when \"a warrant [is] based on an affidavit 'so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable;\u2019 \u201d or (4) when the warrant is facially deficient <em>(e.g., </em>failing to particularize the place to be searched). <em>Minor v.

In <em>McDonald, </em>the Court assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that the search warrant under consideration lacked probable cause. 347 Md. at 471, 701 A.2d 675. This, too, would seem to be a case in which the issue is simply whether the particular facts presented support a finding of probable cause. As noted in <em>McDonald, </em>the ultimate question of good faith is a legal issue. 347 Md. at 470, n. 10, 701 A.2d 675 (citing <em>United States v. Williams, </em>3 F.3d 69, 71 n. 2 (3rd Cir.1993)). The standard is objective, and not subjective, good faith, and where there is an adequate record, the good faith inquiry may appropriately be made for the first time on appeal. <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>at 470, n. 10, 701 A.2d 675 (citing <em>United States v.

In that way, any necessary evidentiary hearing could be held in the trial court. Although the burden is on the State, the defense would have the opportunity to present evidence that might mitigate against the application of the good faith exception in accordance with the special circumstances presented in <em>Leon.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\">.

Whereas the circuit court required too much to show a reasonable basis for issuing the warrant, the State is urging us in the opposite direction. Here, the State is essentially asking us to conclude that the reasonable basis for concluding that relevant evidence would be found in Coley\u2019s home is the fact that Coley is a known narcotics trafficker. We acknowledge that some jurisdictions have held that there is probable cause to believe that drug dealers will keep drugs and records of the drug trade in their homes. <em>See United States v.
