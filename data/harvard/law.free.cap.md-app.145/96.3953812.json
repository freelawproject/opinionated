The Board ultimately denied appellant\u2019s claim. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City vacated the Board\u2019s order and remanded for further proceedings. Appellant argues that the circuit court should have simply reversed the Board\u2019s decision and directed that the Board approve his claim. In support of that argument, he presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">I. Was the decision of the Board in denying the claim for compensation in error because it was not based upon facts supported by substantial evidence, or did the agency abuse its discretion in not approving payment for medical bills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">II. In judicial review, was the trial court bound by the agency record and therefore the court cannot act as an advisor to the agency to correct or reconstitute the agency proceedings by vacating an order at the request of the agency which is not an aggrieved party?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">On August 11, 1999, appellant suffered multiple gunshot wounds that required medical treatment. Appellant filed a timely claim with the Board, seeking payment of medical bills in the amount of $32,641.80, none of which were covered by insurance or medical assistance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s claim included a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>copy of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s Incident Report, copies of his medical bills,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a statement that he did not know the identities of his assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Detective Nevins of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s Homicide Unit investigated .the incident in which appellant was injured. The Board\u2019s investigator was informed by Detective Nevins that (1) appellant was one of four people injured in this incident, (2) no suspects had been apprehended, (3) appellant was a \u201cknown\u201d drug dealer, (4) the area in which the shooting occurred was the appellant\u2019s \u201cterritory,\u201d and (6) Detective Nevins believed that the shooting was \u201cdrug related.\u201d Because of the information provided by Detective Nev-ins, the Board\u2019s investigator recommended that the Board deny appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The Board\u2019s decision included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">The claimant was struck by bullets fired by two unknown offenders who exited a car and opened fire. The police investigation revealed claimant was a known drug dealer and the area in which he was shot was his territory. The police believe the shooting was drug-related. The incident was reported to law enforcement authorities on the same day. The claim was received by this Board on November 3, 1999. The offenders have not been identified. As a result of this incident the claimant suffered multiple gunshot wounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">This claim has met the statutory requirement for timely reporting to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities, timely submission of an application to this Board for compensation, and cooperation with this Board and the investigative process....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">This claim has been filed pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act (Article 27, Sections 815-832, Annotated Code of Maryland). The Board has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>reviewed the claimant\u2019s application for compensation and supporting documents and has directed an independent investigation of the circumstances surrounding the claim. In arriving at its decision, the Board has considered the entire record, specifically including materials submitted by the claimant, the investigative reports, and all relevant exhibits. The Board also observes that, as required by the cited controlling statute, the burden of proof to establish the authenticity of all material elements of the claim rests with the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">To qualify for an award the claimant must prove that a serious financial hardship would ensue as a result of the criminal injury if an award is not made [Section 825(f)(1) J. In evaluating such hardship, among other factors, the Board is required by Section 825(d) of [the] statute to reduce any potential award by the amount of any other monies the claimant received from any other source as a result of the crime. If the monies received from other sources exceed the amount of a potential award, no award is payable by the Board. <em>[See Williams v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, </em>307 Md. 606, 516 A.2d 573 (1986) ]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">The Board concludes after reviewing the file, the evidence submitted, and after due deliberation that the claimant has not sustained the burden of proof that he is the innocent victim of a crime....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">Wherefore, It is Ordered this 13th day of April, 2000, that the herein claim be disapproved, all subject to further order of this Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The Board\u2019s decision was accompanied by a letter offering appellant an opportunity to (1) submit any information not previously submitted, and (2) request a hearing. After receiving no response or additional information from appellant, the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services rendered a final decision in which he approved the denial of appellant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant then sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">During the judicial review hearing, the Honorable John Carroll Byrnes stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">I just think that it\u2019s such a serious public policy issue on both sides of this. I don\u2019t mean to sound as if I think that the result is here is, is the only public policy question. The, [sic] you clearly have a public policy\u2014the Legislature has already addressed it. It said no. So we don\u2019t have an open question here of whether these folks who are involved in drug trafficking can claim victim funds. They said no. The real question that\u2019s unanswered is the, [sic] what the quality of the proof should be and this judge I suppose, maybe no one else but I[sic] made a little bit uncomfortable as a matter of constitutional due process that a result is based upon, solely upon double hearsay. You don\u2019t have, in answering my own question of some minutes ago, the answer is no, there\u2019s nothing in this record which can be seen or understood to be an interpretation by the administrative agency of this\u2014of the characteristics of this shooting of that kind is an indicator of drug trafficking on the part of the victim. That\u2019s absent from this. work. What is present and the only thing present is a double hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">Now, can a reasonable. fact finder rely upon that? I suppose they can and that really is in a sense the Litman\u2019s [sic] test but it\u2019s a little troublesome that, somebody says oh, he\u2019s a bad guy. Oh, okay. There goes that compensation, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Okay. Then we\u2019re in agreement. That\u2019s, since we\u2019re simply trying to clarify my expression that\u2019s all I was doing there. So we\u2019re not in disagreement on the principals [sic] of law but I am of a mind to remand this with a direction to conduct a hearing so that an evidentiary base can be presented and at that hearing I do believe that by implication the Legislature wants third parties to be engaged in this process so they should be entitled to participate in the hearing. And with reference to the discretion argument, I\u2019m not going to, I don\u2019t want to place that in the order. I think that\u2019s a legal issue that, with which we really don\u2019t disagree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Judge Byrnes thereafter entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">The decision of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board denying the claim of Ezra Johnson is hereby VACATED .... This case is hereby remanded to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board with instructions that the Board conduct an administrative hearing in this matter permitting all interested parties to participate, subject to the extent of their interests and standing, and upon notice to counsel for all such parties.... That upon review by the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board shall issue its decision following the hearing aforesaid.... This Court shall retain jurisdiction of this court case so as to review the decision of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board if Appellant so requests further judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is authorized by Maryland. Code (1999 Repl.Vol.), section 10-222 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>of the State Government Article. Under section 10\u2014222(h), when exercising such review, the court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision differs markedly from judicial review of the decision of a trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-14\">In the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for- a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court. However, in judicial review of agency action the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-15\"><em>United Steelworkers v.

We disagree. The circuit court\u2019s authority to remand is not dependent upon (1) a party\u2019s request for that relief, or (2) the legal sufficiency of the evidence contained in the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The Criminal Injuries Compensation Act was adopted in 1968 as a remedial measure designed to provide monetary benefits to offset some of the economic losses sustained by victims of crime. <em>See Criminal Injuries Compensation Board v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 495-96, 331 A.2d 55 (1975); <em>see also Gossard v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, </em>279 Md. 309, 310, 368 A.2d 443 (1977)(\u201cthe General Assembly undertook to provide a measure of financial assistance in specified circumstances to innocent victims of crime and their dependents\u201d). Since the funds to be disbursed under the Act were public funds, the Act was adopted with statutory prerequisites for monetary awards. <em>See Gould, </em>273 Md. at 498, 331 A.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The eligibility prerequisites of the Act require that a claimant not be \u201c... criminally responsible for the crime upon which a claim is based or an accomplice of that person ...,\u201d \u00a7 819(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board is also required by \u00a7 825(e)(l)(i)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u201c... determine whether, because of the victim\u2019s conduct, the victim of the crime contributed to the infliction of the victim\u2019s injury, and the Board members shall reduce the amount of the award or reject the claim altogether, in accordance with this determination.\u201d If a claimant \u201c... initiated, consented to, provoked, or unreasonably failed to avoid a physical confrontation with the offender or ...\u201d was \u201c... participating in a criminal offense at the time of the injury inflicted,\u201d he may not receive an award pursuant to \u00a7 825(e)(3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In the case at bar, the Board concluded that appellant \u201c... has not sustained the burden of proof that he is the innocent victim of a crime.\u201d No Maryland appellate court has decided who bears the burden of proving whether the petitioner did or did not contribute to his or her injuries. To answer this question, we examine the language of Md.Code (2001), Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-810,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>(a) In general.\u2014(1) The Board may make an award only if the Board finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">(i) a crime or delinquent act was committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">(ii) the crime or delinquent act directly resulted in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">1. physical injury to or death of the victim; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">2. psychological injury to the victim that necessitated mental health counseling;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">(iii) police, other law enforcement, or judicial records show that the crime or delinquent act or the discovery of child abuse was reported to the proper authorities within 48 hours after the occurrence of the crime or delinquent act or the discovery of the child abuse; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">(iv) the victim has cooperated fully with all law enforcement units.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">(2) For good cause, the Board may waive the requirements of paragraph (l)(iii) and (iv) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">(b) <em>Serious financial </em>hardship.\u2014Unless total dependency is established, family members are considered to be partly defendant on a parent with whom they reside without regard to actual earnings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">(c) Minimum allowable claim.\u2014The Board may make an award only if the claimant, as a result of the injury on which the claim is based, has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">(d) Contributory conduct.\u2014(l)(i) Except as provided under subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, in considering a claim and in determining the amount of an award, the Board shall determine whether the victim\u2019s conduct contributed to the infliction of the victim\u2019s injury, and, if so, reduce the amount of the award or reject the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>(ii) The Board may disregard the responsibility of the victim for the victim\u2019s own injury if that responsibility is attributable to efforts by the victim:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">1. to prevent a crime or delinquent act or an attempted crime or delinquent act from occurring in the victim\u2019s presence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">2. to apprehend an offender who had committed a crime or delinquent act in the victim\u2019s presence or had committed a felony or delinquent act that would be a felony if committed by an adult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">(3) <em>A </em>claimant may not receive an award if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">(i) the victim initiated, consented to, provoked, or unreasonably failed to avoid a physical confrontation with the offender; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">(ii) the victim was participating in a crime or delinquent act when the injury was inflicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The language of section 11-810 does not expressly address the question of who has the burden of persuasion. The <em>Gould </em>Court stated that \u201c[t]he Maryland version [of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board] is modeled upon the New York statute, adopted in 1966, creating the Crime Victims Compensation Board (N.Y. Exec. Law, Art. 22, McKinney (1972)).\u201d 273 Md. at 497, 331 A.2d 55. Under New York law, once there is sufficient information to generate the issue of whether the claimant contributed to his or her injuries, the claimant must shoulder the burden of persuasion on that issue. <em>See, e.g., Callicutt v. Executive Dep\u2019t, Crime Victims Bd., </em>245 A.D.2d 689, 665 N.Y.S.2d 125 (3d Dep\u2019t 1997), in which the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">The record establishes that information received from the investigating detective and the Assistant District Attorney demonstrated that Hannah was engaged in an ongoing dispute with the alleged perpetrator just days before the murder. <em>Since petitioners failed to present evidence refuting this information or affirmatively showing that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>Hannah did not contribute to his injury, they failed to satisfy their burden of establishing the merit of their claims (see Matter of Regan v.

(\u201cA person who is criminally responsible for the crime upon which a claim is based or an accomplice of such person shall not be eligible to receive an award with respect to such claim\u201d).]). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s determinations are supported by substantial evidence in the record and should not be disturbed (see, <em>Matter of Ortiz v. Leak, </em>214 A.D.2d 840, 841 [625 N.Y.S.2d 329]; <em>Matter of Rigaud v. Crime Victims Compensation Bd., </em>94 A.D.2d 602, 603 [461 N.Y.S.2d 840]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah1\"><em>Callicutt, </em>245 A.D.2d at 690, 665 N.Y.S.2d at 126 (emphasis and language added). Other jurisdictions are in accord.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2022 .We agree with those authorities and hold that, when the circumstances are such that the Board must decide whether the petitioner did or did not contribute to his or her injuries, the petitioner has the burden of persuasion .on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">To determine whether administrative agency findings and conclusions are supported by the record, the court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>be in a position to review findings and conclusions that are sufficiently specific. <em>Tron v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>69 Md.App. 256, 270-72, 517 A.2d 113 (1986). The appellate courts of this State have repeatedly held that if agency decisions are not sufficiently clear to allow for meaningful appellate review or fail to reflect findings or reasons, then the appropriate remedy is to remand the matter to the agency for the purpose of correcting the deficiency. <em>Montgomery Co. v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. 471, 486, 654 A.2d 877 (1995); <em>Atlantic Venture, Inc. v. Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore City, </em>94 Md.App. 73, 84, 615 A.2d 1210 (1992); <em>Colao v.

In such a situation, [the] court may always remand a case - to the agency for further consideration.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In the case at bar, the Board did not (1) explain why it required appellant to prove that he was not disqualified under \u00a7 819(b) or under \u00a7 825(e)(3), (2) make factual findings on the issue of why it was not persuaded that appellant did not contribute to his injuries, and (3) state how much weight it assigned to Detective Nevins\u2019 belief that the shooting was drug related. Thus, the administrative record is inadequate to allow for informed judicial review. Under these circumstances, a remand is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">While hearsay evidence can be the sole basis lor an administrative agency\u2019s decision, the hearsay evidence must be \u201ccredible and probative.\u201d <em>Changing Point, Inc. v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>87 Md.App. 150, 170, 589 A.2d 502 (1991). Moreover, this .Court has rejected the proposition that a person involved in- criminal activity on a prior occasion \u201ctraveled the streets enveloped in probable cause ...\u201d <em>Silbert v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 56, 65, 267 A.2d 770 (1970). We are persuaded that if the Board is relying upon hearsay evidence to \u201cshift\u201d the burden of persuasion to appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>lant, the hearsay should be at least as reliable as the kind <em>of </em>hearsay that is admissible at a sentencing proceeding. In <em>Nickens v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 284, 301 A.2d 49 (1973), this Court imposed the following limitations on the sentencing judge\u2019s consideration of hearsay evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">Section 298 (f) [of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substances Act] ... permits the sentencing judge to receive hearsay testimony. It does not, however, provide that conclusions of police officers are admissible unless there are facts stated that support the conclusions. It was not the intention of the Legislature to allow the sentencing judge to consider all information of any nature relevant to the defendant without regard to the source or trustworthiness of hearsay presented. The enactment mandates the constitutional protections by permitting the production of hearsay evidence, if \u2018... the underlying circumstances upon which it is based and the reliability of the source is demonstrated.\u2019 The question of reliability is for the determination of the sentencing judge. Det. Sallow testified that Appellant was a \u2018bundle drop-off man\u2019 who \u2018dropped off bundles of heroin daily to dealers who distribute heroin. Sallow had followed Appellant on occasions but had never seen him \u2018drop bundles.\u2019 His conclusion that Appellant was a \u2018drop-off man\u2019 obviously was based upon what some person or persons told him. The detective, however, did not relate to the court what was said or by whom. There were no \u2018underlying circumstances\u2019 present that afforded the sentencing judge an opportunity to determine reliability. The only evidence regarding \u2018reliability\u2019 was the officer\u2019s statement that he had acquired his information from \u2018both reliable\u2019 informants and those whose \u2018reliability\u2019 had \u2018not been corroborated.\u2019 It may be that a police officer has sufficient training and experience to interpret the information or corroborate it with his own investigation, but the statements themselves, as related to the officer or witness, must be recited to the sentencing judge. It is the specific facts constituting the hearsay, not the witness\u2019s conclusion therefrom, that are admissible to establish informational reliability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>In addition to required informational reliability, there must be some showing of the credibility of the source.... Unbridled hearsay or opinions of witnesses, without supporting facts, should not be received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 289-290, 301 A.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In the case at bar, the information supplied by Detective Nevins was not sufficient to generate the issue of whether appellant was shot as a result of his participation in criminal conduct. Thus, the Board erred in requiring that appellant bear the burden of persuading the Board that he did not contribute to his injuries.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Appellant argues that the case should not be remanded for further proceedings. We disagree. It is true that when an appellate court reverses a criminal conviction on the ground that the evidence was insufficient, the accused cannot be prosecuted again. That protection against being placed in double jeopardy does not apply to administrative proceedings. \u201cIt is familiar appellate practice to remand causes for further proceedings without deciding the merits, where justice demands that course in order that some defect in the record may be supplied. Such a remand may be made to permit further evidence to be taken or additional findings to be made upon essential points.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Labor Board, </em>305 U.S. 364, 373, 59 S.Ct. 301, 83 L.Ed. 221 (1939) (footnotes omitted). \u201cUnder Md. State Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 10-215(g)(1), the circuit court may remand the case to an administrative agency for further fact finding if the court finds the agency\u2019s record devoid of substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hickory </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>Hills Ltd., supra, </em>84 Md.App. at 685, 581 A.2d 834. We are therefore persuaded that Judge Byrnes neither erred nor abused his discretion when he remanded the case to the Board for additional fact finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Upon remand, the Board must first determine whether there exists enough credible and probative (hearsay or non-hearsay) evidence to generate the issue of whether appellant engaged in criminal conduct that contributed to the injuries he sustained on the occasion at issue. If it does conclude that this issue has been generated, the Board must afford appellant a full and fair opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not contribute to the infliction of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\">.
