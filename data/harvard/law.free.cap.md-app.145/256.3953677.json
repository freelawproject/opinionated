Strausberg in multiple garnishment proceedings initiated by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\u201cCity\u201d) against several insurance companies (\u201cgarnishees\u201d o\u00ed \u201cinsurers\u201d) that provided liability coverage and excess coverage to Croker, Inc. (\u201cCroker\u201d), a subcontractor who installed asbestos-containing thermal insulation products in public buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">As a result of the pre-hearing conference held pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-206, this Court issued an Order calling upon the parties to address the following rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-11\">1. Ruling on Insurers\u2019 Motion to Set Aside or, in the Alternative, to Revise the Consent Judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-12\">2. Ruling on Zurich [Insurance Companyj\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment Based on the Products Hazard Exclusion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-13\">3. Ruling on Utica Mutual [Insurance Comp'anyjs Motion \u2022for Summary Judgment on the Issues of Trigger of Coverage and Allocation, which other Insurers joined;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>4. Ruling on U.S. Fire Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment (based on absence of policy);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">5. Ruling on Federal Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment (based on exhaustion); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">6. Ruling on Insurers\u2019 Motion to Strike Plaintiff the Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore\u2019s Jury Demand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We hold that in garnishment proceedings, summary judgment in favor of a particular garnishee is a final judgment as to that garnishee. We shall deny the garnishees\u2019 motion to dismiss the City\u2019s appeals from the. entries of summary judgment based on the products hazard exclusion, on allocation, and on trigger of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">We shall dismiss the City\u2019s appeals from the order striking its jury request, and from the court\u2019s refusal to deny garnishees\u2019 request to reopen the consent judgment. We shall also dismiss the cross-appeals filed by Utica Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">We conclude that the products hazard exclusion applies to claims of negligent failure to warn, and therefore affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of American Guarantee and Liability Insurance Company and Zurich on that issue, as to primary and umbrella policies for the period from September 5,1979 through September 5,1980, and the primary policy for the period from September 5, 1980 to June 2, 1981. We vacate the entry of summary judgment as to the Zurich umbrella policy for the September 5, 1980 to September 5, 1981 period, because of a significant discrepancy in the record with regard to the correct policy number for the products hazard exclusion, and remand this issue to the circuit court for further consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>We conclude that an injury-in-fact/continuous trigger of coverage is applicable for long term and continuing damage posed by the installation and continued presence of asbestos in buildings, and shall therefore vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment in favor of insurers whose coverage began after December 31, 1980. We remand this issue for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We conclude that liability for the damages claimed in this matter shall be allocated\u2014on a pro rata basis from the perspective of time on the risk\u2014among triggered primary insurance policies and periods of self-insurance <em>(viz., </em>when Croker was either \u201cself-insured\u201d or chose not to buy products liability coverage that was available). We shall affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of Federal Insurance Company on the issue of exhaustion because we have determined that as a matter of law that, under an appropriate allocation and horizontal exhaustion rule, Federal\u2019s excess policy will not be reached.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">These appeals represent yet another chapter in asbestos-abatement litigation that commenced on September 24, 1984, when the City sued numerous entities deemed responsible in some manner for the installation of asbestos-containing building materials (ACBMs) in certain city buildings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the City, the various defendants should be held responsible for the cost of removal, management, abatement or remediation of ACBMs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With the parties\u2019 consent, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>divided the case into separate proceedings based on the nature of the asbestos product that had been installed: \u201cGroup I\u201d involved surface treatment products; \u201cGroup II\u201d involved thermal insulation products; and \u201cGroup III\u201d involved flooring materials.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Group III litigation settled prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">On June 5, 1992, a jury returned verdicts in favor of the City against three of the Group I defendants-United States Gypsum Company, Hampshire Industries, Incorporated and Asbestospray Corporation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> awarding (1) compensatory dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ages against all three defendants in the amount of $17,208,807.14, and (2) punitive damages in the aggregate amount of $6,000,000 against United States Gypsum ($4,000,-000) and Asbestospray ($2,000,000). The circuit court entered a final judgment on that verdict, and the defendants noted appeals. While the appeals were pending in this Court, the Court of Appeals issued a writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In <em>United States Gypsum Co. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>336 Md. 145, 647 A.2d 405 (1994), while upholding the compensatory damage award and reversing the punitive damage award, the Court of Appeals held that (1) tort remedies were available to the City in this action for property damage,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) the defendants were under a continuing duty to warn of product defects after the moment of installation and sale,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) the defendants would be held responsible for general \u201cstate of the art\u201d knowledge about the hazards posed by their product.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Court of Appeals had another occasion to conduct a direct review of Group I proceedings when two insurance companies, North River Insurance Company and United States Fire Insurance Company, as garnishees in the City\u2019s attempt to collect the Group I award against Asbestospray, appealed a default judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>North River Insurance Co. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>343 Md. 34, 680 A.2d 480 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The City-Croker Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The issues before us arise out of a settlement reached in the Group II litigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> One of the Group II defendants was Croker, a subcontractor that installed asbestos thermal insulation in a number of Baltimore City public buildings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Settlement discussions between Croker and the City were conducted throughout 1993, and the parties reached a settlement on December 29, 1993. A consent judgment for $5,018,989.44 was filed in the circuit court on January 4, 1994. The City is now attempting to collect this amount, plus applicable interest, from the insurance companies that provided coverage to Croker during the period of time that is relevant to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The City requested the issuance of writs of garnishment against insurance proceeds and credits allegedly payable to Croker by a number of its insurance carriers. The writs were executed and the garnishees filed timely answers thereto. The City in turn replied.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The issues thus joined, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>filed a host of pre-trial motions,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the appeals now before us stem from Judge Strausberg\u2019s rulings on certain of those motions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The Circuit Court\u2019s January 21, 2000 Order</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Zurich Insurance Company, joined by American Guarantee Insurance Company,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> moved to set aside the consent judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ment, and the City filed a Cross-Motion to Strike Insurers\u2019 Affirmative Defenses. In a Memorandum Opinion filed on January 21, 2000, while rejecting the City\u2019s arguments that (1) the carriers lacked standing to challenge the consent judgment for fraud, and (2) the garnishees were precluded from contesting that Judgment by \u201cprinciples of finality,\u201d Judge Strausberg concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">Zurich is not entitled to the relief it seeks as a matter of law as there is a genuine dispute as to material facts. Md. Rule 2-501. Whether all or part of the consent judgment was procured by fraud or collusion is an open issue not susceptible to resolution as a matter of law at this point in time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The Circuit Court\u2019s May 16, 2000 Order</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The parties continued to skirmish over pre-trial motions. On April 17 and May 2, 2000, Judge Strausberg held hearings on their legal arguments. In a Memorandum Opinion filed May 16, 2000, Judge Strausberg (1) granted a majority of the garnishees\u2019 motions for summary judgment,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (2) deferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ruling on Zurich\u2019s motion to set aside the consent judgment, (3) struck the City\u2019s demand for a jury trial, and (4) denied the City\u2019s Motion to Strike the garnishees\u2019 affirmative defenses. These appeals and cross-appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction pursuant to Maryland Code (1974 and 1998 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-301, 12-308 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Before the Court is a motion to dismiss the City\u2019s appeals, filed by American Guarantee, Zurich, U.S. Fire and St. Paul Fire <em>&amp; </em>Marine.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> According to these appellees, the City has no right to note its numerous appeals from nonfinat judgments that have not resolved all of the claims against all of the parties in this garnishment proceeding. According to the City,. because the garnishment proceedings have been initiated against separate insurers, and are separate and distinct from one another, summary judgment as to a particular insurer constitutes a final, appealable, judgment that has effectively ended the litigation against that insurer.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The City also argues for dismissal of the cross-appeals filed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Utica Mutual Insurance Company from the circuit court\u2019s refusal to grant Utica\u2019s motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The Final Judgment Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Maryland Rule 2-602, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">(a) Generally.\u2014Except as provided in section (b) of this Rule, an order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action (whether raised by original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim), or that adjudicates less than an entire claim, or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties to the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(1) is not a final judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">(2) does not terminate the action as to any of the claims or any of the parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">(3) is subject to revision at any time before the entry of a judgment that adjudicates all of the claims by and against all of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">(b) <em>When </em>allowed.\u2014If the court expressly determines in a written order that there is no just reason for delay, it may direct in the order the entry of a final judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">(1) as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">The Court of Appeals has recently reaffirmed the well-established rule that, subject to certain exceptions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acc\">an appeal may be taken to the Court of Special Appeals under Maryland Code, \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, only from a \u201cfinal judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u201d In construing that statute, we have held that, if a ruling of the Circuit Court is to constitute a final judgment, it must, among other things, be an \u201cunqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck v.

Ghingher, </em>287 Md. 150, 159, 411 A.2d 430, 436 (1980). <em>See also International Bedding Co. v.

Consolidated Construction Services, Inc., </em>143 Md.App. 606, 795 A.2d 754 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>These appeals present two issues that involve the nature of garnishment litigation: (1) whether, and to what extent, a garnishment constitutes a proceeding that is separate from the \u201cunderlying action\u201d that created the judgment (even though a garnishment proceeding is \u201cfiled in the same action\u201d); and (2) whether the attempts to collect property or credits of the judgment debtor that are in the hands of different garnishees constitute separate and distinct garnishment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">A garnishment of a judgment debtor\u2019s property has \u201cmany of the attributes of a separate cause of action,\u201d and a garnishee may respond to the writ \u201cin a similar manner to a defendant pleading in an ordinary action.\u201d C. Brown, Introduction to Maryland Civil Litigation, \u00a7 6.34, 200-201 (1982). Thus, on the question of whether garnishment proceedings against separate insurers fall squarely within the confines of the underlying action, or are <em>sui generis, </em>garnishment has a separate character in those cases where the purported garnishee contests the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Under Maryland Rule 2-645(g), when a judgment creditor replies to a garnishee\u2019s answer to the writ, \u201cthe matter shall proceed as if it were an original action between the judgment creditor as plaintiff and the garnishee as defendant and shall be governed by the rules applicable to civil actions.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-645(e) expressly provides that the \u201cgarnishee may assert any defense that the garnishee may have to the garnishment, as well as any defense that the judgment debtor could assert.\u201d According to the Honorable Paul V. Neimeyer, \u201c[t]he date of the filing of a reply under this rule is analogous to the date that a complaint is filed.\u201d <em>Commentary on the New Maryland Rules of Civil Procedure, </em>43 Md.L.Rev. 669, 857 (1984). <em>See also </em>Paul V. Neimeyer and Linda M. Schuett, Maryland Rules Commentary at 521 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure has discussed the nature of property garnishment proceedings in cases in which the issue had been joined by the judgment creditor\u2019s reply, in contrast to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>routine situations where attachment and garnishment were virtually <em>pro forma. See Court of Appeals Standing Committee on the Rules of Practice and Procedure, </em>Minutes, March 12 and 13,1982, at 37-39, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">Several of the members expressed concern about the requirements of opening a new case. [Judge] Niemeyer pointed out that a new case involves additional process not required by the current garnishment practice....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">The Reporter commented that the requirement of a new suit affords protection for the garnishee; election, of jury trial, discovery, and all other procedural safeguards would be available. Mr. Smith noted that in some counties it is current practice to docket the garnishment proceeding as a new case against the garnishee. Mr. Bowen suggested that the full panoply of process associated with a new case will only be involved where the garnishee had money of the debtor but refuses to disgorge it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">... It was proposed that current practice be preserved to govern the 95% untroublesome garnishments and the type of procedure.presented in this draft be reserved to govern the 5% contested cases.... Mr. Bowen maintained that ... where the creditor contests the response filed by the garnishee that the problem cases are distinguished from the majority of garnishments....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The next month, the following explanatory note was placed in the Committee minutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">[The proposed garnishment rule] has been redrafted with the intent of retaining the essence of current garnishment practice for use in the majority of cases and of making special provision for the few cases where controyersy between the judgment creditor and garnishee requires the full panoply of a litigation action.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1N\">Minutes, April 16,1982, at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">We hold that summary judgments in favor of some, but not all, of the garnishees constitute appealable final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ments because each garnishment initiated against a different insurer constitutes a separate and distinct proceeding. Thus, a summary judgment that terminates the proceeding against a specific garnishee constitutes a final appealable judgment as to that garnishee.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In light of our conclusion that garnishment proceedings are separate cases, even though filed in the underlying action, we shall deny the motions to dismiss the City\u2019s appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of Zurich Insurance Company and American Guarantee Insurance Company, and shall review the following rulings of the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">1. The circuit court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on Federal Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on the issue of exhaustion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">2. The circuit court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on Zurich Insurance Company\u2019s and American Guarantee\u2019s motions for summary judgment based on the product\u2019s hazard exclusion; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">3. The circuit court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company\u2019s (joined by Zurich) motions for summary judgment relating to trigger of coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The City has also appealed the circuit court\u2019s May 16, 2000 decision to vacate its January 21, 2000 denial of the Motion to Set Aside the Consent Judgment filed by Zurich Insurance Company and American Guarantee. Judge Strausberg had originally denied that motion, effectively treating it as a request for summary judgment that required further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>development of the facts. On May 16, 2000, however, Judge Strausberg revisited this issue and ruled that his earlier consideration of this question had been premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">It is true that the City would have a right to an immediate appeal from an order vacating an enrolled judgment. <em>Ventresca et ux. v. Weaver Brothers, Inc., </em>266 Md. 398, 403, 292 A.2d 656, 659 (1972). In this case, however, the City has appealed a decision to decide a motion to vacate. A party has no right to appeal a circuit court\u2019s ruling that it will-at some point in the future-decide whether there is merit in a motion to vacate a judgment.

Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633 (1992), the Court of Appeals noted that in strict liability failure to warn cases, \u201cnegligence concepts to some extent have been grafted onto strict liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 601 A.2d at 640; <em>cf. Phipps v.

In either instance the failure to warn causes the product to be defective with respect to its \u201clatent dangerous characteristics.\u201d In either instance, the duty to provide adequate warnings in essence \u201cruns with the product,\u201d and remains with the seller subsequent to the sale. Thus, the Court of Appeals has concluded that \u201ca manufacturer of a defective product has a duty to warn of product defects which the manufacturer discovers after the time of sale.\u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 446, 601 A.2d at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The Court of Appeals has also stated that the continuing duty to warn is applicable to suits for property damage. <em>See United States Gypsum, </em>336 Md. at 160, 647 A.2d at 412. An installer such as Croker, who \u201cshould have known\u201d about the danger of the ACBMs, has a duty to provide adequate warnings about that product. <em>Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc. v. Balbos, </em>326 Md. 179, 198-200, 203-04, 604 A.2d 445, 455-57 (1992). The supplier-installer is held to the same standard of awareness of the dangerous characteristics of asbestos, <em>viz. </em>\u201cshould have known,\u201d whether the cause of action is denominated \u201cstrict liability\u201d or sounds in negligence. <em>See id. </em>at 199-200, 604 A.2d at 455; <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 443 n. 11, 601 A.2d at 644 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Judge Strausberg relied on the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision in <em>Celotex </em>because it, too, involved the nature and extent of insurance coverage, in an asbestos-related property damage case. There is, however, a split of authority on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">In <em>Scarborough v. Northern Assurance Co., </em>718 F.2d 130 (5th Cir.1983), the insured, a supplier of sand, filed a third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>party claim against two insurers, asserting a right to reimbursement for costs it had incurred in successfully defending a products liability action. The district court dismissed the claim, ruling that the insurers\u2019 policies excluded coverage of claims arising out of the company\u2019s silica products. The company appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which framed the issue as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoq\">whether [the] complaint [in the underlying action], which alleged, among other things, that [the company] had furnished [plaintiffs] employers sandblasting material (sand) \u201cwithout proper instructions for its use,\u201d alleged a ground of liability against [the company] that was not excluded by the exclusion provisions of [insurers\u2019] policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><em>Scarborough, </em>718 F.2d at 132. Applying Louisiana law, the <em>Scarborough </em>Court held that a negligent failure to warn was not excluded by the \u201cproducts hazard\u201d exclusion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In <em>Harford Mutual Ins. Co. v. Moorhead, </em>396 Pa.Super. 234, 578 A.2d 492 (1990), the Pennsylvania Superior Court concluded that a products hazard exclusion did not apply to allegations of negligent failure to warn.' In that case, manufacturers of wine making supplies marketed a sulphur strip that was designed to prepare a vessel for use in the fermentation of grapes. The strip would be ignited and placed inside the fermentation container in order to kill bacteria. The customer placed the strip inside a former whiskey barrel, which exploded because of the presence of alcohol vapors. Litigation, followed, with plaintiffs asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the defendants were negligent in failing to warn of the dangers posed by lighting the strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In a declaratory action initiated by the defendants\u2019 insurer, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the insured. The insurer appealed, contending that the \u201cessence\u201d of the underlying complaint was one of products liability, and not negligence, regardless of how drafted. The wine makers responded that the exclusion was inapplicable in this case. The Pennsylvania Superior Court agreed with that argument,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">Alleged negligence which does not involve the sale of a defective product is of a type which \u201coccurs occasionally in the course of business and is a risk for which businesses buy general coverage.\u201d ... To construe a \u201cProducts Hazard\u201d exclusion to apply in a suit later brought against an insured where the product sold was not the <em>cause of the damage, </em>but was merely an <em>incidental instrumentality </em>through which the damage was done, would defeat the purpose of purchasing such a policy by rendering meaningless much of the stated coverage---- Thus, we conclude, as did this Court in <em>Friestad [v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>260 Pa.Super. 178, 393 A.2d 1212 (1978) ], that the \u201cProducts Hazard\u201d exclusion applies only when a <em>product, </em>rather than a <em>service, </em>is the alleged cause in fact of damages or injury to a third person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-9\"><em>Moorhead, </em>396 Pa.Super. at 242, 578 A.2d at 496 (emphasis supplied, citations omitted). Following Moorhead,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsyl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>vania concluded that the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s opinion \u201cstands for the proposition that an insurer must accept a claim as stated in the complaint and cannot justify its decision to deny coverage by attempting to recharacterize the claim to fit within the terms of the exclusion.\u201d <em>Devich v.

The plaintiff in an underlying tort action was injured when a crane he had been operating collapsed. In a declaratory judgment action against the seller\u2019s insurance company, the trial court and Idaho\u2019s intermediate appellate court agreed that the products hazard exclusion was applicable. The Idaho Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the exclusion did not apply. <em>Chancler, </em>109 Idaho at 847, 712 P.2d at 548; <em>cf. Mario Beauty Supply, </em>227 Mich. App. at 319-20, 575 N.W.2d at 329 (exclusion does not explicitly disavow coverage for damages resulting from failure to warn).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In <em>Celotex, </em>the debtor-manufacturer sought a declaration regarding the scope of the \u201cproducts hazard\u201d exclusion in its liability policies, and asked the court to determine whether the definition of \u201cproducts liability\u201d or \u201cproducts hazard\u201d covered liability for asbestos-related property damage. The debtor company\u2019s argument tracks the argument presented by the City in the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">Debtor asserts a distinction must be made between those claims founded in strict liability, which requires a showing of a defective product, and those claims alleging mere negligent failure to warn, which does not require a showing of a defect in the product involved in the injury.... Thus, Debtor argues the claims are not directly related to products liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">149 B.R. at 999-1000. The Bankruptcy Court agreed with the insurance company, and rejected the debtor\u2019s argument that its negligent failure to warn was \u201csufficiently removed from the nature of its asbestos-containing products to warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>classification as something other than products liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1001. The court noted <em>Scarborough </em>and <em>Moorhead, </em>but disagreed with those cases, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">In this case, however, the Court finds the alleged damages resulting from the failure to warn of the dangers involved in the use of the asbestos-containing products are sufficiently tied to the nature of Debtor\u2019s products to warrant denominating the liability as products hazard.... The underlying complaints allege asbestos is a dangerous, defective product whether used properly or improperly. Any liability based upon negligent failure to warn of those innate dangers, is directly associated with the product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">149 B.R. at 1001. The court stated that, in the case of inherently dangerous products, \u201cit is the failure to warn of those inherent dangers that makes the product defective and implicates the products hazard or products liability provisions of the policies.\u201d 149 B.R. at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Other courts also agree with <em>Celotex. </em>As was explained by a Florida intermediate appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">The complaint against appellants did not allege that they sold the wrong product; or that they had a duty to warn of possible results of misuse [thereof]; or that [defendant] negligently failed to advise [plaintiffs] of additional available equipment which would safely adapt the [product] for a particular use. On the contrary, it alleged that [defendant] was on notice of a dangerous condition created by. a product defect and did not warn of it. Thus, even though the complaint does contain an allegation of negligent failure to warn, it effectively alleges a bodily injury arising out of either the named insured\u2019s product or reliance upon, a necessarily implied warranty with respect to its fitness. The negligence alleged is clearly that contemplated by the exclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\"><em>K-C Manufacturing Co., Inc. v.

Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., </em>16 Cal.App.4th 492, 20 Cal.Rptr.2d 376 (1993), the plaintiffs in asbestos-in-buildings cases sought damages based on a variety of theories, including negligence and strict liability. In this particular appeal, Fibreboard, a manufacturer of asbestos-containing products, asked the California Court of Appeals to overturn a trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the insurer on the ground that numerous claims were excluded under an asbestos products exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Fibreboard argued to the appellate court that \u201cclaims based on theories such as concert of action [and] failure to disclose hazardous nature of products ... have \u2018nothing to do with any product manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by Fibreboard\u2019 \u201d and accordingly would not be subject to an exclusion limiting indemnity for products claims. The Court of Appeals rejected that argument,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Within the framework of the Hartford policies and the continuum of coverage provided for liability stemming from operations and products, it is obvious that the traditional products claims in the underlying complaints, namely, those asserting negligent testing, design, manufacture and sale; strict liability for design and manufacturing defects; failure to warn; breach of warranties; misrepr\u00e9sentation. and the like, are within the four walls of the \u201cproducts hazard\u201d clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">16 Cal.App.4th at 502, 20 Cal.Rptr.2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">It is true that there is a distinction between strict liability and negligence.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> While they are not redundant causes of action, in the context of a defective product case, under either theory, it is the failure to warn that renders the product defective.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We therefore hold that the products hazard exclusion applies to claims for negligent failure to warn of the dangers of an inherently dangerous product such as asbestos in all of its forms.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Whether styled as \u201cnegligence\u201d or \u201cstrict liability,\u201d a complaint for failure to warn of the dangers of the asbestos-containing materials in this case seeks to recover for property damage \u201carising out of the named insured\u2019s products.\u201d We shall therefore affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of American Guarantee as to its policy No. TOP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>74 74 079 for the period September 5, 1979 through September 5,1980, on the basis of the products hazard exclusion.

In applying the products hazard exclusion to relieve Zurich from any potential indemnification liability on its umbrella policy for that period, the circuit court cited what is generally referred to as the \u201cown products exclusion.\u201d As noted by the Illinois Appellate Court, this exclusion by its terms does not apply to indemnification for damage inflicted on the property of persons other than the insured. <em>See United States Gypsum Co. v.

But the record demonstrates confusion on this point, for it contains, as stated above, a schedule of endorsements with a policy number that is different from that employed to identify the Zurich umbrella policy. Although it is argued that the endorsements actually refer to Zurich No. 89-28-612, instead of 89-28-611 as written, the record shows that the effective dates for the documents differ, as do the agency or producer numbers. There may be a logical explanation for these discrepancies, but the discrepancies must be resolved by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Trigger of Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Utica Mutual, joined by St. Paul, Zurich and American Guarantee, filed a motion for summary judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ground that (1) the City could not prove the amount of property damage that occurred during its policy period, and (2) it would not be technologically feasible to demonstrate such damage. Utica also contended that, because the \u201ctotal amount\u201d of property damage occurred at the moment of installation, damages sought by the City were not covered by insurance policies that were on the risk only after the asbestos was installed.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Utica\u2019s motions were denied, but summary judgment was entered in favor of St. Paul and Zurich.

Harford Mutual Insurance Co., </em>327 Md. 418, 610 A.2d 286 (1992). According to St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Company, Zurich Insurance Company, and American Guarantee and Liability Insurance Company, the circuit court correctly entered judgment in their favor because their policies took effect after the manifestation of the City\u2019s damages in this case, and this is a \u201ctrigger of coverage\u201d question rather than a defense based on the concept of known loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We are persuaded that, while the \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d is an appropriate trigger of coverage rule for asbestos-in-building property damages, this trigger does not preclude coverage under subsequent policies when there is continued exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u201cTrigger is a legal rule designed to determine when a policy must respond.\u201d James M.

[Ajfter an injury ... it may be inferred ... that the harm actually began sometime earlier ... [and fjinally, the \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d theory holds that injury occurs at the time of exposure and the time of manifestation, but not necessarily during the intervening period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><em>Id., </em>138 N.J. at 449-51, 650 A.2d at 980-81 (citations, footnotes and internal quotations omitted). <em>See also Village of Morrisville Water &amp; Light Dept. v.

Law Rev. 220, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>222 (1994) (\u201cOgburn\u201d). According to the Michigan Supreme Court, reference to specific trigger paradigms \u201ccan be deceiving,\u201d because in the final analysis the court must apply policy language in particular factual contexts. <em>See Gelman Sciences, Inc. v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>456 Mich. 305, 317, 572 N.W.2d 617, 622 (1998); <em>Domtar, Inc. v. Niagara Fire Insurance Co., </em>563 N.W.2d 724, 733 (Minn. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">In <em>Harford County, </em>the Court of Appeals addressed the trigger of coverage question under a CGL policy in a case involving property damage resulting from environmental pollution. During the time period relevant to that litigation, the county operated five sanitary landfills. For a portion of that period, the county carried standard form CGL liability insurance to cover, <em>inter alia, </em>county liability for property damage claims arising out of the operation of the landfills. The county initially obtained \u201caccident\u201d policies, designed to respond to \u201caccidents which occurred during the policy period.\u201d The CGL policy was revised in 1966 by the National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters, so the policies offered to the county covered property damage on an \u201coccurrence\u201d basis. <em>Harford County, </em>327 Md. at 420-21 &amp; n. 1, 610 A.2d at 287 &amp; n. 1. The policies in question expired in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Upon discovering that seepage from the landfills contaminated underlying groundwater, the county sought a declaratory judgment that each insurer\u2019s policies provided coverage for property damage claims arising out of the seepage. The insurers moved for summary judgment on the ground that the county failed to establish that any damage due to the landfill seepage and resultant contamination had been sustained during the effective period of its policies. The circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of the insurer on the ground that any insurance coverage would be triggered upon the manifestation of damage, after the insurer\u2019s policies were no longer on the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">On appeal, the county argued that the \u201cmanifestation\u201d trigger of coverage theory utilized by the circuit court had been rejected by a number of jurisdictions, and that it was contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>to the rule established in <em>Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc. v. Maryland Casualty Company, </em>324 Md. 44, 595 A.2d 469 (1991). According to the county, a \u201ccontinuous\u201d trigger of coverage applied to the environmental property damage in that case, and insurance coverage was triggered \u201cin each period during which damage took place and not only when damage was discovered or became manifest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 610 A.2d at 292. The insurers argued \u201cmanifestation\u201d was the appropriate trigger theory for environmental claims, because there was no damage under the policies until damage was actually discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The Court of Appeals held that the circuit court erred in \u201climiting the trigger of coverage to the time of manifestation or discovery of the property damage,\u201d because \u201coccurrence\u201d CGL policies cover \u201cliability inducing events occurring during the policy term.\u201d <em>Harford County, </em>327 Md. at 435, 610 A.2d at 294. Recognizing the difficulty in determining precisely when the environmental harm causes property damage, the Court of Appeals concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201c[Manifestation\u201d is not the sole trigger of coverage in environmental pollution cases. Rather, ... coverage under the policies may be triggered during the policy period at a time earlier than the discovery or manifestation of the damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">H* H* *)*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">The burden to show that property damage occurred within the coverage of the policies is, of course, upon the insured. Whether at any time during the policy period the discharge of contaminants into the soil and underlying groundwater - is of sufficient gravity to prove detectable \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the policies\u2019 definition of that term is quite likely a matter for expert testimony. We decide nothing more in this case than that [the circuit court] was in error in limiting the trigger of coverage to the time of manifestation or discovery of the property damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 610 A.2d at 294-95; <footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <em>see also Bausch &amp; Lomb v.

According to George Tinker in his noted commentary on the CGL policy, \u201coccurrence\u201d is the \u201ckeystone to the total coverage structure.\u201d Tinker, <em>ante, </em>at 231. He emphasizes that the \u201crevised wording [of the 1973 CGL policy] should make clear that the definition encompasses not only the usual \u2018accident\u2019 but also the exposure to conditions which may continue over a long period of time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">According to the insurers, <em>Harford County </em>does not apply to their specific argument that the manifestation of damage occurs <em>prior </em>to the inception of a particular policy, so that policy does not obligate the insurer to indemnify for prior manifested damage.'<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We disagree. The continued presence of ACBMs in the buildings may cause continuous property damage during the coverage periods of policies that take effect subsequent to the moment that the City initially discovered the harmful effects of the asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">We reject trigger theories that are based exclusively on exposure t.o harm or the manifestation of injury. The \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d and \u201ccontinuous\u201d trigger theories are not mu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>tually exclusive, but instead may, in an appropriate circumstance be complimentary in the appropriate context. As noted by the United States District Court lor the Northern District of Ohio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">With one possible caveat, the appropriate trigger theory for this case is a continuous trigger rule that employs injury-in-fact as the initial triggering event.... The caveat ... is that in order to justify application of the continuous trigger rule, [the insured] has to show that the damage was continuing in nature, as opposed to one-shot or episodic. Otherwise, the policies will be triggered by injury-in-fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqh\"><em>GenCorp., Inc. v.

In <em>Joe Harden Builders, Inc. v.

We emphasize that expert testimony may be required to quantify, if possible, the nature and extent of continuing damage from asbestos. <em>See Harford County, </em>327 Md. at 436, 610 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>295. We hold only that the City is entitled to present evidence in support of its claim that the presence of asbestos has resulted in property damage that continued beyond the date on which the asbestos was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We therefore conclude that (1) in the case of long-term, continuous property damage due to the installation of ACBMs and the dynamics of the mineral\u2019s continued presence in the buildings' where it was installed, the manifestation trigger is not a correct basis for granting summary judgment to insurers whose policies took effect subsequent to the date on which the asbestos was discovered, and (2) in a claim that results from the presence of asbestos-containing materials in a building, continuous or progressive damage will constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the policy period that the asbestos remains in the City\u2019s buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Applying this holding to the case at bar, we shall vacate the summary judgment entered on the trigger of coverage question in favor of St. Paul, Zurich, and American Guarantee. We remand this matter to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with the above trigger of coverage analysis. On remand, the circuit court shall also consider the defense of known loss.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Even though the \u201cknown loss\u201d defense is closely related to the manifestation theory pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>pounded by the insurers, the circuit court must determine its applicability in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Allocation of Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Whether this case involves only an injury-in-fact trigger of coverage, or also involves the application of a continuous trigger, we must determine which policies, to what extent, and in which sequence, are applicable to the damages at issue. These are questions of allocation of indemnity liability among the various policies implicated, and of exhaustion. These issues come before us by way of the City\u2019s appeal from the summary judgment entered in favor of Federal Insurance Company (\u201cFederal\u201d), which provided Croker with excess liability insurance coverage for the period from July 31, 1984 up to and including May 1, 1985. Pursuant to this policy, Federal agreed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">to pay on behalf of the insured LOSS resulting from any occurrence insured by the terms and provisions of the First UNDERLYING INSURANCE policy scheduled in Item 6 of the Declarations (except for the Limits of Liability and defense provisions, if any). The insurance afforded by this policy shall apply only in excess of and after the UNDERLYING INSURANCE (as scheduled in Item 6 of the Declarations) has been exhausted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Federal Excess Liability Policy No. 7929-20-01.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The first underlying policy was issued to Croker by St. Paul, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>presented limits of $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in an annual aggregate. The Federal excess policy provided for indemnity in the amount of 100 percent of the loss in excess of the underlying insurance up to $8,000,000 per occurrence and $8,000,000 as an annual aggregate.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Federal Insurance Company moved for summary judgment on the basis that \u201cthe City has not demonstrated that Federal\u2019s policy for the period July 31, 1984 through May 1, 1985 has been triggered or is capable of being reached and cannot establish that property damage, if any, occurred during Federal\u2019s policy period.\u201d The thrust of Federal\u2019s argument is that the numerous first-level and other underlying policies would necessarily respond before Federal\u2019s second-tier excess policy would be obligated to answer to Croker\u2019s liabilities. Federal argues that indemnification made pursuant to these underlying policies would cancel the full liability amount to which the City would be entitled pursuant to its settlement with Croker.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">Judge Strausberg granted Federal\u2019s motion, explaining: Federal asserts that the City cannot prove that more than the primary policy amount (which is either $2 million or $2.5 million) of property damage occurred during the applicable term of the Federal policy, July 31, 1984, to May 1, 1985. Generally, an excess carrier has no liability until the primary policy is exhausted. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>52 Md.App. 269, 271-2 [447 A.2d 896] (1982). It is significant that Federal\u2019s excess policy would not come into play unless there was a judgment of at least $2 million. That the damages during the applicable period of Federal\u2019s policy would exceed the primary coverage and trigger the excess coverage is questionable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">City\u2019s reliance on <em>North American Philips Corp. v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>565 A.2d 956 (Del.Super.1989) is misplaced. While that case dealt with potential liability in excess carriers, it was in the context of whether or not there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>was a justiciable controversy in a declaratory judgment action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Memorandum Opinion at 30 (May 16, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On appeal, the City argues that the court\u2019s own language underscores the factual uncertainty of whether the Federal policy would be reached\u2014a question of material fact in the City\u2019s view. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of Federal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> We hold that (1) the obligation to indemnify the insured under the circumstances of this case, which involves continuing asbestos product property damage, is to be prorated among all carriers based on their time on the risk, (2) the \u201cjoint and several\u201d or \u201call sums\u201d allocation method is incompatible with the injury-in-fact/continuing trigger that is applicable to the case at bar, (3) an insured who elects not to carry liability insurance for a period of time, either by electing to be self-insured, or by purchasing a policy which withholds coverage pursuant to a particular exclusion, as in the case of the products hazard exclusions found in this case, will be liable for the prorated share that corresponds to periods of self-insurance or no coverage, and (4) the concept of \u201chorizontal exhaustion\u201d is applicable in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We take this approach because it conforms with the realities of long term property damage resulting from asbestos in buildings, and the application of the injury in fact/continuous trigger of coverage. With respect to the horizontal exhaustion issue, the City as a party that steps into the place of the insured, must exhaust all primary insurance before seeking indemnity from excess insurers. Excess insurance will come into play if and only if the underlying policies have been exhausted, i.e., only after the primary carriers, or self-insurers, have fulfilled their respective obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">In <em>Keene Corporation v. Insurance Company of North America, </em>215 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 667 F.2d 1034 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1007, 102 S.Ct. 1644, 1645, 71 L.Ed.2d 875 (1982), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered a case in which it was likely that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>coverage from more than one insurer would be triggered, and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">The only logical resolution of this issue is for Keene to be able to collect from any insurer whose coverage is triggered, the full amount of indemnity that it is due, subject only to the provisions in the policies that govern the allocation of liability when more than one policy covers an injury. That is the only way that Keene can be assured the security that it purchased with each policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">215 U.S.App.D.C. at 172, 667 F.2d at 1050.

[T]here is no logic to support the notion that one single insurance policy among 20 or 30 years worth of policies could be expected to be held liable for the entire time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-6\"><em>Public Service Company of Colorado v. Wallis and Companies, </em>986 P.2d 924, 940 (Colo.1999). To compress long-term damage of a continuing nature into a single policy period, which would effectively be called for under the \u201cjoint and several\u201d or \u201call sums\u201d approach, is \u201cintuitively suspect.\u201d <em>Olin Corp. v.

Con Edison concedes that it is impossible to determine the extent of the property damage that is the result of an occurrence in a particular policy period. Indeed, its theory of the case was that while the plant was in operation\u2014long before any of the policies were issued\u2014 there were leaks, spills and drips that eventually migrated to the groundwater. Con Edison planned to establish that the dispersion of the pollutants was a gradual, continuous process, thus creating an inference that there was an accident or occurrence during each and every policy period, though there is no evidence of an accident during any particular policy period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Con Edison wants to combine, this uncertainty-based approach, which implicates many successive policies, with an entitlement to choose a particular policy for indemnity. Yet collecting all the indemnity from a particular policy presupposes ability to pin an accident to a particular policy period (see <em>Sybron Transition Corp.[ v. Security Ins. of Hartford], </em>258 F.3d [595] at 601 [ (2001) ]; <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>138 N.J. at 465 [650 A.2d 974]). Although more than one policy may be implicated by a gradual harm <em>(see e.g. McGroarty v. Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>36 N.Y.2d 358, 365 [368 N.Y.S.2d 485, 329 N.E.2d 172]), joint and several allocation ' is hot consistent with the language of the policies providing indemnification for \u201call sums\u201d of liability that resulted from an accident or occurrence <em>\u201cduring the policy period </em>\u201d (see <em>Olin Corp., </em>221 F.3d 307, 323).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">Pro rata allocation under these facts, while not explicitly mandated by the policies, is consistent with the language of the policies. Most fundamentally, the policies provide indemnification for liability incurred as a result of an accident or occurrence during the policy period, not outside that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>period <em>(see Forty-Eight Insulations, Inc., </em>633 F.2d at 1224). Con Edison\u2019s singular focus on \u201call sums\u201d would read this important qualification out of the policies. Proration of liability among the insurers acknowledges the fact that there is uncertainty as to what actually transpired during any particular policy period <em>(see Sybron Transition Corp., </em>258 F.3d at 602).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><em>Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. v.

Within the context of the allocation and exhaustion methods as applied to the primary policies, each excess carrier would look to whether the coverage of the underlying policy was exhausted before responding. <em>See Community Redevelopment Agency, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at 340 n. 6, 57 Cal.Rptr.2d at 761 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Because the allocation will be based on the time on the risk, some primary policies that provide less coverage will be exhausted sooner than others, and their excess insurers, if any, would accordingly have to respond at an earlier point.

Our Court of Appeals recently decided <em>Megonnell v. United States Automobile Ass'n, </em>368 Md. 633, 796 A.2d 758 (2002). The Court there held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the excess coverage section of an umbrella automobile liability policy was required to drop down to indemnify for liability to a family member that was excluded from coverage under the primary policy by a household exclusion. The Court explained that while the household exclusion removed the loss in question from the primary policy, the umbrella's excess section did not \"follow form,\u201d and thus did not have the benefits of the household exclusion. The Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">[I]n order for the excess coverage to be \"follow form\" from the primary policy, thereby making the household exclusion applicable, there would, at the least, need to be a conspicuous, clear and express clause that incorporated the exclusions of the primary policy into the umbrella policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 657, 796 A.2d at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\"><em>Megonnell </em>does not require us to re-examine our disposition of any issues in this case. The issue is not squarely raised, but we note it in passing because this litigation will continue. We have examined the brief excess policy issued by Federal, and are satisfied that it is a \"follow form\" instrument. The Federal policy reads in part that Federal \"agrees to pay on behalf of the insured LOSS resulting from any occurrence insured by the terms and provisions of the First UNDERLYING INSURANCE[J\u201d This is not an academic exercise, because the presence of products exclusions in the primary policies in this litigation may tempt a party seeking indemnification to look to excess policies that may have been carelessly drafted so as not to \"follow form,\u201d and thus not benefit from the exclusion. <em>See Megonnell. </em>We do note some disapproval of the concept that pure excess policies be required to drop down to primary levels. As stated by the Fifth Circuit in a slightly different context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">[I]t is logical to assume that affordable and socially desirable catastrophic insurance would be difficult to obtain ... if we were loosely to allow transformation of umbrella policies because of boilerplate \"other insurance\u201d clauses in primary policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-10\"><em>Truehart v.
