Thompson, Jr., presiding) found that Elkton Care Center Associates Limited Partnership t/a Medpointe (Medpointe), appellant, breached its contract with Quality Care Management, Inc. (QCM), appellee. Appellant argues that it is entitled to a new trial and, in support of that argument, presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">1. Whether the inadvertent disclosure during discovery of a memorandum containing communications protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>trine constituted a waiver of Medpointe\u2019s right to claim said protections at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">2. Whether the trial court\u2019s decision, over Medpointe\u2019s objections, to permit the jury to hear evidence of communications protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine was harmless error?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Appellant constructed a nursing home in Elkton, Maryland and on June 27, 1994, entered into a Nursing Center Management Agreement with appellee. The agreement, which provided that appellee would manage the nursing home for an initial term of three years, included the following \u201ctermination\u201d clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">11. Termination. The Owner shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and the employment of the Manager, and except as to liabilities or claims which shall have accrued or arisen prior to such termination, all obligations hereunder shall cease upon the happenings of any of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">(1) If the Manager files ... bankruptcy....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">(2) By the taking of the entire or a substantial portion of the Facility, or its services, through lawful condemnation proceedings by any governmental authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-12\">(3) The loss by the Owner ... due to its default on any mortgage or other obligation, or by operation of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-13\">(4) .... substantial damage or destruction of the Facility by fire or other casualty ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-14\">(5) The giving of written notice by either party or the other if a party has been grossly negligent in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, failure to obtain the initial operation license for the Facility or causing the Facility to be in danger of losing its operating license, although State and/or Federal deficiencies including, but not limited to, fast track impositions, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>not in and of themselves uncommon nor decisive indication of negligence on the part of Q.C.M., or qualification as a health care provider for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement purposes) and such notice sets forth the details of such alleged breach, and the defaulting party shall not, within thirty (30) days after the mailing of such notice, have cured such breach, or if such breach is of a nature that it cannot be cured within such (30) day period have commenced and at all times thereafter have diligently proceeded with all acts required to cause such breach. Any such termination shall be without prejudice, however, to any and all rights and remedies of the non-defaulting party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">(6) Failure to maintain 85% occupancy after twenty-four (24) months of operation if directly and unequivocally due to gross negligence on the part of Q.C.M-....... \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">(7) At the completion of the first twenty-four month period of operation Owner shall review the past twenty-four (24) months performance of the Manager.

Net income before taxes at the end'-of the first twenty four (24) months operatibnal period shall be within the parameters of the Budgets of the Facility as determined by the public accounting firm specializing in long term care reimbursement and as agreed upon- by both Owner and Q.C.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1z\">If budgeted goals are \u2019not met due to unforeseen events which were not directly the fault of Q.C.M., Q.C.M. shall not be considered negligent, such as but not limited to a reduction in Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Q.C.M. makes no guarantees that operational and economic goals will be obtained although the intent of Q.C.M. is to attain and/or exceed Budget and Owner expectations. (8) The sale of the property by the Owner....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">-During the third year the Manager will be paid his fee through the date of termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In November of 1996, appellant terminated its agreement with appellee pursuant to Paragraph 11(7) of the Nursing Center Management Agreement. In April of 1998, appellee sued appellant for \u201cwrongful termination\u201d of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">During the discovery phase of this case, pursuant to a request for document production, a lawyer in the firm that was then representing appellant produced a box that contained a number of documents. It was agreed that (1) appellee\u2019s counsel would examine the documents in the box and identify which documents they wanted copied, and (2) appellant\u2019s counsel would make, and deliver to appellee\u2019s counsel, a copy of each document that had been \u201ctabbed\u201d by appellee\u2019s counsel. Included among these documents was a memorandum from a lawyer to Mr. Willits, the president of Medpointe, who had retained that lawyer\u2019s firm to determine what defenses would be available to appellant if appellee filed a wrongful termination action. This memorandum was expressly designated as \u201cATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT PREPARED IN ANTICIPATION OF LITIGATION.\u201d The memorandum was tabbed by appellee\u2019s counsel, and a copy was later forwarded to appellee\u2019s counsel along with copies of other tabbed documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">At trial, appellant\u2019s trial counsel called Mr. Willits, who testified as follows during his direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">Q. And what I\u2019d like to do is to cut right to the chaff [sic], if I could. I\u2019d like you to point the ladies and gentleman of the jury to the section of the contract that Medpointe relies upon in terminating its management contract with OCM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axt\">A.

What portions of that section of the contract does Medpointe rely upon in saying that it had the unequivocal right to terminate the agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">A. The portion re[sic]lied upon\u2014two, first one A and B. QCM did not meet their operational goals, nor did they meet their economic goals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">Q. How is it that they did not meet their operational goals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">A. They didn\u2019t have a trained staff that maintained a quality of health care consistent with state and federal regulations. Additionally, they didn\u2019t have a trained staff that maximized the reimbursement rates for Medicare; and their trained staff was not capable, according to the state, of providing in-house education for the employees of Medpointe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentleman of the jury how is it they failed to meet their economic goals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">A. The economic goals were established by the budget projections of May of '94, which the did not come close to meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\">Q. Now you say their budget, projections, what are you referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-14\">A. The projections that were prepared by Wolpoff &amp; Company in May of '94, they are an exhibit, because I\u2019ve seen them before in these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-15\">Q. In that October-November 1996 time frame when the management contract is terminated, can you give the ladies and gentleman of the jury \u00e1 sense of what the economic or financial condition of the facility was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-16\">A. The facility had a loss of approximately $800,000, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArL\">THE COURT: What period are we talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: October\u2014November 1996 time period that\u2014the contract termination time period.

The facility had a loss of some $800,000, and we were maximized on our\u2014maximized on our line of credit to something in excess of a million dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The following transpired during Mr. Willits\u2019 cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Isn\u2019t it true that it wasn\u2019t until after March of 1997 when [the] lawyer [retained by MedPointe\u2019s principal owner] told you that you had breached the contract by improperly terminating it, that you first came up with the excuse that you testified to today? [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">THE COURT: Approach the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">THE COURT:.... Have you all discussed this yet? Has everybody knew this was coming?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, no, judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">THE COURT: Where did it come from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: They produced it in their documents. We tabbed it. They copied it. They sent it to us. I intend to use it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I have no idea. I am not calling him a liar. I just have no idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">THE COURT: You better get together and discuss this ... you might have a waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">A luncheon recess occurred at this point. The following transpired when the proceedings resumed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-15\">THE COURT: ... How did you get this, by requesting documents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-16\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: We filed a request for production of documents, that was responded to; we went over, we inspected the documents. It was among them. We said we want a copy, I think, of everything\u2014or did you just tab it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>[APPELLEE\u2019S CO-COUNSEL]: Your Honor, there was a\u2014we got about a half full box, bankers box of documents that the other side produced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">THE COURT: From whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S CO-COUNSEL]: From the law firm representing the [appellant], and I tabbed the documents.

I showed them to [appellee\u2019s counsel] when I got them, and that\u2019s what she wrote.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The following transpired after Judge Thompson decided that appellee\u2019s counsel could use the memorandum during Mr. Willits\u2019 cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Mr. Willits[,][sic] in March of 1997[,][sic] four months after you terminated [the operator\u2019s] contract or his company\u2019s contract[,][sic] you sought advise from a law firm in Carroll County or Baltimore ...

The attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine are separate and distinct. <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 406, 718 A.2d 1129 (1998). For purposes of this appeal, however, whether inadvertent disclosure constituted a waiver does not depend upon which privilege is asserted. \u201cWhen the disclosure is made to the adverse party, ... the distinction between waiver of attorney client privilege and of work product immunity disappears.\u201d <em>Hartford Fire Insurance v. Garvey, </em>109 F.R.D. 323, 328 (N.D.Cal.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has decided the issue of whether the attorney-client privilege is waived by the inadvertent disclosure of a document protected by that privilege.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dean Wigmore took the position that <em>any </em>disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>causes a loss of protection. <em>See 8 </em>Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2325 at 633 (McNaughton rev.1961). Following Wigmore, some courts have adopted the \u201cstrict test\u201d or \u201cwaiver\u201d test, under which an inadvertent disclosure constitutes a waiver of the privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Some courts have adopted the \u201clenient\u201d or \u201cno waiver\u201d test, under which the attorney\u2019s negligence cannot waive the privilege because the client, and not the attorney, is the holder of the privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Professors Mueller and Kirkpatrick have criticized these inflexible positions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">Courts are divided on whether the attorney-client privilege is lost by accidental or inadvertent disclosure. Usually inadvertent or accidental disclosure happens when a privileged document is released during discovery, and in this .setting there are three primary views on the question whether privilege protection continues. Modern courts generally reject Wigmore\u2019s wooden and mechanical view that any unprivileged disclosure waives the privilege, but some modern courts take a pretty strict'position on this point. They hold that the privilege is waived by any unprivileged disclosure that is voluntary, even though made inadvertently and without intent to waive. A second view is very nearly at the opposite end of the spectrum, and it holds that the privilege is waived only where the disclosing party actually intended to waive it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">A third intermediate view sensibly holds that the question whether disclosure during discovery results in loss of privilege protection depends very much on the circumstances, and the issue should be resolved by looking mostly to three factors: First is the degree of care apparently exercised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the claimant. Second is the presence of extenuating circumstances, the most obvious being the press of massive discovery going forward under the pressure of deadlines, where even caution in producing documents is likely to generate occasional mistakes. Third is the behavior of the privilege claimant in taking remedial steps after disclosing material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATN\">Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 5.29 at 450-52 (4th ed.1995) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We agree with Professors Mueller and Kirkpatrick, and with those courts that have adopted an \u201cintermediate\u201d (or \u201cmiddle\u201d) test, under which the court makes a fact specific case-by-case analysis to determine whether the privilege has been waived.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The courts that use this approach examine the following factors: \u201c(1) the reasonableness of the precautions taken to prevent inadvertent disclosure in view of the extent of the document production; (2) the number of inadvertent disclosures; (3) the extent of the disclosure; (4) any delay and measures taken to rectify the disclosure; and (5) whether the overriding interests of justice would or would not be served by relieving a party of its error.\u201d <em>See Sampson Fire Sales v. Oaks, </em>201 F.R.D., 351, 360 (M.D.Pa.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We are persuaded that neither the lenient test nor the strict test is as fair as the intermediate test,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the intermediate test is consistent with Court of Appeals\u2019 precedent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">The attorney-client privilege is not absolute and \u201cis not an inviolable seal upon the attorney\u2019s lips.\u201d <em>Pitney-Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre, </em>86 F.R.D. 444, 446 (S.D.Fl.1980)(citing <em>Laughner v. U.S., </em>373 F.2d 326, 327 (5th Cir.1967)). Invo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>cation of the privilege can create evidentiary inequities between parties during discovery and the absence of fact and truth at trial. \u201cBecause the application of the attorney-client privilege withholds relevant information from the fact finder, the privilege contains some limitations and should be narrowly construed.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 Md. at 415, 718 A.2d 1129. Only the client has the power to waive the attorney-client privilege. <em>See City of College Park v. Cotter, </em>309 Md. 573, 591, 525 A.2d 1059 (1987). Nonetheless, express and implied waivers of the privilege are universally recognized limitations on client power to hold the privilege. <em>See Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 137-38, 345 A.2d 830.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><em>Parler &amp; Wobber v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>359 Md. 671, 690-92, 756 A.2d 526 (2000) (parallel citations omitted). Applying the intermediate test to the facts of this case, in which the inadvertent disclosure occurred during pre-trial discovery, but was not brought to Judge Thompson\u2019s attention until (in the words of appellant\u2019s brief) \u201cthe penultimate day of trial,\u201d we conclude that the inadvertent disclosure constituted a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In most inadvertent disclosure cases, at least one factor is closely related to another factor. The case at bar is no exception. Factors one, two and <em>three\u2014the reasonableness of precautions taken to prevent inadvertent disclosure, the number of inadvertent disclosures, </em>and <em>the extent of the dis</em>closure\u2014all strongly favor waiver. Here, the privileged document was inadvertently included in a half-full box of documents produced by a lawyer who was then representing appellant. Appellee\u2019s counsel tabbed that document, along with others, and returned all of the tabbed documents to the lawyer then representing appellant, who arranged to have the tabbed documents copied and delivered to appellee\u2019s counsel. Thus, on two occasions during the pretrial discovery phase of this case, counsel then representing appellant had the opportunity to assert the attorney-client privilege with respect to the memorandum at issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is not a case in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>hundreds of boxes and/or thousands of documents were produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Factor four, <em>any delay and measures taken to rectify the disclosure, </em>also strongly favors waiver. Had this issue been brought to Judge Thompson\u2019s attention prior to trial, (1) Judge Thompson could have entered an <em>in limine </em>order that would have prohibited appellee\u2019s counsel from making any use of the memorandum unless and until appellant introduced evidence that \u201copened the door\u201d to its use,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) appellant\u2019s defense would have focused on its right to terminate the contract rather than on its reasons for doing so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In light of Mr. Willits\u2019 direct examination, factor live, <em>whether the overriding interests of justice would or would, not be served by relieving the party of its error, </em>also strongly favors waiver. The inadvertent disclosure in the case at bar constitutes a waiver of the attorney-client and attorney work product privileges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\n<em>Introduction of the Memorandum has a Waiver of Appellant\u2019s objection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Appellee argues that appellant waived its objection by introducing the entire memorandum into evidence; We disagree. In <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Smulyan, </em>41 Md.App. 202, 397 A.2d 198 (1979), this Court rejected the contention that responding to evidence admitted over objection constitutes a waiver of the objection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">We do not, and, of course, may not, depart from the oft-stated rule that an objection to evidence may be deemed waived if the same evidence is permitted to come in subsequently without objection. <em>See, for example, State Roads Comm. v. Bare, </em>220 Md. 91, 151 A.2d 154 (1959). However, there are some practical limits to what counsel must do, or refrain from doing, in order to preserve the objection. When a party makes a clear objection to specific evidence and that objection is plainly overruled, he is not required to play the ostrich and simply ignore the evidence, or its potential effect upon his case, for fear of losing his ground for appeal. He may cross-examine (or, in this instance, re-directly examine) the witness about the evidence, <em>Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 144, 202 A.2d 585 (1964), and make other reasonable efforts to show that the evidence, admitted over his objection, should nevertheless be discounted or disregarded by the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 219, 397 A.2d 198. In the case at bar,' appellant\u2019s counsel objected on nine separate occasions and was granted a continuing objection. After appellee\u2019s counsel cross-examined Mr. Willits about the negative portions of the memorandum, appellant\u2019s counsel elected to introduce the entire memorandum into evidence. Under these circumstances, in which it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>clear that appellant\u2019s trial counsel introduced the memorandum in an attempt to counter the impact caused by appellee\u2019s use of the memorandum, appellant did not waive its objection to appellee\u2019s use of the memorandum during the cross-examination of Mr. Willits.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\">.
