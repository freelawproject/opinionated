THIEME, Jr., Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">Retired, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Appellants were plaintiffs in two medical malpractice actions that were filed against defendants in the Circuit Courts for Baltimore City and Wicomico County. The complaints alleged negligence against Peninsula Regional Medical Center (PRMC), Floyd Gray, M.D., a doctor with PRMC, and the Johns Hopkins Medical Center for malpractice in the diagnosis and treatment of complications surrounding the late L\u00e1veme Sterling\u2019s pregnancy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaints alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Johns Hopkins Medical Center was negligent in transferring Ms. Sterling from PRMC to Johns Hopkins Hospital in her unstable condition and that this negligent act contributed to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The actions against Dr. Gray and PRMC were settled, after \u25a0 summary judgment motions filed by those parties were denied, leaving Johns Hopkins as the sole remaining defendant. On July 22, 1999, Hopkins had filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, asserting as its principal ground for relief the absence of a physician-patient relationship between , its physician and Ms. Sterling. A hearing on the motion was convened, and after argument and consideration of the pleadings, the circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of Hopkins, denied appellants\u2019 Motions for Reconsideration on March 27, 2000, and appellants noted this appeal on April 20, 2001. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Md.Code (1974 and 1998 RepLVol.) \u00a7\u00a7 12-301, 12-308 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Issue on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">On appeal, appellants ask us to determine whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the appellee, Johns Hopkins Hospital. We affirm the circuit court and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">On August 2, 1993, L\u00e1veme Sterling was admitted to the PRMC. At the time she was 32.6 weeks pregnant and her personal physician recommended admission to the hospital due to borderline blood pressure and the presence of protein in her urine (proteinuria). Ms. Sterling also presented with edema (swelling due to fluid retention), hypertension, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>On August 3rd, Ms. Sterling came under the care and treatment of Dr. Floyd E. Gray. By this time, her condition had deteriorated and she had developed hematuria (blood in the urine) and bleeding in her mouth. Dr. Gray ordered labwork and a CT scan of the abdomen. Dr. Gray rendered a presumptive diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia and a potential HELLP syndrome.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of the initial diagnosis, Dr. Gray ordered a magnesium-sulfate intravenous infusion for Ms. Sterling. The diagnoses of severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome were later confirmed around 12:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Due to this confirmation, Dr. Gray contacted the Emergency Medical Resource Center (EMRC) to arrange for the transfer of Ms. Sterling to another hospital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The transfer was deemed necessary because PRMC did not have a neonatal intensive care unit at this time and there was concern that Ms. Sterling\u2019s condition might require a premature delivery of the child. EMRC informed Dr. Gray that Hopkins was the perinatal referral center that he should contact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Upon being connected with Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Gray spoke with Dr. Erica Leventhal, a Hopkins resident. Dr. Gray informed Dr. Leventhal of Sterling\u2019s symptoms (hypertension, hematuria, proteinuria, elevated liver enzymes, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting) and informed Dr. Leventhal that he had placed Sterling on a magnesium sulfate drip.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Dr. Leventhal conveyed this information to the attending physician, Dr. Adib Khouzami. Dr. Khouzami, in turn, telephoned Dr. Gray at approximately 1:10 p.m. During the conversation, it was decided that Sterling would be transferred to Hopkins through the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services System (MIEMSS) perinatal referral program. According to MIEMSS protocol, Dr. Gray informed Dr. Khouzami that Sterling was diagnosed as having severe pre-eclampsia, was receiving magnesium sulfate, and was also diagnosed as having HELLP syndrome due to her hematuria and bleeding. Dr. Gray also conveyed Sterling\u2019s laboratory test results. Dr. Khouzami recorded this information on the Hopkins Maternal Transport Log. Having determined that Hopkins had the resources available to care for Sterling, it was agreed that she be transferred to the hospital by ambulance, in compliance with MIEMSS procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Dr. Gray thereafter arranged for the transportation of Sterling to Hopkins through a local ambulance company. Sterling\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate during this interval. At approximately 3:00 p.m., while en route to Hopkins, Sterling became unresponsive. The ambulance was diverted to Memorial Hospital in Easton, Maryland, where it was discovered that Sterling had suffered an intraventricular hem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>orrhage. An emergency cesarean section was performed at Easton Memorial Hospital to deliver Sterling\u2019s infant daughter. Sterling was airlifted to the University of Maryland where she died on August 5th as a result of the hemorrhage.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">This litigation ensued. Before trial in this matter, the defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Johns Hopkins asserted its entitlement to summary judgment because its representative physician, Dr. Khouzami, did not have a physician/patient relationship with Laverne Sterling. Maintaining that this predicate for the hospital\u2019s legal duty to the decedent was absent, it contended that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Appellants maintain that Dr. Khouzami established a physician-patient relationship, and that, as a result, Hopkins had a legal duty toward Ms. Sterling such that it must answer for its negligence. They contest the entry of summary judgment against them, asserting that the question of whether Hopkins owed a duty of care to Ms. Sterling constitutes a genuine issue of material fact. Appellants further aver that a physician-patient relationship was established under the facts of this case, and insist that \u201cface-to-face\u201d contact between a doctor and patient is not a necessary prerequisite for the establishment of the legal relationship between physician and patient. In this case appellants also assert that they have raised genuine issues of material facts that must be resolved at trial, and contend that, as a result, summary judgment would be inappropriate in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2-501(a). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court must view the facts, including all inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the opposing party. <em>Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding Co., </em>362 Md. 661, 676, 766 A.2d 617, 621 (2001). \u201c <em>\u2018A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>material fact is a fact the resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 227, 783 A.2d 206, 209 (2001) (quoting <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608, 614 (1985)). The moving party bears the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). We are mindful that, as Judge Smith observed in <em>Porter v. General Boiler Casing Co., </em>284 Md. 402, 396 A.2d 1090 (1979), \u201cif [the] facts are susceptible of more than one permissible inference, the choice between those inferences should not be made as a matter of law[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 396 A.2d at 1096 (quoting <em>Fenwick Motor Co. v. Fenwick, </em>258 Md. 134, 138; 265 A.2d 256; 258 (1970)). But where there is no dispute as to any <em>material fact presented, </em>summary judgment is appropriate to resolve purely legal questions. <em>See, e.g., Hobbs v. Teledyne Movible Offshore, Inc., </em>632 F.2d 1238, 1240 (5th Cir. Unit A 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We exercise plenary review over the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant'summary judgment. <em>See generally Lippert, </em>366 Md. at 227, 783 A.2d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">General Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u2022 \u25a0 \u25a0 I. : '</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u201cThe general principles which ordinarily govern in negligence cases also apply in medical malpractice claims.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Shilkret v. Annapolis Emergency Hospital Association, </em>276 Md. 187, 190, 349 A.2d 245, 247 (1975). The Court of Appeals has recently rehearsed the elements for negligence in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">In order to establish a claim for negligence under Maryland law, a party must prove four elements: \u201c(1) that the defendant was under a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, (2) that the defendant breached that duty, (3) that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss and (4) that the loss or injury proximately resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em>Grimes v. Kennedy Krieger Institute, Inc., </em>366 Md. 29, 85, 782 A.2d 807, 841 (2001) (footnote and emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, </em>335 Md. 58, 76, 642 A.2d 180, 188 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The threshold element is the question of whether the defendant owes a legal duty towards the injured party. Assuming the existence of this element, a plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for medical negligence by proving \u201c(1) the applicable standard of care; (2) that this standard has been violated; and (3) that this violation caused the complained of harm.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 354, 749 A.2d 174, 180, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Kishel v. Jacobs, </em>359 Md. 669, 755 A.2d 1140 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The duty of care owed to an individual in the medical context is based primarily on the existence of the physician-patient relationship. As stated by Judge Karwaeki, commenting in a general negligence case in <em>Valentine v. On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 727 A.2d 947 (1999), \u201c[ijnherent ... in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>concept of duty is the concept of a relationship between the parties out of which the duty arises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551, 727 A.2d at 950. We said in <em>Miller v. Schaefer, </em>80 Md.App. 60, 559 A.2d 813 (1989), <em>aff'd, </em>322 Md. 297, 587 A.2d 491 (1991), that \u201c[bjefore a physician may be found liable for an act of medical malpractice, it is essential that a patient-physician relationship be in existence at the time the alleged act occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 559 A.2d at 819. It is a basic principle of law that, with the exception of circumstances where a doctor acts gratuitously or in an emergency situation, recovery for malpractice is permitted only when a physician-patient relationship has been established, and that there has been a \u201cbreach of professional duty to the patient.\u201d <em>Dingle v. Belin, </em>358 Md. 354, 367, 749 A.2d 157, 164 (2000) (quoting <em>Hoover v. Williamson, </em>236 Md. 250, 253-254, 203 A.2d 861, 862 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Maryland has recognized that the existence, of a duty constitutes a legal determination. The Court of Appeals in <em>Valentine </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">Generally, whether there is adequate proof of the required elements needed to succeed in a negligence action is a question of fact to be determined by the fact finder; but, the existence of a legal duty is a question of law to be decided by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">353 Md. at 549, 727 A.2d at 949; <em>see also Davis v. Johns Hopkins Hospital, </em>330 Md. 53, 64, 622 A.2d 128, 133-34 (1993). Other jurisdictions are in accord. <em>See, e.g., Irvin v. Smith, </em>272 Kan. 112, -, 31 P.3d 934, 942 (2001); <em>Adams v.

Appellants contend that a physician-patient relationship was established between Johns Hopkins Hospital and L\u00e1veme Sterling. Indeed, we acknowledge that both Maryland law and the law of other jurisdictions recognize the creation of such a relationship absent an express contract between the physician and patient. Appellants, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ever, farther assert that this Court should find a physician-patient relationship under the facts of this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">It is beyond cavil that a physician-patient relationship may be created through an implied contract. This Court, in <em>Miller v. Schaefer, </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">The relationship between a physician and patient may result from an express or implied contract, either general or special, and the rights and liabilities of the parties thereto are governed by the general law of contract, although the existence of the relation does not need to rest on any express contract between the physician and person treated. However, the voluntary acceptance of the physician-patient relationship by the affected parties creates a prima facie presumption of a contractual relationship between them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANS\"><em>Miller v. Schaefer, </em>80 Md.App. at 73-74, 559 A.2d at 819 (footnotes omitted) (quoting 61 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Physicians, Surgeons, Etc., </em>\u00a7 158 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\"><em>Miller </em>does not dictate the results sought by appellants in this case, but articulates in general the rule as to the creation of the physician-patient relationship. We went on to hold in <em>Miller </em>that a contractual relationship between the parties arose when the patient accepted the physician\u2019s diagnosis and advice on the proper course of treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 559 A.2d at 820. This relationship thus created a duty on behalf of the physician to treat the patient properly, as well as a duty to inform the patient as to the procedure to be used and risks involved. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Appellants\u2019 Cases: <em>McKinney and Wheeler</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u25a0 Appellants rely on two cases from other jurisdictions, which closely resemble the facts before us, to urge that we rule that a physician-patient relationship existed between Ms. Sterling and the appellees, thus leading to the conclusion that Hopkins owed a duty of care to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">In <em>Wheeler v. Yettie Kersting Memorial Hospital, </em>866 S.W.2d 32 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, no writ), the patient, Mrs. Wheeler, then eight months pregnant, contacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to transport her to John Sealy Hospital, located 90 miles away in Galveston.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The EMTs first took her to the Yettie Kersting Memorial Hospital in Liberty, Texas, the nearest medical facility, for an assessment to determine whether she could safely travel to John Sealy. One of the EMTs was doubtful about Mrs. Wheeler\u2019s chances of making the journey without giving birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Upon her arrival at Yettie Kersting, Mrs. Wheeler was assessed by two nurses. Their findings were communicated by telephone to Dr. Rodriguez, an on-call general practitioner with staff privileges. The nurses also telephoned John Sealy Hospital and communicated the information to an unidentified doctor there. That doctor instructed them to transport the patient \u201con her side\u201d to John Sealy. Dr. Rodriguez approved the transfer. Both EMT technicians expressed concern about the journey, but were instructed by a nurse to \u201cput the patient in the ambulance, turn on the lights and sirens and go.\u201d 866 S.W.2d at 35. During the course of the trip, there was a breech birth, and the baby died.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Mrs. Wheeler subsequently brought suit against both hospitals and the staff of Yettie Kersting. The hospitals subsequently moved for summary judgment and the trial court granted the motion on all causes of action. The case eventually was presented to the First District Court of Appeals in Houston on the basis of certain counts disposed of in summary judgment. One such issue concerned the relationship that existed between Dr. Rodriguez and the appellant. In concluding that a physician-patient relationship existed between the parties, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">Dr. Rodriguez was not asked, nor did he refuse to come in to examine the patient. Instead, he was asked to evaluate certain information and make a medical decision ... [H]e willingly agreed to do so. We conclude that in evaluating the status of Mrs. Wheeler\u2019s labor and giving his approval, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>[Dr. Rodriguez] established a doctor-patient relationship with Mrs. Wheeler and accepted the duties which flow from such a relationship, specifically the duty to comply with the applicable standard of care for a physician in an on-call capacity at a rural hospital in transferring an obstetrical patient to a distant facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The Court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">It is axiomatic that a doctor-patient relationship may arise from, briefly exist, and be limited by the unique circumstances presented in a transfer situation. Otherwise, a hospital\u2019s requirement for physician approval of patient transfers would require the patient to subject herself to the physician\u2019s medical decision whether to transfer her without imposing any obligation on the physician to make that decision in a responsible manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\"><em>Id. </em>n. 6. The Court of Appeals reversed the summary judgment that had been entered in favor of Dr. Rodriguez on the basis that no physician-patient relationship had existed. 866 S.W.2d at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Appellants also advance as support for their position the opinion from the Ohio Court of Appeals in <em>McKinney v. Schlatter, </em>118 Ohio App.3d 328, 692 N.E.2d 1045 (1997), to propose that a physician-patient relationship be created by implication under the circumstances found here. The Ohio Court of Appeals determined that the \u201clack of direct contact\u201d between patient and doctor does not preclude the establishment of a physician-patient relationship. It established a three-part test to gauge whether such a relationship would come into existence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">We therefore hold, and in doing so are mindful that we are elaborating in the field of medical malpractice, that a physician-patient relationship can exist by implication between an emergency room patient and an on-call physician who is consulted by the patient\u2019s physician but who has never met, spoken with, or consulted the patient when the on-call physician (1) participates in the diagnosis of the patient\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>condition, (2) participates in or prescribes a course of treatment for the patient, and (3) owes a duty to the hospital, staff or patient for whose benefit he is on call. Once an on-call physician who has the duty to the hospital, its staff, or patients is contacted for the benefit of an emergency room patient, and a discussion takes place between the patient\u2019s physician and the on-call physician regarding the patient\u2019s symptoms, a possible diagnosis and course of treatment, a physician-patient relationship exists between the patient and the on-call physician.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 336-37, 692 N.E.2d at 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In <em>McKinney, </em>a patient sought treatment at a hospital due to chest and abdominal pains. The attending physician examined the patient and conducted tests but could not confirm the nature of the pains. Consequently, he telephoned the home of the on-call cardiologist, who had a duty to the hospital. After discussing the symptoms, test results, and X-rays, the cardiologist concluded that the problem was not cardiac in nature. He requested more testing, after which he reiterated his opinion that the problem was not cardiac in nature. The cardiologist advised the attending physician to continue observation, and that physician thereafter instructed the patient to make an appointment with his family doctor and discharged him. The patient subsequently died of an aortic aneurysm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">On appeal from a directed verdict against the patient\u2019s estate in subsequent litigation, the Ohio Court of Appeals, in applying its \u201cthree-pronged\u201d test, concluded that \u201creasonable minds\u201d could come to different conclusions as to whether a physician-patient relationship existed \u201cbetween the principals in that case.\u201d The doctor \u201cparticipated in McKinney\u2019s course of treatment,\u201d the Court said, even \u201cparticipat[ing in the course of treatment] ... negatively by precluding cardiac treatment....\u201d 118 Ohio App.3d at 337, 692 N.E.2d at 1051. The cardiologist had been consulted by the attending physician \u201cfor the purpose of ruling out a heart attack.\u201d He discussed the patient\u2019s test findings and information with the attending physician. The Court of Appeals was also impressed by the fact that the doctor in question was \u201con-call for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>his group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the directed verdict that had been entered for the defendant cardiologist on the grounds that a relationship had been formed under its three-pronged test.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The Ohio Supreme Court has subsequently rejected the <em>McKinney </em>three-part test. In <em>Lownsbury v. VanBuren, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 231, 762 N.E.2d 354 (2002), that court was faced with the issue of whether a supervisory physician at a teaching hospital may be held to a physician-patient relationship even where that doctor had neither direct nor indirect contact with the patient. Even though the recognition of a duty of care in the context of a supervisory physician for a teaching hospital presents a relatively unique situation, the court\u2019s discussion and review of authorities which do not involve direct patient-physician contact is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The lower court in <em>Lownsbury </em>had concluded that there was insufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of .material fact as to the existence of a physician-patient relationship. Among the authorities brought to that court\u2019s attention was <em>McKinney </em>and its three-part test for a physician-patient relationship. The Ohio Supreme Court then explained what the Court of Appeals had stated in <em>McKinney:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\"><em>... </em>The court in <em>McKinney </em>did not hold that a physician-patient relationship can be created despite the lack of <em>any </em>contact between the physician and the patient.

The court further concluded that physicians who practice in the \u201cinstitutional environment may be found to have voluntarily assumed a duty of supervisory car e[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 762 N.E.2d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Other Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">There is a paucity of Maryland authority that addresses the formation of a physician-patient relationship where there is no direct contact with the patient. There are, however, numerous decisions from other courts that will help us to navigate to avoid Scylla without being gulped by Charybdis. In <em>Prosise v. Foster, </em>261 Va. 417, 544 S.E.2d 331 (2001), the issue was \u201cwhether an on-call attending physician for a teaching hospital owed a duty of care to a patient based upon a physician-patient relationship in the absence of direct contact with or consultation concerning the patient.\u201d 261 Va. at 419, 544 S.E.2d at 331. Dr. Foster, the on-call physician to the hospital emergency room, although not physically present, was available to answer questions from treating residents and interns.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The child was taken to the hospital with chicken pox lesions in her mouth. She was examined by two residents, who did not call Dr. Foster, and was treated for dehydration and released with instructions that she be taken to her pediatrician the following day. The next day, her pediatrician ordered the child returned to the hospital. Dr. Foster then saw the child for the first time, determined that she suffered from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>infection due to a systemic effect of the chicken pox, and ordered IV anti-viral medication. This treatment was unsuccessful, and the child died.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In the resulting malpractice action, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the doctor, ruling that \u201cthere was no \u2018minimum contact\u2019 between Dr. Foster and [the child] and, therefore, no physician-patient relationship existed[]\u201d when the doctor was \u201con call.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed, asserting that such a relationship did exist because Dr. Foster agreed to be on-call, thus accepting the child as her patient. The Virginia Supreme Court disagreed. The plaintiffs also asserted that a provision of the Virginia Code, which requires that medical students may work in hospitals only under supervision of a licensed physician, and that the \u201cattending physician\u201d retains the responsibility to assure the completion of a History and Physical by a licensed physician, created a statutory physician-patient relationship. Again, the Virginia Court disagreed. 261 Va. at 422, 544 S.E.2d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The plaintiffs then urged the Virginia court to follow the decision by the North Carolina Supreme Court in <em>Mozingo v. Pitt County Memorial </em>Hospital, 331 N.C. 182, 415 S.E.2d 341 (1992). That court held that an on-call attending physician had a common law duty to supervise residents who provided medical care, even though the supervision did not fit traditional notions of the physician-patient relationship. The defendant physician in <em>Prosise, </em>on the other hand, relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rivera v. Prince George\u2019s County Health Dept., </em>102 Md.App. 456, 649 A.2d 1212 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 Md. 117, 656 A.2d 772 (1995), which disagreed with the North Carolina Supreme Court, stating that it would impose no duty in the absence of proof that the doctor had accepted the patient, or had been summoned for consultation or treatment, \u201cunless the \u2018on-call\u2019 agreement between a hospital and a physician provides otherwise.\u201d 102 Md.App. at 498, 649 A.2d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In upholding the trial court, the Virginia Supreme Court agreed with this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Rivera, </em>and determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>that it must \u201clook to the record to determine whether it contains any facts which indicate that Dr. Foster, by virtue of her actions or her status as the on-call attending physician for the [hospital], agreed to accept responsibility for the care of [the child].\u201d 261 Va. at 423, 544 S.E.2d at 334. The Supreme Court concluded that the trial court did not err in holding that there was no physician-patient relationship \u201cbecause the evidence failed to show a consensual relationship in which the patient\u2019s care was entrusted to the [on-call] physician and the physician accepted the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 334. The Court noted that Dr. Foster did not participate in any treatment decisions, and had not been consulted by the treating physician or staff about the patient\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In <em>Irvin v. Smith, </em>272 Kan. 112, 31 P.3d 934 (2001), the patient brought a malpractice action against, <em>inter alia, </em>a child neurologist who had been consulted in connection with an undiagnosed ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction. The patient was a 12-year old who had received a shunt shortly after birth in order to relieve cerebral fluid pressure. She started to develop flu-like symptoms and seizures, and neck and back pain. She originally was admitted to a hospital in Ulysses, Kansas, then transferred to a medical center in Kansas City. Tests showed no abnormalities, and the patient was discharged-</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The patient developed the same problems the following month. Some x-rays and other diagnostic procedures up to this point had yielded negative results, but when the patient was admitted to Wesley Medical Center, radiographs showed that the shunt was in need of repair. The treating physician could not recall whether he had seen the films which demonstrated this condition. The treating physician called the neurologist for a \u201cconsult.\u201d They discussed performing a shuntogram the following day to determine whether there had developed any blockage. Before this procedure was conducted the next morning, the patient developed severe symptoms, and suffered permanent and severe brain damage. A lawsuit was filed on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the neurologist, ruling that a physician-patient relationship had not been established in his case. On appeal, the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed. The Court initially observed that the question of whether a physician-patient relationship exists is a question of fact. The Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">The existence of the duty of care is dependent on the existence of a physician-patient relationship.... [citing cases]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">Courts have concluded, as has this court, that whether a physician-patient relationship exists is generally a question of fact for the jury____[citing cases]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Generally, a physician-patient relationship is created only where the physician personally examines the patient.... A physician\u2019s indirect contact with a patient, however, does not preclude the finding of a physician-patient relationship.... Indeed, an implied physician-patient relationship may be found where the physician gives advice ... through another health care professional, [citing case]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">A physician who gives an \u201cinformal opinion,\u201d however, at the request of a treating physician, does not owe a duty to the patient because no physician-patient relationship is created. [citations] A physician who assumes the role of treating the patient, however, can be liable for medical malpractice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-9\"><em>Irvin, </em>272 Kan. at -, 31 P.3d at 940-41. The Court concluded that \u201cthe doctor must take some affirmative action with regard to treatment of a patient in order for the relationship to be established.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">The Court determined that no duty had been created-no physician-patient relationship had been established. The neurologist had not examined the patient, nor had he reviewed her chart or spoken with her parents. His sole source of information was what had been relayed to him by the treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>physician. He entered no orders in the case and took no other action.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The <em>Irvin </em>Court noted that courts have taken public policy concerns to heart and have refused to extend liability to doctors who have acted solely as an informal consultant, even where their participation in the case is extensive. <em>See NBD Bank v. Barry, 223 </em>Mich.App. 370, 566 N.W.2d 47 (1997), <em>appeal denied, </em>458 Mich. 864, 582 N.W.2d 835 (1998) (attending physician contacted the consultant frequently, and consultant viewed patient\u2019s chart, and made recommendations, which treating physician was free to accept or reject).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In <em>Adams v. Via Christi, ante, </em>the Kansas Supreme Court determined that the consultant owed a duty to the patient in that case, and was thus subject to liability. The consultant in <em>Adams </em>discussed the case with the decedent\u2019s mother, who had called him about her daughter\u2019s pregnancy, and offered a medical opinion. He had been the treating family physician and the court concluded that his earlier physician-patient relationship was \u201crenewed.\u201d The doctor had \u201ctak[en] some action to give medical assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 837, 19 P.3d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In <em>Oja v. Kin, </em>229 Mich.App. 184, 581 N.W.2d 739 (1998), <em>appeal denied, </em>459 Mich. 988, 593 N.W.2d 559 (1999), the Michigan Court of Appeals held that a doctor\u2019s consent to form a physician-patient relationship may not be implied merely from the doctor\u2019s status as an on-call physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The plaintiffs decedent had been brought to the Oakland Hospital emergency room with a gunshot wound to the jaw. The defendant osteopath was the on-call ENT specialist whom the attending physician had called for assistance. When reached at home with details about this emergency, he refused to come to the hospital, claiming that he was ill. The resident on duty at the emergency room called Dr. Kin twice more. Each time that \u201con-call\u201d expert declined to come to the hospital. The patient was examined by a number of physicians at the hospital before transfer to the Detroit Receiving Hospital, where he died in surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The executrix filed suit against Dr. Kin and others, asserting negligence. The trial court granted summary disposition for the doctor. The plaintiff appealed, and contended that she raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a physician-patient relationship between the doctor and her decedent. She advanced alternative theories for recovery: the doctor formed a physician-patient relationship because he rendered advice and treatment during his conversations with the resident on duty, and the doctor was bound by a contractual relationship with the hospital, and that this created a legal duty to hospital patients when called.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The Michigan Court of Appeals observed that the \u201cexistence or nonexistence of a legal duty is a question of law for the court to decide[,]\u201d without which \u201cthere can be no actionable negligence.\u201d 229 Mich.App. at 187, 581 N.W.2d at 741. This duty arises from the physician-patient relationship, which \u201cexists where a doctor renders professional services to a person who has contracted for such services.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The court stated that \u201cmerely listening to another physician\u2019s description of a patient\u2019s problem and offering a professional opinion regarding the proper course of treatment is not enough.\u201d Here, the doctor offered \u201cinformal assistance to a _ colleague.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190-91, 581 N.W.2d at 743. The court added, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">At the other end of the spectrum, a doctor who is on call and who, on the phone or in person, receives a description of the patient\u2019s condition and then essentially' directs the course of that patient\u2019s treatment, has consented to a physician-patient relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">229 Mich.App. at 191, 581 N.W.2d at 743. The court noted that this requires a case by case analysis, but concluded that a \u201cphysician\u2019s on-call status alone [is not] enough to support an implied consent to a physician-patient relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The doctor had provided no care, treatment or advice to the decedent and, unlike the on-call physician in <em>McKinney, </em>the doctor here \u201cdid not take any action that would support a finding of implied consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 581 N.W.2d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The court affirmed the entry of summary disposition against the decedent\u2019s personal representative, notwithstanding that hospital bylaws required an on-call physician to take part in the care of patients or arrange for coverage. <em>See id. </em>at 194 n. 7, 581 N.W.2d at 744 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In <em>Reynolds v. Decatur Memorial Hospital, </em>277 Ill.App.3d 80, 214 Ill.Dec. 44, 660 N.E.2d 235 (1996), the Illinois Appellate Court, entertained an appeal from the entry of summary judgment in favor of a physician. According to the appellate court, the sole issue was whether,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">as a matter of law, a telephone conference between [the] treating pediatrician ... and [Dr. Thomas] Fulbright concerning [patient\u2019s] condition created a physician-patient relationship between [patient] and Fulbright so as to raise a duty which is enforceable in a medical malpractice action in light of the standards of protocol of the hospital at which [patient] was being treated and in which both physicians were allowed to practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">277 Ill.App.3d at 81, 214 Ill.Dec. 44, 660 N.E.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that no duty existed. The minor plaintiff was injured at home after a fall from a couch and was taken to the emergency room, where he was admitted for observation and further inquiry into his condition. He exhibited an abnormal breathing pattern and tests were conducted to discover a possible infection or other problem. Cervical spine x-rays appeared to be normal. The child was admitted to the hospital and a pediatrician summoned to examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">That pediatrician contacted a Dr. Fulbright to discuss this case. The latter suggested a spinal tap to determine the involvement, if any, of certain disease processes. The pediatrician did not ask Dr. Fulbright to treat the child, and Dr. Fulbright did not commit to further involvement with his case. Dr. Fulbright later stated that he offered to make himself available if the child\u2019s doctor wished. He recalled that he would \u201coften receive[ ] inquiries from other doctors asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>questions and seeking suggestions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, 214 Ill.Dec. 44, 660 N.E.2d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The spinal tap was performed the next morning shortly after 3:00 a.m. The pediatrician had wanted to consult again with Dr. Fulbright when she arrived at the hospital later in the morning, but was informed that he was in surgery and unavailable. Dr. Fulbright never received a message that had been posted in the patient\u2019s chart the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The appellate court articulated the standard for determining whether a duty exists:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arm\">The determination of whether a duty exists\u2014whether the defendant and the plaintiff stood in such a relationship to one another that .the law imposed upon the defendant an obligation of reasonable conduct for the benefit of the plaintiff\u2014is an issue of law to be determined by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">277 Ill.App.3d at 84, 214 Ill.Dec. 44, 660 N.E.2d at 238 (quoting <em>Kirk v.

The court ruled in this case that there was no direct physician-patient relationship, no special relationship, and \u201chence no duty owed to plaintiffs by [Dr.] Fulbright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court pointed out that this was not a case in which Dr. Fulbright was asked to provide a service, conduct laboratory tests, or review test results. <em>Id. </em>The doctor did not accept a referral, and did not undertake to direct the actions of hospital employees. Dr. Fulbright was not contacted again, and he charged no fee. The appellate court also distinguished <em>Wheeler, </em>stating that this was not \u201ca case in which a physician undertook to direct the action of hospital employees in a telephone conversation with an emergency room nurse.\u201d 277 Ill.App.3d at 85, 660 N.E.2d at 239 (distinguishing <em>Wheeler).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Maryland Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">This Court had the occasion to address the existence of physician-patient relationships in the absence of direct contact in <em>Rivera. </em>The parents of a child born with birth defects brought suit against the hospital where the baby had been delivered, the Prince George\u2019s County Health Department and others asserting that the defendants were negligent in connection with the mother\u2019s treatment. Among the issues that were implicated in that case was the \u201con-call\u201d status of a defendant physician, who had been available to render assistance if called. That doctor was effectively an independent contractor, who was \u201con-call\u201d for about two weeks each year. Judge Cathell wrote for this Court to outline the physician\u2019s functions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">In the absence of an express agreement, \u201con-call\u201d means nothing more than that. He did not exercise control over [hospital residents\u2019] actions on a regular basis. Moreover, in our view, the relationship extant here cannot be construed as a supervisory situation whereby the resident\u2019s knowledge is imputed to Dr. Oh. He was merely to be consulted \u201cregarding any complications that the residents encountered in caring for obstetrical patients\u201d and, theoretically, in that two week period, had the residents not experienced any complications in their routine, Dr. Oh would not have any knowledge of who had and had not been treated ' and the manner in which they had been treated. Indeed, the morning of September 8, 1978 was the first time he was made aware of Ms. Rivera\u2019s condition. Following the child\u2019s delivery, he had no further contact with her or her mother in any capacity\u2014nor was such contact required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">102 Md.App. at 482-88, 649 A.2d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">We observed in that case that the duties of \u201con-call\u201d physicians had not received significant appellate attention up to that point. We then discussed the opinions by the North Carolina Supreme - Court and the North Carolina Court of Appeals in <em>Mozingo v. Pitt County Memorial Hospital, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>331 N.C. 182, 415 S.E.2d 341 (1992) and <em>Mozingo v.

The North Carolina Supreme Court stated in <em>Mozingo:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">[I]n the increasingly complex modern delivery of health care, a physician who undertakes to provide on-call supervision of residents actually treating a patient may be held accountable to that patient, if the physician negligently supervises those residents and such negligent supervision proximately causes the patient\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">... the defendant has stipulated that he undertook the duty of on-call supeivision of\u2014not merely consultation with\u2014the resident physicians.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">331 N.C. at 189, 192, 415 S.E.2d at 345.

Corso, </em>265 Md. 84, 288 A.2d 379 (1972), as factually inapposite. In <em>Thomas, </em>the on-call physician was contacted by the hospital emergency room\u2019s registered nurse. He advised the nurse to admit the patient and outlined the treatment to be administered. That hospital employed no residents or interns, but instead relied on private physicians using an \u201con-call\u201d roster. \u2022 The \u201con-call\u201d physician was therefore the only doctor available.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The patient in <em>Thomas </em>died after admission. The on-call doctor, who lived only ten minutes away, waited three hours to come in, and then only when notified that the patient was dying.

An \u201con-call\u201d physician may be in the position to direct the care of a patient whom he has never seen, so that his or her instructions are followed, the results of which are manifest in the ensuing course of the patient\u2019s treatment. But \u201c[w]here ... the treating physician exercises his or her own independent judgment in determining whether to accept or reject [a consultant\u2019s] advice, ... the consultative physician should not be regarded as a joint provider of medical services with respect to the patient.\u201d <em>Gilinsky v.

We recognize as well that in some circumstances a consultant may undertake by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>contract to take this \u201caffirmative\u201d action, and by that accord be deemed to participate in the care and treatment of patients. This appears to have been the case in <em>Thomas, </em>where the on-call physician\u2019s duty to the hospital and its patients was not in dispute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For the reasons expressed below, however, we conclude that a physician-patient relationship has not been established in this case and the entry of summary judgment in favor of Johns Hopkins Hospital was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We are unaware of any case that addresses the liability of a hospital that has accepted the transfer of a patient without having any direct contact with that patient.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With a bending sail we glide rapidly across domains scarcely seen and like so many intrepid courts before us, begin charting a course through these new legal seas.

It is your decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">A Probably not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">Q Probably not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-12\">A As it turns out, like I say, that act, we make the referral, but the mode of referral, the mode of transport, it becomes out of our hands. I mean, that is determined on this shore, not our shore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-13\">Q I understand all that, Doctor, but you have to make the decision as the what, if somebody, if a consultant recommends something to you, and you are the primary physician, you still make the decision with the hands on the patient whether to do it or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-14\">A I\u2019m the one looking at the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-15\">Q You are the one looking at the patient. You are the one calling the shots. If somebody told you this patient could go by ambulance, and they are going to stop off at Easton for lunch, you might say I\u2019m not shipping this patient. The patient is unstable. I don\u2019t have time for that. We are going to have a baby here. You might say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-16\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-17\">Q That is well within your discretion? You have the power to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>A That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">Q You can override anything that somebody from Hopkins says?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">Q Do you, Doctor, testify today that you told the Hopkins personnel that this was, indeed, an emergency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">Q Did you tell the Hopkins people that you believed that this patient, not that you believed, that you had made a diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia, and you believed the patient had HELLP syndrome?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">Q Doctor [Khouzami] calls you at 1:20. Do you have any new information by 1:20 to tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">A Yes. Do you want me to read my note?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-12\">Doctor [Khouzami] returned call, had been presented patient. Urinary output 10 ccs last, so we are, obviously, with pre-eclampsia, we developed\u2014that is off the note. Blood pressure stable. I have the flow sheet here just to clarify that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-13\">This was 1 o\u2019clock. At 1 o\u2019clock her blood pressure is 160 over 87, 138 over 87. So it was in that range. Patient remains lethargic secondary to Morphine. Dr. [Khouzami] feels ground transport, (ambulance), acceptable, will arrange ASAP. That is the note.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">The excerpt shows that Dr. Gray had reached the diagnosis that Ms. Sterling was pre-eclamptic prior to Dr. Gray\u2019s initial contact with Johns Hopkins, and added the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome before he conversed with Dr. Khouzami when the latter returned his call. Indeed, by the time Dr. Gray called Dr. Khouzami, the record suggests that her condition was also characterized as severe. Although Dr. Khouzami acknowledged that he, too, had rendered diagnoses of pre-eclampsia with the HELLP complication, Dr. Gray had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>already reached these conclusions before discussing the case with the Hopkins attending physician. Dr. Gray had reached a firm conclusion regarding Ms. Sterling\u2019s condition and Dr. Khouzami did nothing to add to this diagnosis of the patient or prepare a course of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Appellants urge that Dr. Khouzami\u2019s deposition testimony virtually dictates a reversal of the summary judgment in favor of Johns Hopkins. Indeed, Dr. Khouzami responded in the affirmative when asked \u201cwere you to make the decision as the fellow as to whether or not a patient like Laverne Sterling was transported to the Johns Hopkins Hospital back then?\u201d He reiterated that he \u201cgave permission for the transport ... [and] approved the transport based on the information [he] had[.]\u201d Dr. Khouzami also said yes when asked whether he \u201cha[d] two patients?\u201d His deposition testimony also indicates that he rendered a diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia, and \u201cfelt that the patient [was] stable to be transported to Hopkins to be delivered at Hopkins where there is a neonate intensive care unit and more expertise for management of severe preeclampsia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Dr. Khouzami did agree to have a patient with severe preeclampsia and HE LLP transported two and a half hours by ambulance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Certainly, Dr. Gray was reluctant to send Ms. Sterling by ambulance, and wanted to move her by helicopter, and Dr. Khouzami recalled that Dr. Gray would make the \u201cdetermination as to whether it would be appropriate or within the standards of care to have the patient moved[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">But we are not persuaded that Dr. Khouzami\u2019s deposition testimony bears the weight assigned to it by appellants or compels the result appellants seek. Notwithstanding Dr. Khouzami\u2019s testimony, it was Dr. Gray, the physician with direct contact with Ms. Sterling, who rendered the initial diagnoses in this case and who initiated contact with Hopkins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>for transfer. Dr. Gray was \u201cthe one looking at the patient[, and he could] override anything that somebody from Hopkins sa[id.]\u201d It is likewise important that Dr. Gray, who was demonstrably Ms. Sterling\u2019s attending physician, could override Dr. Khouzami. He was free to accept or reject the directions from Hopkins by deciding not to send Ms. Sterling in the first place. <em>See, e.g., Lopez v. Aziz, </em>852 S.W.2d 303, 307 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1993, no writ) (treating physician free to accept or reject opinion as he saw fit); <em>accord Hill v. Kokosky, </em>186 Mich.App. at 304, 463 N.W.2d at 267. We hold that, regardless of Dr. Khouzami\u2019s testimony, Dr. Gray\u2019s acknowledgment that he had the final say in making the decision to transfer Ms. Sterling constitutes a crucial factor in this case which militates against the imposition of a duty of care on Dr. Khouzami and his employer Johns Hopkins Hospital. Dr. Khouzami\u2019s deposition testimony does not force a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he played any role in the diagnosis of Ms. Sterling\u2019s condition, or held crucial decisional authority as to her transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In this regard we note a crucial distinction between <em>Wheeler </em>and the instant appeal. In <em>Wheeler, </em>the consulting doctor was contacted by nurses at Yettie Kersting Hospital.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There would be no occasion for the imposition of that duty of care on a health professional who is not a physician. It was the consultant in <em>Wheeler </em>who held staff privileges there, who evaluated information provided by those duty nurses and who made the decision to transfer that patient. That physician\u2019s directives were not merely hortatory, they were conclusive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The instant circumstances differ sharply from <em>McKinney </em>and <em>Wheeler </em>in another respect. Dr. Khouzami was not directly affiliated in any manner with PRMC, the hospital that was providing immediate care for Ms. Sterling. Thus, Dr. Khouzami owed no independent consultative duty to PRMC, its staff or patients with respect to the care and treatment of individual patients. As stated previously, while Dr. Khouzami did conclude that the diagnosis and treatment given to Ms. Sterling at PRMC was appropriate, he did not give any advice that would cause Dr. Gray or the staff at PRMC to rely on his expertise. Dr. Khouzami, in essence, merely conveyed the fact that Johns Hopkins had the facilities and staff to treat that appellant if she was transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">To summarize, Hopkins, through its agent, confirmed a diagnosis of a patient it had no contact with whatsoever, confirmed that the treatment given was appropriate and agreed to a transfer of that patient. None of these actions were binding upon the primary physician,, who could observe that patient\u2019s deteriorating condition. Hopkins has no affiliation with PRMC or PRMC\u2019s staff and no preexisting responsibilities to PRMC\u2019s patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We thus cannot assume that a hospital accepting a transfer owes the same duties as the transferring hospital, as the accepting hospital is not currently treating the patient and thus has not established a responsibility towards the patient. Furthermore, the accepting hospital is unable to examine the patient to make informed decisions. We will not extend to such hospitals a duty of medical care\" where the patient remains under the supervision and care of her treating or attending physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Under the unique facts of this case, we thus do not believe that an implied physician-patient relationship was established between Johns Hopkins and Sterling. Therefore, Hopkins owed no duty of care to Ms. Sterling., In reaching this conclusion, we are not stating that an on-call physician accepting a transfer of a patient for which no direct contact has been made, has no duty of care. Indeed, a physician may have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>duty to act within a standard of care anytime he/she conveys a medical opinion or other directive that indicates an affirmative action in assuming whole or partial responsibility in the care and treatment of a patient. We do not reach that issue. What we are holding is merely that Johns Hopkins, under the facts before us, owed no duty to Laverne Sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">For the reasons set forth above, and aware that no advance has ever been made without controversy, we hold that the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment on behalf of Johns Hopkins Hospital. A physician-patient relationship was not established between Johns Hopkins Hospital and Laverne Sterling. Consequently, Johns Hopkins owed no duty of care to Sterling and thus appellants cannot recover in this claim for malpractice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\">.

Certainly, medical malpractice has evolved as a theory of liability distinct from negligence, because of its incorporation of contract and tort principles. <em>See St. John v. Pope, </em>901 S.W.2d 420, 423 (Tex.1995). Judge Wilner illuminated the interplay between contract and tort theories for the Court of Appeals in <em>Dingle v. Belin, </em>358 Md. 354, 749 A.2d 157 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai9\">We have long recognized, as have most courts, that, except in those unusual circumstances when a doctor acts gratuitously or in an emergency situation, recovery for malpractice \"is allowed only where there is a relationship of doctor and patient as a result of a contract, express or implied, that the doctor will treat the patient with proper professional skill and the patient will pay for such treatment, and there has been a breach of professional duty to the patient.\u201d <em>Hoover </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>v. <em>Williamson, </em>236 Md. 250, 253, 203 A.2d 861, 862 (1964). The relationship that spawns the malpractice claim is thus ordinarily a contractual one. Largely because of the greater facility offered by tort-based actions for recovering damages for non-economic loss\u2014 predominantly pain, suffering, and disfigurement\u2014malpractice actions have traditionally been tort-based, the tort arising from the underlying contractual relationship. <em>See Schaefer v.

It is for the court to determine, as a matter of law, what characteristics must be present for a relationship to give rise to a duty the breach of which may result in tort liability. It is for the jury to determine whether the facts in evidence establish the elements of that relationship.
