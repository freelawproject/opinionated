The court entered summary judgment in favor of appellee against appellant for the sum of $20,000. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Based on our reading of the policy and the undisputed facts, we reach a different conclusion from that reached by the circuit court. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">While driving his father\u2019s car on 19 July 1986, appellee was involved in a head-on collision, in which he sustained serious injuries. The driver of the other vehicle was later convicted of failure to yield the right-of-way and failure to keep to the right of center.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">The vehicle with which appellee\u2019s car collided was insured by State Farm Automobile Insurance Company. The driver of that car was insured by Globe American Casualty Company. Although both of those carriers initially denied coverage for reasons not relevant to this case, they each reversed that position and settled with appellee by paying its policy limits to him. Appellee received a total of $70,000; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>$50,000 from State Farm and $20,000 from Globe American. It is undisputed that appellee\u2019s damages were in excess of $90,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Appellee\u2019s father had an insurance policy with appellant which provided uninsured/underinsured motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) benefits in the amount of $20,000 for personal injury to a single individual. Appellee claimed that because his actual damages exceeded the benefits available under the tortfeasors\u2019 policies and the Colonial policy combined, he was entitled to the full amount of the Colonial UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Colonial denied the claim, asserting that it was relieved of any obligation to pay UIM benefits because the other available coverage exceeded the insured\u2019s limits of his own policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Appellee filed suit against Colonial and the driver and owner of the other vehicle. His complaint originally contained four counts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">Count I alleged negligence by Charles E. Hubbard and vicarious liability therfor by Bonnie Sue Harrison, the driver and owner, respectively, of the other vehicle. Count II alleged negligent entrustment of her car to Hubbard by Harrison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">Count III sought recovery of uninsured motorist benefits from Colonial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">Count IV sought recovery of underinsured motorist benefits from Colonial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Appellee dismissed his claim against Hubbard and Harrison with prejudice after receiving payments from State Farm and Globe American.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">In appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, he conceded that, since the driver and owner of the other car were insured, he no longer had a claim for uninsured motorist benefits and therefore was not seeking summary judgment as to Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">With respect to Count IV, both sides moved for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that the underinsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>motorist provision of appellee\u2019s father\u2019s insurance policy was applicable to the case <em>sub judice, </em>and, there being no dispute as to any material fact, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee in the amount of $20,000.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">Asserting error in that ruling, appellant contends:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">1. An injured party who has been compensated by the responsible parties\u2019 insurers, in an amount greater than the limits of his own underinsured motorist coverage, has no claim under the UIM provision of his own policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">2. The coverage provided by the Colonial policy is, in form and substance, perfectly in accord with the public policy of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">We begin our analysis by noting that insurers have a right to limit their liability and to impose whatever condition they please in a policy so long as neither the limitation on liability nor the condition contravenes a statutory inhibition or the state\u2019s public policy. <em>Walther v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>83 Md.App. 405, 575 A.2d 339 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Md.Ann.Code art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(1) (1986 Repl.Vol.) provides that an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d is one</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALB\">for which the sum of the limits of liability under all valid and collectible liability insurance policies ... applicable to the bodily injury or death is less than the amount of coverage provided to the insured under this subsection. Subsection (c)(2) provides that every motor vehicle liabili-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0L\">ty insurance policy issued in Maryland must contain uninsured motorist coverage in an amount at least equal to the $20,000 minimum liability coverage requirements of \u00a7 17-103(b) of the Transportation Article. <em>Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 167, 171, 522 A.2d 1320 (1987); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Souras, </em>78 Md.App. 71, 75, 552 A.2d 908 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">According to the Court of Appeals, \u201cthe purpose of uninsured motorist statutes is \u2018that each insured under such coverage have available the full statutory minimum to exactly the same extent as would have been available had the tort-feasor complied with the minimum requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the financial responsibility law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>[309 Md.] at 172, 522 A.2d 1320 [citing <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 737, 436 A.2d 465 (1981)]. \u201cThis mandatory coverage has the \u2018purpose of providing minimum protection to individuals injured by uninsured motorists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>[citing <em>Yarmuth v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>286 Md. 256, 264, 407 A.2d 315 (1979)].</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Appellant contends that the Batsons had the statutorily required minimum UM/UIM coverage of $20,000 for personal injuries to an individual. And, because the injured party received exactly that much from one insurance carrier and two and one-half times that much from the other carrier, he is not entitled to compensation under his father\u2019s UIM coverage with Colonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Appellee, on the other hand, asserts that appellant\u2019s interpretation of its policy should be rejected because it attempts to restrict the Batsons\u2019 UIM coverage to \u201cthe insured\u2019s own uninsured motorist limits\u201d and violates several standard rules of contract construction, including that Colonial\u2019s policy makes underinsured motorist coverage \u201cfor which an additional premium was paid\u201d illusory, and fails to make its intention to limit the coverage clear. We disagree with each of appellee\u2019s contentions and will deal with them below.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Appellee cites <em>Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>for the general proposition that \u201cUIM is a supplemental endorsement extending coverage beyond the traditional uninsured situation.\u201d While this statement of the case is correct, the facts of <em>Hoffman </em>are such that reliance on this language to bolster appellee\u2019s argument that his underinsured motorist coverage should not be subjected to the limits of his uninsured motorist coverage is a misapplication of that case. We shall briefly outline <em>Hoffman </em>in order to dispel any further reliance in this vein.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The Hoffmans were passengers in a car that collided with another vehicle, killing Mrs. Hoffman and seriously injuring Mr. Hoffman. The car in which they were riding was insured by Hanover Insurance Company and had underinsured motorists coverage in the amount of $50,000/$100,-000. The other car was insured by Travelers Insurance Company and had the minimum required liability coverage of $20,000/$40,000. The driver <em>of </em>the other car, therefore, was not an uninsured motorist, but in terms of the Hanover Insurance Company policy he was an underinsured motorist. The Hoffmans\u2019 own automobiles were insured by United Services Automobile Association (USAA).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The estate of Mrs. Hoffman received $20,000 from Travelers and $30,000 from Hanover\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage. Mr. Hoffman also received a sum in settlement. Mr. Hoffman then individually and as personal representative of his wife\u2019s estate sued USAA to obtain benefits under the supplementary endorsement relating to underinsured motorists for both his cars. According to the declarations page the Hoffmans had purchased uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $300,000/$500,000 per car.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The issue in <em>Hoffman </em>was whether USAA had expressly extended coverage from the traditional uninsured motorist situation to the underinsured motorist situation. The Court of Appeals held that by virtue of a second endorsement entitled \u201cSupplementary Uninsured Motorists Insurance (Bodily Injury-Property Damage-Limits-Underinsured Motorists)\u201d, they had.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The fact that Hoffman had already recovered the amount of the statutory minimum policy from another insurer was irrelevant because, according to the Court, the USAA policy did not purport to provide the same coverage as was dealt with in prior decisions where each policy provided only the minimum statutorily required coverage. 309 Md. at 176, 522 A.2d 1320. USAA provided insurance in a greater amount ($300,000/$500,000) for uninsured and underinsured situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Despite the language on the face sheet of Colonial's policy that uninsured motorist coverage included underinsured motorist coverage as well, that policy, unlike the policy issued by USAA to the Hoffmans, provided UM/UIM coverage only to the statutory minimum of $20,000/$40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">According to the Court of Appeals, \u201cthe language of \u00a7 543(a) supports a construction of the section whereby an additional recovery under the required minimum Uninsured Motorist coverage of a second policy is precluded, but a recovery under the optional excess Underinsured Motorists coverage of a second policy is not precluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177, 522 A.2d 1320. Furthermore, \u201c\u00a7 541(f) clearly allows \u2018excess uninsured\u2019 or \u2018underinsured\u2019 motorists coverage ...\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>309 Md. at 179, 522 A.2d 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The term \u201cexcess uninsured\u201d coverage as used in <em>Hoffman </em>does not mean, as appellee urges, coverage in excess of other available insurance; it means excess uninsured motorist coverage or coverage in excess of the uninsured motorist coverages required by law ($20,000/$40,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Appellee asserts that Colonial\u2019s definition of an underinsured motor vehicle is an attempt to restrict its UIM coverage and conflicts with Maryland law. Appellee\u2019s insurance policy states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">UNDERINSURED MOTORISTS INSURANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arz\">We will pay all sums for bodily injury and property damage that you or your legal representative are legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of the underinsured motor vehicle, subject to the limits of Uninsured Motorist Insurance shown on the declarations page, <em>when </em>your Uninsured Motorist Insurance limits exceed the bodily injury or property damage limits of the other vehicle. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">In attempting to explain his rationale for insisting that this provision conflicts with Maryland law, appellee states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">Under Article 48A, Section 541 (already a part of the contract) a vehicle whose liability insurance limits covering bodily injury and property damage is less than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>insured\u2019s own UM coverage is \u201cuninsured\u201d and not \u201cunderinsured.\u201d For that reason Colonial\u2019s implicit definition of an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d must be rejected. UIM is thus left undefined by the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Appellee relies upon, and his position is entirely in accordance with, our opinion in <em>Christensen v. Wausau Insurance Company, </em>69 Md.App. 696, 519 A.2d 776 (1987), in which we held that a tortfeasor whose liability insurance coverage was less than the damages suffered by the injured party was \u201cunderinsured\u201d within the meaning of the injured party\u2019s insurance policy containing underinsurance coverage that did not otherwise define that term. Appellee\u2019s reliance on <em>Christensen </em>is misplaced. As we pointed out in <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Souras, </em>78 Md.App. 71, 75-76, 552 A.2d 908 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">Although section 541(c) refers to \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d coverage, it is clear that its provisions operate as <em>under-insured, motorist coverage to the extent that the person responsible for the accident has less liability coverage than the insured under the uninsured provisions of his own policy. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In so interpreting \u201cunderinsured motorist,\u201d we expressly overruled the language in <em>Christensen </em>upon which appellee relied, pointing out that <em>Christensen </em>was decided prior to <em>Hoffman, </em>in which the Court of Appeals made it perfectly clear that <em>Christensen </em>was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Although the term \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d is not defined in the policy, our holding in <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Souras </em>adequately defines it. Since the automobile operated by the Hoffmans was covered for the occurrence in question (by the policy on that vehicle and the policy covering the driver) for an amount in excess of the UM/UIM coverage in appellee\u2019s father\u2019s policy, it was not an underinsured motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Appellee next contends that an additional premium was paid for the underinsured motorist coverage, and therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>it is separate and distinct from his UM coverage. Appellee further states that \u201cColonial\u2019s interpretation of its own policy makes the inclusion of UIM coverage duplicitous and thereby removes any possibility ... of paying UIM coverage to the Batsons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Although the trial court found that UM and UIM coverage were jointly purchased for a single premium of $4.00, it went on to state \u201cColonial does not go so far as to say that the Batsons were not charged for the underinsurance coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">According to an affidavit submitted by a claims supervisor at Colonial, \u201cColonial Insurance Co. of California charged a single premium of $4.00 for uninsured motorists coverage and underinsured motorists coverage for the applicable policy period, and that no separate and distinct premium charge for underinsurance motorists coverage was made.\u201d Appellee presented nothing to refute that evidence or create any genuine dispute as to the facts set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Appellee further contends that if Frederick Batson did not purchase distinct UIM coverage then they would have no claim of entitlement to any additional recovery, thereby making the promised coverage illusory. This is simply not true. If the driver of the other vehicle had been \u201cuninsured\u201d then appellee would have been entitled to $20,000 under Colonial\u2019s Uninsured Motorists Coverage. On the other hand, if the driver of the other vehicle had been \u201cunderinsured,\u201d meaning that appellee\u2019s Uninsured Motorists Coverage of $20,000 was greater than the coverage limits of the tort-feasors\u2019 policies, then appellee would have been entitled to whatever damages would have been recoverable from the underinsured tort-feasor up to the limit of $20,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>While it\u2019s true that if the tort-feasor\u2019s policy is issued in Maryland then of necessity it will include the statutory minimum of $20,000 and appellee will never recover from his underinsurance coverage of $20,000, it is still not an illusory benefit. We find <em>Rafferty v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>303 Md. 63, 492 A.2d 290 (1985) helpful to our analysis. In <em>Rafferty </em>the estate of a decedent killed in an automobile collision caused by an uninsured motorist sued decedent\u2019s insurer alleging that it was entitled to recover uninsured motorist benefits after having recovered uninsured motorist benefits in excess of the statutory m\u00ednimums from the primary insurer. According to the Court of Appeals,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFS\">[T]he instances in which more than one policy may be utilized are limited to those in which the primary insurer\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage is less than the statutory minimum. For example, given the facts of this appeal, had the primary insured been from out of state and purchased coverage for less than the Maryland statutory m\u00ednimums, then Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate could have recovered from Allstate up to the $20,000 minimum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Id. at 71-72, 492 A.2d 290. Such is the case under the facts of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Appellee\u2019s final contention is that Colonial, in attempting to limit its UIM coverage, failed to make its intended meaning clear. We find no basis of support for this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">As we stated in <em>Pedersen v. Republic Insurance Co., </em>72 Md.App. 661, 532 A.2d 183 (1987) absent ambiguity, construction of the contract is within the province of the court and Maryland has not adopted the rule that an insurance policy is to be most strongly construed against the insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 667, 532 A.2d 183 [citing <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Insur. v. DeJames, </em>256 Md. 717, 261 A.2d 747 (1970)]. Likewise, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>interpreting insurance contracts, the intention of the parties is to be ascertained if reasonably possible from the policy as a whole, and words are to be given their customary and normal meaning. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Colonial\u2019s policy clearly and unambiguously stated that appellee\u2019s Underinsured Motorist Insurance was subject to the limits of appellee\u2019s Uninsured Motorists Insurance. In addition, the policy stated that Underinsured Motorists Insurance may be claimed when appellee\u2019s Uninsured Motorists Insurance limit of $20,000 exceeds the bodily injury or property damage limits on the other vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Accordingly, we hold that appellee was not entitled to recover damages under the \u201cUnderinsured Motorists Insurance\u201d provision of his father\u2019s policy. The court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellee; it should have granted judgment in favor of appellant instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">. An insurance policy issued in the State of Maryland which provides for more coverage than required under Md.Ann. code Art. 48A, 541(c)(1), or the uninsured motorist provisions, in essence means that the insured is covered to the extent of his policy less the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>insurance paid by the tort-feasor\u2019s carrier. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.
