BELL, JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b228-5\">WILNER, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Appellant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of battery and resisting arrest. The convictions arose from an altercation occurring when sheriffs deputies, eventually aided by the police, served an arrest warrant on appellant, charging him with failure to make support payments to his former wife. During the struggle, a deputy was stabbed with a ballpoint pen and a police officer was struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Appellant, a self-employed college graduate, had been released on bond prior to and during the trial. Upon rendition of the jury\u2019s verdicts, the court agreed to postpone sentencing pending receipt of a presentence investigation report and to allow appellant to remain free on bond. The judge warned him, however, that he was considering imposition of a \u201csplit sentence with a minimum sentence at Baltimore City Jail and supervised probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">When the parties returned for disposition, the court was informed, to its obvious annoyance, that the presentence investigation report had not been completed, largely because appellant had been out of town visiting relatives and was unavailable to supply information to the investigator. The court nonetheless proceeded, first granting appellant\u2019s motion to merge the battery conviction into the conviction for resisting arrest and then considering an appropriate sentence. The prosecutor argued against the entry of probation before judgment, principally because some three to four years earlier appellant had received that disposition on another charge of resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Although the record does not establish this directly, it appears from some of the colloquy that the judge had had an off-the-record discussion with counsel regarding what he intended or desired to do with respect to sentence. It seems that, at that conference, the judge proposed two alternatives: (1) to hold the matter of sentencing <em>sub curia </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>for 19 days, to revoke appellant\u2019s bond and commit him to the City Jail during that time, and, at the end of the 19 days, to enter a probation before judgment (PBJ) thus freeing him from both further incarceration and a criminal record, or (2) if appellant rejected that proposal, to impose a three-year jail sentence and suspend all but 10 days of it in lieu of probation. Finally, it appears that counsel had discussed these alternatives with appellant, who was reluctant to accept either because he did not want to spend any time in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The colloquy in open court, which suggests this off-the-record discussion principally by inference, began with defense counsel pleading for probation before judgment, asserting that appellant wanted neither a criminal record nor incarceration. It ensued thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: There\u2019s no use offering him probation before judgment, because the only way I will do that is let him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">MR. BERNSTEIN [Defense counsel]: You understand what the Judge is saying? He will offer you probation before judgment, but a requirement for that would be that you would have to spend time in the city jail and then the Court will offer you that, having given you basically a taste of the inside of an institution. Now, that offer has now been made by Judge Themelis. You\u2019ve had an opportunity \u2014 I discussed it with you out in the hall, and you\u2019ve heard the collo[q]uy that has taken place. Would you want to accept that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">THE COURT: I impose a three-years sentence. I\u2019m going to suspend all but thirty days of the sentence to Baltimore City Jail. Three years supervised probation. Immediately upon release, I\u2019m going to order that he be \u2014 no drugs, no alcohol, submit to spot urine, submit to psychiatric and or psychological within sixty days, and treatment if needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">MR. BERNSTEIN: Court\u2019s going to require him to spend thirty days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>THE COURT: Yes, sir \u2014 no, what did I say in chambers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">MR. BERNSTEIN: All but ten.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Following denial of appellant\u2019s request for an appeal bond and for reconsideration of the sentence, the court\u2019s proposal was explained once again for his benefit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cMR. BERNSTEIN: The Judge said if you went to the City Jail today and came back to this court nineteen days from now, having spent a full nineteen days in the Baltimore City Jail, that he would strike the finding of guilty, grant you probation before judgment and you would then have the three years probation along with the special conditions for the counseling if needed and any treatment if needed. The alternative is that you are going to have a criminal record for the resisting arrest. Instead of not having any sentence floating over you, you will have a ten[t]ative sentence for three years and you\u2019ll be required to go to City Jail for ten days. Now, as the Judge indicated, you\u2019ll do five\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">THE COURT: Five or six.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">MR. BERNSTEIN: You will still have a right to appeal, because you will have a criminal record. So what it boils down to, if you are willing to spend an additional fourteen days in City Jail \u2014 because that\u2019s going to be the difference \u2014 that you can then have the benefit of probation before judgment, and that\u2019s the option that he\u2019s presented to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Upon appellant\u2019s continued rejection of the PBJ offer, the court formally imposed a sentence of three years in prison with all but 10 days suspended in lieu of probation. In this appeal, appellant raises the single issue of whether the court erred in \u201coffering a probation before judgment, in which a condition of acceptance, by the appellant was a period of incarceration.\u201d He claims, of course, that it did and asks that we remand with instructions to enter probation before judgment without that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Probation is available as a sentencing alternative in four different settings. Under Md.Ann.Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 641(a), the court may, after a verdict of guilty and with the written consent of the defendant, \u201cstay the entering of judgment, defer further proceedings, and place the person on probation\u201d if it is satisfied that \u201cthe best interests of the person and the welfare of the people of the State would be served thereby____\u201d If the defendant fulfills the terms of the probation, the court is directed to discharge him from the probation; that discharge \u201cshall be without judgment of conviction and is not a conviction for purposes of any disqualification or disability imposed by law because of conviction of crime.\u201d \u00a7 641(c). This is the disposition commonly referred to as PBJ. A similar disposition is permissible in certain controlled dangerous substance cases under art. 27, \u00a7 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The other three contexts are provided for in \u00a7 641A(a) of art. 27. That section authorizes a court to (1) suspend <em>imposition </em>of sentence and place a defendant on probation, (2) impose a sentence but suspend execution of it in favor of probation, or (3) impose a sentence and suspend execution of a part of it in favor of probation. The third of these options is often referred to as a \u201csplit sentence.\u201d See, in general, <em>Hanson v. Hughes, 52 </em>Md.App. 246, 447 A.2d 892, <em>aff'd, </em>294 Md. 599, 451 A.2d 664 (1982); also art. 27, \u00a7 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In <em>Stone v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 329, 405 A.2d 345 (1979), we considered whether it was permissible for a court to implement a fifth alternative \u2014 to impose a sentence of incarceration, purport to suspend execution of all of it, and place the defendant on probation with one of the conditions being that the defendant serve 18 months in jail. In effect, this was an amalgamation of the second and third options allowed by \u00a7 641A(a), but the issue was cast as whether the court could validly require a defendant to serve time in jail as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Observing that the issue was one of first impression in Maryland, we noted that different results had been reached in other States and that those results were largely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>product of statutory interpretation: \u201cJurisdictions holding that imprisonment is a valid condition of probation have generally relied on express statutory authority permitting such action____ On the other hand, jurisdictions holding that imprisonment is not a valid condition of probation generally rely on the lack of express statutory authority permitting such action.\u201d 43 Md.App. at 332, 405 A.2d 345. The trial court in <em>Stone </em>acted under \u00a7 641A(a), which authorizes courts to place the defendant on probation \u201cupon such terms and conditions as the courts deem proper.\u201d That authority, we held, though broad, was not unlimited, and it did not encompass requiring incarceration. Our concluding comment, in this regard, was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">\u201c[wjhile we recognize that incarceration as a condition of probation might be beneficial in some cases, we believe that \u2018this policy and the limits which should be placed upon it are matters properly for the legislature to consider and not for this court to attempt to read into the present statute[s].\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 336, 405 A.2d 345, quoting in part from <em>People v. Ledford, </em>173 Colo. 194, 477 P.2d 374, 376 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Although courts in other States remain split on this issue <em>(see </em>Annotation, <em>Propriety of Conditioning Probation on Defendant\u2019s Serving Part of Probationary Period in Jail or Prison, </em>6 A.L.R.4th 446 (1981)), Maryland law remains firm in this regard. In <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 104, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987), the Court of Appeals, citing <em>Stone, </em>stated unequivocally that \u201ca court cannot impose imprisonment as a condition of probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Apart from what we said in <em>Stone </em>and the blanket confirmation in <em>Maus, </em>there are two reasons why this rule remains intact, especially in the context of a probation \u2014 a PBJ \u2014 ordered pursuant to \u00a7 641. As noted, we concluded our discussion in <em>Stone </em>with an invitation to the Legislature to change the rule if it felt that courts should have this authority. In its 1989 session, the Legislature entertained a proposal to do so. Senate Bdl 361, which the records of the Department of Legislative Reference reveal was prompted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>by a desire on the part of a clerk in the District Court for Charles County to overturn <em>Stone, </em>would, in its first reader form, have amended all the sections of art. 27 allowing for probation, including \u00a7 641, to permit a court \u201cto impose a sentence of confinement as a condition of probation.\u201d As enacted, however, the bill limited that authority to courts in Charles, St. Mary\u2019s, and Calvert Counties. 1989 Md. Laws, ch. 572; \u00a7 641(a)(i)(2). As to the other subdivisions of the State, the Legislature evidently was content to let the doctrine announced in <em>Stone </em>and confirmed in <em>Mans </em>remain intact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Additionally, unlike \u00a7 641A(a), \u00a7 641 does more than provide for \u201csuch terms and conditions as the court deems proper.\u201d It permits the court to impose \u201creasonable terms and conditions as appropriate\u201d but goes on to specify that \u201c[t]he terms and conditions may include ordering the person to pay a fine or pecuniary penalty to the State, or to make restitution\u201d and \u201calso may include any type of rehabilitation program or clinic, or similar program, or the parks program or voluntary hospital program.\u201d In light of this kind of specification of permissible conditions, including fines, the omission of incarceration as an allowable condition is all the more significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">For all of these reasons, we hold that the offer made by the court was impermissible; it had no authority to condition a PBJ on the service of a term of incarceration, even though that incarceration technically was in the nature of pre-trial detention. Appellant cannot be faulted for rejecting that offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">This leaves us with the problem of how to remedy the error. In <em>Padgett v. State, </em>319 Md. 74, 570 A.2d 1226 (1990), the trial court initially indicated an inclination to enter a PBJ but then conditioned that disposition upon the immediate payment of a $1,000 fine. When the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>informed the court that he was unable to make immediate payment, the court withdrew that option and imposed a six-month sentence, which it suspended. The Court of Appeals found that reaction to be \u201cfundamentally unfair,\u201d vacated the sentence, and directed that PBJ be entered. We think that a similar disposition is appropriate here. Appellant, unfortunately, has already served his jail time, and so, in the end, the judge got essentially what he wanted. But it wasn\u2019t right and we do not expect to see a recurrence of it. Sections 641 and 641A give the court ample flexibility in sentencing; there is no need for it to invent new options unauthorized by the Legislature and rejected by the appellate courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY WITH DIRECTION TO ENTER JUDGMENT IN ACCORD WITH THIS OPINION; MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\">.
