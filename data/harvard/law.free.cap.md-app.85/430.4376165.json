Iwan Zaal, appellant, appeals to us from a conviction of one count of child abuse that followed a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (the Hon. Peter Messitte, presiding).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The victim was born on July 27, 1977; she was twelve years old when this incident occurred. At trial, the victim testified that she was home alone when appellant, her grandfather, arrived on March 30, 1989, to take her for an outing. Appellant and the victim previously planned to go to the zoo together. When appellant arrived, he told her that he could not take her to the zoo because he had to work. He proposed instead that they go to the movies and out to lunch. The victim telephoned her mother at work to ask permission to go to the movies. Her mother gave her permission to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Appellant and the victim returned to her home at about 3:30 p.m. that day. The victim changed from a skirt into a pair of oversized shorts. She went into the living room and sat on the couch next to appellant. At that point, appellant started talking about prior sexual encounters that he had had. Appellant then put his hand on the uppermost part of the victim\u2019s thigh. The victim, in an attempt to change the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>subject, asked appellant to come into her room so that she could show him what she had bought with the $20.00 which he had given her because of her good report card. Appellant laid down on the victim\u2019s bed and pulled her on top of him. When she felt something go into her vagina, she jumped up, went back into the living room, and sat on the couch. Appellant sat down beside her and touched the victim\u2019s vagina with his index finger for about two minutes. He also took the victim\u2019s hand and placed it on his penis. The victim jumped up, told appellant that he had to leave, and opened the door for him to do so. Once appellant had gone, the victim telephoned her mother at work, waiting until her mother came home to tell her everything. Her mother then called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The detective who investigated the incident testified at trial. Appellant stated that he was born on April 19, 1929. Appellant told the detective that the victim took his hand, placed it between her legs, and said, \u201cI did it for my daddy.\u201d Later, she touched him and said \u201cNow my father can get you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Appellant\u2019s brother, Phillip, testified at trial on appellant\u2019s behalf. Phillip described the nature of the relationship that existed between appellant and appellant\u2019s son, the victim\u2019s father. Phillip stated that the victim\u2019s father visited Phillip at his place of employment and told Phillip that he was \u201cgoing to get [appellant] one way or another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Before trial, appellant subpoenaed the victim\u2019s school records from the Montgomery County Board of Education (the Board). Relying on COMAR 13A.08.02.20B, the Board responded by filing a motion for a protective order. At the hearing on the motion, appellant argued that the school records were integral to an effective cross-examination of the victim, <em>i.e., </em>to demonstrating the victim\u2019s credibility as a witness by exploring motivation, bias, and veracity. Appellant proffered that the victim attended a \u201cspecial class<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>room\u201d because of an\u2019 \u201cemotional disturbance,\u201d and suggested that this was an area to be explored because there could be \u201ca physical basis that would relate to her capacity to observe and relate,\u201d or \u201ca mental deficiency leading to an inability to control actions.\u201d Further, appellant indicated that \u201cextreme antagonism had existed for a number of years between himself and the victim\u2019s father.\u201d Thus, if the victim were aware of that hostility, it could have biased her or even have caused her to fabricate the incident. After an <em>in camera </em>review of the school records, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied appellant access to the records because the court found nothing in the record that would be admissible for impeachment purposes. As a result, the court concluded that the victim\u2019s privacy interests weighed against disclosure of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">At the end of the trial, a jury convicted appellant of one count of child abuse. The court declared a mistrial on the other counts of third degree sexual offense because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. On February 23, 1990, the court sentenced appellant to eighteen months in prison, all but one year suspended, with a two-year probation period that was to begin upon appellant\u2019s release. Appellant filed a notice of appeal on March 5, 1990 and asks the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">I. Was the evidence legally sufficient to permit any rational trier of fact to find that appellant had the permanent or temporary care, custody, or responsibility for supervision of the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">II. Did the trial court commit reversible error when it granted the Board of Education\u2019s motion for a protective order, thus denying appellant access to the victim\u2019s school records?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>When an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, the standard that it must apply is \u201cwhether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830 (1980). The standard does not require a court to \u201c \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2788-89 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted); <em>Tichnell, </em>287 Md. at 717, 415 A.2d 830. Rather, the appellate court must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789 (emphasis in original); <em>Tichnell, </em>287 Md. at 717, 415 A.2d 830. The standard is the same whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 535-37, 573 A.2d 831 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Article 27, section 35A(b) states that \u201c[a] parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a child who causes abuse to the child is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding 15 years.\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 35A(b) (1987 &amp; Supp. 1990). Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the requirement that he have \u201cpermanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision\u201d of his granddaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The phrase \u201cpermanent or temporary care or custody\u201d encompasses all persons who stand <em>in loco parentis </em>to a child, <em>i.e., </em>one who intentionally assumes the parental status and discharges parental duties, not just those who have custody by judicial decree. <em>Pope v. State, </em>284 Md. 309, 321-23, 396 A.2d 1054 (1979). The Court of Appeals has noted, however, that the phrase is not synonymous with \u201cresponsibility for the supervision of,\u201d because the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ture added the latter provision three years after it had enacted the former into law. <em>Id. </em>at 322, 396 A.2d 1054. <em>\u201cA </em>person may have the responsibility for the supervision of a minor child in the contemplation of \u00a7 35A although not standing in loco parentis to that child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 396 A.2d 1054. It is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">self-evident that responsibility for supervision of a minor child may be obtained only upon the mutual consent, expressed or implied, by the one legally charged with the care of the child and by the one assuming the responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he existence of the requisite responsibility is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d <em>Newman v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 85, 99, 499 A.2d 492 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">We hold that the evidence in this case, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, was sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had assumed responsibility for the supervision of the victim. The victim, a twelve-year-old girl, was at home alone while her mother was at work. The victim called her mother for permission to go to the movies and out to lunch when the previously arranged \u2014 and presumably, previously approved \u2014 plan for appellant and the victim to visit the zoo did not work out. The victim\u2019s mother subsequently granted the victim permission to accompany appellant. A jury might reasonably infer that the victim\u2019s mother <em>impliedly </em>agreed to give responsibility for the victim to appellant when she gave the victim permission to accompany him and that appellant accepted that responsibility when he took the victim from her home. We hold that the record evidence is sufficient to reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred when it granted the Board\u2019s motion for a protective order. Appellant argues that by denying the motion, the court violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>his rights under the federal and state constitutions. Specifically, appellant claims that the trial court denied him his right to confront his accusers, his right to compulsory process, his right to effective assistance of counsel, and his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">In <em>State v. Runge, </em>817 Md. 613, 614, 566 A.2d 88 (1989), the Court of Appeals recently addressed whether a criminal defendant charged with child abuse was entitled to the disclosure of the county department of social services\u2019 records pertaining to the victim. Because the defendant in that case based his claim of entitlement <em>solely </em>on the statute which regulates the disclosures of such records, the Court of Appeals did not apply disclosure principles established in other cases. <em>See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987). Thus, we find <em>Runge </em>inapposite to the instant case and rely on the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987), to support our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In <em>Ritchie, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the question \u201cwhether and to what extent a State\u2019s interest in the confidentiality of its investigative files concerning child abuse must yield to a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to discover favorable evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42-43, 107 S.Ct. at 993-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The State had charged Ritchie with various sexual offenses against his 13-year-old daughter. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 107 S.Ct. at 994. During pretrial discovery, Ritchie subpoenaed records that pertained to his daughter from Children and Youth Services (CYS), a state agency responsible for the investigation of suspected child abuse. <em>Id. </em>Ritchie hoped to find in those records a medical report, witness names, and other unspecified exculpatory evidence that he could use in his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 107 S.Ct. at 994. CYS refused to release the records on the grounds that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>privileged under Pennsylvania law. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 107 S.Ct. at 994. The state statute provided that all information related to a CYS investigation must be kept confidential, subject to certain exceptions. <em>Id. </em>at 43-44, 107 S.Ct. at 994. One such exception was that CYS could release its records to \u201c \u2018a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a court order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 107 S.Ct. at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The trial court held a hearing on Ritchie\u2019s motion for sanctions, which he filed when CYS failed to release the records. <em>Id. </em>Without examining the records, the court accepted the agency\u2019s assertion that there was no medical report in the records. <em>Id. </em>The trial court then denied Ritchie\u2019s motion and refused to order CYS to disclose the records. <em>Id. </em>At the end of trial, the jury convicted Ritchie on all counts and the court sentenced him to 3 to 10 years in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 45, 107 S.Ct. at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Ritchie appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, contending that the lower court\u2019s failure to disclose the CYS records violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>The Superior Court held that there had been a constitutional violation and thus vacated the conviction and remanded the case. <em>Id. </em>On the confrontation issue, the court held that Ritchie was not entitled to full disclosure. <em>Id. </em>The trial court was to review the records <em>in camera </em>and release only those verbatim statements that his daughter had made to the CYS counselor. <em>Id. </em>Then, the court was to make the entire record available to Ritchie\u2019s lawyer to allow him to argue the relevance of those statements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">On further appeal, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decision to vacate and remand the case to determine whether there should be a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 46, 107 S.Ct. at 995. That court, however, concluded that Ritchie \u2014 through counsel \u2014 was entitled to review the entire record for useful evidence. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the trial court had violated Ritchie\u2019s rights under both the Confrontation Clause and the Compulsory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Process Clause<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when it denied him access to the file because he lost \u201cthe opportunity to have the records reviewed by \u2018the eyes and the perspective of an advocate,\u2019 who may see relevance in places that a neutral judge would not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The United States Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\n<em>Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The Court began by noting that the Confrontation Clause gives criminal defendants \u201cthe right to physically face those who testify against [them], and the right to conduct cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 107 S.Ct. at 998. Ritchie alleged that the trial court violated his right of cross-examination when it denied him access to the records because he needed that information to formulate his defense. <em>Id. </em>That is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXY\">\u201che did not know which types of questions would best expose the weaknesses in her testimony\u201d without the information in the CYS records. <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that \u201cthe right to confrontation is a <em>trial </em>right\u201d, designed to prevent improper restrictions on the types of questions that defense counsel may ask during cross-examination.[ ] The ability to question adverse witnesses, however, does not include the power to require the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that might be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 52-53, 107 S.Ct. at 998-99 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). Thus, the Court concluded that the lower court did not violate the Confrontation Clause when it withheld the CYS records. <em>Id. </em>at 54, 107 S.Ct. at 989. Such a violation would have occurred <em>only </em>if the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>prevented Ritchie\u2019s lawyer from cross-examining Ritchie\u2019s daughter. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\n<em>Compulsory Process Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABX\">The Court then turned to the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of compulsory process. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 107 S.Ct. at 1000. The Court found that prior cases had established, \u201cat a minimum, that criminal defendants have the right to the government\u2019s assistance in compelling the attendance of favorable witnesses at trial and the right to put before a jury evidence that might influence the determination of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 107 S.Ct. at 1000. The Court explained that it had \u201cnever squarely held that the Compulsory Process Clause guarantees the right to discover the <em>identity </em>of witnesses, or to require the government to produce exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Rather, the Court indicated that it had traditionally evaluated claims such as Ritchie\u2019s under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>As a result, the Court concluded that a due process analysis was a more appropriate framework for review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">Because the applicability of the Sixth Amendment to this type of case is unsettled, and because our Fourteenth Amendment precedents addressing the fundamental fairness of trials establish a clear framework for review, we adopt a due process analysis for purposes of this case. Although we conclude that compulsory process provides no <em>greater </em>protections in this area than those afforded by due process, we need not decide today whether and how the guarantees of the Compulsory Process Clause differ from those of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is enough to conclude that on these facts, Ritchie\u2019s claims more properly are considered by reference to due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ake\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Due process requires a state to \u201cturn over evidence in its possession that is both favorable to the accused and materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>al to guilt or punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 107 S.Ct. at 1001. \u201c \u2018Evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Because the state statute allowed for disclosure in certain circumstances, the Court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that \u201cno materiality inquiry was required because the statute rendered] the contents of the file privileged,\u201d and that \u201c[rjequiring disclosure ... would override the Commonwealth\u2019s compelling interest in confidentiality on the mere speculation that the file \u2018might\u2019 have been useful to the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the legislature \u201ccontemplated <em>some </em>use of CYS records in judicial proceedings,\u201d the Court reasoned, \u201cwe therefore have no reason to believe that relevant information would not be disclosed when a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the information is \u2018material\u2019 to the defense of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58, 107 S.Ct. at 1001-02. The Court affirmed the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cto the extent it order[ed] a remand for further proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, the Court agreed that Ritchie was entitled to have the trial court review the CYS file to determine whether it held information that \u201cprobably would have changed the outcome of his trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The Court next addressed the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s holding that a defendant is entitled \u2014 through counsel \u2014 to full access to <em>all </em>of the confidential information and to present arguments in favor of disclosure. The Court noted that it had never held \u2014 even absent a statute that restricted disclosure \u2014 that a defendant alone may determine the materiality of information. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 107 S.Ct. at 1002. The State decides which information it will disclose when a defendant makes only a general request for exculpatory information. \u201cDefense counsel has no constitutional right to conduct his own search of the State\u2019s files to argue relevance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The Court concluded that Ritchie\u2019s interest in a fair trial would be fully protected by having the trial court do an <em>in camera </em>review of the CYS records. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 107 S.Ct. at 1002. The Court acknowledged that its ruling would deprive Ritchie of \u201cthe benefits of an \u2018advocate\u2019s eye.\u2019 \u201d It noted, however, that the limitations on the trial court\u2019s discretion in such matters, would protect his interests in a fair trial, <em>e.g., </em>the ongoing duty of the trial court to disclose information at whatever point that information might become material. To decide otherwise would compromise the State\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in protecting sensitive child abuse information. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In this case, appellant subpoenaed the victim\u2019s school records for use in cross-examination. The Board sought a protective order in response. The court granted the protective order after it reviewed the records <em>in camera </em>and found that the records contained no material relevant to appellant\u2019s defense. Appellant now contends that this constitutes reversible error. We think that the fact pattern and the statute in this case are virtually identical to those in <em>Ritchie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Maryland carefully regulates the disclosure of personally identifiable information from a student\u2019s education records. <em>See </em>Md.Regs.Code tit. 13, \u00a7 13.08.02.19-.31 (1989). A school or educational institution generally may not disclose such information without the written consent of a student\u2019s parent or guardian. <em>Id. </em>at 13A.08.02.19. There are a few limited exceptions, however, including a disclosure \u201c[t]o comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena\u201d so long as the school or educational institution attempts to notify the student or the student\u2019s parent or guardian in advance of its compliance with the order. <em>Id. </em>at 13A.08.02.-20A(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Appellant argues that the trial court violated his right to confrontation and his right to compulsory process under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Sixth Amendment of the federal constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights when it granted the Board\u2019s protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>Ritchie </em>made clear that the right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the federal constitution is a <em>trial </em>right whose purpose is to prevent the court from unnecessarily limiting the scope or the nature of defendant\u2019s cross-examination at trial. \u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause only guarantees \u2018an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 107 S.Ct. at 999 (citation omitted). Thus, the sixth amendment right to confrontation is inapplicable under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Appellant further argues that we should find a violation of the right to confrontation under Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. We decline his invitation to do so. The confrontation right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 express \u201c \u2018the same right,\u2019 \u201d <em>Gregory v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 297, 305, 391 A.2d 437 (1978); <em>Crawford v. State, </em>282 Md. 210, 211, 383 A.2d 1097 (1978), and we see no reason to interpret Article 21 differently under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court also violated his right to compulsory process under the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">In <em>Ritchie, </em>the Supreme Court chose to analyze the facts of that case under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause which ensures the fundamental fairness of trials. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 107 S.Ct. at 1000. The Court did so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>because the applicability of the Compulsory Process Clause to \u201cthis type of case\u201d was \u201cunsettled\u201d and because the Court traditionally had evaluated claims such as Ritchie\u2019s under \u201cthe broader protections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Because the fact pattern and the statute at issue in this case are virtually identical to those in <em>Ritchie, </em>appellant\u2019s claim of a compulsory process violation under the federal constitution must fail. We agree with the Court\u2019s rationale for using a due process analysis and adopt that \u201cframework for review\u201d because of the similarities between the two cases. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 107 S.Ct. at 1001. We therefore do not address appellant\u2019s compulsory process guarantees under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. We do not believe that compulsory process would give appellant any greater protection than that afforded by due process and we do not address \u201cwhether and how the guarantees of the Compulsory Process Clause differ from those of the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 56, 107 S.Ct. at 1001, or from those of Article 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Appellant contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because the trial court denied him access to the victim\u2019s school records. He argues that counsel could not be \u201ceffective\u201d because of \u201cthe potential lack of information pertinent either to guilt or innocence and the ability to use that information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Because appellant cites no authority to support this argument, we decline to address it further. We do not think that denying appellant access to the victim\u2019s records rendered counsel ineffective in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>3.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Appellant asks us to \u201cfashion relief pursuant to the due process clause of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d That is, appellant asks us to give a broader interpretation to the Due Process Clause of the State\u2019s constitution than the Supreme Court gave to the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause and to hold that appellant \u2014 through counsel \u2014 has the right to inspect the victim\u2019s school records.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u201c[S]imilar provisions within the Maryland and United States Constitutions are independent and separate from each other.\u201d <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>307 Md. 233, 245, 513 A.2d 299 (1986). Comparable provisions of the two constitutions, however, generally are considered to be in <em>pari materia, id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also Crawford v. State, </em>285 Md. 431, 452 n. 3, 404 A.2d 244 (1979) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018due process of law\u2019 in the federal constitution has been equated with the phrase \u2018Law of the land\u2019 in the Maryland Constitutional declaration that \u2018no man ought to be ... deprived of his life, liberty or property, but ... by the Law of the land.\u2019 \u201d). We see no reason to construe and apply Article 24 any differently than the Supreme Court did the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s due process analysis in <em>Ritchie, </em>appellant was entitled to have the trial court review <em>in camera </em>the victim\u2019s school records to determine whether they contained information that might be material to his defense, <em>i.e., </em>to see if they contained information that, if disclosed, might change the outcome of the trial. At the hearing on the motion for the protective order, appellant had the opportunity to proffer the type of information that he sought from the records. Appellant explained that because the victim had an emotional disability requiring special education, he needed to know the nature and extent of that disability to establish the victim\u2019s competency to testify, and also her credibility, motivation, and bias. Because of the long history of hostility between appellant and his son, the victim\u2019s father, appellant wanted to examine the records to determine whether the victim identified complete<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ly with her father or if there was a history of acting out or lying in school. The court conducted an <em>in camera </em>review of the records immediately following appellant\u2019s proffer. The court concluded that there was nothing in the records that would be relevant for impeachment purposes. Despite this, appellant still complains that the <em>in camera </em>review by the trial court alone effectively deprives the court of the \u201cbenefit of an \u2018advocate\u2019s eyes.\u2019 \u201d He argues that <em>in camera </em>review in counsel\u2019s presence furthers the objective of the adversary system by counsel\u2019s assistance in identification and refinement of the issues.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In <em>Ritchie, </em>the Court noted that \u201c[djefense counsel has no constitutional right to conduct his own search of the State\u2019s files to argue relevance,\u201d and held that an <em>in camera </em>review of the CYS files by the trial court was sufficient to protect Ritchie\u2019s interest in a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>S.Ct. at 1002. Although the Court recognized that its decision deprived Ritchie of \u201cthe benefits of an \u2018advocate\u2019s eye,\u2019 \u201d the Court believed that allowing full disclosure of the files would \u201csacrifice unnecessarily the Commonwealth\u2019s compelling interest in protecting its child abuse information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">In this case, the victim had an emotional disability or other problem that required special education. The school records contained not only evaluations of her performance and potential, but also psychological evaluations of the victim. Having determined that nothing in the records was relevant to appellant\u2019s purposes, the court concluded that the State\u2019s strong interest in protecting the privacy of its students generally, and this student particularly, outweighed appellant\u2019s need for disclosure of the records. Having carefully reviewed the subject records, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it granted the Board\u2019s motion for a protective order. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>854 F.2d 273, 278 (7th Cir.1988) (no abuse of discretion when trial court, after <em>in camera </em>review, denied defendant\u2019s motion for production of entire contents of FBI\u2019s informant file); <em>see also Couser v. State, </em>282 Md. 125, 140, 383 A.2d 389 (1978) (request for production of documents in the State\u2019s control ordinarily within the trial court\u2019s discretion); <em>Williams v. Moran, </em>248 Md. 279, 291, 236 A.2d 274 (1967) (administration of discovery rules lies within the trial court\u2019s discretion, which will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse); <em>Craig v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 250, 271, 544 A.2d 784 (1988) (trial court did not err when it refused to disclose to defendant accused of child sexual abuse therapist\u2019s notes containing statements of child witnesses and other related information), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>316 Md. 551, 560 A.2d 1120 (1989), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\">.

Under Seal, </em>774 F.2d 624, 627 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\">. Appellant also argues that because defense counsel laid a foundation for some finding of relevancy, the court should have ordered disclosure on that basis pursuant to <em>Eiler v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 439, 492 A.2d 1320 (1985). In <em>Eiler, </em>defense counsel had proffered that the State's key witness probably suffered from a mental disorder and that said disorder could affect her ability to perceive and relate accurately the events about which she testified. <em>Id. at </em>450, 492 A.2d 1320. Defense counsel offered the testimony of a psychiatrist as to the witness\u2019s psychological diagnosis and the dosage and type of medication prescribed for her. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 492 A.2d 1320. The trial court refused to allow the psychiatrist to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 492 A.2d 1320. On review of the record, we concluded \"that Inquiry was likely to disclose defects in relevant factors of credibility.\u201d Id. at 450, 492 A.2d 1320. Consequently, we held that the psychiatrist/patient privilege \u2014 even though applicable \u2014 could not \"prohibit the liberal, but careful, allowance of exploratory questions [on cross-examination] into [the witness\u2019s] mental condition for the purpose of testing her credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451, 492 A.2d 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em>Eiler </em>is inapposite. The trial court permitted appellant to cross-examine the victim about the hostile relationship that existed between appellant and his son, the victim's father, and also about those matters in her educational background that were relevant to her credibility. Thus, there was no restriction on appellant's cross-examination of the victim in this case as there was in <em>Eiler. </em>The only restriction in this case pertained to appellant\u2019s access to the victim\u2019s school records. As such, it is irrelevant whether appellant\u2019s proffer was adequate; materiality is the sole criterion for disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
