[them].\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These words of wisdom set the tone for this appeal. Warren A. Waddell (appellant) complains to us about a conviction of first degree murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>a violent crime. He contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was denied a fair trial because the trial court made improper comments suggesting his guilt. We agree that one of the comments potentially was so damaging that it deprived appellant of his right to a fair trial. Consequently, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Appellant and Carlton Robinson were co-workers at the Precision Concrete Company. Early in the morning of November 9, 1988, someone shot Robinson to death in Baltimore City. No one saw the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Appellant was charged with Robinson\u2019s murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of that murder. He was tried by jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on October 24, 1989, the Hon. Elsbeth Bothe presiding. At trial, Robert Kline, the supervisor at Precision Concrete, for Robinson and appellant, testified that the day before he was killed, Robinson had teased and aggravated appellant \u2014 calling him a \u201cdickhead\u201d \u2014 while they were at work. The comments upset appellant, who then made remarks to the effect that he could \u201cget\u201d Robinson and the others who were teasing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Robinson was shot with both copper jacketed and hollow point bullets. A firearms expert testified that the bullets had been fired from a semi-automatic pistol made by any one of seven weapons manufacturers. Two witnesses testified that appellant owned a weapon produced by one of these seven manufacturers and that appellant always loaded his gun with a \u201cmix,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>he alternated solid and hollow point bullets when he loaded the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Two police officers, who arrived at the scene within minutes of the dispatcher\u2019s call, testified that Robinson was conscious and that he named appellant as the person who shot him. The two paramedics who arrived shortly thereafter testified that Robinson repeatedly said \u201c[H]elp me, I\u2019m dying\u201d and described how \u201chis friend\u201d had shot him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Other testimony established appellant\u2019s behavior after the shooting, <em>i.e., </em>he told the Precision Concrete supervisor that he wanted to get his paycheck \u201cto get out of town\u201d and that he had a passport. Over objection, the court permitted witnesses to testify about appellant\u2019s responses to their statements implying that appellant was the killer, including appellant\u2019s statements indicating his intent to obtain counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The jury found appellant guilty of first degree murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. On November 29,1989, the court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the murder conviction. The court also imposed a consecutive sentence of 20 years imprisonment for the handgun conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Appellant noted an appeal to this Court on December 13, 1989, asking whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">I. the trial court\u2019s comments suggesting appellant\u2019s guilt deprived him of a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">II. appellant was denied a fair trial because the State offered evidence of his plans to obtain counsel to ' show a consciousness of guilt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">III. the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted two lay witnesses to identify and to testify on ballistics;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">IV. the trial court improperly restricted appellant\u2019s cross-examination of two State\u2019s witnesses; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">V. the trial court erred when it refused to grant appellant\u2019s requested jury instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">We shall reverse because of a single remark made by the trial judge which potentially was so damaging that we believe it deprived appellant of the opportunity for a fair trial. We also address the remaining issues to assist the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Appellant contends that on innumerable occasions during trial, the trial judge interrupted counsel, questioned witnesses, and interjected comments as to factual matters. Although appellant concedes that <em>\u201csome of these </em>remarks arguably might be considered clarification of counsel\u2019s questions, [he argues that] others range far beyond the prerogative of the trial court to aid in the questioning of a witness when counsel\u2019s questions are unclear or embarrassing.\u201d <em>See Bell v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 669, 677, 429 A.2d 300 (1981). As a result, appellant claims that the judge did not preserve an attitude of impartiality, thereby depriving appellant of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We have carefully considered all of those interruptions, questions, and interjections by the trial judge that appellant has noted in his brief. Although the trial judge sometimes inappropriately asked questions and interjected comments, we do not believe that individually or cumulatively they warrant reversal <em>save </em>for the sole comment on which we have decided to reverse. That comment occurred in the following context: The Precision Concrete supervisor, Robert Kline, testified that appellant continued to carry a gun to work even after he had ordered appellant not to do so. On direct examination, the trial judge expressed her disbelief by repeatedly asking questions such as \u201cAnd you just let him do it?\u201d On cross-examination, defense counsel asked the supervisor why he permitted appellant to come to work if he knew that appellant was armed. The supervisor responded that he was familiar with the area in which appellant lived and understood why appellant might feel the need for protection. Here, the trial judge \u2014 in full hearing of the jury \u2014 said, <em>\u201cYou know different now.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">As appellant notes in his brief, the meaning of this comment is crystal clear. The judge meant by her remark that Kline now knew that appellant carried the gun for reasons other than just protection, the \u201cindisputable implication\u201d being that appellant had shot and killed Carlton Robinson. We find no other possible construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>judge\u2019s remark except for this one, which presupposes appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We have warned this trial judge on at least two prior occasions that she should act with restraint during trial to avoid the appearance of prejudice against the accused. <em>See McMillian v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 21, 499 A.2d 192 (1985), and <em>Ferrell v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 627, 536 A.2d 99 (1988), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>318 Md. 235, 567 A.2d 937 (1990). Although we concluded in both <em>McMillian </em>and <em>Ferrell </em>that the judge\u2019s interruptions, comments, and questions were not \u201ctantamount to reversible error,\u201d we admonished her for not having \u201cexercised greater restraint.\u201d <em>Ferrell, 73 </em>Md.App. at 639, 536 A.2d 99; <em>McMillian, </em>65 Md.App. at 27, 499 A.2d 192. We further stated in, <em>Ferrell </em>that \u201c[w]hen a judge interjects himself or herself into a case to any significant extent, as, despite prior admonitions from this Court, Judge Bothe seems wont to do, he or she invites this kind of argument and risks not only a reversal of the conviction but embarrassing censure as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>73 Md.App. at 638-39, 536 A.2d 99 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Our admonitions appear to have had little effect. The comment that the judge interjected during the supervisor\u2019s testimony was so egregious \u2014 so inflammatory as it were\u2014 that this time we have no choice but to reverse. Through that comment, the judge clearly implied her belief that appellant shot and killed Carlton Robinson. When she did so, she crossed over the line of impartiality and became an advocate for the State. We think that it was impossible for appellant to have had a fair trial under the circumstances. We hold that the judge\u2019s comment suggesting appellant\u2019s guilt constituted reversible error and remand the case to the circuit court for a new trial with a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We now address the remaining issues to assist the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Appellant argues that he was denied a fair trial because the State offered evidence of his plans to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>counsel to show consciousness of guilt. He contends that occurred during the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of the Precision Concrete supervisor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: So you told [Waddell] what? [KLINE]: I told him that I had been called and Carlton [the victim] was shot several times and they said that you were the triggerman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And what did Mr. Waddell say to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">[KLINE]: He said he had to go call the, use the phone and call his lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: So when you confronted Mr. Waddell and he gave his explanation about the gun and said he had to go and make a phone call, was anything else said by you or by him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">[KLINE]: No. Just a few of the men told him\u2014 [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">[THE COURT]: Don\u2019t tell us what other people told him. [THE PROSECUTOR]: We just need from you what you said and what Mr. Waddell said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-13\">[KLINE]: All he said [was] he had to go make a call and call his lawyer. Then he was like real scared. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\">[THE COURT]: He can tell us how he acted. But don\u2019t tell us what your conclusions are.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-15\">We previously addressed this issue in <em>Hunter v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 679, 573 A.2d 85 (1990). In <em>Hunter, </em>the defendant was tried and convicted of negligent homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated, driving while intoxicated, and failure to control vehicle speed to avoid collision. <em>Id. </em>at 679, 573 A.2d 85. On defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination at trial, the investigating officer injected into her testimony the fact that the defendant called his attorney immediately after the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 683, 573 A.2d 85. The prosecutor returned to the matter of the attorney when he cross-exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ined the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 573 A.2d 85. After the defendant confirmed that he had called his attorney, the prosecutor asked <em>why </em>he had done so. <em>Id. </em>The court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection to the question and the defendant responded, \u201cTo see if he would defend me.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">On appeal, the defendant complained that the court erred when it admitted testimony about the defendant\u2019s telephone call to his attorney immediately after the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 573 A.2d 85. We held that although the officer\u2019s testimony was inappropriate and outside the scope of defense counsel\u2019s questions \u2014 and thus was volunteered \u2014 defense counsel made no timely motion to strike that part of her testimony at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 685-86, 573 A.2d 85. Thus, the defendant could not later complain of it. <em>Id. </em>at 686, 573 A.2d 85. That did not finish the matter, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We went on to say that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">[t]he cognizable error came not during the [officer\u2019s] testimony ... but on the cross-examination of [the defendant]. When the prosecutor not only returned to that testimony but demanded that appellant explain <em>why </em>he called his lawyer just minutes after involvement in a serious accident, an objection <em>was </em>made, and it was overruled. It was <em>that </em>question and answer, more than the statements of ... [the officer], that formed the foundation of the prosecutor\u2019s consciousness of guilt argument in this case. The seeds of the argument were in the admission that the call was made to see if the lawyer would \u2018defend me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 686, 573 A.2d 85 (emphasis in original). We found that the defendant did not waive his complaint and that it was a valid one. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Although the sixth amendment right to counsel did not protect the defendant because he obtained counsel before any judicial proceedings had begun, <em>ie., </em>before his sixth amendment right to counsel had attached, <em>see Kirby v. Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 688-89, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 1881-82, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972); <em>see also Hunter, </em>82 Md.App. at 689-90, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>573 A.2d 85, Judge Wilner noted that such evidence still was impermissible. An individual\u2019s right to seek counsel is not limited to the specific right conferred by the sixth amendment or by its state counterpart, the Maryland Declaration of Rights, art. 21. An individual has an independent right \u201cto seek legal advice or representation at anytime, on any matter, and for any reason,\u201d <em>Hunter, </em>82 Md.App. at 690-91, 573 A.2d 85, that is protected by the fourteenth amendment due process clause and its state counterpart, the Maryland Declaration of Rights, art. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Judge Wilner then went on to explain for the court that such evidence was irrelevant purely as an evidentiary matter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">[T]he exercise of this right does not imply a consciousness of guilt. In seeking legal advice or representation, the person may well believe himself capable of some tortious or criminal conduct. But he may just as well believe himself entirely innocent or only partly culpable, or he simply may not know whether his acts or omissions are in violation of law. And if he has some pre-formed belief as to his culpability or innocence, that belief may turn out to be unfounded. Indeed, common human experience would suggest that, absent some special circumstance not evident here, the most likely purpose for seeking legal advice or representation is to find out what one\u2019s status and exposure may be. If there is a rational inference to be drawn from the seeking of such advice or representation therefore, it cannot be more than that \u2014 an uncertainty. To draw an inference of consciousness of guilt from the seeking of such advice, then, is both illogical and unwarranted; the fact to be inferred \u2014 the consciousness of guilt \u2014 is not made more probable (or less probable) from the mere seeking of legal advice or representation, and so evidence of the predicate fact is simply irrelevant. On pure evidentiary grounds, it is inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 691, 573 A.2d 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Thus, our holding that the State may not \u201coffer evidence of, or comment upon, a criminal defendant\u2019s obtention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>counsel ... to show a consciousness of guilt\u201d was based on two premises. <em>Id. </em>at 686, 573 A.2d 85. First, that the fourteenth amendment due process clause and its State counterpart, Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, protects at all times and under all circumstances an individual\u2019s right to seek counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 690-91, 573 A.2d 85. And second, as a purely evidentiary matter, an individual\u2019s exercise of that right is irrelevant because it can only demonstrate that person\u2019s uncertainty about his or her legal status and exposure to liability. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 573 A.2d 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In this case, the State contends that appellant failed to preserve this issue for appellate review because he did not move to strike the supervisor\u2019s testimony. Even if preserved, the State argues that this case differs from <em>Hunter </em>because \u201cthe State did not elicit the contested evidence, nor did the prosecutor attempt to use appellant\u2019s intent to call an attorney to show his consciousness of guilt.\u201d The State contends that because the witness volunteered the information in response to the general question \u201cAnd what did Mr. Waddell [appellant] say to that?\u201d that the State did not \u201coffer\u201d the evidence and certainly did not offer it to show consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Had the prosecutor in this case ended his inquiry after the witness\u2019s first statement, we might be inclined to agree that the witness made the statement in passing. The prosecutor\u2019s question arguably was proper in form, and although defense counsel objected to the question, he did not move to strike the answer. The prosecutor, however, did not stop here, but led the witness to repeat his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">An attorney\u2019s responsibility for investigating and preparing a case before litigation includes meeting with witnesses and reviewing their testimony before trial. Under the circumstances, the prosecutor simply should not have led the witness to repeat his statement. Because defense counsel made a timely and appropriate objection to the repeated testimony, we find that appellant did not waive his complaint and that it is a valid one.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>It is true that the prosecutor in this case did not use the testimony to the same extent that the prosecutor in <em>Hunter </em>did to show consciousness of guilt. That is, the prosecutor in this case never asked the supervisor further questions about appellant\u2019s statement or raised the issue in closing argument. But, we disagree that absent a direct suggestion from the prosecutor, there was no basis from which the jury could infer that appellant\u2019s intent to call a lawyer was evidence of a guilty mind. A juror, even without the prosecutor\u2019s suggestive comments, easily might infer from the witness\u2019s testimony that appellant planned to obtain counsel because he had done something for which he needed a lawyer to defend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Appellant obtained counsel before his sixth amendment right to counsel had attached, <em>i.e., </em>before any judicial proceedings had begun. Like the defendant in <em>Hunter, </em>however, appellant had an independent right to seek legal counsel that was protected by the fourteenth amendment due process clause and the Maryland Declaration of Rights, art. 24. <em>Id. </em>at 690-91, 573 A.2d 85. The fact that appellant exercised this right does not imply a consciousness of guilt. As Judge Wilner explained in <em>Hunter, </em>the only rational inference to be drawn from appellant\u2019s exercise of this right immediately after the occurrence is \u201can uncertainty,\u201d not consciousness of guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 573 A.2d 85. As an evidentiary matter, the testimony was irrelevant and should not have been admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We believe that the other evidence against appellant \u2014 the fact that after the shooting he no longer carried the handgun which he habitually had worn, that he talked of leaving town and referred to his passport, and that he generally was nervous \u2014 was enough to justify his convictions. We cannot say, however, that the admission of the supervisor\u2019s testimony into evidence was harmless. We trust that the prosecutor will not repeat this error on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Appellant complains that the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted two of the State\u2019s lay witnesses to testify on ballistics. He contends that occurred on the State\u2019s direct examination of two Precision Concrete employees \u2014 supervisor Robert Kline and crew worker Carlos Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The supervisor testified that he had seen Waddell carrying a Beretta. The supervisor also indicated that he knew that the gun contained a \u201cmix\u201d of ammunition because he had seen Waddell load the gun alternately with solid point and hollow point bullets. The supervisor identified solid point and hollow point bullets from a State\u2019s exhibit and testified that they were similar to those used by Waddell. The only \u201copinion\u201d that the supervisor offered was the difference between the two types of bullets upon impact, <em>ie., </em>the solid points remain intact while the hollow points explode.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The crew worker similarly testified that he had seen Waddell carrying a Beretta; further, he knew the gun contained a \u201cmix\u201d of ammunition because he had seen the bullets and because Waddell had told him so. The crew worker likewise identified the solid point and hollow point bullets from the State\u2019s exhibit and indicated that they were similar to those Waddell used in his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">A lay witness may testify and give an opinion on matters as to which he or she has first-hand knowledge. L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 602.1, at 22 (1987); <em>see also Yeagy v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 1, 22-23, 491 A.2d 1199 (1985). Furthermore, \u201c[l]ay opinions ... [that] are rationally based and helpful to the trier of fact will be admissible.\u201d <em>McLain, </em>\u00a7 702.1, at 192. The admission of such testimony lies within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Yeagy, </em>63 Md.App. at 22, 491 A.2d 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">At trial, an expert witness explained that ballistics or firearm examination \u201cdeals with an examination of a firearm or firearm related evidence. Firearm related evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>dence ... pertain[s] to anything that has been fired from or ejected from the firearm such as spent bullets, cartridge cases, residue from the bullets or residues from the weapons. The examination of these items are part of a ... forensic curriculum dealt with in any law enforcement agency, [the] scientific examination of these [sic] evidence [is] to tie it in with a specific case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Neither of the two witnesses claimed that he had examined spent bullets, cartridge cases, or residues in an attempt to connect such evidence with Waddell\u2019s gun. Rather, they merely described the gun and ammunition based on their personal observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The trial court properly admitted the witnesses\u2019 testimony that was based on their firsthand knowledge of Wad-dell\u2019s gun and the ammunition that he used in it. With respect to the supervisor\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d testimony about the difference between the two types of bullets on impact, the trial court admitted that testimony only after it ascertained the supervisor was \u201capparently familiar with ammunition, at least to the point of telling us about [the two types of bullets that Waddell loaded in his gun].\u201d That is, the supervisor had demonstrated that he could distinguish between the two types of ammunition and stated that he had a familiarity with the ammunition from hunting. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the testimony of these two witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Appellant asserts that the trial court improperly restricted him from cross-examining two of the State\u2019s witnesses against him, Detective Garvey and crime lab technician Lisa McKelvie.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Appellant indicated before trial that he wanted to elicit testimony from the detective that a Gerald Parsons had reported seeing a man known as \u201cBlack\u201d or \u201cBlackie\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>running from the scene of the shooting. Because appellant could not locate Parsons to testify at trial, appellant wanted to elicit Parsons\u2019 statements through cross-examination of the detective. The trial court was willing to allow Parsons to testify if located, but would not allow the statements into evidence solely through the detective\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">On direct examination, the detective testified about his contact with appellant when he transported appellant from a Baltimore County precinct to a Baltimore City precinct for charging; he also testified about items seized from appellant at the time of arrest. On cross-examination, the trial court refused to allow appellant to question the detective about the information that Parsons gave him regarding \u201cBlack\u201d or \u201cBlackie.\u201d The court also held that appellant\u2019s requested cross-examination exceeded the scope of direct examination, that it was a \u201cred herring\u201d which would divert the jury\u2019s attention, and that it would be too time-consuming.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Two established principles of law support the court\u2019s exclusion of the detective\u2019s testimony from evidence. First, the trial court has the discretion to limit the scope of cross-examination. <em>Caldwell v. State, </em>276 Md. 612, 618, 349 A.2d 623 (1976). On direct examination, the prosecutor elicited testimony only as to the detective\u2019s contact with appellant during transport and as to the items found on appellant at the time of arrest. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it restricted appellant\u2019s cross-examination of the detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The second legal principle that supports the exclusion of this evidence is the hearsay rule. Under the rule, \u201can out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and thus resting for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court [declarant],\u201d is considered to be hearsay and generally is inadmissible unless it falls under a specific exception to the rule. <em>Cassidy v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 1, 6, 8-9, 536 A.2d 666 (1988). Had the trial court permitted appellant to question the detective, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>would have elicited what Parsons, the out-of-court declarant, had said to the detective. The trial court properly excluded the testimony because it did not qualify under one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 536 A.2d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Appellant also contends that the trial court improperly restricted his cross-examination of the crime lab technician. On direct examination, the technician testified that she did not take any fingerprints from the scene because there were no suitable surfaces. On cross-examination, defense counsel persisted in asking why she had not taken fingerprints from other surfaces such as the victim\u2019s lunch bucket or wallet. The court cut short appellant\u2019s cross-examination as to the lack of fingerprint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u201c[TJrial judges have broad discretion in the conduct of trials in such areas as the reception of evidence.\u201d <em>McCray v. State, </em>305 Md. 126, 133-34, 501 A.2d 856 (1985) (citations omitted). In this case, the technician already had testified on direct examination that she had not taken any fingerprints. The court permitted appellant to cross-examine the technician and to question her judgment in so deciding. Thus, the technician\u2019s testimony at the point when the trial court intervened was sufficient for appellant\u2019s purpose of casting doubt on the police work. The court properly restricted appellant\u2019s cross-examination of the technician.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Appellant also asks whether the trial court erred when it refused to grant his requested jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">At trial, the police officers and the paramedics testified, over objection, about statements that Carlton Robinson made after he was shot. The trial court found that Robinson\u2019s statements were dying declarations and thus admissible hearsay. At the end of the evidence, appellant requested that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the court ... give an instruction on a dying declaration and ask the jury to return a verdict as to whether or not they believe that the declaration that was made fits the criteria as to whether or not the victim was aware of pending death and that statements were made by the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">I think the jury should be able to make the determination as to whether that is a dying declaration and how much weight to give that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">The court denied the requested instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Appellant contends that the court should have given the instruction because it was on an area of law central to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">\u201cIn a criminal case, the only issue for the jury is that of guilt or innocence. Anything that does not bear upon guilt or innocence is utterly foreign to the only task assigned to the jury.\u201d <em>Ehrlich v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 730, 738, 403 A.2d 371 (1979). The admissibility of evidence is thus a question within the sole province of the trial court; the jury is not to decide such matters. <em>Id. </em>at 737, 403 A.2d 371 (quoting <em>Hamilton and Fletcher v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 91, 98, 277 A.2d 460 (1971)). We find that the trial court properly refused to give appellant\u2019s requested instruction. The trial court, not the jury, decides evidentiary matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Appellant also contends that the court erred when it gave the jury the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">Murder in either degree, first or second, is the intentional killing of another human being without excuse, justification or mitigation. There is no evidence in this case that [the victim\u2019s] death was caused by any act or excuse, justification or mitigation on the part of the perpetrator so that you need not consider those factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Appellant specifically contends that the court erred when it stated that there was no evidence of excuse, justification, or mitigation and that the court should have told the jury the legal meaning of those factors so that it could have deliberated on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Maryland Rule 4-325(c) permits the court to instruct the jury on the law applicable to a given case. To that end, subsection (d) allows the court to \u201crefer to or summarize the evidence ... to present clearly the issues to be decided.\u201d There was no evidence of excuse, justification, or mitigation in the instant case. The trial court, rather than improperly commenting on the absence of such evidence, clarified the instructions for the jurors. The court explained which elements were relevant and should be considered in their deliberations and which elements were irrelevant and should be ignored. The court also told the jury that it was the sole trier of fact. The court\u2019s instruction to the jury was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">JUDGMENTS REVERSED; REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR A NEW TRIAL.
