Smith. Except for a short period of time, she continued her services until 1945. During these years the amount paid to her monthly was reduced from time to time. Miss Horacek claims that she accepted these payments on account and not in full satisfaction of wages due to her. The appeal of Smith and his wife Florence is from a judgment against them in an action upon the contract of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The complaint alleges that in 1928 the Smiths employed Miss Horacek as housekeeper at a salary of $75 per month with room and board. Two years later, the appellants advised her \u201cthat they had met with financial reverses and could no longer pay her $75.00 per month but that if she would continue to serve them at whatever they could afford to pay, they would make up the difference when their financial condition improved.\u201d For about five years thereafter, she continued her services, during which time they paid her an average of about $12 per month. In the next five years, she worked as before. However, during this period, she received no monetary consideration, but the Smiths told her that if she would continue to serve them, they would never send her away from their home. They also agreed to provide, when advanced age prevented her from working, room and board in their house, and whatever else she needed, for the balance of her natural life.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Belying upon their promises, the pleading asserts, she continued her services until January, 1945. During these last five years, she received at irregular intervals amounts which would average approximately $12 monthly. In January, 1945, the Smiths advised her that they had no further use for her services, and at that time they packed her belongings and ejected her from her room. By an amendment to the complaint, Miss Horacek alleges her belief \u201cthat defendants\u2019 financial condition did improve during the year 1945 to the point where they could pay her the money claimed to be owing.\u201d Her demand was for $11,600, as the balance of wages accruing since August, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u201e The answer consists of a general denial and several so-called separate defenses, which consist of extensive allegations of evidentiary matter bearing upon the issues already framed by the complaint and the general denial. As barring the action, the statute of limitations (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 339(1)) is also pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The testimony presented upon the trial of these issues shows that Miss Horacek was employed in 1928 by J. K. Smith, the father of Victor B. Smith. J. K. Smith died in 1930, and she continued her duties in the home under the direction of the appellants. According to the testimony of Mrs. Smith, Miss Horacek \u201cwas left to us the same as the house.\u201d A short time later, assertedly due to limited finances, the Smiths began reducing the amount paid to her. There is a direct conflict in the evidence as to the conditions under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Miss Horacek carried on her duties after payment of wages to her at the rate of $75 per month was discontinued. She testified that, in 1931 or 1932, Mrs. Smith came to her and said, \u201cJosephine, I couldn\u2019t pay you any more $75.00 a month.\u201d In reply, said Miss Horacek, \u201cI told Mrs. Smith she could pay me less than $75.00 and when the time would Mr. Smith be promoted he could pay, me the difference.\u201d In answer to the question, \u201cAnd did Mrs. Smith say anything to that ? \u2019 \u2019 Miss Horacek told the jury: \u2018 \u2018 She go on the telephone again and she come back and she said, \u2018Josephine, would you make it $25.00? . . .\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The next conversation as related by Miss Horacek occurred in 1940, at the time of the marriage of one of the appellants\u2019 children. The respondent brought up the matter. \u201cMrs. Smith . . . you tell me everything what is to be done but you don\u2019t tell me nothing about money.\u201d According to Miss Horacek, Mrs. Smith replied, \u201cJosephine, are you going to expose me now?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In 1937, Miss Horacek left the home of the Smiths for several months. She declares that she returned after a conversation with Mr. Smith in which he said that she \u201cshould come back and start work on the old basis.\u201d In August, 1945, Mrs. Smith gave her a letter dated January 26, 1945, which stated, among other things, that \u201cI have always said I would never send you from my home and I repeat again the same statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Smith was that, during the depression, they told Miss Horacek it was impossible for them to continue paying her $75 per month. They then commenced reducing her wages at the rate of $10 per month until 1933, when she was paid $25 per month in addition to* room and board. Each of these reductions was accepted by Miss Horacek, and at no time did they obligate themselves to make any additional payments for her services.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">During 1934, the Smiths said, because of their financial circumstances they left their home and moved to an apartment. When they notified Miss Horacek that they would no longer require her services, she said she did not want to leave. They then informed her that they would keep her but could not afford to pay her any regular salary. This arrangement continued until August of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">In June, 1937, as related by Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Miss Horacek asked them to take her back. They told her they would provide her with room and board and pay such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>amounts as their income allowed. She returned under these conditions, but because of ill health her services were sporadic. Early in 1945, Miss Horacek accepted other employment and left their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Upon this evidence the jury returned a verdict in favor of Miss Horacek for $5,970. As grounds for a reversal of the judgment subsequently entered against them, the appellants assert that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; that if they ever attained the ability to pay, they attained it more than two years prior to the commencement of the action, and the statute of limitations now bars recovery; and that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the judgment. They also challenge certain instructions as being prejudicially erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The objection that a complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action may be raised at any stage of the proceedings and, even for the first time upon appeal. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 434.)  Further, in an action upon a contract to pay \u201cwhen able,\u201d the promise is conditional and \u201cno cause of action accrues until the condition is performed, that is to say, until the debtor is able to pay.\u201d <em>(Van Buskirk </em>v. <em>Kuhns, </em>164 Cal. 472 [129 P. 587, Ann.Cas. 1914B 932, 44 L.R.A. N.S. 710].)  Accordingly, a complaint in such an action fails to state a cause of action if it does not include an allegation of the defendant\u2019s ability to pay. But the complaint, as amended, pleads that Miss Horacek \u201cbelieves the defendants\u2019 financial condition did improve during the year 1945 to the point where they could pay her . . .\u201d  Since material facts may be alleged on information and belief (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437), any failure to more specifically state the circumstances in this regard was one of uncertainty or ambiguity which could have been cured if brought to the attention of the trial court. In the absence of a demurrer, such a defect is waived. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Concerning the appellants\u2019 plea of the bar of the statute of limitations, Mr. Smith testified that in 1931 his salary was about $225 per month. In 1931, it was raised to $250, and it progressively increased until August 1, 1944, when it was $550 per month. He was paid at that rate until November 1, 1945, when another increase brought his income to $700 per month, which was the amount received by him at the time the complaint was filed. Miss Horacek testified that Mrs. Smith \u201ctold me when Mr. Smith is going to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the position that Mr. Burk has, then Mr. Burk has about . . . $8,000.00 a year, and then Mr. Smith is going to be able to pay me. \u2019 \u2019 From this evidence the jury could well have concluded that her cause of action did not accrue until November 1,1945, which was less than six months before the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Upon the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding of an agreement to pay Miss Horaeek at a later time the difference between $75 per month and the amounts received by her, the appellants quote extensively from the record and point to many instances of direct conflict in the evidence. It is true that Miss Horaeek\u2019s testimony was vague in many respects, but as a matter of law, the facts related by her are not inherently improbable. The conversations as stated by her and the continuance of her services for the appellants are sufficient evidence to support the finding of the agreement relied upon by her. The trial court\u2019s determination of an issue of fact will not be overturned upon appeal if there is substantial evidence to support the challenged finding. <em>(DeYoung </em>v. <em>DeYoung, </em>27 Cal.2d 521, 526 [165 P.2d 457].)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The appellants complain of an instruction given by the trial judge, which reads: \u201cIt is not necessary that you find whether plaintiff entered into a contract with defendants in which they agreed to hire her as a housekeeper and pay her $75.00 a month and furnish room and board as this is admitted in the answer of the defendants. There are other issues to be determined, however, as follows: (1) Did plaintiff agree at. any time after the hiring to accept less than $75.00 a month as payment in full for the monetary consideration agreed upon with the defendants. (2) Did defendants agree, or lead plaintiff to believe, that when their financial condition improved they would pay plaintiff the difference between the monetary consideration originally agreed upon and the amount actually paid her during the years that she served them. (3) Did the defendant, Florence Smith, make an agreement to keep plaintiff in her home as long as defendants were indebted to plaintiff. (4) Was there an implied understanding between plaintiff and defendants that plaintiff would cancel her debt to them provided they never sent her away from their home. (5) Did plaintiff perform all of the conditions of her agreement on her part to be performed. (6) Did defendants perform all of the conditions of their agreement on their part to be performed. (7) Has plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>been fully compensated in accordance with whatever agreement was entered into. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Reduced to its simplest form and read as a whole, this instruction presented the case as a suit upon the original contract of employment which was adopted by the appellants in July, 1930, and modified by subsequent agreements. By their answer, the appellants admitted that they employed Miss Horaeek in 1930 at the rate of $75 per month with room and board. Miss Horaeek was then required to prove that she continued her employment upon the appellants\u2019 agreement to pay her the difference between the amounts given her from time to time and $75 per month, and to furnish her with a home for the rest of her life. As these were conditional promises, necessarily the jury was required to find whether the respective obligations of the parties had been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The appellants attack each portion of this instruction as being prejudicially erroneous. As to the first sentence, although they admit that it was unnecessary for the jury to determine the existence of the original contract, this is \u201cbecause no part of the cause of action pleaded by plaintiff in her complaint depends in any manner or to any extent upon the existence or non-existence of such original contract. \u2019 \u2019 That position would only be sound if the complaint had pleaded the modification agreement as a novation which extinguished the rights under the original contract. <em>(Beckwith </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>165 Cal. 319 [131 P. 1049]; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Hislop, </em>109 Cal.App. 440 [293 P. 168].) Novation is a matter of intention (Civ. Code, \u00a71531(1)), and neither Miss Horacek\u2019s pleading nor proof indicates any intention of the parties to extinguish the original obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The appellants\u2019 objection to subdivision (1) of the quoted instruction is that it refers to \u201cthe monetary consideration agreed upon.\u201d The objection is grounded upon the premise that the modifying agreement \u201cwhatever its effect, would have superseded the original contract . . .\u201d But the action is based upon the original contract as modified by the parties and not upon a novation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">As to subdivision (2), the appellants contend that the language \u201cDid defendants agree, or lead plaintiff to believe\u201d set up alternatives, one of which was whether they, without intending to do so, led Miss Horaeek to believe that they had committed themselves to further payments to her. The terms of a contract are established, not by the undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>closed intentions of the promisor, but by such words or conduct \u201cas justifies the promisee in understanding that the promisor intended to make a promise. \u2019 \u2019 (Rest, of Contracts, \u00a7 5.) In <em>Hobart </em>v. <em>Hobart Estate Co., </em>26 Cal.2d 412 [159 P.2d 958], cited by appellants, the challenged instruction, by referring to the \u201cabsolute right to rely,\u201d expressly negated the element of justifiable reliance which is implicit in the instruction here attacked. Other objections to this portion of it are wholly insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Further criticism of the instruction is placed upon the ground that subdivision (3) referred to the alleged promise to give plaintiff a home for life, which it is argued was an immaterial issue, with the implication that if the jury found such a promise had been made \u201cthey should decide the case in plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d Again, the nature of the action is misconceived by the appellants. The alleged agreement here referred to was the second modifying agreement testified to by Miss Horacek. The fact that she prays for wages and not specific performance of the agreement to furnish a home does not remove it as an issue in the case. Miss Horacek did not allege or introduce evidence tending to prove a separate contract in this regard; as related by her the Smiths\u2019 promises constituted a modification of the original contract of employment. Evidence as to their conduct tending to prove a breach of the contract as modified, therefore, was properly presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Subdivision (4) of the challenged instruction is attacked because it states, as an issue of the case, whether there was an \u201cimplied understanding\u201d that plaintiff should cancel her debt provided the Smiths never sent her away from their home. Appellant argues that \u201can agreement having such terms would necessarily have had to have been an express contract having an express offer and an express acceptance . . .\u201d No authority is cited for such a conclusion, nor does there seem to be any merit to the argument. Express and implied contracts are both based upon the intention of the parties and are distinguishable only in the manifestations of such assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">It is then said that subdivisions (5) and (6) are defective in that they \u201csound in damages.\u201d The word \u201cdamages\u201d was not used, and as the alleged modifications of the original contract rest upon conditional obligations of the parties, the instruction was proper.  Finally, as to subdivision (7), it is stated: \u201cThe most vicious of all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>seven, subdivisions of this instruction is the seventh. The words \u2018with whatever agreement was entered into\u2019 went beyond the express agreement alleged in the complaint. . . .\u201d But the \u201cexpress agreement alleged\u201d referred to is the first modifying agreement as alleged by Miss Horacek. This is the basis of Miss Horacek\u2019s cause of action and the issue as to whether the original contract to pay her $75 per month had been modified, and if so, to what extent, necessarily was presented to the jury for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Carter, J., Traynor, J., and Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
