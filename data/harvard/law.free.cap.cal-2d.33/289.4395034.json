In seeking such relief, petitioner attacks the validity of the new trial proceedings and claims that the order in determination thereof was void as an act in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, with the result that the judgment theretofore entered remained in full force and effect. Upon such premise petitioner maintains that its demand upon the clerk of the court for issuance of a writ of execution was improperly refused, and in such case \u201cmandamus is the appropriate remedy to enforce the performance of that duty.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>(Kahn </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>23 Cal.2d 12, 14 [142 P.2d 13], and cases there cited.) But petitioner\u2019s contest of the propriety of the order in question upon jurisdictional grounds is not tenable, and it cannot prevail in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Petitioner\u2019s position rests on the following chronology of events: In a damage action entitled <em>\u201cTelefilm, Inc., a Corporation, </em>Plaintiff, v. <em>Harry M. Warner, and others, </em>Defendants,\u201d which was tried with a jury before Honorable Roy Y. Rhodes of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, a verdict was returned in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $300,000. Judgment was entered accordingly on December 11, 1947, and notice of the entry thereof was subsequently served and filed. On December 24, 1947, defendants timely served and filed their joint notice of intention to move for a new trial. On January 10, 1948, Judge Rhodes died. Two days later notice of the hearing of the motion for a new trial was given, and thereafter such motion was assigned to the Honorable Charles S. Burnell, a judge of the same court, for disposition. Meanwhile and on January 23, 1948, plaintiff filed objections to the jurisdiction of the court or any judge thereof\u2014in view of the death of Judge Rhodes, who had tried the case\u2014to \u201chear and determine\u201d the pending motion. On January 27, 1948, plaintiff\u2019s objections were considered and overruled, the motion was thereafter argued on two successive days and then submitted for decision, and on February 5, 1948, the following minute order was made by Judge Burnell: \u201cMotion for new trial granted on following grounds: (1) Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict; (2) The verdict is against law; (3) Errors of law occurring at the trial, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">On March 30, 1948, plaintiff, consistent with its aforestated jurisdictional objections to the new trial proceedings and the validity thereof, made a demand upon the clerk of the court that he issue forthwith a writ of execution in pursuance of the judgment, but he refused to do so. Thereupon plaintiff instituted the present proceeding in mandamus for relief. Respondents superior court, Judge Burnell, the clerk of the court, and the defendants in plaintiff\u2019s damage action have filed a joint demurrer and answer, but it is unnecessary to detail their pleading since the above chronology of facts material to petitioner\u2019s position insofar as it is properly reviewable in this proceeding does not appear to be in dispute. Petitioner is not entitled as a matter of law to the relief here sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Section 661 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides, so far as here pertinent, as follows: \u201cThe motion for a new trial shall be heard and determined by the judge who presided at the trial; provided, however, that in ease of the <em>inability </em>of such judge or if at the time noticed for hearing thereon he is <em>absent </em>from the county where the trial was had, the same shall be heard and determined by any other judge of the same court.\u201d. (Emphasis added.) Petitioner contends that the italicized words as \u201cused in sequence\u201d envisage application to a living person and do not include the concept of death of the trial judge as reason for another judge to act on the motion. Petitioner also emphasizes the statute\u2019s reference to the \u201cinability of <em>such </em>[trial] judge\u201d as connoting a living judge and argues that when a judge dies, he is no longer a public officer\u2014a vacancy exists in the official position that he held while living (Gov. Code, \u00a7 1770)\u2014and after so ceasing to be a judge, he would no longer answer that description as contemplated by the statute. The same reasoning would apply, of course, to a \u201cformer judge\u201d who, because his term of appointment or election has expired, would thereby be excluded from the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">But such restricted view of the statute\u2019s wording appears to be contrary to its purport and intent to provide a comprehensive and adequate basis for the disposition of new trial proceedings. The word \u201cinability\u201d is thus defined: \u201cQuality or state of being <em>unable; </em>lack of ability; want of sufficient power, strength, resources, or capacity.\u201d (Emphasis added; Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary [1948 ed.], p. 1254.) Such all-inclusive choice of terminology evidences the statutory design to encompass thereby a variety of contingencies which would permit litigants to pursue their right to seek a new trial though the trial judge be \u201cunable\u201d to act with regard thereto\u2014^whether the cause of his inability be death or the happening of an equally significant event in life affecting his continued performance of his judicial duties, such as expiration of his term of office, resignation or retirement from service, disqualification, as well as some physical or mental disorder. Consistent with such apparently intended coverage, the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cinability of <em>suck </em>judge\u201d would seem to be a means for identification of the person \u201cwho presided at the trial\u201d rather than a specification for his continued status as a trial judge at the operative time of the statute\u2014when the motion for a new trial is noticed for hearing. (Cf., <em>Warner Bros. Pictures </em>v. <em>Brodel, </em>31 Cal.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>766, 770 [192 P.2d 949].) It is true that the word \u201cinability\u201d was not regarded as including the trial judge\u2019s \u201cabsence\u201d from the jurisdiction because such consideration was expressly added in the section\u2019s amendment in 1931. (Stats. 1931, ch. 768, p. 1608.) But such additional ground for another judge to act in disposition of the new trial proceedings does not indicate the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit thereby the prevailing scope of the terminology of the statute as it had theretofore existed. So pertinent in this connection is the observation in <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>3 Cal.2d 19 [43 P.2d 300], where in discussing the \u201cgeneral requirement\u201d of the statute that a \u201cmotion for a new trial shall be heard and determined by the judge who presided at the trial,\u201d this court noted the \u201cproviso or exception\u201d thereto \u201cin case the judge who presided at the trial is absent from that county where the trial was had, or is <em>otherwise unavailable </em>for the purpose of hearing the motion.\u201d (P. 27; emphasis added.) Manifestly a judge who has died is not only \u201cunable\u201d to act but likewise is \u201cabsent from the county\u201d insofar as the statute contemplates his presence in court to determine litigation\u2014in short, he is \u201cunavailable\u201d on both grounds for the new trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Petitioner likens the definitions of the words \u201cinability\u201d and \u201cdisability\u201d as both referring to \u201cliving persons\u201d and upon such premise of similarity in connotation, cites cases where statutes containing the phrase \u201cdeath or other disability\u201d have been evaluated in the light of their association of terms\u2014\u201cnoseitur a sociis.\u201d Thus petitioner refers to <em>Laumann v. Conner, </em>12 Cal.App.2d 631, 634 [55 P.2d 1225], where the term \u201cdisability\u201d in the phrase appearing in the statute there construed was said to mean \u201ca disability, short of death ... of a physical or mental character,\u201d thereby emphasizing the contraposition of the opposing concepts of life and death. (See, also, <em>Ulmer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>266 P. 176, 180-181.) But there is no such grouping of words in the statute here involved to indicate a like limited meaning when the one comprehensive word \u201cinability\u201d is singly and independently used. The same observation prevails in derogation of the force of petitioner\u2019s listing of constitutional and statutory provisions where the distinction between \u201cdeath\u201d and \u201cinability\u201d (Const., art. V, \u00a7 16) or \u201cdisability\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 953e) or \u201cincapacity\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 512; Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1934, 2355) is expressly made\u2014here, on the contrary, the all-inclusive term \u201cinability\u201d is employed to convey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the statute\u2019s intent to provide a broad base for another judge\u2019s performance of the trial judge\u2019s duties when the latter is \u201cunable\u201d under the prevailing circumstances. Nor does it avail petitioner to cite several cases involving insurance policies, wherein the courts, in differentiating between \u201cdeath\u201d and \u201cdisability\u201d as the terms would ordinarily be used by the parties in such contractual negotiations, have held that \u201cdisability\u201d is not included in \u201cdeath\u201d and that a dead person is not deemed to be \u201cdisabled.\u201d <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>146 Iowa 133 [124 N.W. 898, 28 L.R.A.N.S. 742]; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>305 Ill.App. 537 [27 N.E.2d 548, 550]; <em>Hinkley </em>v. <em>Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>37 F. Supp. 1018, 1023.) Necessarily there in such distinct field of litigation relating to proof of loss under \u201clife\u201d insurance claims, \u201cdisability\u201d would presuppose \u201clife\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d would be the \u201cantithesis\u201d thereof in determining the propriety of \u201cdisability\u201d payments after the insured has died\u2014 but such analyses of the parties\u2019 respective rights commensurate with their private agreements have no significance here in relation to the interpretation of the wording of a statute resting on entirely different legal principles and concerning subject matter in nowise comparable in concept. Obviously such cases have no bearing upon the present problem of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Of course, there can be no question as to the established rule in this state that the authority to seek, and the power of the court to grant, a new trial is statutory, and proceedings therefor must be strictly pursued in the manner provided by law in order that litigants may not lose their rights. <em>(California Imp. Co. </em>v. <em>Baroteau, </em>116 Cal. 136, 138 [47 P. 1018]; <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>189 Cal. 732, 736-737 [210 P. 36]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ibos, </em>22 Cal.App.2d 551, 553 [71 P.2d 847].) But such rule does not require the assignment of \u00e1 restricted and narrow meaning to the wording in question contrary to a fair interpretation of the statute and the purpose of its enactment in providing \u201ca wise procedure for the disposition of\u201d new trial proceedings. <em>(Pappadatos </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>209 Cal. 334, 335 [287 P. 342].) So in <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.2d 19, the advantage of having a motion for a new trial heard and determined by \u201cthe judge who presided at the trial, if . . . available,\u201d since he \u201cis best qualified to rule\u201d thereon because \u201cfamiliar with the facts and law of the case,\u201d is fully discussed and declared to be \u201cthe very essence of\u201d the statute. (Pp. 28-29.) However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>statute also contemplates that circumstances may require some \u201cother judge of the same court\u201d to perform the judicial duties of the trial judge because of the latter\u2019s \u201cinability\u201d or \u201cabsen[ce] from the county,\u201d and it accordingly employs language suggestive of such interpretation as will broaden, rather than narrow, the premise for such other judge\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction so that litigants will not be precluded from availing themselves of their statutory remedy of seeking a new trial. The maxims of jurisprudence that \u201cinterpretation must be reasonable\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3542) and that a statute is to be \u201cliberally construed with a view to effect its objects and to promote justice\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 4) are generally applicable and must be given effect. Certainly the statute here in question should not be narrowly approached contrary to its spirit and intent, and construed in such a manner as would make its application impracticable, unfair, or unreasonable. In line with these considerations, the death of Judge Rhodes, the trial judge in this case, was a circumstance within the contemplation of the statute as permitting Judge Burnell, another \u201cjudge of the same court,\u201d to hear and determine the motion for a new trial here involved, and his order in disposition thereof is not assailable as an act in excess of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Petitioner further objects to the validity of the order granting a new trial because Judge Burnell \u201ceither . . . consider [ed] depositions not in evidence or . . . decid [ed] the motion without sufficient knowledge of the evidence to weigh and consider it.\u201d Such argument presents no jurisdictional issue and accordingly has no pertinency in this proceeding. Under section 661 of the Code of Civil Procedure as above construed, Judge Burnell had the power to make the order in determination of the new trial proceedings, and all clalma in contest of the propriety of such ruling by reason of his alleged consideration of matters \u201cnot in evidence\u201d or reexamination of the record \u201cwithout sufficient knowledge\u201d thereof involve at most questions of error or abuse of discretion, reviewable only on appeal from said order. (Cf., <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>57 Cal.App.2d 968, 972 [136 P.2d 72].)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Petitioner also urges that \u201cby appealing from the judgment, defendants [in the damage action] have elected to treat the order as void\u201d and they \u201ccannot maintain an inconsistent position in this proceeding.\u201d Whether such appeal from the judgment is properly classifiable as no more than \u201cprecautionary\u201d or presents considerations of timeliness upon procedural grounds (see Rules on Appeal, rule 3(a) (2); <em>Spencer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>v. <em>Nelson, </em>30 Cal.2d 162, 164 [180 P.2d 886]), it clearly could not constitute any so-called \u201celection\u201d or \u201cwaiver,\u201d and as a circumstance occurring after entry of the order granting a new trial, it would have no relevancy as a jurisdictional factor in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The alternative writ of mandate heretofore issued is discharged, and the petition for a peremptory writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Gibson, C. J., Edmonds, J., Traynor, J., and Schauer, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b326-6\">SHENK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU4\">In my opinion the Legislature intended to confine the hearing of a motion for a new trial to the judge who tried the case, with the special exceptions noted. Those exceptions are concerned solely with cases of inability of the incumbent judge to act or of his absence from the county, giving to those expressions their ordinarily accepted meanings. There is no indicated intent on the part of the Legislature to accord the new trial procedure to an aggrieved party in every case. In a case not excepted by the statute the obvious result of a failure to obtain the judge who presided at the trial to hear the motion is a denial of the motion by operation of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 660.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Before 1929 there was no statute or rule restricting the hearing on the motion for a new trial to the judge who tried the case. <em>(Atschul </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>48 Cal. 535, 536; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Genshlea, </em>180 Cal. 213 [180 P. 336].) In that year the Legislature (Stats. 1929, p. 842) enacted section 661 of the Code of Civil Procedure requiring a motion for a new trial to be heard by the judge who presided at the trial except in case of the inability of that judge to act, and in 1931 (Stats. 1931, p. 1608), the contingency of absence of the judge from the county was added as a further exception to the general requirement. The provisions were held to be mandatory in <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>3 Cal.2d 19, 27 [43 P.2d 300].</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">It is not the policy of the courts to enlarge express exceptions to a mandatory requirement. The intent of the Legislature seems to be clear, and we are not here concerned with the wisdom of confining exceptions to those expressly enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The right to move for a new trial is statutory and may be pursued only in the manner prescribed by the statute. <em>(Diamond </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>189 .Cal. 732, 736 [210 P. 36] and cases cited.) It must also be taken as unquestionable that the Legislature, in mating exceptions to a general provision, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>tended none other than those expressly stated. It is a cardinal rule of interpretation of statutes that a proviso or exception carved out of the general enactment must he construed strictly, and one who relies on the exception must establish it within the words as well as the reason. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>208 Cal. 282, 285 [281 P. 57]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 141 [10 L.Ed. 689].)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">If the Legislature in enacting provisos to the general provisions of section 661 of the Code of Civil Procedure had intended to include therein the death of the trial judge, the intention would have been indicated as was done in other instances where death was expressly mentioned. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 953e, Stats. 1931, p. 410, death, or other disability; Const., art. Y, \u00a7 16, impeachment, death, inability, resignation or absence from the state; Prob. Code, \u00a7 512, death, disqualification, <em>incapacity; </em>former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 653, death, removal, disqualification, absence or refusal (replaced by Rules on Appeal, rule 51, 22 Cal.2d 33 \u201cunavailable or unable to act\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The policy of rigorous adherence to the words of statutory provisos is not confined to this jurisdiction. In <em>Malony </em>v. <em>Adsit, </em>175 U.S. 281 [20 S.Ct. 115, 44 L.Ed. 163], a bill of exceptions was allowed and signed by the successor, instead of the judge who tried the case required by statute to authenticate the bill. It was held that the judge who signed the bill was without power in the matter. Rule 63 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.A., p. 735) includes the exceptions of death, sickness or other disability. \u201cDisability\u201d as so used was held not to extend to cases of absence. <em>(Norwood </em>v. <em>United States, </em>18 F.2d 577.) Incapacity to act does not include voluntary absence from the state. <em>(In re Hunger, </em>10 App.Div. 347 [41 N.Y.S. 882].) Resignation of the judge who tried the case does not empower another judge to make findings. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Nugent, </em>100 F.2d 215, 217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">I am in agreement with the disposition of this matter by the District Court of Appeal of the Second Appellate District, Division Two (194 P.2d 542). The peremptory writ should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Carter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied February 17,1949. Shenk, J., and Carter, J., voted for a rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
