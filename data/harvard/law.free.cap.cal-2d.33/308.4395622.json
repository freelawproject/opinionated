As grounds for reversal defendant urges: (1) the charge of plaintiff\u2019s double recovery because in subsequent proceedings before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Industrial Accident Commission in adjustment of his compensation claim, plaintiff obtained an award exceeding by a few hundred dollars the amount of the judgment here assailed ; and (2) the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the court\u2019s finding of negligence in the adjudication of defendant\u2019s liability. Neither of defendant\u2019s points' is well taken as the record stands herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">But brief consideration need be given to defendant\u2019s first objection.  Under section 3706 of the Labor Code, the injured employee may bring an action for damages in any case where his employer failed to carry compensation insurance, and this right may be exercised independently of any proceedings before the Industrial Accident Commission. <em>(Rideaux </em>v. <em>Torgrimson, </em>12 Cal.2d 633, 636-637 [86 P.2d 826]; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>81 Cal.App. 98, 101 [252 P. 1075]; <em>Rosslow </em>v. <em>Janssen, </em>139 Cal.App. 81, 83 [33 P.2d 705] ; <em>Graybiel v. Consolidated Associations, Ltd., </em>16 Cal.App.2d 20, 25 [60 P.2d 164].) As so authorized, plaintiff pursued the two distinct remedies given him by statute against defendant, his uninsured employer\u2014first commencing the within litigation and then filing his compensation claim before the commission, but holding in abeyance the prosecution of proceedings in the latter tribunal to await the outcome of the damage action, which, as tried by the court sitting without a jury, resulted in the present judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $2,250. Almost a year later the commission made its compensation award, and such favorable determination of plaintiff\u2019s claim has become final following the denial of a review thereof by the District Court of Appeal. <em>(Fershaw </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. amd Mustoe, </em>2 Civ. 16164, 83 A.C.A. No. 3, Min. Jan. 16, 1948; no petition filed in this court.) The proceedings before the commission are not a part of the record on appeal, but the parties concede that its award exceeds \u201cby a few hundred dollars\u201d the amount of the judgment herein, and upon such agreed basis they argue the propriety of the two adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The sequence of litigation in the measure of plaintiff\u2019s right to relief as granted by statute does not open to attack the validity of the award which he first secured\u2014the judgment here subject of appeal\u2014upon the claim that it constitutes an allowance of a duplication of recovery against defendant, when such question manifestly was not before the trial court in its initial disposition of plaintiff\u2019s authorized damage action and only arises now as defendant argues the injustice of permitting plaintiff to have \u201ctwo [full] compensations ... for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>one injury\u201d in view of the <em>subsequent </em>termination of the independent proceedings before the commission in plaintiff\u2019s favor. Whether defendant would be entitled to a credit of the judgment against the greater amount of the compensation award upon plaintiff\u2019s undertaking to collect both amounts as separately adjudicated by the designated tribunals is not a matter for consideration here <em>(Cf., Sullivan </em>v. <em>Tait, </em>38 Cal.App;2d 185 [101 P.2d 145]), for defendant contests the validity of the judgment, not the premise of its enforcement in the admeasurement of plaintiff\u2019s total relief. In such distinguishable circumstances, the merit of defendant\u2019s objection to the successive awards as embracing a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d is not an issue for review within the scope of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">There now remains for consideration defendant\u2019s challenge of the evidentiary support for the court\u2019s finding of negligence as the issue was tendered by the parties\u2019 pleadings. (Of., <em>Graybiel </em>v. <em>Consolidated Associations, Ltd., supra, </em>16 Cal.App.2d 20, 26.) Section 3708 of the Labor Code, so far as here pertinent, provides that in an action such as the present one \u201c. . . it is presumed that the injury to the employee was a direct result and grew out of the negligence of the employer, and the burden of proof is upon the employer, to rebut the presumption of negligence. It is not a defense to the employer that the employee was guilty of contributory negligence, or assumed the risk of the hazard complained of, ...\u201d Defendant argues that plaintiff\u2019s own testimony affirmatively established that there was no negligence on her part, that the statutory presumption to the contrary was thereby dispelled from the case, and there then remained no evidence which would sustain her liability for plaintiff\u2019s injuries. There is no force to defendant\u2019s position upon analysis of relevant portions of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">It appears that plaintiff, while employed as a saw operator and in other capacities in defendant\u2019s cabinet shop, injured his left hand\u2014lacerations of the thumb and second and third fingers\u2014in the process of operating a power-driven ripsaw for the cutting of a piece of wood for a window frame. Plaintiff was alone at the time of the accident and was the sole witness thereto. After testifying that he was experienced in the operation of power-driven saws and demonstrating his partial loss of the use of his injured hand as affecting his future employment in carpentry work, plaintiff gave this account of the accident: That the saw he was using was \u201cimbedded in a small table\u201d with \u201cthe motor operating it on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>side\u201d; that \u201cthe saw\u201d had \u201ca guide\u201d to set the \u201cmeasurements \u2019 \u2019; that \u201c as I was cutting like this, because that got to do this way, see, from the top, the saw in turning in the bottom, you have to get your piece on top like that and push right down on it, so the saw comes right on top here and cuts here to here (indicating)\u201d; that \u201cwhen I was doing this, this happened . . . hand . . . slip or jump, I don\u2019t know\u2014 still it happened when I was going down this way, see. \u2019 \u2019 Later in the trial as a witness for plaintiff, a safety inspector for the State Division of Industrial Safety, who had examined the saw in question and who had heard plaintiff\u2019s testimony \u2018 concerning the way he cut this piece by holding it, one end of it with his left hand . . . the other end with his right hand .... lowering the thing over the saw, \u2019 \u2019 testified as follows: That the manner in which plaintiff described his operation of the saw was \u201cthe customary method ... in small back yard shops\u201d; that \u201cone of the reasons why I am in the field [is] that we try to discourage such manual operations to prevent just what happened to [plaintiff] ... it is common practice ... it isn\u2019t safe practice.\u201d The inspector further stated that \u201canybody with any experience in cabinet work\u201d should know that the use of a \u201cblock\u201d or \u201ctable stop\u201d to \u201cprevent the piece [as cut] from being kicked back,\u201d would guard against the happening of just such accident as the one here involved. Plaintiff then testified that the saw was \u201cset up\u201d by his [former] employer\u2014the husband of defendant, who, upon her husband\u2019s death, had undertaken to manage the business and operate the shop; that he (plaintiff) made no change in \u201cthe machine at all after [defendant\u2019s husband] died\u201d but continued to \u201cuse it\u201d as it was \u201cset up\u201d; that he \u201cdid . . . not set up a block before [he] used the saw\u201d; and that \u201cthere was no chance to put up a block.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The court found that \u201cas the direct and proximate result of the negligence and carelessness of the said defendant, plaintiff\u2019s left hand was then and there drawn into and became engaged with the teeth of said saw. \u2019 \u2019 This is the finding that defendant attacks as running counter to all the evidence, arguing that since it appears from plaintiff\u2019s own testimony that \u201cdefendant gave him no instructions as to the use of the saws; that in fact she knew nothing about the use of the saws\u201d; and that plaintiff \u201chimself [had] neglected to employ the known safeguard of placing the block on the saw\u201d; the rebuttable presumption of negligence imposed by statute upon defendant (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3708, <em>supra) </em>was effectively destroyed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the record stands devoid of any support for plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Generally speaking, it may be stated that a presumption is dispelled as an evidentiary consideration when a fact which is wholly irreconcilable with it is proved by the uncontradicted testimony of the party relying upon it or of such party\u2019s own witnesses, when such testimony was not the product of mistake or inadvertence. <em>(Mar Shee </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>As<em>surance Corp., </em>190 Cal. 1, 9 [210 P. 269]; <em>Smellie </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>212 Cal. 540, 553 [299 P. 529]; <em>Engstrom </em>v. <em>Auburn Automobile Sales Corp., </em>11 Cal.2d 64, 70 [77 P.2d 1059]; <em>Westberg </em>v. <em>Willde, </em>14 Cal.2d 360, 365 [94 P.2d 590]; <em>Fortier </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>115 Cal.App. 50, 57 [1 P.2d 23].)  However, the situation here prevailing is distinguishable in that plaintiff\u2019s testimony is not \u201cwholly irreconcilable\u201d with the operative force of the presumption of defendant\u2019s negligence. On the contrary,' conceding that as an experienced carpenter plaintiff should have used a \u201cblock\u201d as a precautionary safeguard in his performance of the work in question, nevertheless his testimony that he operated the saw as it was \u201cset up\u201d for his use and \u201cthere was no chance to put up a block\u201d would support an inference that defendant negligently maintained the saw in such condition that it was impossible to \u201cput up a block, \u2019 \u2019 and that such negligence was the cause of the accident. As above noted, the common-law defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk are expressly denied by statute to defendant in such action as the present one. (Lab. Code, \u00a73708, <em>supra.) </em> In such circumstances,whether the presumption of defendant\u2019s negligence was controverted was at best a question to be determined by the trial court, and its finding thereon would be conclusive. <em>(Fortier </em>v. <em>Hogan, supra, </em>115 Cal.App. 50, 58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">But even were it to be said that since plaintiff\u2019s evidence fully disclosed the circumstances surrounding the happening of the accident\u2014his acts and conduct just prior to and at the time of his injury\u2014there would be no reason for the presumption of defendant\u2019s negligence to stay in the case and it disappears therefrom <em>(Rogers </em>v. <em>Interstate Transit Co., </em>212 Cal. 36, 38 [297 P. 884]; <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>McDuffie, </em>4 Cal.2d 111, 119 [47 P.2d 709] ; <em>Mundy </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>8 Cal.2d 294, 296 [65 P.2d 65]), such conclusion would not aid defendant under the record. There would still remain as a factor in evidence the inference from plaintiff\u2019s testimony that defendant was guilty of negligence by reason of the particular manner of mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>nance of the saw in her cabinet shop\u2014a consideration which would preclude holding, as a matter of law, that defendant was not guilty of fault in conclusive defeat of plaintiff\u2019s damage claim. Defendant\u2019s citation of the case of <em>Spivok </em>v. <em>Independent Sash &amp; Door Co., </em>173 Cal. 438 [160 P. 565], does not strengthen her argument. There the plaintiff\u2014a carpenter in defendant\u2019s employ\u2014could have used a stairway provided by his employer as a safe means for passing from one floor to another in the course of his work, but plaintiff deliberately chose another means of approach and sustained certain injuries as the result of his needless risk. Accordingly, \u201c [t]he conclusion [was] unescapable that the employer . . . was without fault and that the injury occurred solely through the negligence of the employee.\u201d (P. 440.) Here plaintiff had no choice but to use the saw provided by defendant for the work in question, and its condition for safe use was a factual consideration in the light of the record. (Cf., <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Curran, </em>17 Cal.App.2d 689, 695-696 [62 P.2d 800].) As so determined, the finding that plaintiff\u2019s injury was \u201cthe direct and proximate result of [defendant\u2019s] negligence and carelessness\u201d is not open to objection as being without evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Carter, J., and Schauer, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b344-7\">TRAYNOR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0S\">I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">It is my opinion that as a matter of legislative policy section 3708 of the Labor Code places upon the employer the burden of proof, which remains upon him throughout the case. (Compare, <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>111 Cal. 261, 267 [43 P. 756, 52 Am.St.Rep. 180, 31 L.R.A. 411]; <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>171 Cal. 770, 774 [155 P. 95]; <em>Estate of McNamara, </em>181 Cal. 82, 95 [183 P. 552, 7 A.L.R. 313]; <em>O\u2019Dea </em>v. <em>Amodeo, </em>118 Conn. 58, 65 [170 A. 486, 488]; Am. Law Institute, Model Code of Evidence, rule 703.) The employer in this case has not sustained that burden. It therefore serves no purpose to consider when the presumption was dispelled. That question would be pertinent only if the plaintiff had the burden of-proof, aided by the presumption. (See dissenting opinion in <em>Speck </em>v. <em>Sarver, </em>20 Cal.2d 585, 590-598 [128 P.2d 16].)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Edmonds, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
