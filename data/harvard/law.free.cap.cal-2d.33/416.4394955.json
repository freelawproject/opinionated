He contends that such awards run counter to a purportedly complete adjustment of all property matters theretofore made by contract, between plaintiff and himself, and that the limitations of such settlement are binding upon the court herein. However, the evidence bearing upon the agreements executed by the parties in the light of their marital history, as well as settled public policy pertinent to the marriage relationship, sustains the trial court\u2019s findings in determination of this divorce action, and defendant\u2019s points of challenge therefore cannot prevail. Accordingly, the portions of the judgment here subject of appeal must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The record discloses that plaintiff and defendant were first married on October 8, 1928; that plaintiff was granted an interlocutory decree of divorce on August 12, 1940; and that the final decree of divorce in dissolution of the 1928 marriage was entered on January 13, 1942. On May 11, 1945, plaintiff and defendant remarried, neither having contracted a marriage in the meantime. There were no children the issue of either marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">On January 21, 1946, plaintiff instituted the present litigation originally as a separate maintenance action and sought a declaration of rights with regard to certain agreements previously executed by the parties: viz., an antenuptial agreement made on October 1, 1928, just prior to their first marriage, and several property agreements dated respectively June 28, 1935, November 16, 1936, December 16, 1936, November 1, 1937, December 2, 1937, and August 24, 1943. Defendant countered with a cross-complaint for divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty. Thereupon plaintiff, with leave of the court, amended her complaint to seek a divorce, alleging extreme cruelty on the part of defendant. At the trial defendant did not oppose a dissolution of the marriage, and he offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>no proof of his charges of cruelty in his cross-complaint. Plaintiff made proof of her allegations of mental cruelty and was awarded a decree of divorce, whereupon the court declared that it would \u201ctake up the question of the property rights as joined by the pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The antenuptial agreement of October 1, 1928, recited that \u201cin anticipation of [their forthcoming] marriage, the parties desire [d] ... to fix and determine the rights of each of them in any and all property . . .\u201d; and \u201cin consideration of said marriage,\u201d each party specifically \u201cwaive[d] any and all rights, claims and demands ... in and to [the] property,\u201d of the other, \u201cboth during . . . life and after .. . death.\u201d The agreement of June 28, 1935, made while the parties were \u201cliving separate and apart,\u201d was executed \u201cin consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants\u201d therein \u201ccontained and for the purpose of finally adjusting and settling all rights, present or future, including property rights, rights. of second party [the wife] to support and maintenance, and any other rights of whatsoever kind or nature arising out of the marital status of first and second parties, irrespective as to whether there may be a subsequent reconciliation, suit for separate maintenance or divorce.\u201d Expressly included in second party\u2019s release and waiver were future claims of \u201cinterest in community property,\u201d \u201cright to . . . homestead,\u201d and \u201cany and all claims and rights, present and future, to support . . . saving and excepting such as are provided for by this instrument\u201d ($200 per month to \u201ccontinue until the death of first party or second party, or until the marriage of second party to another, whichever shall first occur\u201d). Specifically recognizing \u201cthe possibility of a future reconciliation,\u201d the \u201cparties declare[d] their intention to be that a reconciliation, either temporary or permanent, between first and second parties, or a restoration of the former relations of said parties, or a further separation, temporary or permanent, after any reconciliation\u201d should \u201cnot render this agreement or the \u2018Ante-Nuptial Agreement,\u2019 hereinabove ratified, reaffirmed and confirmed, or any provision hereof or thereof, invalid, inoperative, rescinded or revoked,\u201d and \u201cparticularly agreed\u201d that \u201cthe monthly payments ... to be paid by first party to second party\u201d should \u201ccontinue as in this agreement provided, notwithstanding resumption of former relations, reconciliations or subsequent separations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Each of the various property settlement agreements subsequently executed by the parties was denominated \u201camend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ment to agreement.\u201d The first of these, that of November 16, 1936, increased the \u201cmonthly payments\u201d in favor of \u201csecond party\u201d to $300 per month \u201csubject to the contingencies\u201d and conditions, however, provided in the \u201cagreement of June 28, 1935.\u201d Bach of the succeeding amendments ratified and reaffirmed all those preceding it. On August 12,1940, when plaintiff was awarded her interlocutory decree of divorce with regard to the first marriage, she presented those agreements which had been executed up to that date, which would include the first four amendments, and they were approved by the court in that decree. The last or \u201cfifth amendment to agreement\u201d was that of August 24, 1943, some 19 months after the entry of the final decree of divorce in the first action. It provided that \u201csecond party\u201d should \u201cbe entitled to a claim against the estate of first party to the extent of\u201d $60,000 \u201cin the event that second party\u201d was \u201cliving at the time of the death of first party and [had] not married another,\u201d said sum to be payable in monthly payments of $300 \u201cfor the support and maintenance of second party.\u201d And again \u201cthe parties\u201d ratified and reaffirmed \u201call of the . . . agreements and amendments\u201d theretofore executed and agreed that \u201cthe same [should] continue in full force and effect as herein clarified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alp\">In the present action the trial court found that all of the aforementioned agreements, including that of August 24,1943, \u201care now and were at all times valid and subsisting and have not been cancelled, rescinded or annulled\u201d but \u201csince the marriage\u201d of the parties \u201con May 11, 1945 . . . their rights and duties towards each other as husband and wife are controlled by the laws of the State of California and not by the said agreements as to all things occurring since said marriage on May 11, 1945.\u201d Accordingly, the interlocutory decree of divorce adjudged the aforesaid agreements to be \u201cin full force and effect and that the plaintiff is entitled to receive from the defendant, by virtue of said agreements, the sum of $300.00 per month . . . [but] that the said agreements are not binding on this court in awarding support to the plaintiff,\u201d it being \u201cfurther adjudged\u201d that \u201cbeginning August 1,1946,\u201d and \u201cuntil the plaintiff remarries,\u201d she shall receive \u201cin addition to the moneys required to be paid . . . under the aforementioned agreements\u201d the \u201csum of $600.00 per month for her support and maintenance,\u201d as well as \u201cthe community property of the parties acquired after\u201d their second marriage \u2014\u201cMay 11, 1945\u201d\u2014amounting to $11,101.01: $6,836.01 in cash, war bonds valued at $3,365, and 100 shares of stock val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ued at $900. The court also \u201c assign [ed] to the plaintiff, for the remainder of her natural life, \u2019 \u2019 a portion of the homestead theretofore declared by her upon defendant\u2019s separate property known as the Santa Ynez ranch. It is solely from these last-mentioned portions of the decree\u2014the award to plaintiff of $600 per month for support, the community property, and the homestead\u2014that defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Plaintiff takes the position that by her second marriage to defendant she acquired new rights with respect to the disposition of property issues between them; that the ante-nuptial and property settlement agreements theretofore executed between the parties were directed solely to the adjustment of property matters arising as the result of their first marriage, and to subsequent separations and reconciliations in connection with that marriage alone; and that the court therefore properly limited the \u201cbinding\u201d effect of the agreements and viewed the parties\u2019 remarriage as a new venture calling for an independent determination of their property rights from that point of their resumed marital relationship. On the other hand, defendant maintains that the second marriage of the parties constituted \u201ca reconciliation or a resumption of former relations\u201d as that language appears in the various agreements; that when plaintiff and defendant remarried, no support obligations or property rights arose in conjunction with their renewed marital venture because such matters had already been settled by previous contract between them; and that the trial court\u2019s recognition of the validity and subsisting force of the parties\u2019 successive agreements precluded an award contrary to the qualifications and limitations thereof. In considering these opposing views, it must be remembered that neither party challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that the prior agreements were all valid when made and that as to the matters governed by them, they did not become invalid by reason of the second marriage\u2014and such points of decision now stand final and conclusive. Bather the whole controversy here centers on the interpretation and effect to be given the agreements in the light of the parties\u2019 second marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">A contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful, operative, definite, reasonable, and capable of being carried into effect, if that can be done without violating the intention of the parties. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1643, 3541; see Best., Contracts, \u00a7 236(a).)  When the language used is fairly susceptible to one of two constructions, extrinsic evidence may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>be considered, not to vary or modify the terms of the agreement but to aid the court in ascertaining the true intent of the parties <em>(Central Heights Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Memorial Parks, Inc., </em>40 Cal.App.2d 591, 608 [105 P.2d 596]), not to show that \u201cthe parties meant something other <em>than </em>what they said\u201d but to show \u201cwhat they meant <em>by </em>what they said\u201d <em>(Barnhart Aircraft, Inc. </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>212 Cal. 19, 23 [297 P. 20]).  Where any doubt exists as to the purport of the parties\u2019 dealings as expressed in the wording of their contract, the court may look to the circumstances surrounding its execution\u2014including the object, nature and subject matter of the agreement <em>(Wachs </em>v. <em>Wachs, 11 </em>Cal.2d 322, 326 [79 P.2d 1085])\u2014as well as to subsequent acts or declarations of the parties \u201cshedding light upon the question of their mutual intention at the time of contracting\u201d <em>(Lemm </em>v. <em>Stillwater Land &amp; Cattle Co., </em>217 Cal. 474, 481 [19 P.2d 785]). To this latter point, it is said that \u201ca construction given the contract by the acts and conduct of the parties with knowledge of its terms, before any controversy has arisen as to its meaning, is entitled to great weight and will, when reasonable, be adopted and enforced by the court.\u201d <em>(Woodbine </em>v. <em>Van Horn, </em>29 Cal. 2d 95,104 [173 P.2d 17]; see, also, 20 Am.Jur. \u00a7 1144, p. 998.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In line with these rules designed to aid the court in the performance of its duty to make \u201cthe language used by the parties serve rather than subvert their mutual intention\u201d <em>(Lemm </em>v. <em>Stillwater Land &amp; Cattle Co., supra, </em>217 Cal. 474, 481), the following evidence, adduced in the course of plaintiff\u2019s direct examination, is pertinent to the issue of the intended scope of the parties\u2019 successive agreements, all of which antedated the second marriage and purported to limit plaintiff\u2019s rights in defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201cQ. Now, before you and he were married (the second time) did you have any conversations with Dr. Barham about signing any new written agreements? A. Yes. He wanted me to sign a paper saying that he was to have the entire use of his salary and I wasn\u2019t to have anything to say about that . . . And I said no, that I thought we had signed too many agreements already and that marriage was supposed to be trust and fifty-fifty and if it wasn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t think it was going to be much of a marriage, and so I refused to sign the papers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">\u201cThe Court: This was before the second marriage? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">\u201cBy Mr. Young (plaintiff\u2019s counsel): Now, did you have any conversation with Dr. Barham about the three hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>dollars a month that he was paying you at that time ? A. Definitely, Mr. Young. He told me that I was to have that for my own personal use, that it wouldn\u2019t be touched for anything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you that is what the situation would be after the marriage ? A. Absolutely. That was a promise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201cQ. Was anything said as to what would be done about the household expenses, prior to your (second) marriage? A. Yes. There had always been trouble about that; I suggested that it would be nice if I could run my own household, because I knew how and am quite capable, and he was to make an allowance for that purpose and pay all utilities and expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">\u201cQ. Now, was anything said at that time as to what he would do about the ownership of the Santa Ynez Ranch ? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201cQ.

Barham to sign an ante-nuptial agreement ? A. I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-13\">\u201cQ. All right, what did she say to you when you asked her to sign an ante-nuptial agreement in May, 1945 ? A. She said she had signed so many, she didn\u2019t want to sign any more, and I said, \u2018All right.\u2019...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-14\">\u201cQ.

A. I don\u2019t remember any specific conversation .... Other than to say, of course, that the agreement holds and you are to get your three hundred a month just like you have in the past. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>From the foregoing testimony, it may reasonably be inferred that both plaintiff and defendant looked upon their second marriage as a new venture, and that it was undertaken without qualification as to the property rights of either of the parties growing out of their renewed marital relations. In opposing this view, defendant argues the significance of the last amendment-\u2014-the \u201cfifth amendment\u201d\u2014to the parties\u2019 previous agreements, which was executed some 19 months after the final decree of divorce in dissolution of their first marriage. That amendment, like the others, expressly ratified and reaffirmed all the preceding agreements, which would include the language as to their continuing in force \u201cnotwithstanding resumption of former relations, reconciliations or subsequent separations.\u201d He claims that such wording as <em>then </em>ratified cannot reasonably be regarded otherwise than to encompass a second marriage as a \u201cresumption of former relations.\u201d But such interpretation overlooks other features of the parties\u2019 successive agreements which must be noted. The first agreement\u2014the \u201cAnte-Nuptial Agreement\u201d of October 1, 1928\u2014specifically recited that it was made \u201cin anticipation of\u201d the \u201cmarriage\u201d that was \u201cabout to be solemnized\u201d and was in \u201cconsideration of said marriage,\u201d which could only refer to the one of October 8, 1928, and the parties\u2019 subsequent ratification of the terms of their preceding agreements appears properly to be confined to that marriage\u2014as the one designated in the course of their successive adjustment of their property rights as husband and wife, as a matter of marital chronology. The last amendment, though executed after the parties\u2019 final divorce, does not mention a second marriage or remarriage, nor indicate that the ratification of the wording \u201cresumption of former relations\u201d is to have any different connotation than it had as embraced in the preceding agreements referable to the October 8, 1928, marriage as the only one then contracted between the parties.  It is the general rule that in considering marriage settlement agreements, the court must seek the intention of the parties \u201cat the time of [their] execution, for it is their intention at such time that governs.\u201d (41 C.J.S. \u00a7 102, p. 575; see, also, <em>Estate of Brimhall, </em>62 Cal.App.2d 30, 35 [143 P.2d 981].)  Reaffirmance and ratification of agreements will preserve their legal effect but will not change it. Accordingly, under accepted rules of interpretation, a general clause reaffirming the provisions of previous agreements will not operate to enlarge their scope so as to make them applicable to property rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>which they were not intended to govern in the light of the parties\u2019 negotiations at the time of their original execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Defendant argues that since the last \u201creaffirmance and ratification\u201d was made after the parties\u2019 final divorce and included the reference in the former agreements to the resumption of former relations at a time when such procedure would require a new marriage, an inference should be drawn that the previously executed agreements were thereby intended to control the parties\u2019 rights in the event of their second marriage. But as opposed to this position, another line of reasoning appears equally sound.  A provision in an agreement amending former agreements and reciting that the latter are ratified and reaffirmed expresses an intention of the parties not to raise an objection to the validity of the former agreements nor encroach upon their content except where expressly or by clear implication so modified. However, such \u201creaffirmance and ratification\u201d does not necessarily express a belief of the parties that <em>all </em>the provisions of their former agreements are still of practical import, and that none of them has meanwhile become obsolete either by reason of subsequent events or the passage of time. Insistence upon interpretation of a reaffirmance clause as designed to revive the prior agreements with such effect as though they were originally made at the later date would often result in actually changing the meaning of the previously executed agreements when the parties did not so contemplate nor intend to express that purpose in the process of reaffirming their former agreements. Accordingly here, the parties may have considered that all provisions contained in their successive agreements as to reconciliation, made while they were separated but still married, became obsolete upon the dissolution of their marriage. Pursuant to such premise, there would be no reason to dissociate the words \u201cresumption of former relations\u201d from the original context and assume that the parties intended such phrase to apply to a new marriage that was not even contemplated when the parties entered into the \u201clast amendment\u201d of their property rights, rather than to relate solely to a reconciliation during the period of their existing first marriage. So significant is defendant\u2019s admitted act of suggesting before the new marriage that the parties make \u201canother\u201d agreement incorporating important provisions of the former agreements and the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to so proceed.  In the light of such evidence the inference drawn by the trial court with regard to the purport of the parties\u2019 intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>as to the scope of their successive agreements and its construction thereof in limiting their application to the first marriage will be deemed conclusive as supported by the record. (Wood<em>bine </em>v. <em>Van Horn, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 95, 104.)  Moreover, such determination accords with the rule that marriage settlement agreements must be strictly construed, for \u201cit is a definite doctrine of the law that courts will not enlarge [their] language ... \u2018so as to deprive either spouse of such rights unless there is a clear and unmistakable intention to barter them away and to reach such conclusion the contract must not be of doubtful interpretation but must by express terms or by necessary implication, clearly so provide. \u2019 <em>(Girard </em>v. <em>Girard, </em>29 N.M. 189 [221 P. 801, 35 A.L.R. 1493].)\u201d <em>(Estate of McNutt, </em>36 Cal.App.2d 542, 549 [98 P.2d 253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Also material to the propriety of the' trial court\u2019s findings are considerations of public policy, resting on the state\u2019s interest in the institution of marriage, which would preclude enforcement of the parties\u2019 agreements if construed to govern their rights as projected into a future marital status. There is a vital difference in the public policies applicable to agreements made <em>before </em>marriage wherein the prospective husband limits his obligations arising from the marriage relation, whatever violations of marital duties he may commit, and agreements made <em>after </em>disruption of the parties\u2019 marriage has occurred. \u201cPublic policy seeks to foster and protect marriage, to encourage parties to live together, and to prevent separation. (Citing authorities.) But public policy does not discourage divorce where the relations between husband and wife ar\u00e9 such that the legitimate objects of matrimony have been utterly destroyed. (Citing authority.) \u201d <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>23 Cal.2d 82, 93 [142 P.2d 417].)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The leading ease illustrative of the prevailing policy prohibiting the sanction of a property settlement agreement which interferes with the real substantial status of a marriage contract through alteration of the legal relations of the spouses, to wit, their marital duties and obligations, is <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Pereira, </em>156 Cal. 1 [103 P. 488,134 Am.St.Rep. 107, 23 L.R.A. N.S. 880]. There the parties, had separated and the wife instituted an action for divorce. During its pendency the parties effected a reconciliation and the action was dismissed. The parties then entered into an agreement which provided that \u201cif the husband should thereafter so conduct himself as to give the wife a new cause of action for divorce, and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>should establish the same in a subsequent action against him, \u2019 \u2019 he \u201cshould thereupon pay to [her] ten thousand dollars,\u201d in \u201cfull satisfaction, settlement, and discharge of all claims\u201d for \u201calimony\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d rights. (156 Cal. 3.) In declaring such agreement to be void as \u201cplainly against public policy,\u201d this court stated at pages 4 and 5 as follows: \u201cThe real effect of the contract to pay the ten thousand dollars, so far as the husband is concerned, would be to provide against \u2022liability for a contemplated wrong to be subsequently inflicted by him upon his wife, and to liquidate such liability in advance of the commission of the wrong. The evidence and findings show that the defendant was then possessed of property worth about seventy-seven thousand dollars, was engaged in a very lucrative business, and was receiving an income of about eleven thousand dollars a year which he had every reason to believe would continue. By this contract, if valid, he was left free to inflict upon his wife the most grievous marital wrongs, such as would compel her to obtain a divorce, secure in the protection of his contract that ten thousand dollars would satisfy all her claims against him of a pecuniary nature or in relation to the community property. If he should, after its execution, be moved by evil impulse to commit anew the offenses against his wife which first gave her cause for divorce, or other acts having the same legal effect, the existence of a valid contract of this sort could not but encourage him to yield to his baser inclinations, and inflict the injury . . . The law does not countenance such agreements.\u201d <em>(Cf., Hill </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d 82, 91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The same considerations were held to apply in voiding a similar agreement made \u201cprior to marriage\u201d in the case of <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>62 Cal.App. 157 [216 P. 92], Accordingly, a contract providing \u201cagainst liability for a contemplated wrong to be subsequently inflicted\u201d by one of the spouses upon the other and liquidating \u201csuch liability in advance,\u201d was declared a \u201cmenace to the marriage relation and should not be tolerated, and this irrespective of the time when the same might have been executed in reference to the time of marriage. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Ibid, </em>62 Cal.App. 167; see, also, 17 Am. Jur. \u00a715, pp. 156-157; annot. of eases, 70 A.L.R. 827; 109 A.L.R. 1174; <em>Vock </em>v. <em>Vock, </em>365 Ill. 432 [6 N.E.2d 843, 109 A.L.R. 1170].)  So pertinent is the fact here that\u2014 with the exception of the antenuptial agreement of October 1, 1928\u2014all the property settlement agreements successively executed by the parties were alike <em>postnuptial </em>to the marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of October 8,1928, but <em>antenuptial </em>to the marriage of May 11, 1945. If they were construed to apply to the parties\u2019 latter marital undertaking, then for offenses committed in connection therewith defendant would be free of all liability as to support or property claims which plaintiff otherwise might make by virtue of the legal relations the parties assumed upon remarriage. But it will not be supposed that the parties entered into agreements contemplating a violation of the law. On the contrary, it will be deemed that they intended a lawful, rather than an unlawful, act, and their agreements will be construed, if possible, as intending something for which they had the power to contract. (6 Cal.Jur. \u00a7 168, p. 268; <em>Long Beach Drug Co. </em>v. <em>United Drug Co., </em>13 Cal.2d 158, 166 [88 P.2d 698, 89 P.2d 386]; <em>Woodbine </em>v. <em>Van Horn, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 95, 104; <em>Schroeder </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>126 Cal.App. 367, 376 [14 P.2d 903]; <em>White </em>v. <em>Cascade Oil Co., </em>14 Cal.App.2d 695, 701 [58 P.2d 994].)  In line with these principles, as well as the above-recited evidence indicating the parties\u2019 understanding as to the purport of the successive agreements at the respective times of their execution, the trial court properly confined their scope to the first marriage only, and as so limited, adjudged them \u201cvalid, subsisting and in full force and effect,\u201d entitling \u201cplaintiff . . . to receive\u201d thereby \u201cfrom . . . defendant\u201d the \u201csum of $300.00 per month,\u201d but that they were \u201cnot binding on [the] court in awarding support to . . . plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">It is undisputed that defendant has regularly made the $300 per month payment to plaintiff ever since it was first incorporated in the parties\u2019 property settlement agreements \u2014that of November 16, 1936\u2014covering the period of their several separations and reconciliations, their final decree of divorce, and on through their second marriage, including the time of trial of the present divorce action. Moreover, as heretofore indicated from the parties\u2019 respective testimony relative to these payments, defendant always \u201cfigured that the three hundred a month was her [s] . . . regardless of anything.\u201d  While plaintiff stated at the trial that defendant made such payments to her for her \u201cpersonal\u201d expenses rather than for \u201csupport\u201d (see 6 Cal.Jur. \u00a7 226, p. 375), such claim is immaterial insofar as affecting the parties\u2019 evident understanding that the monthly payments\u2014 regardless of purpose\u2014were intended as an essential feature in the adjustment of their property rights arising from their first marriage. <em>(Rich </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>44 Cal.App.2d 526, 529 [112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>P.2d 780]; <em>Landres </em>v. <em>Rosasco, </em>62 Cal.App.2d 99, 105 [144 P.2d 20].) Such monthly payments, like the later provision giving plaintiff a claim against defendant\u2019s estate \u201cto the extent of\u201d $60,000, payable \u201c$300.00 per month,\u201d in the event that she survived defendant and had not married another, appear to be an integral and important element in the parties\u2019 amicable liquidation of their rights as confined to their first marital undertaking <em>(Ettlinger </em>v. <em>Ettlinger, </em>3 Cal.2d 172, 178 [44 P.2d 540]), with plaintiff agreeing to such provisions <em>in lieu of </em>other rights in the community property of the parties <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>29 Cal.2d 621, 625 [177 P.2d 265]). \u201c Highlyfavored in the law\u2019 \u2019 <em>(Kill </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d 82, 89) and authorized by the statutes of this state (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 158, 159), such property settlement agreements, when untainted by fraud, coercion, undue influence, or collusion, are valid and binding on the court. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>.29 Cal.2d 621, 624, and cases there cited.) No claim is here made that any of the mentioned vitiating elements ever entered into the parties\u2019 extended contractual dealings with each other; and, to the contrary the agreements expressly state that they were executed \u201cvoluntarily and with full knowledge and belief that it [was] for the best interests of each\u201d party to so contract, and \u201cafter independent advice of counsel.\u201d The parties have continuously acted in accordance with the terms of their agreements as successively modified; defendant has at all times performed the financial obligations required of him by reason of his contractual undertakings with plaintiff; and as part of the issues litigated in the first divorce action between the parties, plaintiff presented for examination by the trial court all of the agreements\u2014 with the exception of the later executed \u201cfifth amendment\u201d\u2014 and secured judicial approval thereof. Consistent with such adjudication, the trial court here found the agreements\u2014 including the fifth amendment\u201d\u2014to be \u201cvalid and subsisting\u201d and there only remains the question of the propriety of the awards to plaintiff in disposition of the parties\u2019 rights upon dissolution of their second marriage. <em>(Pereira </em>v. <em>Pereira, supra, </em>156 Cal. 1; <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Whiting, supra, </em>62 Cal.App. 157; see, also, <em>Seuss </em>v. <em>Schukat, </em>358 Ill. 27 [192 N.E. 668, 95 A.L.R. 1461].)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Under the terms of the interlocutory decree of divorce herein, the trial court granted plaintiff a support award of $600 per month\u2014not $900 as defendant argues, the extra $300 per month being due to plaintiff under the adjudicated \u201cvalid\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>property settlement agreements theretofore effected between the parties. At the time such award was fixed by the trial court, the annual income of defendant, as disclosed by his \u201cbooks and records,\u201d was $85,090.57, of which $67,200 was salary. In her affidavit for support, plaintiff stated that her monthly expenses were $830 which included salaries for the gardener and housekeeper employed to take care of the Santa Tnez ranch, the aforementioned homestead property where plaintiff had continued to live.  Unquestionably, upon granting the divorce herein to plaintiff, provision of a \u201csuitable allowance\u201d for her support was a matter for the determination of the court \u201chaving regard to the circumstances of the parties respectively.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7139; see, also, 1 Cal.Jur. \u00a764, p. 1012; <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>Puckett, </em>21 Cal.2d 833, 845 [136 P.2d 1].) Consistent with such recognized discretionary power in the trial court, it cannot be said that the award of a monthly support payment of $600 to plaintiff when defendant, her husband, earned an annual income of $85,000 is excessive. (See <em>Scheibe </em>v. <em>Scheibe, </em>57 Cal.App.2d 336, 342-343 [134 P.2d 835].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Nor may defendant successfully attack the community property award to plaintiff. The amount of the community property accumulated during the period of the second marriage was a matter of stipulation by the parties\u2014 $11,101.01, consisting of a bank balance of $6,836.01, war bonds having a valuation then of $3,365, and 100 shares of stock valued at $900. The divorce having been granted to plaintiff on the ground of defendant\u2019s extreme cruelty, it was within the discretion of the trial court to award her as the innocent spouse all of the community property. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 146, subd. 1; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>196 Cal. 761, 765 [239 P. 36]; <em>Crouch </em>v. <em>Crouch, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 747, 756 [147 P.2d 678]; <em>Buehler </em>v. <em>Buehler, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 472, 476 [166 P.2d 608]; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>76 Cal.App.2d 877, 883-884 [174 P.2d 674].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Likewise without merit is defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s award of the homestead to plaintiff was improper because it was taken from his separate property, concededly was \u201cworth fifty thousand dollars\u201d and was given to her \u201cfor the remainder of her natural life,\u201d without regard for the event of her remarriage as a limitation upon her continued use of the property. Section 1238 of the Civil Code specifically provides that a homestead \u201cmay be selected from the . . . separate property of the husband.\u201d And as stated in <em>Greenlee </em>v. <em>Greenlee, </em>7 Cal.2d 579, at page 583 [61 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>P.2d 1157], where a like objection was raised by the husband in regard to the court\u2019s award of homestead property: \u201cSubdivision 4 of section 146 of the Civil Code provides that in divorce actions, if the homestead has been selected from the separate property of either, it shall be assigned to the former owner of such property, subject to the power of the court to assign it for a limited period to the innocent party. . . . The limited period for which the court may assign to the innocent party the homestead selected from the separate property of the other has been held to be for the period of the natural life of the former. <em>(Strupelle </em>v. <em>Strupelle, </em>59 Cal.App. 526, 531 [211 P. 248]; <em>Neary </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>102 Cal. 338 [36 P. 655] ; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>McNally, </em>85 Cal. 619 [24 P. 1071].)\u201d It is evident that in assigning the homestead to plaintiff here, the trial court was concerned only with the parties to the present divorce action, and it was not bound to consider her possible remarriage as a material factor affecting the propriety of such award. <em>(Neary </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>102 Cal. 338, 344 [36 P. 655].) Its power to make such award is wholly statutory <em>(Litt </em>v. <em>Litt, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 242, 245 [170 P.2d 684]), and there appears to be no limitation on the value of a homestead that may be awarded to the wife as the innocent spouse in a divorce action.  The provision of section 1260 of the Civil Code, restricting the value of a homestead claim to \u201cnot exceeding seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500),\u201d fixes only the extent of exemption of such property \u201cfrom execution or forced sale\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a71240), as a limitation enacted solely for the benefit of judgment creditors <em>(Walton </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>59 Cal.App.2d 26, 29 [138 P.2d 54]), but has no application in a divorce action. The record discloses without dispute that the homestead property here in question was originally acquired by defendant for plaintiff, and as heretofore stated, they returned there to live on the day of their remarriage, he having promised prior thereto that \u201che would put the place in joint tenancy. \u201d  It is the policy of the law to protect the interest of the wife in homestead property <em>(Warner </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>144 Cal. 615, 618 [78 P. 24]) and in view of the circumstances here prevailing, the trial court appears to have been justified in awarding such property to plaintiff as \u201cthe innocent spouse under charges of extreme cruelty.\u201d <em>(Litt </em>v. <em>Litt, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 242, 245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">As his final point of objection .to the trial court\u2019s adjudication of the parties\u2019 property rights, defendant argues that in making the awards in favor of plaintiff, the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>unduly influenced and acted to his prejudice because of inadmissible testimony concerning the parties\u2019 maintenance of marital relations at various times during the period between their first divorce and their second marriage. As premise for the introduction of such line of testimony, plaintiff\u2019s counsel states that it was elicited from her in an attempt \u201cto establish a claim to property accumulated by the defendant between the divorce and remarriage on the principle that their relationship was the same as in the so-called \u2018 putative wife cases. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 However, since the trial court did not award to plaintiff any property accumulated during said period, it cannot be said that the admission of such testimony operated to defendant\u2019s prejudice or affected the property assignments in her favor. So pertinent are the trial court\u2019s comments in ruling on defendant\u2019s motion to strike out such testimony; \u201cI don\u2019t think we will strike it at this time. I don\u2019t think it will make any particular difference whether it is in the record or not. The farther we go in it the less all of those collateral, small issues seem to matter in the case as a whole.\u201d Under such circumstances, the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in disposition of the parties\u2019 property rights stemming from their second marriage will not be disturbed. <em>(Of., Crouch </em>v. <em>Crouch, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 747, 756.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The portions of the interlocutory decree of divorce here subject of appeal are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Gibson, C.

It is the general rule that in considering marriage settlement agreements, the court must seek the intention of the parties \u2018at the time of [their] execution, for it is their intention at such time that governs. \u2019 [Citations.] <em>Reaffirmance and ratification of agreements will preserve their legal effect but will not change it.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">It appears to me that the conclusion of the court as above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>quoted in italics is too narrow. I think, further, that when we \u201cseek the intention of the parties\u201d in respect to a series of agreements we are not bound to relate our inquiry solely to. the status of the parties at the date of the original document but rather that we should consider their circumstances as of the respective dates of the several agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The relevant purposes of the antenuptial agreement of October 1, 1928, and of the several amendments thereafter executed, are clearly apparent from the language used. As disclosed in the majority opinion the parties agreed \u201c \u2018in anticipation of [their forthcoming] marriage, the parties desire [d] ... to fix and determine the rights of each of them in any and all property . . and \u2018in consideration of said marriage,\u2019 each party specifically \u2018waive [d] any and all rights, claims and demands ... in and to [the] property\u2019 of the other, \u2018both during . . . life and after . . . death.\u2019 The agreement of June 28, 1935, made while the parties were \u2018living separate and apart,\u2019 was executed \u2018in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants\u2019 therein \u2018contained\u2019 . . . Expressly included in second party\u2019s release and waiver were future claims of \u2018interest in community property,\u2019 \u2018right to . . . homestead,\u2019 and \u2018any and all claims and rights, present and future, to support . . . saving and excepting such as ar\u00e9 provided for by <em>this </em>instrument\u2019 . . . Specifically recognizing \u2018the possibility of a future reconciliation, the parties declare [d] their intention to be that a reconciliation, either temporary or permanent ... or a <em>restoration of the former relations of said parties, or a further separation, temporary or permanent, after any </em>reconciliation\u2019 should \u2018not render this agreement or the \u201cAnte-Nuptial Agreement\u201d ... or any provision hereof or thereof, invalid, inoperative, rescinded or revoked\u2019 . . . Each of the various property settlement agreements subsequently executed by the parties was denominated \u2018 amendment to agreement. \u2019 . . . The last or \u2018fifth amendment to agreement\u2019 was that of August 24, 1943, some <em>nineteen months after the entry of the final decree of divorce in the first action </em>. . . And again \u2018the parties\u2019 ratified and reaffirmed \u2018all of the . . . agreements and amendments\u2019 theretofore executed and agreed that \u2018the same [should] continue in full force and effect as herein clarified. \u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The significant fact in relation to the last agreement is that by it, for admittedly valid consideration, the parties, <em>being then divorced, </em>agreed that the original antenuptial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>contract together with the several amendments, should \u2018 \u2018 continue in lull force and effect\u201d in the event of a \u201cresumption of former relations.\u201d The \u201cformer relations\u201d of the parties included those of husband and wife; such \u201cformer relations\u201d could be resumed only by remarriage; the republished and redeclared provisions relative to possible <em>future marriage </em>could have significance, in their futurity aspects as of that date, only to a remarriage; the parties did remarry and this litigation has ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The majority opinion affirms the trial court in holding that \u201call of the aforementioned agreements, including that of August 24, 1943, \u2018are now and were at all times valid and subsisting and have not been cancelled, rescinded or annulled\u2019 but \u2018since the marriage\u2019 of the parties \u2018on May 11, 1945 . . . their rights and duties towards each other . . . are controlled by the laws of the State of California and not by the said agreements as to all things occurring since said marriage on May 11, 1945.\u2019 \u201d The decree, among other things, allows the plaintiff the sum of $300 a month provided for by the agreements and in addition awards her \u201cthe sum of $600.00 per month for her support and maintenance\u201d until she remarries; it also bestows upon her certain community property and assigns to her \u201ca portion of the homestead theretofore declared by her upon defendant\u2019s separate property known as the Santa Ynez ranch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The effect of the majority opinion is to give to plaintiff all the continuing benefits and to relieve her of all continuing obligations under the several agreements; as to defendant, insofar at least as the agreements are executory, the judgment imposes on him their burdens but deprives him of their benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">This holding seems to me to allow the plaintiff \u201cto both eat her cake and have it too. \u2019 \u2019 I would reverse the portions of the decree which are the subject of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Shenk, J., and Carter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied February 28, 1949.
