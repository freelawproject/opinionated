The will contains no residuary clause so that in the event of the failure of such devise and bequest, such property would descend to the decedent\u2019s heirs at law under the laws of succession. In the probate proceedings, the court ordered distribution of the mentioned property in pursuance of the terms of the will. From the portions of the decree of final distribution accordingly entered in favor of the \u201cUnited States of America,\u201d the heirs bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">The only question here presented is whether the challenged testamentary disposition to the \u201cUnited States of America\u201d is valid under the laws of this state. The parties advance the same opposing contentions in relation to the construction of section 27 of the Probate Code, prescribing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>\u201cwho may take by will,\u201d as were considered and resolved in a like situation prevailing in the <em>Estate of Burnison, </em>this day decided, <em>ante, </em>p. 638 [204 P.2d 330]. The only additional point here made relates to the pertinency of the government\u2019s reference to two specific federal statutes as establishing the \u201cauthority of the United States to take by will.\u201d One is the Act of April 3, 1945 (59 Stats. 48, e. 51, \u00a74; 31 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 757e), declaring that \u201cthe Treasurer of the United States . . . shall effect redemption\u201d of \u201cany direct obligation of the United States\u201d (such as government bonds) that \u201cis bequeathed by will to the United States\u201d; and the other is the Act of March 3, 1903 (32 Stats. 1112, c. 1007, \u00a7 1; 40 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 304), authorizing \u201cthe Secretary of the Treasury ... to sell such lands as have been or may hereafter be acquired by the United States by devise.\u201d However, such congressional enactments, by their provision for the government\u2019s disposition of such testamentary gifts, can be regarded as no more than implied recognition of the power of the United States to take property by will, but only where such act would be in accordance with the law of the state governing the right to make the testamentary disposition in question. Certainly such federal statutes cannot validate a \u201cdevise\u201d or \u201cbequest\u201d of property in this state made by a California resident contrary to our statutory law. <em>(Estate of Burnison, supra.) </em>Accordingly, the objections of the heirs to the claims of the \u201cUnited States of America\u201d under the terms of the decedent\u2019s will must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The portions of the decree here subject of appeal are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">.Gibson, C.
