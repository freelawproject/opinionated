Filtzer to pay to petitioner and respondent, Mary Louise Harder, a family allowance \u201cfor the support and maintenance\u201d of Gregory Francis Filtzer, the minor child of petitioner and decedent. In challenge of the propriety of such order, there is argued: (1) the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the application of the legitimating statute (Civ. Code, \u00a785); and (2) the error of the trial court in awarding attorney fees in this proceeding. Neither of these points is well taken in view of the record and settled legal principles bearing thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">Francis W. Filtzer died on or about May 9, 1947, leaving as his surviving spouse Evelyn R. Filtzer. In 1945, she had filed an action for divorce against said decedent and an interlocutory decree was granted 'in September' of that year, but a few months thereafter the action was dismissed. In November, 1945, divorce proceedings were instituted between Mary Louise Harder, petitioner herein, and Hans Frederick Harder, and on January 3, 1946, an interlocutory decree was entered therein. On or about January 13, 1946, petitioner and Francis W. Filtzer, the decedent, went through a \u201cmarriage ceremony\u201d in Tijuana, Mexico, and thereafter lived together as husband and wife in California. As a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>that marital union a child was born on July 22, 1947\u2014said Gregory Francis Filtzer. In pursuance of the provisions of section 85 of the Civil Code\u2014that \u201cThe issue of a marriage which is void or annulled or dissolved by divorce is legitimate\u201d\u2014petitioner sought \u201ca reasonable allowance\u201d from the decedent\u2019s estate for the \u201csupport and maintenance\u201d of said minor child, together with \u201cattorney\u2019s fees ... on account of . . . services . . . rendered\u201d in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">' After hearing, the trial court made an order in which it found that petitioner and decedent \u201centered into a marriage ceremony in the State of Morales, Republic of Mexico, and that said, marriage between said decedent and said petitioner, Mary Louise Harder, was, by said Mary Louise Harder, entered into in good faith, and that said marriage has never been dissolved, annulled or otherwise set aside. That following said marriage, said petitioner, Mary Louise Harder and said Francis W. Filtzer lived together in the City of Avalon, Count)' of Los Angeles, State of California, as husband and wife, and engaged in the marital relationships of husband and wife.\u201d The court further found that petitioner was \u201centitled to [a] reasonable allowance out of the above entitled estate for the maintenance of said child, for the payment of doctor and hospital bills, and for the employment of attorneys to protect the interest of said child.\u201d Accordingly, the court ordered the administrator to pay to petitioner \u201c$500.00 attorneys fees, $275.00 hospital and doctor bills, and $100.00 for the support and maintenance of said minor child . . . each and every month . . . until further order of the . . . court.\u201d From such order the administrator has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Section 680 of the Probate Code declares, as here material, that a minor child is \u201centitled to such reasonable allowance out of the estate [of its father] as shall be necessary for [its] maintenance according to [its] circumstances, during the progress of the settlement of the estate. \u2019 \u2019 Appellant contends that the evidence Avas insufficient to bring petitioner\u2019s claim Avithin the scope of this section and therefore the order for an allowance to the minor child in question was improperly made. In this connection he maintains: (1) that no marriage was in fact proA'ed; but (2) if a marriage actually did take place, it Avas not shown to have been contracted in good faith on the part of either party and the child accordingly would not be legitimate under section 85 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The only testimony relative to the marriage was that of petitioner, who stated that she and the decedent \u201cwent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>through\u201d a \u201cmarriage ceremony\u201d before an official in Tijuana, Mexico, who delivered to her \u201ca document written in the Spanish language\u201d purporting to evidence the ceremony just performed; and that thereafter she received through the mail \u201ca document\u201d purporting to be an official \u201ctranslation\u201d in English of the \u201cmarriage certificate.\u201d Each of these documents was introduced into evidence over objection that \u201cno proper foundation [had been] laid\u201d therefor. With regard to the issue of good faith, petitioner testified that decedent told her that \u201cwe could not get married anywhere in the State of California, but that we could go to Mexico and it would be valid in any state\u201d; that whenever they talked of their forthcoming marriage, the decedent assured her \u201cwe could get married in Mexico and it [we] would be married anywhere\u201d; that she relied upon these statements of the decedent, went through the \u201cceremony in reliance upon\u201d them, and thereafter they \u201clive[d] together as husband and Avife,\u201d she \u201cusing [his] name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In his attack upon the sufficiency of petitioner\u2019s proof of the marriage, appellant urges that \u201cno evidence Avas adduced as to [the] hrws\u201d of the State of Morales, Mexico, and therefore \u201cit must be presumed\u201d that the laws of that state are \u201cthe same\u201d as California; that \u201cno evidence Avas presented that the parties had obtained a license to marry,\u201d that \u201cthe person . . . perform[ing] the purported marriage ceremony was authorized by Irav\u201d so to do, or \u201cof his official capacity ... [or] identity\u201d; and that \u201cthe court erred in receiving into exudenee the purported marriage certificate and translation thereof.\u201d But such evidentiary considerations have no pertinency here in derogation of the force of petitioner\u2019s claim as directed solely to the establishment of the legitimacy of the minor child in question. A purported marriage which, by reason of a legal disability existing at that time [one of the parties already married], is rendered Aroid [as creating a bigamous relationship between the parties] and so \u201cdeemed null in law\u201d as regards them, nevertheless comes within the scope of the legitimating statute for the protection of the issue, Avho become \u201cin relation to their father, the inheritors of his name, his heirs apparent, and entitled to look for, and demand from him, his care, maintenance and protection.\u201d <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>Bennet, </em>2 Cal. 503, 506.) To like effect is the <em>Estate of Shipp, </em>168 Cal. 640 [144 P. 143], where the offspring of a marriage \u201cnull in law\u201d because of the \u201cwant of a license\u201d was held legitimate in determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>right of heirship upon distribution of the alleged father\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Here the testimony of petitioner stands undisputed that she and the decedent actually went through what purported to be a marriage ceremony and received a certificate to that effect. As bearing upon her description of the ceremony, the purported marriage certificate, and translation thereof were properly introduced into evidence. The authorities cited by appellant in challenge of their admissibility in the absence of \u201ccompetent outside evidence\u201d establishing their authenticity\u2014that a \u201cmarriage certificate does not prove itself,\u201d and that \u201c [p]roof of the signature of the person by whom it purports to have been signed, and of his authority to perform the marriage ceremony is necessary\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Le Doux, </em>155 Cal. 535, 550 [102 P. 517]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>72 Cal.App. 406, 408 [237 P. 757])\u2014are not applicable here for, as declared by the trial court, the documents were admitted in evidence \u201cnot ... to prove a valid marriage\u201d but to support the\u25a0 testimony of petitioner that \u201cshe went through a . . . marriage ceremony down there [Mexico] at that time,\u201d that \u201ca certificate\u201d\u2014\u201cwhether or not . . . valid\u201d\u2014\u201cwas presented to [her] when she entered into [the] marriage,\u201d and that she believed that she was legally married\u2014the \u201ceffect on [her] mind.\u201d In short, the documents were relevant in substantiation of petitioner\u2019s claim, and in corroboration of her testimony, that she acted in good faith and assumed marital relations with the decedent in the belief that they were legally married.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">It is. frequently said that in order to legitimate the issue of a bigamous marriage\u2014as is here involved\u2014under statutes identical with or similar in wording to section 85 of the Civil Code, it must appear that at least one of the parties to such attempted marriage contracted in good faith, believing it to be a valid marriage. (See anno., 84 A.L.R. 499, 501; 3 Cal.L.Rev. 160, 162; 19 So.Cal.L.Rev. 457, 458.) However, here it is unnecessary to pass upon that question, for the trial court found, upon substantial evidence, that the \u201cmarriage was, by [petitioner], entered into in good faith\u201d and that thereafter she and the decedent \u201clived together ... as husband and wife.\u201d Appellant attacks this finding upon the premise that the testimony of petitioner as to her good faith is so inherently improbable as, to be unworthy of belief, and .that this court should therefore disregard her statements and .declare the .findings of the trial court based thereon to be with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>out support in the evidence. But he cannot prevail in the light of the record sustaining the trial court\u2019s determination of the point as a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Nor can it be said that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees as part of the order granting the \u201cfamily allowance.\u201d As appears from the record incident to the discussion of the point at the hearing, the payment of the attorney fees was ordered as \u201csomething . . . necessary for his [the child\u2019s] support and maintenance, just the same as room and board or anything else.\u201d In so distinguishing the premise of the award of the attorney fees as in \u201cthe interest of the child,\u201d the court expressly limited its consideration to services, rendered \u201cin connection with [the] petition for family allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">While appellant cites no authority holding that attorney fees are not allowable in a proceeding such as this, he relies on the general rule that \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d are not recoverable unless \u201cspecifically provided for by statute . . . [or] agreement ... of the parties\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a71021; see 7 Cal.Jur. \u00a7 27, p. 286; <em>Los Angeles Trust &amp; Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>197 Cal. 103, 107 [239 P. 847]; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>217 Cal. 184, 194 [17 P.2d 993]; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>71 Cal.App. 389, 392 [235 P. 653]; <em>Bank of America National Trust &amp; Savings Assn. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>18 Cal.App.2d 522, 529 [64 P.2d 460]; <em>Exchange National Bank of Tulsa </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>52 Cal.App.2d 544, 547 [126 P.2d 620]), except in \u201ccertain actions'in equity\u201d\u2014representative or class suits, \u201cwhere the courts will award\u201d to the successful litigant from the fund preserved or protected \u201cfor the benefit of [himself] and others . . . compensation . . . for the services of [his] attorneys\u201d as justice requires. <em>(Estate of Marr\u00e9, </em>18 Cal.2d 191, 192 [114 P.2d 591].) However, such authorities have no relevancy here, for the trial court did not deem \u201cpetitioner . . . entitled to attorneys fees as attorneys fees\u201d but correlated such added relief with the concept of an obligation assumed by her on behalf of the child \u201cto defend his rights\u201d to share in the decedent\u2019s estate. Thus, the trial court expressly declared its views to be that an \u201callowance\u201d to petitioner \u201cout of the [decedent\u2019s] estate . . . for the employment of attorneys to protect the interest of said child\u201d rested on the same principle as one made \u201cfor the payment of doctor and hospital bills\u201d incurred on his behalf\u2014\u201cnecessary\u201d for his support and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>In line with this theory of the trial court is the case of <em>Arais </em>v. <em>Kalensnikof, </em>10 Cal.2d 428 [74 P.2d 1043, 115 A.L.R. 163], where suit was instituted to compel a father to support his illegitimate child under section 196a of the Civil Code, which at that time [1937] read as follows: \u201cThe father as well as the mother, of an illegitimate child must give him support and education suitable to his circumstances. A civil suit to enforce such obligations may be maintained in behalf of a minor illegitimate child, by his mother or guardian, and in such action the court shall have power to order and enforce performance thereof, the same as under sections 138, 139 and 140 of the Civil Code, in a suit for divorce by the wife.\u201d After discussing the evidence sustaining the finding on the parentage issue against the defendant, the court stated at page 434: \u201cAlso, as section 196a of the Civil Code requires a father to support his child, the trial court had power to order him to pay attorney\u2019s fees in the action brought to enforce that obligation.\u201d In other words, the attorney\u2019s fees in an action prosecuted under authority of said section 196a were allowed as a part of the final judgment, not upon an express authorization of the statute but as a necessary element entering into considerations affecting the support and maintenance of the minor child. (See <em>Kyne </em>v. <em>Kyne, </em>38 Cal.App. 2d 122, 131-132 [100 P.2d 806], citing <em>Paxton </em>v. <em>Paxton, </em>150 Cal. 667 [89 P. 1083]; also <em>Kyne </em>v. <em>Kyne, </em>60 Cal.App.2d 326, 329 [140 P.2d 886].) Nor did the amendment of section 196a in 1939, by adding in the last clause a reference to sections 137 and 137.5 of the Civil Code and, as construed in <em>Carbone </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>18 Cal.2d 768, 770-772 [117 P.2d 872,136 A.L.R. 1260], so giving to the trial court, in an action brought under that statute, a power which it did not theretofore have\u2014the right to order attorney fees <em>pendente lite </em>in the same manner as \u201cin a suit for divorce by the wife\u201d\u2014 render \u201cthe law as it existed prior thereto and as it was interpreted by the courts . . . obsolete so far as . . . concerned . . . attorney\u2019s fees . . . assessed . . . in the final judgment\u201d <em>(Andrade </em>v. <em>Newhouse, </em>54 Cal.App.2d 339, 345 [128 P.2d 927] )\u2014\u201c [an] allowance . . . predicated upon the theory that such legal services are part of the child\u2019s right to support\u201d <em>{ibid., </em>p. 344; see, also, <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Chaplin, </em>74 Cal.App.2d 669, 678 [169 P.2d 453]).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">It is true that the present action is not a filiation proceeding instituted against a living parent to enforce the obligation of support, but the same reasoning should apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>where the claim is against the estate of the deceased father under section 680 of the Probate Code, entitling the minor child \u201cto such reasonable allowance out of the estate as shall be necessary for [its] <em>maintenance </em>according to [its] circumstances, during the progress of the settlement of the estate . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cMaintenance\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d are synonymous terms (Webster\u2019s New Int. Diet. 2d ed.), Unabridged, p. 1484; see <em>In re Lazar, </em>37 Cal.App.2d 327, 332 [99 P.2d 342]), envisaging alike the same considerations necessary to sustaining a livelihood\u2014and a child\u2019s need would in nowise differ according to whether the father was living or deceased, or whether it was the illegitimate or legitimate offspring of the parent. In this connection it is pertinent to note that \u201cfamily allowances are strongly favored in the law (11A Cal.Jur. 507.) . . . [statutes providing therefor] must be construed with the same spirit of liberality that prompted their enactment ... to guard and protect the family ...\u201d <em>(Estate of Jacobs, </em>61 Cal.App.2d 152, 155-156 [142 P.2d 454].) Accordingly, it would seem proper to conclude that in giving a child the right to an allowance for \u201cmaintenance\u201d against his father\u2019s estate, the Legislature intended to comprehend in such term all such elements as would reasonably enter as factors essential to the satisfaction of that obligation, including an allowance for attorney fees necessarily incurred in the prosecution of the statutorily authorized proceedings. Thereby the same protection is given the child in the matter of provision for a livelihood whether sought under section 196a of the Civil Code or section 680 of the Probate Code, and the trial court\u2019s power to order the payment of attorney fees for services rendered in the prosecution of the proceedings on behalf of the child would be identical in either ease, consistent with the finding that they were \u201cnecessary for his support and maintenance, just the same as room and board or anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In opposing these views, appellant unavailingly relies on certain observations in the <em>Estate of Marr\u00e9, supra, </em>18 Cal.2d 191, an appeal by a beneficiary of a trust from that portion of an order which denied his petition for an allowance from the trust funds with which to pay the fees of his attorney. The beneficiary had been successful in obtaining an order requiring the trustees of the trust to make payments to him for his support and maintenance, with the \u201camount\u201d thereof, however, \u201cto be determined in [their] sole judgment.\u201d <em>(Estate of Marr\u00e9, </em>18 Cal.2d 184, 190 [114 P.2d 586].) Consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>therewith, this court, in disposing of the controversy affecting the payment of the attorney fees, stated at pages 192-193: \u201cIt is suggested that under the facts of this case attorney\u2019s fees constitute a necessary expense of the beneficiary and should, therefore, be paid from the trust funds as a portion of the amount due for support and maintenance.' The amounts payable,, however, are to be determined in the sole judgment of the trustees, and under the facts here presented no ground is shown entitling appellant to an order of the court awarding him attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d In other words, the refusal of a court award of attorney fees was placed, not on the ground that such allowance would be without the concept of \u201csupport and maintenance, \u2019 \u2019 but because it would be a payment the amount of- which was for the trustees to determine in the exercise of their discretion. <em>(Estate of Marr\u00e9, supra, </em>18 Cal.2d 184, 190.) But the present ease is distinguishable, for here the court itself had the duty to determine what would be \u201cnecessary\u201d for the child\u2019s \u201cmaintenance\u201d\u2014and so was authorized to make \u201ca reasonable allowance\u201d therefor as the elements entering into such concept appeared from the evidence. The court here did not undertake to order the payment of attorney fees to petitioner as an item of \u201ccosts,\u201d so manifestly appellant\u2019s reference to the <em>Estate of Bevelle, </em>81 Cal.App.2d 720 [185 P.2d 90], for its discussion of the impropriety of such procedure unless \u201cexpressly allowed by statute or agreed to by express contract\u201d has no relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The order subject of this appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Gibson, C.
