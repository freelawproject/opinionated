The case was tried before a jury, which rejected plaintiffs\u2019 demand <em>in ioto </em>and returned a verdict in favor of defendant. Prom the judgment accordingly entered and the order denying their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>As their principal ground for reversal, plaintiffs challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, particularly as related to the federal Emergency Price Control Act (56 Stats. 23; 50 .U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 901 et seq.), to defeat their claim. A review of the record sustains plaintiffs\u2019 position on the issues of ownership and consequent possessory rights in the tractor, but various other considerations require further examination of the parties\u2019 rights in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">It appears that plaintiffs as contractors were engaged in a general grading business and in line with that activity, they bought, repaired, used, and sold tractors and kindred equipment. On November 10, 1941, they purchased the tractor in question\u2014No. 1H 7401\u2014from the Oilfields Trucking Company of Bakersfield, and received a bill of sale therefor. Such document was received in evidence without objection. After using the tractor in their business for almost four years, plaintiffs on November 7, 1945, negotiated a transaction with one Vergil Grove whereunder delivery of the tractor \u201ccompletely equipped\u201d was made to him that day. As evidence of such transfer of possession, Grove wrote by \u2022 hand a conditional sales agreement, which covered also another secondhand tractor and a carryall, and which was signed by both parties. ' The total charge for the three items was fixed at $23,500, of which $2,500 was paid then by Grove, and the writing (hereinafter cited as Exhibit A) specified the terms of further payments and the description of the three pieces of equipment afe follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201c11-7-45.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cI Hereby agree to Buy one cat. <em>&amp; </em>unit Serial 7401\u2014to be bought as rent at Terms of $1,000 down and 1,000 each month for 7 months &amp; one payment of $500, one cat <em>&amp; </em>unit &amp; \u2018A\u2019 frame Serial No. l-H-949</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">l-H-949</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\"><em>&amp; </em>one R-U- carry all for payment of $1,500 down &amp; 13 payments of $1,000 and one payment of $500, R-U\u20147747\u2014 after Said payments have been made in full Said buyer \u25a0 H-T-&amp; Guerin Bros.\u2019 are to furnish me with Bill of Sale to all this Equipment.

After two drafts as prepared in plaintiffs\u2019 office had been rejected by Grove, plaintiffs about December 15, 1945, forwarded to him a third document (hereinafter cited as Exhibit B) dated November 7, 1945, entitled \u201cAgreement of Lease of Personal Property (with Option to Buy),\u201d and required that he sign it or return the equipment delivered to him. The pertinent portions of Exhibit B are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201c1. The lessor (Guerin Brothers) hereby agrees to lease to the lessee (Vergil Grove), and the lessee hereby agrees to rent from the lessors all of that certain personal property described as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">.

The agreed monthly rental shall be the sum of $2,000.00 per month payable monthly in advance, commencing on the seventh (7th) day of November, 1945, and continuing on the seventh (7th) day of each and every succeeding month up to and including the seventh (7th) day of July, 1946, and the balance of $1,075.00 shall be paid on the seventh (7th) day of August, 1946, and the total rentals for said period shall be the sum of $19,075.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">\u201c4.

Payments shall be made to the lessors at their office - at 208 South' Linden Avenue, South San Francisco, California. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u25a0 Grove signed this latter document and made payments in connection with the transaction in the total amount of $5,500, the last under date of January 23, 1946. To be noted with respect to these two agreements bearing the same date are these parallel considerations: both relate to identical equipment; both call for aggregate payments of $23,500; both specify monthly payments in the amount of $2,000;. both stipulate interest at 8 per cent on deferred payments; and both provide that Grove should own itemized machinery upon fulfillment of the agreed terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">On or about January 21, 1946, John M. Kirst, defendant, negotiated the purchase of a new and distinct Caterpillar tractor from Grove for $8,300. The next day he paid that amount to Grove and received a bill of sale covering the transaction, with the understanding that delivery was to be made within 10 days. Apparently Grove could not' obtain the new tractor for defendant as scheduled and pending its availability, Grove on February 22, 1946, delivered to defendant on a loan basis plaintiffs\u2019 tractor No. 1H 7401\u2014the one here involved in suit. Finally about March 5, 1946, with Grove still unable to fulfill his delivery undertaking on the new tractor, defendant and Grove agreed that defendant would keep plaintiffs\u2019 tractor No. 1H 7401 for the price of $6,000 and there would be a $2,300 refund. The latter sum, however, was never repaid to defendant. Plaintiffs had no part in these dealings between Grove and defendant, nor had a bill of sale covering their tractor No. 1H 7401 following their acquisition of it on November 10, 1941, as above noted, ever been made\u2014either by plaintiffs in favor of Grove or by Grove in favor of defendant. Grove had entered into several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>other contract agreements with plaintiffs relative to the purchase of equipment, and of the aforementioned $8,300 he received from defendant, he forwarded $6,200 to plaintiffs for application on his general account with them. Within the exercise of their discretion, plaintiffs credited this sum in proportionate amounts to four of their outstanding contracts with Grove, but not including the agreement covering the tractor here in question. The propriety of such distribution of the moneys as subsequently itemized in correspondence with Grove is in nowise disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">On June 10, 1946, plaintiffs located their tractor No. 1H 7401 in defendant\u2019s possession. Plaintiffs thereupon demanded delivery of the tractor but defendant refused to surrender possession. Defendant had been using the tractor in good faith in his business, with the belief that he had purchased from Grove machinery which the latter owned and had the right to sell, and without knowledge of any interest of plaintiffs therein. Plaintiffs instituted this action on July 5, 1946. Under the evidence adduced at the trial, the tractor was valued at $6,000 or $7,000; and defendant in his answer admitted its reasonable rental value was $825 per month\u2014a figure he likewise stipulated in open court to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The foregoing review of the record on the issue of ownership between the parties establishes that plaintiffs, whether viewed as conditional vendors or lessors, were entitled to judgment for \u201cpossession\u201d of tractor No. 1H 7401 \u201cor the value thereof,\u201d in lieu of its return, \u201cand damages for the detention.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 667.) Plaintiffs did no act which was calculated to lead a reasonable person to believe that Grove was the absolute owner of such tractor.  Although defendant apparently relied on Grove\u2019s representation that he had complete power of disposition over the tractor that was in his possession, and accordingly paid Grove full value therefor in the belief that he was acquiring absolute title to the property, such circumstances cannot avail defendant against plaintiffs asserting their rights as the true owners, subject to the qualifications hereinafter mentioned. Grove was in the position of a mere possessor and he could not convey title, however innocent his vendee. <em>(Oakland Bank of Savings </em>v. <em>California Pressed Brick Co., </em>183 Cal. 295, 297 [191 P. 524]; <em>Pacific Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Hendley, </em>103 Cal.App. 335, 338 [284 P. 736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Nor in dispute of plaintiffs\u2019 possessory right to tractor No. 1H 7401 does it aid defendant to challenge the legality of plaintiffs\u2019 dealings with Grove upon the ground that the successive agreements\u2014Exhibits A and B\u2014when construed together, constituted a contract of conditional sale and, as such, are void because violative of the \u201cEmergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended [56 Stats. 23, 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 901 et seq.], and the Rules and Regulations issued pursuant thereto. \u2019 \u2019 Defendant apparently takes such position with the object (a) of overcoming plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the meaning and purpose of Exhibit B was to make a lease out of the transaction instead of a contract of sale, and (b) of then maintaining (1) that as vendee in possession and not in default Grove could with impunity \u201csell his interest\u201d to defendant, and (2) that the latter could establish by parol that plaintiffs\u2019 object was to evade the federal statute by wording the agreement in terms of a lease. Preliminarily, it should be said that in his negotiations with defendant, Grove did not purport to convey \u201chis interest\u201d in the tractor to defendant but rather undertook to transfer full and absolute title thereto.  But aside from that point, defendant cannot thus dispose of Exhibit B in the absence of appropriate pleading and proof. All of the conversations preceding the execution of Exhibit A were merged in that document, and all conversations and preliminary writings relative to the sale or lease of tractor No. 1H 7401 prior to the execution of Exhibit B were merged in that instrument. Exhibit B became the \u201cfinal memorial\u201d of the understanding of the parties; and consequently no testimony that would vary its provisions was competent, and no evidence of the terms of the agreement other than its own contents was admissible in the absence of a \u201cmistake or imperfection . . . put in issue by the pleadings.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1856; <em>Estate of Gaines, </em>15 Cal.2d 255, 264-265 [100 P.2d 1055]; <em>Nourse </em>v. <em>Kovacevich, </em>42 Cal. App.2d 769, 771-772 [109 P.2d 999]; <em>Mulrooney </em>v. <em>Pietro, </em>79 Cal.App.2d 311, 314 [180 P.2d 62].)  Moreover, in further consideration of this premise of defendant\u2019s attack, it-is significant that plaintiffs did not rely upon their agreements with Grove to establish their right to recover possession of the tractor, but upon their prior untainted legal title thereto. <em>(Of., Holm </em>v. <em>Bramwell, </em>20 Cal.App.2d 332, 336 [67 P.2d 114]; <em>Asher </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>26 Cal.App.2d 403, 409-411 [79 P.2d 457].) Accordingly, on this phase of the case it was wholly immaterial that defendant introduced evidence for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>of showing (1) that plaintiffs sold their tractor No. 1H 7401 to Grove for $8,500; (2) that the maximum price to be charged for such used tractor not rebuilt and guaranteed was 55 per cent of its \u201cbase price\u201d\u2014that is, the price f.o.b. the manufacturer\u2019s plant\u2014(Maximum Price Regulations, No. 136 of the United States Office of Price Administration, \u00a7 12 [e] [e]); and (3) that the base price of tractor No. 1H 7401 was $10,411.86, so that 55 per cent thereof would be $5,726.52. Plaintiffs were not trying to enforce any agreement they had with Grove with respect to the tractor in question, and their violation of the federal statute or of the regulations issued pursuant thereto would give defendant no rights in. contravention of plaintiffs\u2019 possessory claim as owners of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">However, the legality of plaintiffs\u2019 dealings with Grove are material in the equitable disposition of this controversy under the doctrine of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hollins, </em>118 Cal.App. 561 [5 P.2d 899], permitting an innocent purchaser to retain property bought from the conditional vendee upon paying the balance due the conditional vendor under the terms of the contract. Such regard for the p\u00e1rties\u2019 respective positions avoids undue enrichment of the conditional vendor through receipt of an amount in excess of what he might have obtained from his vendee and at the same time prevents unnecessary hardship upon the innocent purchaser, who,' after having paid full value to his transferor, would otherwise be compelled to deliver up the property or pay full value over again to the conditional vendor. <em>(Cf., U. 8. Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>International Metals Development, Inc., </em>74 Cal.App.2d 5, 14 [168 P.2d 37].) The same premise of equitable adjustment should prevail where a \u201clease with option to buy,\u201d rather than a conditional sales agreement, is involved, so that \u201cthe owner receives the [consideration] agreed upon together with interest and the innocent purchaser is penalized only to the extent necessary to fairly compensate the owner. The law has always endeavored to protect the rights of the innocent purchaser for value and such protection should readily be extended to those cases where no injustice is done to others.\u201d <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Hollins, supra, </em>118 Cal.App. 561, 565.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Under the above record the value of the three pieces of equipment\u2014two tractors and one carryall\u2014which plaintiffs transferred to Grove pursuant to their successive agreements \u2014Exhibits A and B\u2014was $23,500. It is conceded that the sale of such used or \u201csecond-hand\u201d equipment was subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>to the federal price regulations, with the \u201cmaximum price\u201d for a \u201crebuilt,\u201d \u201ctested\u201d and \u201cguaranteed product\u201d fixed at \u201c85 per cent\u201d of the new \u201cbase price,\u201d but if not so qualifying, then the \u201cmaximum price\u201d should be only \u201c55 per cent\u201d of the new \u201cbase price.\u201d (Maximum Price Regulations, No. 136 of the United States Office of Price Administration, \u00a712 [b] (2), [e].) Accepting the \u201cbase price\u201d listing stipulated by the parties as here applicable, the following table of computation is pertinent under the federal regulations :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHRq\">\n<em>85% of 55% of Base Price Base Price Base Price</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">Tractor No. 1H 7401 $10,411.86 $8,850.08 $5,726.52</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">Second Tractor No. 1H 949 $10,411.86 $8,850.08 $5,726.52</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyS\">Carryall $11,958.30 $10,164.56 $6,577.07</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">$27,864.72 $17,030.11</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Prom these figures it is clear that plaintiffs\u2019 sale of the three pieces of equipment for $23,500 would be within the legal limitation only if they were \u201crebuilt\u201d and \u201cguaranteed,\u201d and \u201cthe seller must so certify to the buyer on the invoice.\u201d (Maximum Price Regulations, No. 136, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12 [b] (iv).) The significance of these considerations with respect to the purport of Exhibit B as executed by plaintiffs and Grove in the form of a lease with option to buy is the express provision of the regulation\u2014effective at the time of plaintiffs\u2019 delivery of the equipment to Grove on November 7, 1945\u2014that the federal \u201cprice limitations . . . shall not be evaded whether by direct or indirect methods, in connection with an . . . agreement, sale, delivery, purchase, <em>lease of </em>or relating to commodities covered\u201d thereby, and among the \u201cspecific practices prohibited\u201d was <em>\u201crenting or leasing a new or second-hand product with an option to purchase, when the sum, of the rental and the sale price exceeds the </em>[established] <em>maximum price.\u201d </em>(Maximum Price Regulations, No. 136, <em>supra, </em>as revised March 26, 1945; \u00a7 26[a] [b] (8); emphasis added.) Defendant thus maintains that the validity of plaintiffs\u2019 total price listings for the three pieces of equipment under Exhibit B would have to conform with the limitations of the regulation and would require a written certificate by plaintiffs warranting such equipment to be \u201crebuilt\u201d and \u201cguaranteed\u201d so as to permit a charge exceeding 55 per cent, but not more than 85 per cent, of the base price. (See <em>Mechanical Farm Equipment Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>156 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>F.2d 296, 298-299.) No such certification now appears in the record in derogation of the charge of illegality and evasion of the federal price regulations, as presented by defendant, upon establishment of the legal base prices operative for the equipment and introduction in evidence of plaintiffs\u2019 successive agreements with Grove\u2014Exhibits A and B\u2014-neither of which mentioned a \u201cguaranty\u201d covering the equipment nor purported to be accompanied by any other document containing the required warranty. Such evidentiary matter is material to the affirmance of the legality of plaintiffs\u2019 price listings in the event of the exercise of the \u201coption to buy\u201d under Exhibit B (10 Cal.Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 88-89, pp. 782-784), for defendant would not be liable to pay more for tractor No. 1H 7401 than plaintiffs could lawfully charge under the effective price controls at the time of their agreements with Grove. Accordingly upon the retrial of this action, the proper price limitations will depend on the parties\u2019 showing in regard thereto. If it should appear that the equipment was \u201crebuilt\u201d and \u201cguaranteed,\u201d and was so certified so as to qualify within the higher price allowance for \u201csecond-hand products,\u201d then within that limitation the parties should agree or introduce evidence establishing what proportion of the $23,500 total sum covering the three items subject of exhibit B is properly assignable to tractor No. 1H 7401 for valuation. <em>(Field </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>131 Cal. 379, 383-384 [63 P. 692].)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Other matters must also be considered in connection with the accounting adjustment between the parties on this phase of the case.  First there is the payment of $5,500 which Grove indisputedly made to plaintiffs on Exhibit B. Defendant urges that he, in assuming Grove\u2019s obligations on the agreement, should receive credit for the whole of such sum in the determination of the balance of the purchase price owing on tractor No. 1H 7401. But such contention ignores the fact that the $5,500 payment applied to the <em>three </em>pieces of equipment covered by Exhibit B, and consequently only a proportionate distribution of that sum would be proper as an allowance to defendant consistent with the evidence relative to this point adduced on the retrial of this action.  Likewise to be mentioned here is the effect of Grove\u2019s payment of $6,200 to plaintiffs from the $8,300 which he received from defendant on January 22, 1946, pursuant to the latter\u2019s purchase of the new tractor, which Grove undertook to deliver to defendant and for which tractor No. 1H 7401 was later substituted at a valuation of $6,000, plus a $2,300 refund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>as above related. Defendant argues that since plaintiffs were enriched to the extent of $6,200 by reason of money paid by him, he should have credit therefor in the balance of accounts. But significantly, such $8,300 payment as initially negotiated between Grove and defendant had nothing to do with tractor No. 1H 7401 here involved, and the $6,200 thereof later paid by Grove to plaintiffs from his commingled funds was applied by them, in the exercise of their judgment, not to Grove\u2019s obligations under Exhibit B but to other outstanding accounts they had with him. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1479.) Accordingly, the testimony relating to these independent dealings was.material only to the establishment of defendant\u2019s status in proceeding in good faith with the purchase of the tractor, but it could not affect the settlement of the accounting issues of this case, and plaintiffs\u2019 objections within the bounds of this limitation were well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">There now remains the matter of plaintiffs\u2019 right to damages for defendant\u2019s detention of tractor No. 1H 7401 following their demand on him for its return on June 10, 1946.  In a replevin action the owner may r\u00e9cover the value of the use of his property where the amount thereof exceeds the interest on such value, inasmuch as the latter measure does not furnish adequate compensation for the wrongful detention. <em>(Drinkhouse v. Van Ness, </em>202 Cal. 359, 379 [260 P. 869]; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Hagerty, </em>37 Cal.App. 789, 792 [174 P. 908].) However, in computing such damages it is only the \u201cnet usable value less the .expense of keeping up the property\u201d which can be recovered by the aggrieved party. <em>(Mutch </em>v. <em>Long Beach Improvement Co., </em>47 Cal.App. 267, 269 [190 P. 638]; see, also, <em>Bonestell </em>v. <em>Western Automotive Finance Corp., </em>69 Cal.App. 719, 727 [232 P. 734]; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Finance &amp; Thrift Co. of Modesto, </em>124 Cal.App. 131, 138-139 [12 P.2d 50].) Defendant admitted in his pleading and likewise stipulated in open court that the reasonable rental value of tractor No. 1H 7401 was $825 per month. But, as defendant urges in relation to this item of recovery, there is the further matter of repairs made and expenses incurred by him for upkeep of the tractor.  During the course of the trial defendant made an offer of proof that the cost of overhauling the tractor at the time of his purchase from Grove and prior to his knowledge of plaintiffs\u2019 claim was $2,169.82. Such evidence was improperly excluded. <em>(Mutch </em>v. <em>Long Beach Improvement Co., supra, </em>47 Cal.App. 267, 269.)  Likewise defendant .should be permitted to show whatever expenditures he made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>with regard to the tractor after plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of their claim thereto and pending the disposition of this controversy, during which time defendant admittedly has been using the tractor in his buisness.  In addition, appropriate allowance should be made for the decline in rental value of the tractor over the years\u2014perhaps to the vanishing point\u2014consistent with the normal deterioration of a piece of machinery in the measure of its condition for the continued performance of effective work. It is only upon the basis of all these considerations that plaintiffs will be fairly compensated in a \u201creasonable\u201d amount for defendant\u2019s use of their tractor, and defendant will not be subject to \u201cunconscionable and grossly oppressive damages, contrary to substantial justice.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3359.) \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Plaintiffs argue that they should be allowed damages for the detention of the tractor computed on a fiat rate of $825 per month\u2014without regard for any repair expenditures made by defendant while it was in his possession or for any decline in rental value as would manifestly operate to reduce the monthly return properly assessable on equipment being subjected to continued use\u2014and on such basis the item would run \u201cfrom November 7, 1945 to date\u201d at $9,900 per year. Obviously such damage claim is grossly excessive and disproportionate when correlated with the value of the tractor\u2014 $6,000, according to plaintiffs\u2019 own figures, \u201cif it cannot be returned. \u2019 \u2019 While section 667 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for \u201cdamages for the detention\u201d of \u201cpersonal property\u201d as an item of appropriate recovery, it does not undertake to set out a formula for the determination of the amount thereof.  However, \u201cdamages must, in all cases, be reasonable\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3359), and this command of the law is controlling in every instance pursuant to the settled rule that all related provisions of the codes must be read and construed together, and that effect must be given to every section. The mere recital of plaintiffs\u2019 exorbitant demand demonstrates their position to be one wholly irreconcilable with the question of \u201creasonableness\u201d as an essential condition which enters into \u201call cases\u201d of damage recovery\u2014and the impropriety of such excessive relief need not be further discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Prom what has been said, it follows that the judgment must be reversed. On the other hand, it appears that plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was properly denied, as the trial court could not have entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>such judgment in favor of plaintiffs without a determination of the several issues of fact above discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is affirmed. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for a retrial in accordance with the views hereinabove expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Carter, J., Traynor, J., and Schauer, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
