Magrath, an orphan and an infant, alleging that the appellant had been so appointed guardian at the request of the great-grandmother of the child, and against the wishes of the mother, and claiming that he, the petitioner, was uncle to the child, and as such had a right to the guardianship, and praying the removal of the appellant and the appointment of himself, the appellee, as guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-7\">To this petition the appellant answered, denying any right in the petitioner, as uncle, to the guardianship, and denying that he, the respondent and appellant, had been appointed without the mother\u2019s consent, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-8\">Testimony was then taken orally in open Court, and the case argued, and the opinion of the Court announced, but not filed until some days afterwards, and so far the proceedings were <em>\u201csummary\u201d </em>but the Court afterwards filed their decree, and the respondent appealed and asked to have the proceedings made <em>\u201cplenary\u201d </em>and that the testimony be taken down in writing. The appellant then offered his answer upon oath, which the Court refused to receive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-9\">The testimony so taken was, in effect, as follows: The relationship existing between \u2018 the parties, as stated in the petition, having been established, it was proved that the appellant was a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, about fifty years of age, and of irreproachable character \u2014 some of the witnesses testifying that he was, in every way, well qualified for the trust to which he had been appointed, and others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>expressing tbe contrary opinion, and assigning as reasons therefor that the appellant was unmarried, without a domestic establishment, a parish priest charged with the care of an extensive parish, with a large congregation, and liable at any time to be removed to a different field of labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">Other witnesses testified to the excellent moral character of the appellee, his fitness for the guardianship of the infant, his niece; that he was a married man, his wife being also a cousin of the infant, and well suited and willing to assume its care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-6\">It was also proved that the infant was living in the boarding school of the Sisters of Charity, at St. Joseph\u2019s, Barre street, Baltimore, where, as far as was known, she was well fed and clothed, and otherwise well treated and cared for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-7\">The Orphans\u2019 Court, on the 9th of November, 1865, passed an order, that \u201cbeing convinced that it has the power to revoke, and that it would be for the best interest and happiness of the ward to revoke the letters of guardianship in said case, it orders and decrees that the letters of guardianship in said case, heretofore granted and committed to said Michael Slattery, as guardian of said Mary J. McGrath, be and the same are hereby revoked, and that the said James Smiley, who is the nearest of kin to the said ward, be and he is hereby appointed the new guardian,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-8\">Erorn this order the guardian first appointed ajjpealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-9\"><em>H\u00f3bert G. </em>Bcarry, for the appellant, argued :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-10\">1st.

The death of the mother of the ward, Mary Jane Magrath, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>fact, changed entirely the position and necessities of said Mary. Before that, the guardian, (though nominally in law the guardian both of her person and property,) was, in fact, but the trustee of her estate while her mother retained the custody and control of her person; sent her to school when she saw fit and withdrew her at her pleasure. But the death of that mother left the legal guardian the sole custodian of the person as well as the trustee of the estate. This new class of duties, thus devolved upon the guardian, most unquestionably should lead the Court to require different qualifications in the person selected to discharge those duties, from what would have been previously required. The Rev. Father, from the necessities of his position, could never afford the child a home.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b403-5\">Goldsborough, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APA\">delivered the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The appeal in this case is taken from an order or decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Baltimore city, passed on the 9th day of November, 1865, revoking the guardianship of the appellant, and appointing the appellee guardian to Mary Jane McGrath. The case was heard on petition, answer, replication and the testimony set out in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Courts to remove a guardian is derived from the 232nd section of the 93d Article of the Code. That section provides that the Orphans\u2019 Courts \u201c may, on the application of an infant, or any person in his behalf, suggesting improper conduct in any guardian, either in relation to the care and management of the property or person of any infant, inquire into the same, and at their discretion remove such guardian,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The appellant was appointed guardian in October, 1862, and the petition of the appellee was not filed until the 7th day of October, 1865. There was no appeal from the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court by which the appellant was appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>guardian; and this Court said, in the ease of <em>Lefever vs. </em>Lefever, 6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>478, that the act of the Court, in making an appointment of guardian; being the act of a Court oi competent jurisdiction, ought to be supported by every legal intendment, assuming, as we are bound to do, that the first appointment, coming before us thus incidentally, was legally and properly made. But the point before us is the propriety of the Court\u2019s action in revoking the guardianship of the appellant. By the 232nd section of the 93d Article, any application to remove a guardian, according to our construction of that section, must allege impioper conduct on the part of the guardian, either in relation to the care and management of the property or person of the infant; and such an allegation must be sustained by proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><em>We </em>have examined the appellee\u2019s petition and find no allegation whatever of improper conduct on the part of the appellant since his appointment. \"Whatever influence the facts set out in the petition might have had upon the action of the- Orphans\u2019 Court when the appellant was appointed, we are not called on now to decide. But the appellee contends that the removal of the appellant was within the discretion of the Orphans\u2019 Court, and, therefore, no appeal will lie. By the \u00a39th section of the 5th Article of the Code, it is provided that \u201cin all decrees, orders, decisions and judgments made by the Orphans\u2019 Courts, the party who may deem himself aggrieved by such decree, order, decision or judgment, may appeal to the Court of Appeals,\u201d &amp;c. This comprehensive language will certainly embrace this case, especially as the petition does not allege, or the evidence show, any improper conduct on the part of the appellant, therefore, the discretion exercised by the Court was not a sound, legal discretion, but arbitrary and subject to review by this Court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Finding that there was error in the decree of the Orphans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Court, tbe same will be reversed with costs in both Courts to the appellant, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AKi\">(Decided July 12th, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
