The declaration alleged: \u201cThat William Carr, trading under the name and firm of William Carr &amp; Co., sues Joseph H. Meixel and McHenry Grafton, co-partners, trading under the name and firm of Meixel and Grafton, for that the defendants converted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>to tlioir own use, or wrongfully deprived tlio plaintiff of the uso and possession of tlie plaintiffs\u2019s goods, that is to say, four barrels of whiskey; and the plaintiff claims therefor $500. The defendants pleaded <em>\u201cnot gvdly </em>issue was joined, a jury sworn, and a verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff for $156.08. The defendants filed a motion in arrest of judgment, which motion the Court overruled, and entered judgment on the verdict, whereupon the defendants appealed to this Court,</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">The cause was argued before Bowle, O. J., and Golds-borough, Cochran and \"W icigsx,, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-6\"><em>John, If. Frazier, </em>for the appellants, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-7\">1st. That tlie declaration was in tlie alternative; that it did not set forth, any proper cause of action, and was therefore materially defective, and cited: 1 <em>Chitty on Pleading, </em>237. <em>Stephen on Pleading, page </em>387. <em>Cook vs. Cox, </em>3 <em>M. &amp; S., </em>114. <em>Griffith vs. Eyles, </em>1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul., </em>413. <em>Stirling vs. </em>Garritee, 18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>468.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-8\">2nd. That the defect was not cured by verdict, and the objection was properly taken by motion in arrest of judgment. <em>Cook vs. Cox, </em>3 <em>M. &amp; S., </em>114. <em>Fugit vs. Brayton, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>350. <em>Stirling, et al., vs. </em>Garritee, 18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>468.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-9\"><em>Benjamin F. Ilorwilz, </em>for the appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-10\">1st. The declaration is in the precise language of the 28th form prescribed by 1 Code, Art. 75, (p. 514,) which form, by the 22nd section of that Art. (p. 510,) is expressly declared sufficient, and tlie sufficiency of which form is reiterated by the clause between the 13th and 14th forms of said article, on page 511. As, therefore, Hiero is nothing unconstitutional in this law, the act of the Legislature declaring this form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>sufficient is, it is submitted, conclusive on the point, and it is not necessary to examine its language, as the Legislature .had the power to introduce any language and declare it sufficient, and <em>ipso facto </em>it became sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">2d. This Court has decided the very form used to be good. <em>Stirling vs. </em>Garritee, 18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>468.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\">3d. The rule of pleading, laid down in the Code, would make it good if it -were not a prescribed form of the Code. 1 Code, sec. 3, Art. 75, p. 507, and 1 Code, sec. 14, Art. 29, p. 194.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">4th. This declaration would, however, be good if it were not a prescribed form, especially after verdict, when every intendment is made to support the verdict; <em>or, </em>means in this form, <em>viz: </em>or <em>and. </em>' (In the construction of deeds and wills <em>or </em>is often construed to mean <em>and. See Janney vs. Sprigg, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>202.) If it were a defect, it would however be cured by verdict. 1 <em>Chitty on Pleading, </em>673, 674, 682. <em>Merrick vs. Bank of Metropolis, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>74. <em>Ing vs. State, </em>8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>295. <em>Evans' Practice, </em>331. 1 Code, Art. 75, secs. 8 and 9, p. 507.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-8\">Cochran, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AP9\">delivered the opinion of this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The count in the declaration on which the appellants moved to arrest the judgment is, \u201cthat the defendants converted to their use, or wrongfully deprived the plaintiff of, the plaintiff\u2019s goods, that is to say,\u2018 four barrels of whiskey, &amp;c.,\u201d and, as the injury complained of is laid in the alternative, the motion asserts that the account is not sufficient to sustain a judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">The point thus presented differs very materially from the one decided in <em>Sterling vs. </em>Garritee, 18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>468.\u2014 There, the plaintiff claimed a return of the property of which he had boon deprived, or its value, and $1,500 for its detention. The damages were assessed generally, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>judgment was arrested for the reason that no damages were claimed for a conversion of the property, and because the verdict could not,-with reference to the declaration, be held to ascertain its value. No such difficulty is presented here. The alternate forms in which the wrong is laid are equivalents, and relating to the same thing, import a single injury for which the appellee claimed the damages found by the jury. A more particular notice of this point seems to be unnecessary. The form of the count upon which this verdict was rendered is expressly prescribed in the Code, Art. 75, sec. 22, sub-sec. 29, and in sec. 22, declared to be sufficient.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AP0\">(Decided June 1st 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\n<em>Judgment affivrmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
