It appears from the record thereby brought up, that Boyle was indicted at a special term of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel county, held in May, 1865, for the murder of Thomas H. Watkins, committed on the 25th of March, 1865, and upon his suggestion and affidavit this case was, on the 25th of May, 1865, removed to the Circuit Court for Howard county, to be held on the first Monday of September then next, for trial. He was then tried and convicted in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel county on two other indictments, one for larceny and the other for an assault with intent to murder, and on the 22d of June, 1865, by judgment of that Court, was sentenced to the penitentiary for four years in one case, and five in the other, and under these sentences was, on the same day, taken to and confined in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-6\">On the 20th of September, 1865, at the September term of the Circuit Court for Howard county, to which the indictment for murder had been removed, the judge of that Court, on motion of the State\u2019s Attorney, issued a writ of <em>habeas corpus^ </em>directed to the warden of the penitentiary, commanding him to have the body of John Boyle, \u201c with the day and cause of his being taken and detained,\u201d before him, the said judge, on the 26th of September, 1865, \u201cto do and receive all and singular those things which the said judge shall then and there consider concerning him in this behalf, and have here this writ.\u201d On the return day the warden came into Court with Boyle in his custody, and made return to the writ in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>open court, \u201cthat the said John Boyle is now in Court, and annexed herewith is a copy of the warrants by which he is held in custody,\u201d being copies of the judgments of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel county, before referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">The State, by its attorneys, then moved the Court that the custody of Boyle be transferred and handed over to the sheriff\" of Howard county, in order that he might be tried on the said indictment for murder. At the same time, and before hearing this motion, Boyle, by his counsel, moved to quash the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>and prayed the Court to remand him to the penitentiary, alleging as a reason, the previous judgments in Anne Arundel county, his confinement thereunder, by reason whereof he had been unable to prepare for his trial, the non-expiration of these sentences, and that he could not be lawfully tried until the periods of confinement under those sentences shall have expired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\">The Court overruled the State\u2019s motion and sustained that of the prisoner, and thereupon ordered and adjudged that Boyle be remanded to the custody of the warden aforesaid.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-7\">Afterwards, on the 20th of October, 1865, the State, by its attorney, made application to tlie Hon.

Opon this application, without any order of Judge Sm\u00edti\u00ed, as equity judge, granting it or ordering the writ upon the same day, as stated in the record, the said State produced (to whom <em>non constat) </em>the writ of the State of Maryland for the correction of errors, commanding that the judgment aforesaid, so a&amp; aforesaid rendered, with all things thereunto relating, be transmitted to the Court of Appeals for the State of Maryland, the tenor of which said writ is as follows <em>t</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-8\">\u201c To the Honorable John E.

That the writ does not show upon its face that it was issued by the Judge of the Circuit Court for Howard county, sitting in equity, to whom the application for it was made. It is not under seal, nor is it issued and tested like any other original writ, nor does it purport to come from any Court or any competent source or authority. The Code, Art. 5, sec. 4 provides, that\u00a3\u00a3 writs of error may be sued out in civil or criminal cases as heretofore practiced in this State.\u201d1 A writ of error is an original writ issuing out of Chancery, and whilst the High Court of Chancery was in existence in this State was always issued out of that Court. The mode of proceeding was by an application to the Chancellor, and the writ itself always disclosed on its face that it was issued by the Chancellor. \"When that Court was abolished, and its jurisdiction transferred to the Circuit Courts and the Courts of Baltimore city, the mode of obtaining the writ has always been by an application to the equity side of the Circuit Courts, or to some Court in Baltimore city having equity jurisdiction, and in all such cases, like every other original writ, the authority of the Court issuing it appears on its face. Snell lias been the uniform practice in Maryland from the earliest times. When issued, the writ is to he served upon the clerk of the Court which has rendered the erroneous judgment, who allows it, as a matter of course, and transmits a transcript of the record, with the writ of error attached, to the Court of Appeals, under the seal of his Court, as in cases of appeals. No precedent for any such writ, as is in tliis record, can he found in any of the cases which have-come up to this Court on writs of error. The clerk has no authority vested in him to issue a writ of error. As establishing the practice, the forms of the writ in this particular in several cases will he given from the original records in this Court; they can be multiplied to any extent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">In the case of <em>State vs. </em>Buchanan, 5 <em>H. &amp; </em>J., 317, the writ concludes thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u201c Witness the Honorable William Kilty, Chancellor, this sixteenth day of April, eighteen hundred and twenty-one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">Test: \u2014 Ramsey Waters,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-6\">(Seal.)'

But if the writ be in proper form it must be quashed, because no final judgment has been rendered in the Court below. No writ of error can be brought but on a final judgment, or on an award in the nature of a judgment, for the words of the writ are <em>si judieium reddidvm sit. </em>The order of the Court below, remanding Boyle to the custody of the warden, is no final judgment disposing of the indictment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>murder; that indictment is still left pending and undisposed of, and Boyle can be tried upon it when ho shall have served out his present sentence in the Penitentiary. In the case of <em>State vs. </em>Buchanan, it was strongly urged that a writ of error would in no criminal case lie at the instance of the State, but that it was at all times the privilege of the accused alone. The Court, however, decided the State had the right to sue out the writ as well as the accused; that the right was reciprocal. Now, if the State can maintain this writ before final judgment, then if the decision had been adverse to Boyle on his motion, and the Court had ordered him to the custody of the sheriff and to be put on his trial, lie could have stopped the trial by writ of error before final judgment, and brought up for review, before being tried, the action of the Court in this respect. Would the writ of error in such a case have been sustained by this Court ? The cases are clear, and the current of authorities unbroken, that a writ of error will not lie against any interlocutory judgment before final judgment is given. <em>Boteler </em>&amp; <em>Belt vs. State, </em>7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>109, 112. <em>Keirle &amp; Walker vs. Shriver, </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>405. <em>Evans' Prac., </em>429, 436. <em>Ray vs. Fitch, </em>1 <em>Root, </em>290, 181. <em>Carpenter vs. Childs, Id., </em>181. <em>Gleason vs. Chester, </em>1 <em>Day, </em>27. 3 <em>Bac.

In that event, (if a writ of error lies in such a case,) it is respectfully submitted, that this Court is confined to the consideration of the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>and the return thereto, and the action of the Court below thereon. The return to the writ that the party is confined in the Penitentiary by the final judgment and sentence of a Court of competent jurisdiction, is clearly sufficient and justified the Court below in quashing the writ and remand-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ing the party to the custody of the warden. <em>Code, Art. </em>43, <em>sec. 11.

In reply to the first point of the defendant in error on the motion to quash, the State relies upon the Code, Art. Y., see. 1, which provides that \"an appeal may he taken\u2018from a Court of Law or Equity by application to the <em>clerk, </em>* * * and upon such application, if made within the time prescribed by law for taking such appeal, the <em>clerk </em>(register, commissioner or justice,) to whom the same is made, shall enter a prayer of appeal upon his docket or minutes of proceedings and transmit the papers or a transcript of the record as hereinafter required.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-7\">Section 3 of the same Art. provides for appeals \u201c from any judgment or determination of any Court of Law in any civil suit or action, or in any prosecution for the recovery of any penalty, fine or damagesand sec. 4 provides, first, for appeals in cases of petition for freedom and <em>mmdamus, </em>and then provides, that \u201cwrits of error may be sued out in civil or criminal cases as heretofore practiced in this State.\u201d This does not mean that the formalities then observed should still be literally conformed to, but that they should be substantially observed as far as the changes in our Constitution and laws will allow. It is not now necessary that the writ should show upon its face that it was issued by the Circuit Court in equity, or by the judge of that Court. The certificate of the clerk is sufficient evidence that the writ was duly authorized. Sec. 29 of the same Art. directs, that \u201cupon any appeal being taken in a Court of Law or Equity, or any writ of error sued out, the <em>clerk </em>shall make out and transmit to the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Appeals a full transcript of the record,\u201d &amp;c. And in cases of appeals from Orphans\u2019 Courts similar duties are devolved upon the registers. TJpon this point see also 3 <em>Bac. Abr., </em>341, <em>title \u201c Writ of Error.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-5\">The assertion that the position contended for on the other side is established by the <em>uniform </em>practice in Maryland from the earliest times, cannot be maintained. See the ease of the <em>State vs. Buchanan, </em>5 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>J. </em>329. On the contrary, it is said on page 331 of the opinion in that case, \u201cfrom that time to the present, the uniform practice under that Act, (Act of 1713, eh. 4,) has been for the <em>dark </em>to send up the transcript of the proceedings under his hand only, and the seal of the Court, together with the writ of error, as is done in this case, unaccompanied by the signature of the judge to the return of the writ.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-6\">2. In answer to the second point of the defendant in error, viz., that if the writ be in proper form it must be quashed because no <em>final </em>judgment has been rendered in the Court below, the State maintains that the position is utterly inconsistent with the language of secs. 18 <em>&amp; </em>42 of Art. T. of the Code. Sec. 18 provides expressly for appeals or writs of \u2022error taken from \u201cany order of the Court antecedent to final judgment,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-7\">But the decision of the Court below was not interlocutory, it was final <em>quoad </em>the matter before the Court.

First, on account of defects on the face of the writ. Secondly, because the judgment or determination of the Court below was one from which no writ of error lies. Considering that the first objection was fatal, this Court sustained the motion and ordered the writ to be quashed, and delivered the following opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\u201cIt was decided in <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>case 5 <em>H. &amp; J. </em>317, that a writ of error may be sued out by the State as well as by the prisoner in a criminal case. The writ is an original writ issuing out of chancery, directed to the Court of Law, by whose judgment the alleged error has been committed. Formerly, in Maryland, such writs usually, if sued out of the high Court of Chancery, were granted by the chancellor and verified by his attestation. Since the Court of Chancery was abolished, the power of granting writs of error resides in the judges of the Circuit Courts sitting in chancery. Without such a writ, issued by a competent tribunal, this Court has no jurisdiction or power to review a judgment rendered by a Circuit Court in a criminal case. In this case the supposed writ of error, upon which the proceedings of the Circuit Court have been brought before us for review, appears upon inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tion not to have been issued by any competent tribunal. It does not appear to have been issued or authorized by the Circuit Court sitting as a Court of Chancery, but was issued and signed only by the clerk without the attestation of the judge, and is not authenticated by the official seal. There is no authority given by the Code or by any statute to the Clerk to grant a writ of error; nor is the writ before us in conformity with the established practice in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">No precedent has been cited by the Attorney General to sanction the proceeding in this case; for this reason the writ of error must be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Whether the judgment or determination of the Circuit Court upon the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is such a final judgment as may be brought up for review on a writ of error properly issued, is a question of more importance, upon which the Court does not now express any opinion. It will be considered and decided before the case is finally disposed of, because upon its decision may depend the future action of the State\u2019s officers in determining whether they will obtain another writ of error from the proper Court and in proper form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">This question has been since examined and maturely considered, and this Court is of opinion that from the judgment of the Circuit Court upon the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>no writ of error lies. This results from the nature of the proceeding, being a matter resting in the discretion of the Court below, and also from the nature of the judgment, which is not, in legal acceptation, \u201ca judgment or determination of a Court of law in any civil suit or action,\u201d from which alone appeals or writs of error would lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">This subject has been very fully considered in the case of <em>Coston vs. Coston &amp; </em>others, decided at the present term, and in the opinion delivered by the Chief Justice the reasons and authorities controlling our judgment are fully stated, considering them as applicable to this case; we are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>opinion that no writ of error could be maintained in the present ease. <em>We </em>express no opinion upon tho point decided by the Circuit Court, as we liave no jurisdiction of the cause, and upon that point no argument has been heard.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A2N\">(Decided July 17th, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\n<em>Writ of error quashed,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
