E. , F. M. and G-. C., to approve and draw within the city of Baltimore, for their exclusive benefit, within and during three years, commencing on the first of December., 1850, such.lawful schemes in the .Maryland Consolidated Lotteries as might be presented by the contractors to the Commissioners, and also to issue and deliver to the contractors annually, during that time, a certain number of licenses for the sale <em>of </em>lottery tickets in Baltimore, and also a number of other licenses for the sale of sueh tickets in the State of Maryland, outside of said city. &lt;x. C., died., and the survivors on the 27th of July, 1850, assigned to J. .P. the benefit of one-half of tire contract of .the 18th of July, 1849. A bill was filed by J. P. setting out the facts, inlying solely upon the conitract of July 18th, 1849, praying for an account of -the .salas .of tickets in said lotteries, and that he might be paid one-half of the avails of said sales after equitable deductions. R. F. and F. M., in their answer, after Alleging the violation and forfeiture of the first contract en the part of J. P., charge that he was, notwithstanding, paid in full all tliat he might have claimed in virtue thereof, and further allege that the contract of .July 18th, 1849, was suspended by a new and different contract made by the Commissioner of Lotteries under the Constitution of 1851, with R. F. , and that the new contract took effect April 1st, 1852; and that they were in. no way indebted to said J. P. After general replication and testimony taken, it was agreed between the parties that the sales of schemes and tickets in said lotteries were forbidden ly the statutes of the several States of the United States outside of Maryland. The covenant on the part of R. F, and F. M. was to pay to J.

That the Court below erred in refusing to enlarge the order of reference as to allow a full statement of the accounts between the parties on the complainants\u2019 petition, notwithstanding the previous opinion of July 13th, 185T. An order or reference with instructions to state an account, with a view to a final decree, is not conclusive upon the Court, and may be reviewed by the Court pronouncing it without a, bill of review; and on further proof or more mature consideration at any time before final decree, the Court may reverse its opinion, may reject the account made in conformity to it, and may refuse all relief; and the fact that a party has, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Act of Assembly, a right of appeal from such an order as partaking of the quality of finality, does not impose upon him the obligation to resort to the remedy of appeal. The statutory remedy by appeal from an order, saving the quality of finality, does not militate against the general power and authority of the Court, while the cause is in <em>fieri, </em>to-review and correct any previous erroneous opinion, when no change of property has been effected under its interlocutory order.

Comity rests on voluntary consent and is inadmissible when contrary to the known policy or injurious to the interests of the State where it is urged, and it is only in the silence of any positive rule affirming or denying the operation of the foreign law, that courts of justice presume the tacit adoption of them by their own government unless they are repugnant to its poliey or injurious to its interests.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">A foreign law is never allowed any force when either the State or its citizens may suffer loss or inconvenience from it, and this applies to questions of morals, to <em>mala in se, </em>as well as to <em>mala prohibita. </em>2 <em>Kent, </em>406, 407 457, 458, <em>note </em>b.\u2014 <em>Davis vs. Jaquin, </em>5 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>100. <em>Wilson vs. Carson, </em>12 <em>Md.

But, by the laws of all States, even those which forbid the sale of lottery tickets, the complainant would, upon the case made by the bill, be entitled to an account and decree for his proportion of the profits made by the sale of lottery tickets under the partnership dealings, because the contract or duty here raised is collateral to the illegal contracts, if such there were, and is not tainted by it. The illegality of the sales and dealings were disposed of when the appellees received the money from the sales; the plaintiff is now only seeking his share of the realized profits, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>for money paid to his use, and received by the appellees for his benefit,. <em>Balt. &amp; Susq.

That the partnership funds and capital were extended to dealings outside of the State of Maryland, and whether embraced within the terms of the original contract or not, all profits thence derived are to be accounted for; even the illegal purpose of a partnership dealing will not defeat the right.

The bill sets up no title except under the contract of 1849 and the profits therefrom resulting, and its prayer for relief is limited to that contract. It appears in the evidence that the contract of 1849 was surrendered under the provisions of the Act of 1852, ch. 113. No amendment of his bill to shew that fact was made by the appellant, nor did he make any amendment to shew the further fact alleged in the answer but not established by the proof, that a new contract was made upon the surrender of the old one. Under the bill? therefore, as it stands, the appellant is confined to the contract of 1849 and to the operations under it from the 1st December, 1850, when it took effect, up to the 27th of March,, 1852, when it ceased to have any existence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Had an amended bill been filed charging that the defendants, (now appellees,) liad, at the time of the surrender of the original contract, entered into a new one, and claiming the benefit of such new contract, the question would have arisen, whether he wras entitled to participate in it. But no such question can arise on the bill as it stands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-5\">2. The lottery contract, in which the appellant claims an interest as assignee, Was a contract by which the monopoly of lotteries was conceded by the State of Maryland within its territorial jurisdiction, and the State neither granted nor had the right to grant the privilege of selling tickets in any other State. The bill is limited accordingly to transactions and sales made under and by virtue of the contract, and its prayer covers no sales except those made within the State of Maryland. The appellees have excepted to all evidence, oral and written, of sales out of the State. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-6\">3. Whatever may be the character of the pleadings, and the extent to be attributed to them, there can be no relief in regard to sales of lottery tickets made out of the State of Maryland. These sales are conceded to have been made in violation of the laws of the States where made. 1 <em>Story Eq.

The auditor has reported, that upon the legitimate business there was a loss. The appellant\u2019s exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, so far as they are not covered by the preceding points, present questions of fact merely as to the state of the accounts, and the assumed action of the auditor in regard to them, and this Court has not the materials for a judgment as to the correctness of his conclusions, nor, if it had, could it do more than assert the principles upon which the account is taken.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Bowie, C.

An \u2018account 'being thus stated and returned, (after exceptions thereto by 'the complain ant,) was by decree of the Court finally ratified, \u00a1and the complainants bill dismissed, from which decree, this \u2022appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">From this synopsis of the 'cause, it is apparent the main \u25a0points are found in the force and effect of dhe contract, and \u25a0the allegations and prayer ef the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Neither the one nor the other of these seems'to contemplate \u00a1a dealing in lottery tickets rbeyend the limits of the State Independently of all questions arising from the comity of \u2022Courts or States, or the eoaHict of laws of the several States, tlie letter of the contract limits its operations to tlie State.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The first covenant of exhibit A, oa the part of the commissioners, is to deliver to the parties &lt;\u00a9f the second part, etc.) <em>\u201c </em>eight annual licenses in each of said years for .the sale rof lottery tickets in khc ci ty of Baltimore, * * and for the further sum of--, thirteen other licenses each year for the \u00a1sale of said tickets in the State of Maryland, out -of the city \u25a0of Baltimore,'\u201d * * <em>* </em>\u2022* to authorize the said parties of tlie \u25a0second part, etc., \u201c to sell, either in the city \u00ab&amp;f Baltimore or \u25a0out of it, in the'State Mlaryland, as the ease may be, tickets &lt;or parts of tickets, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"AVW\">There is no clause or word on the part of the eommission&gt;ers enlarging the -area &lt;\u00a9f sede.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">The covenants on the part of the respondents must be \u2022construed with regard to those of the parties of the first part, and by presumption -of law would be limited to the \u00a1same subject matter. The second covenant on the part of the respondents is, that they will pay to the parties of the first part five per cent. \u201c on the amount of tickets at scheme prices, sold hy them or their agents in the Maryland Consolidated Lotteries,\u201d and they undertake that the sum shall amount during eaeh ef three years, to tlie sum -of $25,000, \u25a0exclusive of expenses, and to pay the difference between such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>sum, and the said per eentage, at the end of each of said years; that a correct account of such sales shall be furnished, <em>\u201c </em>sustained by such proof as the parties oi the second part require from their distant agents,\u201d etc.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A4t\">(Decided June 28th, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">It was argued that as the last cited covenant secured the State five per cent, upon tho amount of sales, and the respondents had guarantied it should amount to a certain minimum, it was the interest of the State, and therefore the intent of the contract, that the sales should ho made wherever they could he. This deduction is hardly consonant with the rules of law, which require all parts of tiro contract to harmonize, if possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">A clear and manifest intent, is not ho disregarded to obtain some pecuniary advantage, by a construction opposed to that intent, nor can it be presumed that the legislation and policy of other States was unknown to the State of Maryland, and that she sought to enrich herself at the expense of her neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Tbe complainant having made the contract a part of h;s bill, and interpreted it as we have, as far as ho professed to set forth its terms, the relief prayed is based upon the same theory, and expressly limited to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">It was very properly said by the 'Judge below, that there had been no change in tho hill since it was originally filed, no application to amend in conformity with facts disclosed by the answer or the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">If these furnished grounds for relief, the case as made by tho bill did not, and it is only on tbe hypothesis, that tho contract relied contemplated sales out of the State, that tho appellants, could complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Our opinion is, that such a position is untenable, and without deeming it necessary to examine the other points mooted, wo will affirm the decree below, dismissing the bill, with costs to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\"><em>Decree </em>&lt;ijjmned.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
