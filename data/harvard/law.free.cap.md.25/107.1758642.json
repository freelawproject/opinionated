Now then,were the authorities diligent in acting where they supposed their aid necessary?. If must be remembered that they were-continually harrassed by applications of all hinds, that false rumors were current upon the streets and elsewhere, that it was almost impossible to discover their truth, or to know at which point their assistance was most needed, they were therefore to keep a constant look-out, to ascertain the correctness of the reports, and to govern themselves and the force under their control, as in their judgment the circumstances required, so that \u2019protection to all might be \u2022secured,, and the city properly kept in order. Bor tins purpose a call, was made by the Board of Police upon General Stewart for five hundred men, these with four hundred of the regular-police, were all the force the board thought they would require. They found they had entire control of the city. It was impossible for men to do moro; they made calls to suit their exigencies, and found them sufficient. Tins tiie defendants, think conclusive up io <em>1 </em>his time of Bio diligence of the-police board, and the city judiunli\u2019c;! generally, in adapting; themselves to the circumstances, and in their preparations to* defend and protect their cithern frem out-break ox: riot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Now if tins notice was received by the police force at all, was it a notice of an actual riot? or of such, a riot as would brake it appear that the store of the defendants was in danger of an attack ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-5\">The notice itself has every appearance of a production dictated by fear and apprehension, and was such a notice as would embarrass the police force if attended to, and at the expense of taking them away from the scene of immediate trouble, whore their services were absolutely necessary. So the commissioners regarded it and the result proved that their views were correct, \u00e1s no riot nor any manifestation of a riot occurred at the store of the plaintiffs\u2019 on that day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">This, then, is the notice relied upon by the plaintiff's, and the only written one produced by them. The day of the 19th closed, and with it the vestiges of riot;' it is true the excitement was still high, but that identical day, and that identical riot, were numbered with the past, and Poultney and Trimble\u2019s store was untouched j no manifestation upon thorn had occurred, and as far as they were concerned, eycry thing was quiet. \"With the coming in of a new day, they were to be upon their guard, and if it brought new dangers, it was their duty to notify the authorities, if they were threatened, in time to prevent such injury or destruction j and the city to be responsible only, when, after notice duly given, it shall appear that they did not use all reasonable diligence and the powers intrusted to them, for the prevention or suppression of such riotous or unlawful assemblage. (Code, Art. 82.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-7\">The notice must have its date, and base its origin from the time on Sunday morning that the manifestations at the store of the plaintiffs commenced; everything in fact that happened anterior to that time is past, and has no more to do with the subject in question, than if it liad occurred in the year before.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The defendants hold that not only the notice in time must be proven, but the hick of dliiger.ee on the part of the commissioners, that the assemblage was of such a character that without the aid of the police they would have broken into their store, to damage and destroy and carry away; that they were boisterous, in large numbers; that the plaintiffs gave them no goods of their own free will; and that the police, after their arrival, were unable to protect them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-5\">All of these facts must be shown in order to entitle the plaintiffs to recover; a failure to prove them defeats their action, and upon the testimony as to these circumstances, the defendants have founded the substance of their prayers, and they respectfully insist that they were entitled to corresponding instructions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-6\">Art. 82 of the Code of Public General Laws, see. 2, declares: that \u201cno such liability shall be incurred by any count}, incorporated town or city, unless the authorities-thereof shall have had good reason to believe that such riot or tumuli,nous assemblage was about to take place, or having' taken place, shall Lave liad notice of the same in time to prevent said Injury or destruction either by its own police or with the aid of the citizens of such county, town or city, it being the intention of tiffs Article that no such liability shall devolve on such county, town or city, unless the authorities having notice have also the ability of themselves, or with flioir own citizens, to prevent said injury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">And'again, by sec. 8: \u201cIn no case shall indemnity be received when it shall be satisfactorily proved that the civil authorities and citizens of said county, town or city, when called on by the civil authorities thereof, have used all reasonable diligence, and all the powers intrusted to them,, for the prevention or suppression of such riotous or unlawful assemblages.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-8\">The appellants5 counsel then read and commented fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>upon tbe testimony in the cause, and argued therefrom that\u2019 the city authorities were able by themselves, and with tlio* force they could command to quell the disturbance, and used all due diligence at the plaintiffs5 store, and after their arrival there did effectually protect the establishment from all further demonstrations; that the testimony shows that' Trimble, himself, distributed guns to tbe crowd; that none were distributed after the arrival of the police, but tliat many were then returned,</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-5\">Tbe evidence that due diligence was used on the part of the polic.e is very conclusive. Marshal Gifford was alone at the police office when tho intelligence of the crowd at the-plaintiffs\u2019 store arrived; he started immediately and intercepted a squad of police and toolc them at once to the store in question. Marshal Kane stood upon the stops of the-police office, when the witness Barton approached with his-complaint of the same tenor. He asked Barton if the plaintiffs were giving away their arms? and upon Barton\u2019s exp\u00eda-nation of this, ho said he would send the police, and in a few minutes they were at tbe store. Tbe witness, Klorbacher, started after tho police, and in ten minutes found them communicated bis message, and returned with them. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-6\">Was not this reasonable diligence? Was there ever a police force more diligent? The evidence cited is takers from two of tbe witnesses of tbe plaintiffs, and one of the defendants, and they all agree in tbe fact that there was no delay. Tbe police were on tbe watch and moving to and fro in. all parts of tbe city; in any and every direction they, were-to-be met, looking out for, and protecting the citizens, quelling disorders and preventing disturbances; in each of-the cases above cited, tbe police were brought to tbe scene-immediately; it was effected by three different persons with-three different officers all tending to the same result. Nor' have tbe plaintiffs attempted to show in any way, or by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>witness, that reason aide diligence, after dno notice given, was not exercised by ilie police of the city, but on the contrary the tendency of the evidence which they produced was to the canse effect, that every diligence was used, and all possible dispatch.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-5\">There is but one oilier point upon which the defendants rely in sustaining their prayers, and that is: Did the police force after their arrival succeed in protecting the store ? The \u25a0evidence upon this point jg as plain and straightforward as upon any ox the others. Marshal Gilford says, that \u201c lie took the guns from those in the crowd then present, who had received them, and handed them back into the store; the crowd )nade no resistance but yielded them back quietly.\u201d The witness. Parten, says: \u201cin a few inmutes the police wore at ilie store and protected it effectually from the time of their arrival.\u201d The witness, Klerbaelier, says: \u201c that there were no goods handed out after the police arrived; the police took possession of the store and guarded it for ten days or two weeks from that timeas in the -others, this point is proven by three respectable witnesses, and the plaintiffs have not even sought to prove to the contrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-6\">The defendants, therefore, respectfully insist that they have proven their case clearly, so far as to entitle them to the instructions asked for; that the notice to the Mayor, dated April 19th, did net dispense with the necessity of a notice on the 21st; that the remedy of the plaintiffs is under Art. 82 of the Cede of Public General Laws; that according to Art. 82, they have complied with its requirements in using -all diligence after notice given to them of the existence of the crowd at the store of the plaintiffs, and that after their arrival they protected it effectually.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-7\">They, therefore, respectfully ask that the decision of the Court below be reversed,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Wm. Schley </em>for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-5\">TJpon examination of the instructions of the Court, it will be seen that every point embodied in the several prayers set out in the appellant\u2019s argument, is fully covered by the instructions of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-6\">The facts were properly loft to the jury. In the appellants\u2019 argument, questions of <em>fact </em>are discussed, as if this Court was to decido on the testimony. To whom did it properly appertain to decide whether the authorities of the city had \u201c good reason to believe \u201d that a riot was about to take place ? To whom did it belong to decide whether the civil authorities, when called on, had or had not used all reasonable diligence and all the powers intrusted to them for the prevention of said riot ? There was evidence that there was great excitement in the city \u2014 that blood liad boon shed in Pratt street \u2014 that the plaintiffs had in their store arms and ammunition ; and it was further proved, that no attention was paid to the call of the plaintiffs for protection, nor any inquiries or directions made or given as to the grounds of their apprehension. There was also evidence that Marshal Kane, when called on by Mr. Barton, had knowledge that arms were being obtained from the store of the plaintiffs ; and,-upon his unwarranted conclusion that they were giving their arms away, ho had not ordered any of the police to visit the plaintiffs\u2019 store. Why was this? It cannot be denied that he might, so soon as he know that arms were being obtained, have sent a party of men \u2014 policemen, citizens or soldiers \u2014 to protect the property. The jury, upon the whole evidence, might well have formed the conclusion that in the state of feeling then in the city, it was a reasonable apprehension on the part of the plaintiffs, that their \u25a0store, being a depot of arms, would be attacked for tho sake of the arms there ; and that, in the exercise of reasonable diligence and precaution, a sufficient force of men should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>been sent early on Sunday morning, if not before, (for tlie excitement ivas on the increase) to guard the property. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-3\">Whether the conduct of the plaintiffs was judicious or not in endeavoring to appease the crowd was for the consideration of the jury, upon the whole evidence, in allowing damages. It did not go to the plaintiffs\u2019 right of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-4\">Whether the assemblage was riotous or not, was not to be decided by the Court. It was for the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-5\">Every point presented in the appellants\u2019 argument, seems to look to the effect of the testimony as to its probative force, and not to present any sound objection to the ruling of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-6\">Parties may have' their remedy at common law, although there may he a remedy by statute. <em>Scholl vs. Nor.

That being performed, the finding of the facts, and the application of the instruction to them, was for the jury as in all other cases.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Aqf\">(Decided June 20th, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">As the instruction of his Honor below is full and meets with the entire approbation of this Court, we deem it unnecessary to enlarge.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmedL</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
