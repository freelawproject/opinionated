The proof was admissible whether the witness knew of his own knowledge or not, any thing of the delivery over of the' check in question; the transfer of all the business of the day carried with it, either full knowledge of everything relating to the business of the day, or put them upon enquiry; and the accepting the transfer of Lee <em>&amp; </em>Go\u2019s business on that day, obliged the appellees to do, with regard to the business of that day, everything that Lee &amp; Co. should have done; this check, that day received, instead of sending to its lawful owner, they wilfully and fraudulently appropriated, with what the law imputes as full knowledge, and the evidence of said Gover was directly to establish this point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-5\"><em>Thomas 8.

The appellee, Ileald, was a special partner in the firm of Spurrier, Honeywell <em>&amp; </em>Evans. But it was claimed on the part of the plaintiff, that a limited co-partnership, for the purpose of banking, was not legalized by the Code, Art. 72, and that by the general rule of law, Iieald was responsible, as general partner, for all the debts of the partnership. To meet this pretension the defendants proved, that at the time of the commencement of business relations between the two films, the firm of Josiah Lee <em>&amp; </em>Co., (through whom the plaintiff was obliged to claim,) had notice of the terms of agreement of co-partnership of Spurrier, Honeywell &amp; Evans. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>This evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, but the objection was overruled, and the evidence was given to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-5\">And at a later stage of the cause, the Court, by rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s prayer and granting the first prayer on the part of the defendants, virtually instructed the jury that at the time of dealing between the two firms, Josiah <em>Leo &amp; </em>Co. had notice of the terms of agreement under which the firm of Spurrier, Honeywell &amp; Evans was carrying on business, and that neither the former firm, riot any person claiming through that firm,-could charge Heald With any greater responsibility' than he had assumed by said agreement* <em>Story on Agency, secs. </em>140, 451. <em>Weiser vs. Dennison, </em>10 <em>N. </em>Y. <em>Rep., </em>77. <em>Story on Contracts, sees. </em>203, 206. <em>Gow. on Part., </em>4. <em>Story on Partnership, secs. </em>128, 74 &amp; 18, 19. <em>Collyer on Partnership, secs. </em>98, 387, 388, 389. <em>Winship and others vs. The Bank of the U.

In response to the second instruction given, the jury 'have found that the' cheek remitted by the Merchants aiul Traders Bank to1 Josiah Lee &amp; Co'., was- endorsed and paid over by the said fern to the defendants, and that said\u2019 payment -was accepted by the defendants is good faith, in du'ecourse\u2019 of business, and without any notice of the pretended right or claim of the plaintiff' to said cheek.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s- prayer (which was rejected) insisted,-that if the notes offered in evidence Were specially endorsed by the plaintiff to- Josiah Lee &amp; Co., and that said firm received from its correspondent in New Jersey, on account and in-part of the proceeds of said notes, the check in question, and that said check was paid over to the defendants-,- and that the defendants received the money therefor, then the plaintiff was entitled to the verdict, although the said payment-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>over was on account \u00a9f an indebtedness- of the said Josiah!

It will- be apparent that the objection- taken by tlm defendants to the testimony of Gerard- Go ver, as disclosed by the third bill of exceptions, was taken to the statement \u25a0by the witness \u201c that on the 31st of October, 1860, all thb mailed letters of the firm of Josiah Lee &amp; Co. and the business of the firm- of that day were handed- over to the defend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ants.\u201d This, we say, will be apparent,, as- well from the' structure of the entire exception as from the statement in the first exception that the plaintiff proved Ut the trial,- \u201cthat Josiah Lee &amp; Co. had failed on the previous day, and were utterly insolvent, and had never resumed business.\u201d After' this proof had been admitted,, without objection, if is not to be imagined that the defendants would have objected to' the statement by this' witness, that the firm of Josiah Lee &amp; Cov \u201cfailed and closed its banking house on the 30th \u00a9f October,-1860,\u201d and if the objection had been made* it is yet less credible that the plaintiff would have acquiesced in the objection. But the objection being made and the' witness having, further stated that he could Mot speak of the delivery of the' check in question, as of a fact Within his own knowledge, the objection was renewed and acquiesced in and the witness was withdrawn, and, as a necessary consequence, the statements were excluded.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-5\">At a later stage of the trial, that is, after the examination of the witnesses had been closed, and the prayers had been-submitted, in the course of the argument thereon* the' counsel for the plaintiff stated* that he would,- in his argument before the jury, rely on the above statement of the witness as proof that the said check had iiot been passed over\u2019 \u201cin due course of business.\u201d The counsel for the defendants-insisted, that the said statement was not in evidence in the cause. He stated, further, that at the time of the examination of said witness, the defendants had in Court witnesses by \u25a0whom they would have explained aiiy unfavorable inferences'whieh could have been drawn from the statement of the witness, and If their objection had been overruled they would: have examined said Witnesses to that point. And said counsel further offered to permit said testimony to go to the' jury, provided said rebutting testimony was also permitted to go to the jury. But the Court rejected the tender so mad\u00a9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>by the defendant\u2019s counsel, declaring'that the said statement, so made by the witnesses, was inadmissible as evidence and was to be treated as out of the case, to which declaration and opinion of the Court, and its refusal to permit the said statement to be used as- evidence before the jury, the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-5\">The exception was, therefore, taken to the refusal of the Court to permit the plaintiff to use', as evidence, the statement of a witness which was-objected to when made, and had been withdrawn in consequence of such objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARs\">The plaintiff did not ask leave to re-examine the witness, Upon the ground of misapprehension as to the effect of the withdrawal of the witness in the face of the objection. Nor did he accept the offer of the defendants to withdraw the' oto jection, on condition that their rebutting evidence should be admitted. The pretension was, that the statement was properly in evidence and might be used as such, and the Court decided, simply, that it Was not in, and could not be used as evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-9\">It is submitted'?</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-10\">1st. That this decision is not subject to revision or appeaL</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-11\">2d. That' it was properly made. By acquiescing in the objection made by the defendants, the plaintiff avoided a decision thereon by the Court, and his withdrawal of his witness Under the' circumstances, ought tobe attended with the sam\u00e9 consequences as if the evidence had been formally excluded?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-12\">3d. But if the exception had been taken to the' formal exclusion- of the statement as inadmissible evidence, it could not be sustained. It was not shown that the check was paid to the defendants at or after the time when' it is alleged the mail matter of th\u00e9 d ay was handed over to them. And if the payment of'the check and delivery over of the mail matter had been contemporaneous, the defendants would have had no notice' of the pretended right of the plaintiff to' the<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>eheek, nor of any fact which, would have put them upon inquiry. The letter enclosing tho check stated that the remittance was made for balance in the hands of the remitters, belonging to Josiah Lee &amp; Co. And it was not shown that the defendants had any notice of dealings between the plaintiff and Josiah Lee &amp; Co. Unless, therefore, it can be maintained that the delivery by a failing house of its mail matter for the day to a favored creditor, obliges the latter to take notice of and enquire into the state of accounts between that house and all its customers, and deprives a creditor of the house of his right to accept payment out of <em>funds'prlma\u00a1facie </em>belonging to and in the actual possession of <em>the </em>house, the evidence tendered must be deemed inadmissible.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b581-5\">Goldsboeough, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Agy\">delivered the opinion of this Court\u2014 Babtol and Cochean, J., dissenting;</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The appellant instituted suit in the Superior Court of Baltimore city, to recover from the appellees the sum of $3,438.-85 alleged to be the proceeds of certain promissory notes sent to Josiah Lee &amp; Co., specially endorsed \u201cfor collection.\u2019 These notes were payable in Jersey city, New Jersey, and were transmitted by Lee <em>&amp; </em>Co., to J. S. Fox, - Cashier, and endorsed \u201cfor collection.\u201d They were collected by Fox, as Cashier of the Mechanics and Traders Bank of J ersey city, who, after deducting from the amount collected a balance due by Lee <em>&amp; </em>Co. to said Bank, remitted the residue by check on the Continental Bank of New York. This residue is the amount claimed by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">This check was remitted to Josiah Lee <em>&amp; </em>Co., made payable to their order, dated the 29th of October, 1860, and received on the 31st of the same month. Lee &amp; Co. endorsed it in blank and sent it, on the last named day, to the appellees, who applied it in part payment of a <em>debt </em>due by Lee <em>&amp; </em>Co, to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Lee <em>&amp; </em>Co. failed on the 30th of October, the day before \u2022they sent the check to the appellees, and on an investigation of their affairs they were found to be utterly insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">At the trial, the plaintiff proved that the defendants, as bankers, were partners under articles of co-partnership by which they were associated for the purpose of conducting \u201ca 'banking, bank note, .exchange, bill broking and stock business.\u201d It also appeared that William Heald, one of the alleged partners, had contributed $80,000 as special partner., .and that he had stated his intention not to draw his share of profits, but to suffer them to accumulate for the benefit of Spurrier, one of the defendants, his son-in-law, and Spurrier\u2019s children, who were his, He.ald\u2019s, grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In the progress of the trial, three exceptions were taken by the appellant to the ruling of the Court. The first relates to the .objection to evidence .offered by the appellees that Lee Co. had notice of the terms of agreement for special partnership between the appellees, the appellant insisting that such proof would not affect it; the Court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The second exception was taken by the appellant to the ruling of the Court rejecting its prayer .and granting the two prayers of the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The third exception was taken because the Court declared the evidence of Gerard Go ver, offered by the appellant, inadmissible, and that it was to be treated as out of the case. The .circumstances attending this exception will be noticed in treating of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">In disposing of the questions presented by these exceptions we shall reverse the order of them, and first consider the third exception. This exception was not, in fact, taken until the prayers of the respective parties had been submitted. No exception was taken to the opinion of the Court when first announced; the appellant, therefore, must be presumed to have waived its objection. The ruling of the Court was fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>justified under such circumstances. See <em>Davis vs. Patton, </em>19 <em>Md. Rep. </em>120, and the eases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The second exception involves the ruling of the Court in granting the appellees\u2019 second prayer. It is important, in this connection, to recur to the appellant\u2019s cause of action. The suit was brought to recover from the appellees the amount received by them on a check of the Mechanics and Traders Bank of New Jersey, on the Continental Bank of New York, payable to the order of Josiah Lee <em>&amp; </em>Co., by them endorsed in blank, and given to the appellees in part payment of an antecedent debt due by Lee &amp; Co. to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">This check was, therefore, a negotiable instrument; and though given in part payment of such a debt, if it was received in good faith and without any notice of the right or claim of the appellant to the proceeds of the check, we think the appellees were entitled to the benefit of the payment. The appellant cannot complain of the prayer as granted. It submitted to the j'ury to find the facts deemed essential by the Court to the appellees\u2019 defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The general principle of commercial law, that a <em>iona fide </em>holder of a negotiable instrument for a valuable consideration, without notice, will be protected against the antecedent .equities of the original parties, is fully sustained by numerous authorities, and they uphold the doctrine, also, that the holder will be protected when the instrument is applied in payment of an antecedent debt, regarding such antecedent .debt as a valuable consideration. In <em>Swift vs. </em>Tyson, 16 <em>Peters S. C. Rep., </em>1, the Supreme Court declared : <em>\u201c We </em>are prepared to say, that receiving it in payment of, or as security for, a pre-existing debt, is according to the known usual course of trade and business; and why, upon principle, should not a pre-existing debt be deemed a valuable consideration ?\u201d Again the Court say: <em>\u201c </em>The question has been several times ihefore this Court, and it has uniformly been held, that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>makes no difference -whatsoever as to the rights of the holders, whether the debt, for which the negotiable instrument is transferred to him, is a pre-existing debt, or is contracted at the time of transfer\u2019. In each case he equally gives credit to the instrument.\u201d In quoting with approbation these extracts, we adopt the law there announced, so far only as it is applicable to the facts of this case. We are not to be understood as expressing any opinion upon the right of a holder of a negotiable instrument received by him \u201c as <em>seewrity </em>for a pre-existing debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The case of <em>Swift and Tyson </em>was elaborately argued, and the authorities, both in England and in this country, carefully collated and reviewed in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In the case of <em>Goodman vs. Symonds, </em>20 <em>How. S. C. Rep., </em>343, decided in 1857, the case of <em>Swift and Tyson </em>is recognized in the following emphatic language: '\u201c A well defined and correct exposition of the rights of a <em>tona fide </em>holder of a negotiable instrument was given by this Court in <em>Swift vs. </em>Tyson, (16 <em>Peters, </em>1,) as long ago as 1842, and we accept that exposition relative to the point under consideration, on the present occasion, as one accurately defining the nature and character of the title to those instruments which such holder acquires when they are transferred to him for valuable consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In <em>Goodman vs. Harvey, 4 Adol. &amp; Ellis, </em>870, Lord Denmar said: \u201c Where the bill of exchange has passed to the plaintiff without any proof of <em>tad fa/vth </em>in him, there is no ,objection to his title.\u201d We have only to reverse the parties to make this decision applicable to the case at bar. See <em>Ch. on Bills, 12th Ed., </em>257.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The Superior Court having properly granted the appellees\u2019 second prayer, ruled correctly in refusing to grant the prayer of the appellant. And a majority of this Court having sanctioned the ruling of the Court in granting the appellees\u2019 second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>prayer, it is unnecessary to pass upon the question of notice contained in the first exception, or the question of partnership embraced in the appellees\u2019 first prayer.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AZiB\">(Decided July 19th, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
