They then proved by Martin, that he knew Mc-Cann, one of the defendants, and that witness, in company With Caldwell, one of the plaintiffs, met McCann on the 25th of March, 1861, on the street, when Caldwell asked him, '(Mc-Cann,) why he had not paid the plaintiffs\u2019 claim ; to which- ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>McCann answered, he had not collected sufficient assets; witness then asked the plaintiff why he did not cite the defendant before the Orphans\u2019Court; the defendant said hehad been cited before the Court, and that the plaintiff would haVe got his claim long before, if he had not done so ; that the claim was per^ fectly good; that he got six months from the Court, an'd could get six months more.

The prayer is also wrong, inasmuch as it assumes that the acknowledgment testified to by the witness, Martin, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>not only sufficient to remove the bar of the statute, but also to establish the existence of the debt without any proof thereof <em>aliwnde. </em>See same authorities as above, and also <em>Wood vs. </em>Howell, 5 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>60. <em>Miller vs. </em>Dorsey, 9 <em>Md.

Under the plea of <em>plene achminist/ravit, </em>the <em>onus </em>of proving assets is .on the plaintiff, and he must produce the \u00a1record of the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court. A mere \u00bfcopy of an account passed on the 27th of August, 1861, and ydiich purports on its face to be the <em>first </em>and not the <em>final </em>account, without any other evidence, is not sufficient proof of assets in a suit commenced in June, 1863. The prayer was therefore erroneous in assuming there was sufficient proof in \u2022the case from which the jury could find assets ip the hands pf the defendants. <em>Seighman vs. Marshall, </em>17 <em>Md.

It is clear that the promise of one of two or more joint administrators will remove the bar of the Statute of Limitations, and especially will it so operate if the promise is made before the statute applies, 7 <em>Gill, </em>102. 2 <em>Smith\u2019s Leads </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>Ca., </em>387, 388, <em>(5th Ed.) 4 Cow., </em>494, 495. 2 <em>Monroe, </em>131. 4 <em>Id., </em>37, 38. 5 <em>J.

It is submitted, that the principles enunciated by these .\u25a0authorities, if traced to their legal conclusion, will be efficient -to establish the original demand. When a claim is barred by limitations, the bar may be removed by a new promise within three years before the institution of suit. When the statute operates upon a claim, it is presumed, in legal contemplation, to be extinguished ; if it is a joint demand, the joint liability is severed, destroyed. A new promise,however, \u201creanimates \u25a0the old promise, and imparts vitality to the remedy.\u201d In the case of a single bill, for instance, over twelve years standing, the bar may be removed by a new promise, or by any recognition of the existence of \u00a3he claim, and the law would raise the <em>assumpsit; </em>but, in that case, the action would be brought on the new promise, and the single bill would be used merely as an inducement to the action. The new promise does, in effect, therefore, establish the original demand. The same extent of power, the same measure of authority, it is thought, is requisite in both cases. Andit isfurther submitted, that co-administrators, acting separately, have greater powers than one of two or more joint contractors, one co-administrator represents the whole estate, and can, it is conceded, do many things conclusively binding on the estate he thus represents; whereas, joint contractors must all concur. Co-administrators, like joint tenants, are\u2019possessed <em>\u201cper my eipertoutP</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-7\">3. There can be no reasonable doubt that the admission of an.a;Jminisiraio? is evidence sufficient, not only to remove the bar of the Statute of Limitations, but to establish the original demand. <em>1 H. &amp; J., </em>109. 4 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>529, 530. 21 <em>Pick., </em>243, 245.

Having shown the effect of the declarations of a sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>administrator on the estate of his intestate, let us see what difference, if any there is, when there are two or more administrators. Joint or \u201c co-executors are regarded in law as an individual person, and by consequence, the acts of any of them, in respect to the administration of the effects, are deemed the acts of all, for they have a joint and entire authority over the whole property.\u201d \u201c Hence, a release of a debt by one of several executors is valid, and shall bind the rest.\u201d 2 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>226. (And the same law applies to co-administrators. 2 <em>Wms. on Executors, </em>854.) 6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>210. 1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>190, 191 and 195, and 10 <em>Md.

He was then authorized to speak, not only for himself, but as her recognized agent, and as well as by virtue of his <em>\u201c </em>entire authority over the whole property.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-9\">5. But suppose what is above stated does not receive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>approbation of the Court, still the declarations of McCann are evidence and entitle the appellees to an affirmance as to him. 1 <em>GreenLeaf Ev., secs. </em>171, 172, 174. 1 <em>Ch.

The administration account offered in evidence was Competent and proper to show assets in the hands of the administrators; it was the first and only account passed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, and was at least <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the appellants had the sum of $2,951.90 in their hands due the est\u00e1te of the deceased. No suitor is bound to show mor\u00e9 than a <em>prima, facie </em>case till his opponent exhibits countervailing evidence. 4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>173. <em>Gould on Pl., ch. </em>3, <em>sec. </em>193. See also, 2 <em>GreenLeaf Ev., sec. </em>347. Furthermore, McCann, in the conversation in the presence of the witness, Martin, admitted there wer\u00bf sufficient assets to piiy and satisfy the claim. Here the appellees close the argument of the case as presented by the record, and respectfully ask that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">Now, although the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was in favor of the appellees, which prevented their appealing,yet, as it is possible, this Court may reverse the judgment of the Court below, it is thought best to bring to the notice Of the Court the evidence offered by the appellees of the handwriting, original entries, and subsequent death of the book-keeper and salesmen, referred to in the record. I think I am justified in asking this under the decision in <em>Long &amp; Byrn vs. Crawford, </em>18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>226. The evidence offered ought to have been submitted to the jury, leaving it to them to say whether the Entries therein referred to were <em>\u201c </em>original entries,\u201d in' the proper handwriting of the book-keeper, and whether the bookkeeper subsequently died. It was a question of fact, legitimate and proper, lor the consideration of the jury. And it as further insisted, that by presumption of law, the entries were original in the absence of all evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-7\">Should the Court, therefore, determine to reverse the kdg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ment, it is hoped it will also pass upon the appellees\u2019 first, second and third exceptions, as it may prevent a second appeal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b594-5\">Bartol, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4E\">delivered the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">This case turns mainly upon the decision of the question raised by the appellants\u2019 second exception, as to the admissibility of the evidence of the witness, Martin, whereby it was sought to charge the defendants by proof of the acknowledgment of McCann made to the plaintiffs. The same question-is also presented by the Court\u2019s instruction to the'jury conv tained in the appellants\u2019 third exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The suit is against the appellants as administrators of James-H. Nussear, deceased, to recover a sum of money alleged to-be due to the appellees, from their intestate in Mb life time,Limitations were pleaded, and the evidence was offered for the two-fold object of establishing the' existence of the debt,- and of removing the bar of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The Court below admitted the evidence and instructed the jury: \u201cIf they find from the'evidence that the defendants,Daniel McCann and Susan Nussear, have been duly appointed administrators of the estate of James-H, Nussear, deceased ;- that the plaintiffs exhibited an account against the estate of the deceased amounting to the sum of \u00a7374.43, which was-duly passed by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Baltimore'city,- an'd that one of the plaintiffs-, on the 25th of March, 1861,-had the conversation with DanielMcCann, one of thndefendan-ts,-detailed by the witness, Martin, and if the jury shall further find-from the evidence, that the defendants-are'in possession of assets, to be administered, sufficient in hand,-that then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">It appears from the proof that the appellees qualified as administrators on the 14th of November, 1859. On the 29th of November, 1859, an account was passed by the' Orphans\u2019 Court,, of the appellees again-st Jamos H. Nussear,- deceased,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>for $37-4.43, and a memorandum or record thereof was made by the Register, under Code, Art. 93, sec 114, in a boolc kept for the purpose. It is plain, from the certificate of the Register, that the 29th of November, 1859, was the date when the account was passed by the Orphans\u2019 Court. What the date of the account was when due, or what were the items composing it, does not appear; it was not produced at the trial. The registry of the claim was evidence of notice of the same to the administrators, and as such the certificate was properly admitted. <em>Seighman vs. </em>Marshall, <em>Adm'r, </em>17 <em>Md. Rep., </em>569. But it was not evidence to establish the claim as against the appellants in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">There was proof given of a promissory note signed by James H. Nussear, the defendants\u2019 intestate, dated January 29th, 1859, for $176.75, in favor o\u00ed the appellees; but there was no evidence that this note formed any part of the account and claim exhibited to, and passed by, the Orphans\u2019 Court, or that the administrators had any notice thereof. In the conversation between the appellee, Caldwell, and McCann, testified to by the witness, Martin, no allusion was made to the note. That conversation must, therefore, be understood as relating only to the account, that being the only claim exhibited to the Orphans\u2019 Court, or of which the defendants appear to have had notice. The note was clearly barred by limitations, and there being no evidence of any promise or acknowledgment with regard to it, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover thereon; and we do not understand the instruction of the Court below as comprehending the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We now proceed to consider the question presented, so far as relates to the account. The evidence of the entries in the plaintiffs\u2019 books having been rejected, there was no proof in the cause to establish the account, except the declarations of McCann, testified to by Martin. We are correct, therefore, in saying that those declarations were offered for the double 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>purpose of establishing the claim, and of taking it out of the operation of the Statute of Limitations. Are they competent evidence for that purpose?</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In <em>Forbes vs. Perrie's Admr., 1 H. &amp; J., </em>109, which was a suit against a sole administrator, it was held by the General Court that a count against an administrator as such, was supported by evidence of his promise to pay a debt of the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In <em>Chapman vs. Dixon's Admx., </em>4 <em>H &amp; J., </em>527, and <em>Quinn vs. Carroll's Admrs. d. b. n., </em>10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>197, it was decided that a promise or acknowledgment by a sole executor or administrator, will take a case out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">But the question whether, if there are two or more administrators, the promise of one will take the case out of the statute, seems not to have been decided in Maryland. In <em>Kent's Adm'r vs. Wilkinson, </em>5 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>498, 499, the question is stated in the opinion of the Court, but not decided. And in <em>Quynn vs. Carroll, </em>10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>197, though the question was elaborately argued at the bar, the Court expressed no opinion upon it, (see page 209.) When we look outside of the State, there is considerable conflict of authority. In <em>Tullock vs. Dunn, </em>1 <em>Ry. &amp; M., </em>416, (21 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>478,) it was ruled by Abbott, C. J., that an express promise by one executor would not take a case out of the statute as against the others, and this decision was followed in <em>Scholey vs. Walton, </em>12 <em>Mees and Wels., </em>509, in a note on page 514: several American cases are referred to, and many more are cited in the argument of the appellee in <em>Quynn vs. Carroll, </em>10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>205, 206. Unquestionably, the current of decisions in this country is in accordance with the ruling in <em>Tullock vs. Dunn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">In <em>Hammon vs. Huntley, </em>4 <em>Cowen, </em>494, the contrary is asserted; but in the <em>Cayuga Bank vs. Bennett, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>236, before the same Court, the expression of Woodworth, J. in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Hammon vs. Huntley, </em>4 <em>Cowen, </em>is called <em>\u201cobiter </em>see, also, <em>McIntire vs. Morris' </em>Admrs <em>Wend., </em>90; <em>Lane vs. Doty, </em>4 <em>Barbour, </em>535; <em>Peck vs. Botsford, </em>7 <em>Conn., </em>172, and <em>Pitts </em>vs. Wooters\u2019 <em>Exrs., </em>24 <em>Ala., </em>474, where this question is considered. The cases in all the States are, however, not in harmony. The contrary was held in <em>Emerson vs. Thompson, </em>16 <em>Mass., </em>429, and in <em>Hords\u2019 Adm\u2019rs vs. Lee &amp; others, </em>4 <em>Monroe, (Ken.,) </em>36.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We concur in what was said by Judge Cowen, in 5 <em>Hill, </em>240, \u201c that the reasoning of Judge Mills, in the case cited from 4 <em>Monroe, </em>seems to raise a serious doubt whether denying the force of personal representatives, or any one of severa], to admit or to act in respect to any matter which concerns the estate, be not equivalent to saying that they are mere naked agents. They are clearly a good deal more. It has often been held that they are trustees with more than the ordinary powers incident to that character, for one may sell or convert the whole estate without the consent of the others.\u201d See <em>Bell vs. Hilliary, </em>1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>186, &amp;c., <em>Mitchell vs. Williamson, </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>210, and <em>Gardener &amp; Bowling vs. Hardy &amp; Simms, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>365, where the powers of executors and administrators are considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Although there is much conflict of authority on the point, and it must be conceded, that the current of decisions both in England and in this country is the other way, we perceive no good reason why a promise or acknowledgment by one executor or administrator, where there are several, should not operate to remove the bar of the Statute of Limitations, especially when made before the statute has operated upon the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">But we are clearly of opinion that this can only apply where the claim is established by proof <em>aliunde, </em>and that such promise or acknowledgment cannot be relied on for the purpose of establishing the existence of the debt as against the other administrators.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AEm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>(Decided July 19th, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The law seems to us to be correctly stated in 2 <em>Smith's Lead. Cases, </em>(5th <em>Ed.) </em>388, note, where it is said: \u201c Executors have joint authority and power touching debts due by the testator, and if you prove <em>aliunde, </em>that the claim sued upon was a debt of the testator, you lay a ground for admitting the acknowledgment of one to be evidence against the other; thus, if you prove that it was a debt due by the testator, an acknowledgment by one would take the case out of the Statute of Limitations against both, and against all. <em>Johnson vs. Beardslee, </em>15 <em>Johns., </em>3. But for the purpose of proving the fact whence the joint interest and power arise, viz : for proving that it was a debt due by the testator, the confession of one is not evidence in a suit against both. <em>Hammon vs. Huntley, </em>4 <em>Cowen, </em>493.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">This must be understood, however, with reference to what has been before said, as to whether the acknowledgment has been made before or after the statute has operated. In the latter case it would seem a promise or acknowledgment of one of several co- administrators would not bind the others. See <em>Ellicott vs. Nichols, 7 Gill, </em>102.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In this case, the declarations of McCann, being offered for the purpose of establishing the existence of the debt, were inadmissible, and for that reason there was error in the Court\u2019s instruction. The judgment will therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\"We are of opinion that the Court below ruled correctly in excluding the evidence of entries in the plaintiffs\u2019 book, contained in the first and second exceptions of the plaintiffs, for the reason that it did not appear from the evidence that the same was a book of original entries; there is, therefore, no ground for a <em>procedendo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
