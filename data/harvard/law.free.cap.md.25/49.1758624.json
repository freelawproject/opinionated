ScMllinger then offered evidence to maintain his plea, of <em>set offy </em>and proved that he had purchased, during the month of June, 1860, various articles of household furniture for Kratt, amounting to about $300 in valuethat ho, (ScMllinger*) had paid for them with his own proper money, and that they were delivered to and received and' used by Kratt; \u2014 - Kratt then proved that he had married Schillinger\u2019s stepdaughter in June, I860, but that ScMllinger was opposed to-the match,, and, also, that he was opposed to Ms wife\u2019s giving' anything to her daughter at her marriage, and, also, that when the promissory note offered in evidence was presented to ScMllinger for payment, he got angry, and denied that there was any indebtedness from him to Kratt, because he-had purchased and paid for the property hereinbefore spoken of as being delivered to, and received and used by, Kratt. Mrs. Kratt died in August, 1861, shortly after the note wa&amp; presented to ScMllinger for payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">The evidence as detailed in the foregoing statement, having been given to the jury, the plaintiff offered the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">1st. That if the jury shall find from the evidence that the defendant made and delivered the note offered in evidence in this case, dated March 5th A. D.'1860, payable one year after date, and that the said promissory note is still unpaid* then the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">2d. That there is no sufficient evidence in the case of anj payment on account, of said note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">And the defendant offered the following prayer;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Til's defendant in this ease is entitled to <em>set off </em>against tlie plaintiff\u2019s claim any amount which the jury may believe from \u00a1lie evidence is due and owing from the plaintiff to the defendant and in making up their verdict the jury may \u2022credit the defendant with whatever amount they may find due to the defendant from the plaintiff, and if they find that a sum equal to the whole amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is \u2022due by tlie plaintiff to tlie defendant, then their verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">The Court below (Kino, J\u2019.,) granted the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers, and rejected the prayer of the defendant, to which ruling of the Court the defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b61-6\">The cause was argued before Bowie, O. J., and Golds-borough, Cochran and Weisel, <em>J.</em></judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-7\"><em>JBenj. P. </em>Ilorwits, for the appellant, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\">1st. That there was abundant evidence from which the jury might have found that there was an indebtedness from the defendant to the plaintiff, which could properly set off against the demand &lt;of the plaintiff, and conseqently that there was error in the Court\u2019s taking the entire case from the jury, and ordering them to find for the plaintiff, <em>nolens </em>&lt;nolens, ignoring entirely the defendant\u2019s jilea of <em>set off, </em>and all the evidence offered to sustain it, and looking only to the payment of the note. There is abundant evidence that Schil linger purchased and paid for goods which lie delivered to Kratt, who received, used and kept them, and for which goods, there is in. law an implied promise on the part of Kratt to pay. Where one man receives the property or accepts the services of another, tlie law presumes a promise to pay; in other words, there is anjimplied <em>asmimjasit, </em>which may bo repelled by legal evidence, and which was attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>in this case, by the plaintiff\u2019s endeavor to show that the property was intended to be given to him or his wife, but these facts, it is submitted, were questions for the jury, and were improperly taken from them by the Court\u2019s instruction, which in fact, blotted orrt the entire evidence. <em>Ogden vs. Saunders, </em>12 <em>Wheaton, </em>341. 1 <em>Blackstonds Commentaries, </em>159, 162, 163. <em>Chiity on Contracts, </em>18. 1 <em>Story on Con</em>tracts, <em>Sec. </em>12. <em>Abbott vs. Herman, </em>7 <em>Greenleaf, </em>(Maine,) 118. <em>Stockett vs. Watkins, </em>2 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>326.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-5\">2nd. Even if it bo assumed that the evidence offered and received from the defendant, was legally insufficient to establish the issue joined on the replication to the plea of <em>set off, </em>or that there was evidence to establish a material fact involved in maintaining that plea, then the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s prayers was erroneous, as they did not point out specifically the defects or omissions in the proof, as required by the Act of 1825, ch. 117, re-enacted in 1st Code, Article 5, section 12. A general prayer that there is no evidence, (such as the plaintiff\u2019s prayers were,) is only proper where there are no facts offered in support of a case, or where the testimony offered has been rejected as incompetent. <em>Hatton vs. McClish, </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>407. <em>Tyson vs. Shucey, </em>5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>540.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-6\">The following eases show the critical strictness which this Court applies to see that a prayer shall by no implication of a fact, or even of the necessary conseqenee of a fact, exclude from the jury the ascertainment of all facts, and even the operation and result of facts. <em>Charleston Ins. Co. vs. Corner, </em>2 <em>Gill, </em>410. <em>Bullitt vs. Musgrave, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>31. <em>Brown vs. Ellicott, </em>2 <em>Md. Rep., </em>75. <em>Boyd vs. McCann, </em>10 <em>Md.

The appellant\u2019s prayer, it is submitted, contained the true law of the case, and should have been Granted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>Wm. J3. </em>Hillj for tlic appellee, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">That the defendant\u2019s plea of <em>sel off </em>was not sustained by any evidence in the case. The Court below was right in rejecting the defendant\u2019s and granting the plaintiff\u2019s prayer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">To constitute <em>set off </em>there must be a subsisting debt due by the plaintiff to the defendant. But there is nothing in the evidence to show that Kratt ever became indebted to Scliillinger on any account whatever. It is not anywhere shown that he promised, either expressly or by implication, to pay the defendant anything. It does not appear, from the evidence, that Kratt was present at the time of Sliillinger\u2019s purchases; that they were made at his request, or that he had any knowledge of them whatever, until he found them at the house occupied by himself and wife after the marriage. On the contrary, all the evidence tends very clearly to show that Scliillinger bought them as part of the marriage portion of his daughter, and gave them to her in contemplation of her marriage. 2 <em>Espinassee Rep., </em>594, 514. 7 <em>T. &amp; R. Rep., </em>348. 4 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>233, 3 <em>Md. Chan. Dec., </em>65. 4 <em>Md. Chan. Dec., </em>3, 333.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">2. The law presumes a gift to be intended where a father sends chattel property to the future home of his daughter about to be given in marriage. <em>Cole vs. Varner, </em>3 <em>Alabama R., </em>244. <em>Olds vs. Powell, </em>7 <em>Alabama R., </em>652. Morris\u2019 <em>Admr. </em>vs. <em>Dawney, </em>3 <em>Hen. &amp; Mun,., </em>127. <em>Farrel vs. Perry, Haywood Rep., </em>2. <em>Carter\u2019s Fx\u2019ors vs. Rutland, Haywood Rep., </em>112. <em>Parker vs. Phillips, Haywood Rep., </em>519. <em>Owen vs. Tandersly, </em>12 <em>Texas, </em>405, <em>Bell vs. Strother, 3 McCord, </em>207. <em>Brasshears vs. Blassingame, </em>1 <em>Nott &amp; McCord, </em>223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-8\">In this case the intention of the defendant is obviously to make a gift, or marriage portion, to his daughter. That intention was executed by an unqualified delivery of possession of the chattel property purchased for her, and it was not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>bis power, at any time afterwards, to retract it. 2 <em>Blacks Com., </em>441. He cannot, in March, 1861, transmute into a debt his voluntary gift of June, 1860. But even upon the hypothesis that this were possible, it would not then be the debt of this plaintiff, and hence, could not be pleaded in <em>set \u25a0off. </em>Such an indebtedness would lack all those qualities which are indispensably requisite before it could be set off against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The debt must be mutual. It must be in the same right. It must be of such a nature that he can sue for it and recover it at law. 1 <em>Robinson's Practice, </em>369, 381. <em>Parsons on Contracts, </em>243. <em>Darnall vs. Hill, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>388. 8 <em>Gill, </em>93. 18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>85.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b64-5\">Goldsborough, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJR\">delivered the opinion of this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\"><em>~We </em>think the instructions contained in the bill of exceptions were improperly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">They are founded altogether upon the admission of the execution and non-payment of the note declared on, and do not refer in any way to the evidence offered under the plea of <em>set off, </em>and the effect of granting them was to withdraw this evidence from the consideration of the jury. This, in our opinion, was error. The evidence in question should have been submitted to the jury under instructions sufficiently comprehensive to cover the case actually made by the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The presumption of law growing out of the relationship of the parties was, that the articles furnished by the appellant were a gift to the wife of the appellee, and the Court, if it had been called on to do so, might have so instructed the jury. But it was not authorized to find the facts shown by this evidence, although its legal conclusions upon them might have been substantially correct had they been found by the jury according to the evidence. Some of the testimony tended to support the plea of <em>set off, </em>but other portions of it, if believed by the jury, may have been sufficient in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>judgment, supported by tbe presumption of law, to establish a state of case which would defeat that defence. The prayer offered by the appellant was too general to meet this view of the evidence, and for that reason was properly rejected.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AikW\">(Decided June 1st, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed, <em>a/nd procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
