Jf. </em>Lanwhan, for the appellant, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-9\">That the plaintiff below was not entitled to recover, and the Court of Common Pleas should have granted the appellant\u2019s prayer because the appellee failed to deposit his money and valuables wfith him or his agent for safe-keeping, agreeably to section 5 of Article 70 of the Code of Public General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Laws. That' the case of <em>Pettigrew vs. </em>Barnum, 11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>434, was considered as inflicting great injustice upon landlords, and the Act of 1854, chap. 323, now embodied in the \u00a9ode, was passed to* remedy this evil.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-5\"><em>WilUaMti \u00c1. Stewart, </em>for the appellee argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-6\">1'. That'prior to the passage of the Act of 1854, chap. 323, an inn-keeper was responsible for all losses happening to the goods of\u2019 his' gU'ests, such as moii'ey, baggage, jewelry and persona! orriaments, appropriate for a traveller\u2019s wardrobe, while they remained within the inn, unless such losses were occasioned by some agency over which human power could exercise no control, or by the act of public exlemies, or by the conduct of the guest himself or his servant, or some companion whom he chose to take into his room With him.\u2014 <em>Owings vs. </em>Wyant, 3 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>393. <em>Towson vs. Havrede-Grace Bank, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>47. <em>White vs. Wagner, </em>4 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>391. <em>Pettigrew vs. Barnum, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>434.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-7\">2. The Act of 1854, chap- 323, merged in secs. 5 and 6 of Article 70 of the Code, shifted this responsibility from the landlord, in the case of money, jewelry and plate, on certain conditions: 1. That he shall provide an iron safe or other secure depository for the keeping of such articles belonging to his guests; and, 2. That he shall cause written or printed notices to be put up in his chambers and other conspicuous places about his house, notifying his guests of the purport of the law, and requesting them to deposit their money and plate with him or his agent, to be designated by such notice. It is necessary that the landlord should prove that he has complied with both of the above requisites in order to exempt him from responsibility. <em>Code, Art. </em>70, <em>see. </em>6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-8\">3. The notice in evidence is not such a compliance with the Code, either in letter or spirit, as will place the landlord* under its protection; the law,.being in derogation of the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Common Law, its provisions should be strictly complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-5\">4. The Court properly rejected the defendant\u2019s prayers because neither the watch, watch-guard -nor pocket-book, came within the description of money, plate or jewelry, and, therefore, it would have been error, even admitting the defendant\u2019s construction of the law for the sake of argument to be correct, to say that the plaintiff could not recover the value of those articles. The Court is entitled, absolutely, to reject a prayer, if at all erroneous. <em>Webster\u2019s Dictionary, Art. Jewelry. McCormick vs. Hudson River R. R. Co., </em>4 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>182. <em>Doyle vs. Coms. of Baltimore County, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>484. <em>Code, Art. </em>93, <em>sec. </em>207. <em>Pope vs. Hall, </em>14 <em>Lou. An.

The law as stated in the plaintiff\u2019s prayer was correct, and properly granted. The provision in the Code is an imperfect copy of the New York statute-of 1855, chap. 421, and the interpretation of that statute by the Courts of New York, although not conclusive upon Courts outside of that State, is, nevertheless, a safe guide to be followed in construing the same language. The word \u201cmoney,\u201d in the Code, is designed to cover large sums carried by travellers in packages or otherwise, and not loose change or small sums necessary for the ordinary travelling expenses of the guest. The plaintiff is entitled to recover such reasonable amount as the-jury in their discretion may deem just and proper. <em>Van Wyck vs. Howard, </em>12 <em>Howard\u2019s Pr.

Rep., </em>434, and upon the principles there enunciated, it is very clear that the appellant became liable for the loss complained of, if not protected by the 5th and 6th sections of Art. <em>70 </em>of the Code. These sections provide a mode by which an inn-keeper, under the circumstances therein mentioned, may protect himself from liability to his guest for losses of money, plate and jewelry, but not for other kinds of property. The evidence here shows that the articles stolen from the room of the appellee, while a guest of the appellant, were a watch, watch-guard, pocketbook, and ninety dollars in money; and looking to the purpose and terms of these provisions of the Code, it is manifest that a compliance with them could not relieve the \u2022appellant from liability for the loss thus shown. All of these articles, with the exception of the money, were of a class not within the statutory provisions referred to, and the appellant could not, even by complying with their requirements, exempt himself from liability for their loss. The prayer offered on his behalf asserts a proposition altogether inconsistent with this limitation of his statutory privilege, and was properly rejected for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The ease appears to have been submitted to the jury under an instruction wholly free from objection. Assuming that the appellant was entitled to <em>the </em>protection afforded by a compliance with the requirements of sections .5 and 6 of Art. 70, the only objection that could be made to the instruction is, that it. left the question, as to the appellant\u2019s liability for the stolen money, to the jury. This objection, however, cannot be maintained upon a true construction of these provisions of the Code. As we understand them, they do not require the guest of an inn,, to protect himself from loss, to place money, necessary for his personal expenses as ;a traveller, in the personal custody of the inn-keeper. He anight guard against losses by theft or pillage, by taking that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>course, but these' provisions cannot be said to contemplate protection to the guest or inn-keeper through or by means of such a personal inconvenience to the guest. They evidently relate to money not necessary for personal use, and such as can be deposited with the inn-keeper without personal inconvenience to the guest. This question was considered in the case of <em>Gile vs. Libby, 36 Barb., </em>70, where it arose upon the construction of a similar statute, and the conclusion reached, sustained the views here presented.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A9v4\">(Decided June 28th, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The question, whether the sum of money lost was reasonable and necessary for the appellee\u2019s travelling expenses, was clearly one for the jury; and if the sum lost was reasonable and necessary for such expenses, the instruction granted by the Court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
