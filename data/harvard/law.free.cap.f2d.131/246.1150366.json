Upon debtor\u2019s, death, appellants succeeded to his rights, and they assail the plan of reorganization which allowed nothing to them as the owners of the equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The sole and only question involves the analysis and appraisal of the evidence to ascertain whether the findings of the referee and of the court, to the effect that the aggregate of the claims against the debtor exceeded the value of the estate, are supported by the evidence. On this issue, there were two hearings, the court having concluded, upon request of appellants, to rere-fer the issue to the referee who heard additional evidence offered by appellants, as well as by the trustee, and found against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">We are convinced that the evidence amply supports the finding of the referee and justifies the court in overruling the exceptions of appellants, thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Appellants rely largely, if not entirely, upon the testimony of one Loeber, who gave his opinion, on the original hearing, before the referee, as well as on the rehearing. Upon the latter hearing he raised his estimate of value from $137,000 to $174,000, and based it largely upon expected increase in rentals. At this same hearing the court appointed an independent appraiser who gave it as his opinion that the property was worth $128,500. The first mortgage and tax liabilities against the property were approximately $174,000. There was a second mortgage securing notes in the sum of $22,-500. In addition, there was the expense of the administration of this estate. To debt- or\u2019s credit, there was $12,000 in cash on hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">It would seem that the referee\u2019s observation that even if he should accept Loeber\u2019s present value \u201cthat the market value has increased more than $36,000 within the last year * * the amount due on taxes and first mortgage bonds equals or exceeds that value\u201d is a proper, and in fact necessary, conclusion. However, the referee did not accept the increased value given by Loeber, but placed the value somewhere between that amount and the $128,500 figure which was the independent appraiser\u2019s estimate. His finding that \u201cthe value <em>of </em>the property in question <em>is much less </em>than the amount due for taxes and the first mortgage bonds,\u201d is well supported by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">From the foregoing it follows that appellants have no interest in the debtor\u2019s property.
