Int. Rev.Acts, page 798), under which, for each year ending June 30, there is \u201cimposed upon every domestic corporation with respect to carrying on or doing business for any part of such year an excise tax of $1 for each $1,000 of the adjudged declared value of its capita] stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-22\">Appellee, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York, which had been in the business of building and repairing ships, filed a petition for reorganization under \u00a7 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207, on July 23, 1934; on the same date, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (which it later made \u201cpermanent\u201d) approving the petition as filed, and continuing appellee, as debtor, in possession of its property and estate. On September 29, 1936, appellee filed a return, under the Capital Stock Tax Act, for the year July 1, 1935, to June 30, 1936, and on the same date paid to the collector the capital stock taxes shown in that return. A plan of reorganization was subsequently effected in the reorganization proceedings, and, in 1937, a final decree was entered discharging appellee from its debts and liabilities and terminating the proceedings. In 1938, appellee filed a claim for refund of the taxes paid, on the ground that it had not carried on any business during the taxable year which made it subject to the tax. The claim having been rejected, appellee brought this suit for refund.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From a judgment for appellee, appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-23\">In United States v. Whitridge, 231 U.S. 144, 34 S.Ct. 24, 58 L.Ed. 159, the court held that, where equity receivers were appointed for certain corporations, and the receivers carried on the business, there was not collectible a special corporate excise tax, then in force, imposed \u201cwith respect to the carrying on or doing business by\u201d corporations. The court said that the receivers, in managing and operating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>business, acted \u201cas officers of the court and subject to the orders of the court; not as officers of the respective corporations, nor with the advantages that inhere in corporate organization as such. The possession and control of the receivers constituted, on the contrary, an ouster of corporate management 'and control, with the accompanying advantages and privileges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">No doubt because of that decision, there were issued, under the statute here before us, Treasury Regulations 64, Article 35, reading: \u201c * * * If during any entire year ending June 30th, all of the property of a corporation is in the hands of such public official (i.e., a receiver, or a trustee in bankruptcy, or is in the custody of a federal or state officer pending the appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy), the corporation is not subject to the tax for such year * * *.\u201d However, Article 42 of the same Regulations provides: \u201cDoing Business \u2014 The term \u2018business\u2019 is very comprehensive and embraces whatever occupies the time, attention, or labor of men for profit. Accordingly, regardless of the nature of its activities, any corporation organized for profit and carrying out the purpose of its organization is doing business within the meaning of the Act. Similarly, even if not organized for profit, any corporation which nevertheless engages in activities ordinarily carried on for profit is also doing business. It is immaterial whether the activities result in a profit or a loss, whether the corporation has been successful in-its enterprise, or that because of unfavorable business conditions, no operations are carried on for a particular period. No particular amount of business need be done, nor is it necessary that the business be continuous throughout the taxable year. The case is exceptional in which the activities of a corporation organized for profit do not amount to doing business within the meaning of the Act. Such a case is generally limited to one in which the corporation is not pursuing the ends for which organized, i.e., profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Appellee contends that there is no distinction between a debtor continued in possession under \u00a7 77B' and an equity receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy, and that, accordingly, under the doctrine of the Whitridge case, no tax was due from it. In support of its contention, appellee cites and quotes from In re Walker, 2 Cir., 93 F.2d 281, 283, where it was said that the purpose of the provision continuing a debtor in possession \u201cis certainly that the debtor shall be in fact a trustee,\u201d and In re Martin Custom Made Tires Corp., 2 Cir. 108 F.2d 172, 173, where it was said: \u201cThe attempted distinction between the powers of a debtor in possession and the rights of a trustee in bankruptcy is unreal. A debtor in possession holds its powers in trust for the benefit of the creditors.\u201d We cannot agree that those cases are in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">It would be time-saving if we had a descriptive catalogue of recurrent types of fallacies encountered in arguments addressed to the courts, giving each of them a number, so that, in a particular case, we could say, \u201cThis is an instance of Fallacy No. \u2014 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such a device would be helpful here. For the fallacy of the appellee\u2019s argument is of a familiar kind: In formulating the reasons for their decisions, judges often adopt rulings made in previous decisions in which the facts were somewhat similar, saying, in effect, \u201cThis situation is sufficiently like those which we previously considered so that we can disregard the differences and restrict ourselves to the resemblances.\u201d And, thus ignoring \u2014 for the purpose immediately at hand \u2014 the unlikenesses, the situations are, frequently, spoken of as identical. But elliptical discussions of cases partly alike, as if there were complete identity, is merely for convenience. There is present, although it may- be unexpressed, an \u201cas if,\u201d a \u201clet\u2019s pretend\u201d \u2014 a simile or metaphor. Such \u201cas-if\u201d or metaphorical thinking is invaluable in all provinces of thought (not excepting that of science). However, some of the greatest errors in thinking have arisen from the mechanical, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>unrcflective, application, of old formulations \u2014 forgetful of a tacit \u201cas if\u201d- \u2014 to new situations which are sufficiently discrepant from the old so that the emphasis on the likenesses is misleading and the neglect of the differences leads to unfortunate or foolish consequences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In governmental or business administration, such neglect, when it occurs, provokes justifiable irritation at \u201cbureaucracy\u201d;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in judicial administration it deserves criticism as unenlightened precedent-mongering.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">A debtor company in possession in not a receiver or trustee. It is, as we said, in Re Wil-Low Cafeterias, Inc., 2 Cir., Ill F.2d 83, 85, \u201canalogous to\u201d a trustee, i.e., it is, for some purposes, to be treated as if it were a trustee. For the corporation debtor is still carrying on or doing business, although the manner in which it can operate is restricted by trustee obligations imposed by the Bankruptcy Act. Indeed it was, in part, out of a desire to preserve a continuity of management and the complete loss of the advantages and privileges which accompany such a continuation that section 77B departed (unwisely according to many critics) from all previous provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and deviated markedly from well-settled equity receivership practice, in allowing the debtor, although plainly not a disinterested person, to remain in possession and continue operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Appellee argues that there was no provision contained in its articles of incorporation giving it authprity to do business as a corporate trustee. That fact surely does not help appellee\u2019s argument. For it shows that appellee could not, lawfully, have served as a trustee in bankruptcy for any other person. It follows, then, that it had not ceased to engage in its regular business of shipbuilding and repairing ships and, instead, taken on the business of acting as a trustee in bankruptcy (for itself), since it had no authority to do so under the laws of the state of its incorporation. The plain truth is that it was still doing its business, but subject to limitations, under the Bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ruptcy Act, restricting the purposes for which, and the manner in which, it could conduct that business.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ah7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-24\"> The suit was begun against the Collector. He subsequently died, and his executrix was duly substituted as defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> Schopenhauer, in The Art of Controversy, sketched a catalogue of - familiar fallacies and \u201cstrategems\u201d used in all sorts of arguments. I-Ie remarks that it \u201cwould be a very good thing\u201d if every strategem \u201ccould receive' some short and obviously appropriate name.\u201d He refers to Aristotle\u2019s descriptions of some of the \u201cstrategems.\u201d The older books on logic would be useful to one who undertook to compile such a book; for a recent helpful discussion, see Oohen and Nagel, Logic and Scientific Method (1934), especially 376-390.

Burke, Permanence and Change (1936); Hammond-Knowlton v. United States, 2 Cir., 121 E.2d 192, 199.

Common sense, he showed, revolts when the application of an analogy or fiction \u201cis pushed far enough to become noticeable,\u201d for a \u201cfiction is not a satisfactory reason for changing men\u2019s rights or liabilities.\u201d Holmes, Agendy (1891) reprinted in Holmes\u2019 Collected Legal Papers (1921) 49 et seq. Cf. Hammond-Knowlton v. United States, supra, 321 E.2d at page 200, note 22; The Eugene F. Moran, 212 U.S. 466, 474, 29 g.Ct. 339, 53 L.Ed. 600. See the discussion in the Supreme Court opinions \u2014 cited and quoted in Perkins v. Endicott Johnson Corp., 2 Cir., 128 E.2d 208, 217 note 29 \u2014 of the \u201cgradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">There is thus a need to revise a fictional major premise, expressed as a legal rule, in the light of the consequences revealed by logic, when the minor or fact premise departs too far from the facts with reference to which the major promise was originally formulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">Modern semantieists have done much to expose that need. However, some of them have done so with insufficient acknowledgment that they were not the discoverers of the treacherous nature of words and of their tendency to tyrannize thinking; that discovery goes hack at least to Plato and Aristotle; see Ogden &amp; Richards, The Meaning of Meaning (4th Ed. 1938) 31-38; nor were the scholastics always as unaware of these word-dangers as some persons (under Francis Bacon\u2019s indirect influence) suppose. Some modern semantieists, too, have an inadequate grasp of the indispensability of general statements and abstractions (indeed of the realities of the relations expressed by some abstractions) and of the inestimable utility of fictions and other metaphorical expressions \u2014 if employed consciously as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b600-16\"> If a trust company, authorized by law to act as a trustee in bankruptcy, had become trustee in bankruptcy for appel-lee, it would not h\u00e1ve been obliged to pay a capital stock tax merely as successor to appellee in the operation of appellee\u2019s business; but it would have been obliged to pay such a tax because it was doing business as a trust company, in acting as trustee in bankruptcy (and no doubt in performing other functions as such trust company).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
