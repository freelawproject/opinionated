Applicant\u2019s mark, however, is not \u201cChesterfield,\u201d but \u201cLady Chesterfield;\u201d and it seems to me that the combination precludes any other significance than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>of a name. Nor is it material that the name is not in common use, for as was observed by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in the case of In re Nisley Shoe Co., 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1211, 58 F.2d 426, 427, \u201cthe statute makes no exception in the case of uncommon or rare names.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Counsel urges that the mark is nevertheless registrable, because' it is \u201cthe name of a deceased person who achieved fame and distinction,\u201d and cites Shoemaker on Trade-Marks as authority for the proposition that names of that character are entitled to registration. Assuming, ar-guendo, the soundness of such doctrine, I am unable to apply it here in the absence of proof that the late lady in question qualifies thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">It is contended here by counsel for appellant that the mark \u201cLady Chesterfield\u201d is not merely the name of an. individual, and that it is entitled to registration for the reasons set forth in their brief as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">There is no evidence in the record that there is any individual bearing the names \u201cChesterfield\u201d or \u201cLady Chesterfield\u201d and the only evidence shows that said names do not appear for any individual in the telephone directories of Chicago and Philadelphia, two of the largest cities in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">*****</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">It [the mark \u201cLady Chesterfield\u201d] is universally recognized as having a primary distinctive, suggestive significance, to wit: 1. Elegance. 2. The name of a fanciful person or the wife of a deceased person having achieved fame and distinction for elegance.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">&gt;}; ifc sjs <em>Hi %</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The real name of the famous Lord Chesterfield was Phillip Dormer Stanhope. \u201cLord Chesterfield\u201d was merely his title and not his name, and the title of his wife was Lady Chesterfield. Stanhope died in 1773. The foregoing data are given by Burke\u2019s Peerage, the Dictionary of National Biography and other authorities, which state that Lord Chesterfield was noted for being \u201cexquisitely elegant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">No claim is made here by counsel for appellant that the mark is written or printed in a distinctive manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">The Solicitor for the Patent Office points out in his brief that the 1940 edition of \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d lists \u201ca twelfth Earl of Chesterfield, who is married\u201d (appellant\u2019s application was filed July 22, 1939), and it is contended by the Solicitor that the bearer of that title is \u201creferred to as Lord Chesterfield and his wife as Lady Chesterfield,\u201d and that the names \u201cLord Chesterfield\u201d and \u201cLady Chesterfield\u201d are intended to, and do, in fact, designate those individuals. The Solicitor also calls attention to the fact that such titles as Byron, LaFayette, Wellington, Essex, and Chesterfield are listed in such standard reference works as the Encyclopedia Britannica, and are generally accepted by the public as the names of the individuals who bore them, rather than the family names \u2014 Gordon, DuMotier, Wesley, Capal, and Stanhope, respectively. It is also contended in the brief of the Solicitor that, although the name \u201cChesterfield\u201d may have a secondary meaning, such as elegance, the name is not registrable merely for that reason, and the decision of this court in the case of In re Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 804, 86 F.2d 830, overruling our decision in the case of In re Plymouth Motor Corporation, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 838, 46 F.2d 211, so far as it held that a geographical term was registrable as a trade-mark if it had acquired a secondary meaning, was cited in support of that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">As will be observed, the Commissioner of Patents stated in his decision that the Examiner of Trade-Marks had refused registration of the involved mark on 'the ground that it is the name of an individual, not displayed in a distinctive manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">In his decision, the Examiner of TradeMarks said: \u201c * * * The ground of refusal to register is that the mark is <em>merely the name of cm individual not distinctively displayed. The basis for refusal </em>is the decision of the Assistant Commissioner in Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Inc. v. Adelphi Shirt Co., 159 Ms.D. 778 [31 U.S.P.Q. 162], wherein the mark \u2018Lord Kent\u2019 was refused registration under the 1905 Act. Therein the Assistant Commissioner said: \u2018 * * * I do not think the addition thereto of the title \u201cLord\u201d saves it from being merely the name of an individual within the meaning of the statute.\u2019 \u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">In the case of Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Inc. v. Adelphi Shirt Co., 159 Ms.D. 778, 31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>U.S.P.Q. 162, which was the basis for the holding of the Examiner of TradeMarks in the instant case, the Commissioner of Patents, in holding that the trade-mark \u201cLord Kent\u201d was confusingly similar to the trade-mark \u201cKent,\u201d stated that, in addition to the term \u201cKent\u201d being a geographical term, it was \u201cadmittedly a common surname,\u201d and that the addition of the title \u201cLord\u201d did not prevent the trade-mark \u201cLord Kent\u201d from being merely the name of an individual within the meaning of the proviso contained in section 5(b), supra. In support of such holding, the Commissioner cited the case of In re Artesian Mfg. Co., 37 App.D.C. 113, wherein it was held that the trademark \u201cDeacon Brown\u201d was not registrable under* the! Trade-Mark Ac't of February 20, 1905, because the mark was merely the name of an individual, not displayed in a distinctive manner. In so holding, the court said: \u201cWe agree with the Commissioner that 'the name \u201cBrown\u201d is a common surname, and the prefixing of the word \u201cDeacon\u201d thereto no more renders it registrable than would the prefixing of the word \u201cMr.\u201d \u201cDr.,\u201d \u201cGeneral,\u201d or the like.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The court then stated that the decision of the Commissioner was in harmony with other decisions on the subject which it cited, but which we deem unnecessary to refer to here.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">It is evident from his decision that the Examiner of Trade-Marks held that the term \u201cChesterfield\u201d was in use as a surname; that it was the dominant or distinguishing feature of appellant\u2019s mark; and that, in view of the authority cited by him, the association therewith of the term \u201cLady\u201d did not render appellant\u2019s mark registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">It appears from the record that counsel for appellant argued before the Examiner of Trade-Marks and before the Commissioner that as the telephone directories in Chicago and Philadelphia did not disclose the term \u201cChesterfield\u201d as the name of any individual residing in those cities, it was not a <em>common </em>surname, and that if it \u201chad been found in a directory,\u201d presumably by the Examiner of Trade-Marks, \u201cthat, in itself, would not establish that\u201d it \u201cwas a <em>common </em>surname as, at most, it would only establish that it was a surname for one or more persons.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">It is apparent from the record that counsel for appellant understood that the Examiner of Trade-Marks refused to register1 appellant\u2019s mark on the ground that the name \u201cChesterfield\u201d was in use as a surname and that appellant\u2019s mark was merely the name of an individual not distinctly displayed; that counsel then contended that the name \u201cChesterfield\u201d was not <em>commonly </em>used as a surname and that, unless it was commonly so used, it, in association with the term \u201cLady,\u201d was registrable under the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905. In this connection it is sufficient to say that whether the name \u201cChesterfield\u201d is commonly or only rarely used as a surname is not of vital importance as held by the Commissioner. In re Nisley Shoe Co., 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1211, 58 F.2d 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">It also appears from the record that counsel for appellant contended before the tribunals of the Patent Office that the name \u201cChesterfield has a distinct arbitrary well-understood meaning. <em>It signifies smartness and this significance is its only significance. </em>Even if there were any person with the name, however, it is manifest that the significance of <em>smartness </em>is the dominating significance and this must be clear from the fact that the name was chosen for shoes.\u201d (Italics ours.) In their brief in this court, however, counsel for appellant contend, as hereinbefore noted, that the mark \u201cLady Chesterfield\u201d is \u2014 -universally recognized as having a primary distinctive, suggestive significance, to wit: 1. Elegance. 2. The name of a fanciful person or the wife of a deceased person having achieved fame and distinction for elegance.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">The term \u201cChesterfield,\u201d as held by the tribunals of the Patent Office, is no-t only in use as a surname, but, according to such standard works as Funk &amp; Wag-nails New Standard Dictionary and the Encyclopedia Britannica, is the name of a certain style of overcoat \u201cso-called from an Earl of Chesterfield of the 19th Century [the \u2018Lord Chesterfield\u2019 referred to in the quoted excerpt from appellant\u2019s brief],\u201d is a part of the title \u201cEarl of Chesterfield,\u201d and is also a geographical term.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">We find nothing whatsoever in any standard authority to indicate that the name \u201cLady Chesterfield\u201d signifies any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>thing other than that the person bearing that title is the wife of a person bearing the name \u201cChesterfield.\u201d Nor do we find anything to indicate that the name \u201cLady Chesterfield\u201d has a primary significance of either smartness or elegance.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">As the term \u201cChesterfield\u201d is in use as a surname, it is the distinguishing feature of appellant\u2019s mark. See The American Tobacco Co. v. Wix, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 835, 838, 839, 62 F.2d 835. Accordingly, the addition of the descriptive title \u201cLady\u201d to the surname \u201cChesterfield\u201d does not render appellant\u2019s mark registrable under the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905. In re Artesian Mfg. Co., supra, and cases therein cited; Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Inc. v. Adelphi Shirt Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-32\"> This cause was originally decided by this court on the 29th day of June 1942. Thereafter, counsel for appellant filed a petition for rehearing. The rehearing was granted October 23, 1942, solely for the purpose of permitting the court to revise certain language in its original decision to which counsel for appellant directed the court\u2019s attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
