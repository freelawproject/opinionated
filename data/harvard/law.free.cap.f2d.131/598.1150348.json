From the discussion of the evidence in the opinion of the Court below, it appears that it meant to find that they did not form a partnership, and the following passages can serve as findings to that effect. The \u201cpetitioner\u2019s evidence falls far short of establishing his contentions.\u201d \u201cWe are unable to find any evidence * * * that would justify us in concluding that the relation of petitioner\u2019s wife to his business was changed in any material way.\u201d It is true that we should have been grateful for a plainer commitment upon the issue, especially in view of another statement in the discussion, \u201cThe only real purpose of the agreement was a division of income, all of which was earned by petitioner,\u201d which suggests that the purpose might be material, even though a real partnership had been formed, which would be erroneous. However, we think that it would be captious to seize upon this to throw any doubt upon the findings as a whole. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that no partnership was formed; it would indeed be difficult to come to any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-17\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
