The punishment prescribed by statute for this offense is a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than 20 years, or both. All the appellants ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>cept Giovanni Polonio were acquitted on the charge of conspiracy alleged in Count Two, and as the punishment of Giovanni Polonio on the conspiracy count runs concurrently with that on Count One no point is raised as to the conspiracy charge. The sentences varied from five to two years. The defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The defendants admit that they did the acts condemned by the statute as charged in the indictment. They contend that although the statute under which they were prosecuted by its terms applies to \u201cwhoever\u201d commits the acts denounced by the statute, the faqt that the appellants were either officers or members of the crew of the vessel excludes them from the operation of T. III, Sec. 1, when properly construed. Two\" arguments are advanced in support of this proposition. First, that at common law the owner had a right to destroy his own property. Consequently, unless the owner is more definitely prohibited by the act from such destruction the word \u201cwhoever\u201d in T. III, Sec. 1, should not be construed to include the owner. Second, that another section of the same statute, (Title II, Sec. 3, SO U.S.C.A. \u00a7 193),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specifically applies to the officers and members of the crew who cause or permit the destruction or injury of their vessel and, consequently, the general word \u201cwhoever\u201d in T. III, Sec. 1, must yield to the more specific words \u201cowner\u201d, etc., in T. II, Sec. 3. Each of these arguments has been considered and determined adversely to the appellants by the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the First, Third, Fourth and 'Fifth Circuits. In the First Circuit, Giugni v. United States, 127 F.2d 786; Third Circuit, in United States v. Scaleggeri et al., 126 F.2d 1023; Fourth Circuit, in Bersio v. United States, 124 F. 2d 310; Fifth Circuit, in M\u00e1rchese v. United States, 126 F.2d 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> We are in accord with the conclusion reached by these courts that by reason of the purpose of Congress to protect all shipping engaged in commerce with foreign nations the word \u201cwhoever\u201d contained in Sec. 1, T. III, was intended to include the owners and officers and crew of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\"> The second contention of the appellants above mentioned was disposed of , by the First and Fifth Circuits by the conclusion that Title II was not applicable at all unless and until the President, by proclamation or executive order, has declared a national emergency as provided in Sec. 1, T. II, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 191, and, consequently, in the absence of such proclamation T. Ill, Sec. 1 would apply. However, this ground does not wholly dispose of the appellants\u2019 argument which is that the express provision of the statute (T. II, Sec. 3) dealing with owners and crew shows that the Congress did not intend the word \u201cwhoever\u201d in Sec. 1, T. Ill, to apply to the owner or his agents at any time. However, the crimes denounced by the two sections are not the same although there may be cases where the two sections overlap, but this is not such a case. The crime charged in the indictment is not the crime defined in Sec. 3, T. II, namely, that of injuring or destroying the vessel, but is the crime of tampering with the navigational instrumentalities of the vessel denounced by Sec. 1, T. III. If it be said that the engines, compasses and steering engines are part of the vessel and, consequently, that the destruction or injury thereof is prohibited also by T. II, Sec. 3, we are assisted in our interpretation of these over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>lapping, provisions of the 'statute by the rule which appellants so strongly invoke, namely, that general provisions of a statute are controlled by specific provisions. Consequently, the general provision of the statute dealing with the destruction of the vessel (T. II, Sec. 3) is controlled by the specific provision of the statute punishing an injury to the motive power or navigational instrumentalities of the vessel. Therefore, tampering with the motive power or instrumentalities of navigation would come under T. III, Sec. 1, and not under T. II, Sec. 3, even if the latter were effective because of a Presidential proclamation issued in pursuance of T. II, Sec. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">All other questions raised by the appellants are satisfactorily disposed of by the above cited decisions, or are so clearly without merit as to require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The disparity in punishment under Sec. 1, T. III and under Sec. 3, T. II, may be illogical but the matter lies wholly with Congress and an attempt to harmonize the. two sections is not helpful or necessary to the construction of the two sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-12\"> \u201cTitle III.
