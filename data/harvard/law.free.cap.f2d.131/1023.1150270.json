We have carefully examined the evidence, the recital of which here would serve no useful purpose, and we are satisfied that the district court was right in holding it sufficient to support the verdict. It follows that the court committed no error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and for judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-16\">The judgment, 44 F.Supp. 636, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
