The hatchery involved was located in the city of Keokuk, Iowa, and was engaged in hatching, selling and distributing in commerce approximately 1,-000,000 baby chicks a year to farmers and poultry-raisers in Iowa, Illinois and Missouri. It was the employee\u2019s contention that the conduct of these commercial activities by an urban hatchery did not constitute \u201cthe raising of * * * poultry\u201d within the intendment of the Act, and that he could not therefore properly be classified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u201cemployed in agriculture\u201d, so as to exclude him from the benefits of the wage and hour provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The District Court rejected the interpretation which had been made by the Administrator and, in sustaining the contention of the employee, declared: \u201cI cannot convince myself that the operation of these large commercial hatcheries are enterprises engaged in raising poultry within the ordinary and common meaning of the term. To say that the commercial processing or incubating of a chicken from the egg is raising poultry gives a forced and unnatural meaning to the words employed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABO\">In the brief filed here by the Administrator as amicus curiae, he has attempted to set out, frankly and succinctly, both the considerations which appear to him to support his previous interpretation and those which support the position of the District Court. Briefly, the general considerations upon which the Administrator\u2019s interpretation is declared to rest are that the legislative history of the Act indicates that the term \u201cagriculture\u201d was used in a broad and general sense and its definition was intended to be \u201call-inclusive\u201d;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that \u201cthe raising of poultry\u201d necessarily includes the \u201cbreeding\u201d of it, and \u201chatching\u201d is <em>merely </em>part of the process of \u201cbreeding\u201d;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that hatching chicks is an integral part of agriculture, in that it is a necessary link between the production of the two important agricultural commodities, poultry and eggs; that hatching is admittedly agricultural when performed on a farm, and that the incidents of such work, when done in a commercial hatchery for the purpose of supplying farmers with baby chicks, under the now common practice of utilizing this more efficient instrumentality as a step in the agricultural processes, are so closely and directly related to the modern conduct of farming that they ought not to he regarded as having changed the fundamental aspect of the work involved, but as having merely altered the surroundings in which the work is being performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">As supporting the position of the District Court, the Administrator points out that it may reasonably be contended that the hatching of baby chicks by a commercial hatchery is an industrialized and highly specialized activity which does not itself have any direct connection with \u201cfarming operations\u201d; that the economic function of such an urban establishment is completely disassociated from the agricultural activities of producing and hatching eggs and feeding, tending and otherwise \u201craising\u201d poultry for market; that when the hatching of chicks is thus transposed from the farm to a commercial establishment it ceases to be a technical farming activity and is outside the purpose and intention of Congress in excepting agricultural employment; that the attributes of farm labor which justify its exclusion from the coverage of the Act ought not to be regarded as extending to services performed for such a commercial hatchery; and that the careful enumeration of the operations included within the agricultural <em>exception, </em>viewed in the light of the intention evidenced by the last clause of section 3(f), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(f), points to the conclusion that, while a broad conception of \u201cagriculture\u201d was intended in relation to \u201cfarming operations\u201d, a more narrow construction was intended with respect to \u201cthe raising of livestock, bees, fur-bearing animals, or poultry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">We have previously declared that an exemption to remedial legislation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \u201ccreates an exception to the general scope of the Act, and hence is subject to strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>construction.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such an exemption should be extended only to those who are \u201cplainly within its terms\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">But, in the circumstances of the present situation, there is another principle that also soundly must be taken into account. We are dealing with a situation where there has been \u201ca contemporaneous construction of a <em>statute by </em>the men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion; of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The practical interpretations which the Administrator and his staff have been required to make in applying and placing the provisions of the Act in social and industrial operation should be recognized as having peculiar persuasiveness <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and weight.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Unless such a construction is one which could not reasonably or soundly be made under the terms of the statute, it= should ordinarily be accepted by the courts. Especially is this true where its rejection will result in an economic dislocation in the industry involved, by virtue of its previous reliance upon the Administrator\u2019s interpretation, as well as a general inequity against the class to which it is to be applied, under the circumstances in which the changed construction is being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">So far as the present situation is concerned, it appears that at the time the Fair Labor Standards Act went into effect the commercial hatcheries sought to have their status defined by the Administrator. The Administrator and his legal staff immediately <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> took the position that the operations of hatcheries engaged in selling baby chicks to farmers were within the agricultural exemptions of the Act. This interpretation has been consistently adhered to and specifically repeated in hundreds of letters since sent out by the Administrator in response to inquiries from hatcheries throughout the country. The industry has manifestly proceeded in reliance upon its exemption from the Act, in its relations with employees and in its sales to farmer-customers, during the four-year period that the Act has been in effect. The employees of the industry have apparently also generally accepted the Administrator\u2019s interpretation, since the present action appears to be the only judicial challenge that has been made to the Administrator\u2019s construction during the several years that have now elapsed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>If the interpretation of the Administrator is to be rejected at this late date, it necessarily will occasion a serious economic dislocation in the hatching industry, by reason of the accumulated liability against the hundreds of commercial hatcheries in the country for unpaid compensation and \u201cdouble damages\u201d dating back to October 24, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Without attempting to resolve the construction of the statute as a matter of original impression, it is sufficient to say that, from a careful consideration of the statute and the existing situation, we have no omniscient conviction that the Administrator\u2019s contemporaneous interpretation here has been so unreasonable and unsound that it could not fairly have been made, within the spirit and language of the Act. Congress may well have intended that hatchery operations, in their now common relationship to poultry raising by farmers, should be treated as so intimately and directly connected with farming activities as to constitute one of the exempt processes of agriculture. If it did not, the way is open to it to change the situation by a more specific legislative definition. In the absence of any such action, we feel that the Administrator\u2019s initial and four-year-continued, liberal interpretation of the all-inclusive scope of the agricultural exemption should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The judgment of the District Court will accordingly be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-10\"> Act of June 25, 1938, e. 676, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.A. <em>\u00a7 </em>201, et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-12\"> \u00a7 13(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7. 213 (a) provides: \u201cThe provisions of sections 6 and 7 [206 and 207 of this title] [prescribing minimum wage rates and maximum hours for employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce] shall not apply with respect to <em>* </em>* * (6) any employee employed in agriculture; * <em>*</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-15\">\u00a7 3(f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203 (f) provides: \u201c \u2018Agriculture\u2019 includes farming in all its branches and among other things includes the cultivation and tillage of the soil,, dairying, the production, cultivation, growing, and harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities (including commodities defined as agricultural commodities in section 15(g) [12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1141j (g) ] of the Agricultural Marketing Act, as amended), the raising of livestock, bees, fur-bearing animals, or poultry, and any practices (including any forestry or lumbering operations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market- or to carriers for transportation to market.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b356-23\"> Cf.
