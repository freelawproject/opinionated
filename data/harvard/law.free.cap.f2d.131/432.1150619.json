He was right in so deciding. The Davis case was not, as this one is, a collateral attack upon a final judgment of a State Court. Had appellant in this case, as Davis did in that one, applied to the Supreme Court of the United States for and obtained a writ of certiorari to the George Court the question would have been fully open to him. Having failed to so apply and thereby permitted the Georgia judgment to become final he is precluded from now attacking it in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-27\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-28\"> Hobbs v.
