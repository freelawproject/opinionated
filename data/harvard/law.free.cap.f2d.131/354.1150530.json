We took the case to determine whether statements made by him to police officers were properly received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">In support of its case, the Government offered the testimony of four witnesses, in the following order: Dr. Richard L. Hawkins, Lionel Couture, Dr. R. M. Rosenberg, and Sergeant William J. Liver-man. The second and fourth witnesses were police officers. Lionel Couture testified, generally, concerning conditions which he found at the scene of the accident shortly after it occurred. He then testified, over objection, concerning a conversation with the accused immediately after the accident. Sergeant Liverman, the last of the four witnesses, testified concerning another later conversation with the accused. He was not a witness of conditions at the scene of the accident and, appropriately, his testimony was reserved until the last. Generally speaking the order in which evidence shall be presented to a jury is controlled by the trial judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If he receives evidence out of its logical order it may become necessary, later, for him to strike it from the record and instruct the jury to disregard it ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or perhaps to declare a mistrial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But if sufficient evidence is presented by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Government, before it closes its case, to show the relevance, materiality, or other factor of admissibility of the challenged evidence, then no prejudice results to the accused <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Both appellant and the Government rely upon the case of Forte v. United States<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to establish- their conflicting contentions concerning the disputed testimony. In the Forte case we stated the applicable rule governing the reception in evidence of extrajudicial <em>confessions. </em>In the present case appellant\u2019s statements to the officers were admissions made by appellant as exculpatory statements,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> rather than confessions. He did not in those conversations acknowledge guilt of crime,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> any more than he did in his testimony at the trial. The rules governing the reception in evidence of such admissions are much less onerous than those concerning confessions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But it is not necessary to draw the fine line of demarcation between the two, in order to decide this case, because, as we shall show, even under the requirements of the rule concerning confessions, appellant\u2019s statements were properly received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Briefly stated the rule of the Forte case is that (1) there can be no conviction of an accused person in a criminal case upon an uncorroborated extrajudicial confession; (2) such corroboration is not sufficient if it tends merely to support the confession without also embracing substantial evidence touching and tending to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>each of the main elements or constituent parts of the corpus delicti; (3) howevei\u00ed, such corroborating evidence need not, independent of the confession, establish the corpus delicti beyond a reasonable doubt; (4) if there is substantial evidence of the corpus delicti, independent of the confession, and the two, together, are convincing beyond a reasonable doubt of a defendant\u2019s guilt, that is sufficient. And the rule was clearly restated in George v. United States.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"> Applying this rule, therefore, the question is whether the corroborating evidence was sufficient in the present case. In answering this question we must consider all the evidence; not merely that presented by the Government. This results from the fact that, although appellant objected to the challenged testimony when it was first offered and, again, by his motion for a directed verdict, at the close of the Government\u2019s case, nevertheless he then proceeded to the presentation of his own case and testified in his own behalf to most of the same facts as those which appear in his statements to the officers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> His testimony thus constituted a judicial admission<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and operated as an express waiver, with the same effect as an admission made in a pleading or in a stipulation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In the present case the corpus delicti consists o\u00ed three elements, (1) the death of a human being, (2) by the instrumentality of a motor truck, (3) operated \u201cat an immoderate rate of speed or in a careless, reckless, or negligent manner, but not wilfully or wantonly * * *\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is not disputed that the first two elements were proved. In his brief appellant says: \u201cIt is submitted that to kill a person with an automobile is not a crime, and that is all that the Government proved aliunde the admissions of defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">It is with reference to the third element of the corpus delicti that the issue has been drawn; namely whether there was substantial evidence, apart from appellant\u2019s extrajudicial admissions, that the truck was being driven at an immoderate rate of speed or in a careless, reckless or negligent manner. As to this appellant concedes \u201cthat had the Government proven that the decedent was struck in the crosswalk where he had the paramount right to be, that the Government would have made out a prima facie c\u00e1se which together with the admissions would have been sufficient to overrule a motion for a directed verdict.\u201d But the bill of exceptions which was signed by the trial judge shows that appellant while testifying in his own behalf stated as follows: <em>\u201c </em>* * * that the deceased was about twenty-five or thirty feet from the defendant when defendant first saw him and was walking toward the north side of M Street <em>in the sidewalk lane on the west side of New Hampshire </em>Avenue[Italics supplied.] His entire testimony as it appears in the bill of exceptions reads as follows: \u201cThat he was operating the concrete truck east on M Street; that he was in the center lane of traffic on M Street, approaching New Hampshire Avenue, intending to go north on New Hampshire Avenue and there was a lane of traffic to his right; that an automobile on his right, traveling in the same direction, obstructed his view of the pedestrian until it turned into the gasoline station, at which time <em>it </em>was too late to stop; that the deceased was about twenty-five or thirty feet from the defendant when defendant first saw him and was walking toward the north side of M Street <em>in the sidewalk lane </em>on the west side of New Hampshire Avenue; that the deceased walked into the truck without looking for traffic from the direction the truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>was coming; that defendant had been working for the Super Concrete Company for about three and a half years and had been driving this truck or one of a similar type for that period of years; that when he struck the man, the truck had been slowed up some, but not much, by the application of the brakes; that the truck was loaded with about five tons of concrete; that the truck was equipped with mechanical booster brakes; that these brakes don\u2019t act right away, but as you apply the brakes, the booster goes into operation and then the brakes start to take hold; that the brakes on the truck had just started to take hold when he struck the man; that the man had reached a point about four or five feet from the center of M Street at the time he was struck.\u201d [Italics supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The rule of corroboration, it will be remembered, does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Neither does it require direct evidence. Circumstantial evidence may be sufficient for the purpose; as, indeed, it may be to prove that an accused is guilty as charged.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition to appellant\u2019s testimony, and apart from the admissions to which objection was made, the Government\u2019s witnesses testified to the following facts among others: (1) Dr. Hawkins responded to an ambulance call at M Street and New Hampshire Avenue, N. W., where he found a dead man lying on the street with the right side of his head mashed in and his brains strewn all-over the road; (2) Lionel Couture, a police officer arrived at the scene at approximately 7:10 A. M. on April 23, 1941, and found the body lying in the northwest corner of the intersection of New Hampshire Avenue and M Street, N. W.; the weather was cloudy, the streets were dry, it was daylight; (3) there were \u201cscuff marks\u201d on the street in the crosswalk; (4) the truck, loaded with three and a half tons of concrete was parked on the east side of New Hampshire Avenue; (5) there were no marks on the truck except that upon the front license plate, which was right in the center of the truck, \u201cthere were some clothing impressions\u201d; (6) the witness (Couture) saw appellant at the scene of the accident; (7) witness Couture tested the brakes of appellant\u2019s truck immediately after the accident and, at a speed of twenty miles per hour, the truck stopped within forty feet after the brakes were applied; (8) the horn on the truck was in good condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">It does not require further demonstration to show that much of this evidence bore directly upon the speed at which appellant drove his truck and the care or carelessness with which he was driving. The vehicle under his control was of tremendous size and weight \u2014 facts also described fully to the jury \u2014 it was potentially dangerous to pedestrians; it was being driven on a busy city street; at a rate of speed which made it impossible to stop \u2014 according to his own testimony \u2014 when he first saw the deceased, approximately twenty-five to thirty feet away; and this in spite of the fact that the traffic in the lane to his right obstructed his view and should have made him even more careful. We conclude, therefore, that there was sufficient evidence, touching the corpus delicti, and the whole of it, to satisfy the rule declared in the Forte case, and that the judgment of the trial court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-13\"> Tliiede v.
