Coen, on January 10, 1940, filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy; appellant duly became his trustee in bankruptcy. In this suit appellant sought the surrender value of a policy issued, on January 26, 1921, to the bankrupt on his life; the policy named his wife as beneficiary with the privilege reserved in, the bankrupt to change the beneficiary. On November 20, 1929, the bankrupt assigned this policy to his wife at a time when, appellant claimed, appellee was insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-30\">Were it not for \u00a7 55(a) of the New York Insurance Law, Consol.Laws, c. 28, now \u00a7 166<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 which is applicable because the1 bankrupt was a New York citizen and a resident when the policy was is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>sued and since then \u2014 Appellant, as trustee in bankruptcy, would be entitled to, such surrender value under \u00a7 70,' sub. a, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7- 110, sub. a; and this would . have been true regardless of whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when the policy was issued or assigned or when the premiums were paid thereon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the trustee\u2019s right to such surrender value, under \u00a7 70, sub. a, was-cut off by the New York statute except as to claims existing before the effective date of that statute, March 31, 1927.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here the. only claim against the estate which was then in existence amounted to $151.96. The trial court therefore correctly limited recovery to that amount.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">2. Appellant seeks additional relief-on the following grounds: During the period of the bankrupt\u2019s alleged insolvency, the bankrupt paid to his wife sums in excess of her expenditures for household expenses; that excess is at least equal to amounts paid by her during the period of alleged insolvency for a house and for premiums on the insurance policy; the wife, during that alleged insolvency period, had no independent sources of income equal to that excess; accordingly, says appellant, he is entitled to at least a part of the value of the house and also \u2014 assuming he is not entitled to the surrender value under \u00a7 70, sub. a \u2014 to a part of so much of that surrender value as equals the amount of premiums paid during the alleged insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">This relief was properly denied. For appellant has failed to show that, just before the period of the alleged insolvency, the wife did not have funds at least equal to the amount thus expended for the house and for the insurance premiums; appellant has, therefore, failed to show that the funds received by her from the bankrupt during the period of the alleged insolvency were thus expended in fraud of creditors. As this is a sufficient ground for denying relief, we need not consider the question as to when the bankrupt became insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-17\"> \u00a7 166 reads in part as follows: \u201cIf any policy of insurance has been or shall be effected by any person on his own life in favor of a third person beneficiary * * * or otherwise, to a third person, \u25a0such third person beneficiary, assignee or payee shall be entitled to the proceeds and avails of such policy as against the creditors, personal representatives, trustees in bankruptcy and receivers in state and federal courts of the person effecting the insurance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b952-9\"> Cohen v.
