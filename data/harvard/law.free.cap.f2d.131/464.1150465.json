For the purposes of this Act [chapter]\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">J\u00a1\u00ed J\u00a1\u00ed sj&lt; <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">\u201c(m) The term \u2018labeling\u2019 means all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-18\">* Sf\u00ab * * <em>* </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b537-19\">\u201cSec. 301 [\u00a7 331]. The following acts and the causing thereof are * * * prohibited :</p>\n<p id=\"b537-20\">\u201c(a) The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any * * * drUg, * * * that is * * * misbranded.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-23\">\u201c(b) The * * * misbranding of any * * * drug * * * in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-26\">* H* * * sfc *</p>\n<p id=\"b537-27\">\u201c(k) The alteration, * * * of * * * any part of the labeling of, or the doing of any other act with respect to, a * * * drug, * * * if such act is done while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in such article being misbranded.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-30\">j|\u00ab jf:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-31\">\u201cSec. 502 [\u00a7 352], A drug or device shall be deemed to be misbranded \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b537-32\">\u201c(a) If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-33\">In the District Court counsel for plaintiff contended that the phrase \u201caccompanying such article\u201d means that misbranding occurs through any device which causes printed matter containing false therapeutic claims to be shipped through interstate commerce, including printed matter shipped separately from the product, and constitutes a violation of \u00a7 201 (m) if at the destination it becomes associated with and is used in proximity to the transported product on the shelves and display counters of the defendant\u2019s agents and distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-34\">The District Court [40 F.Supp. 801, 802] however, was of the opinion that literature \u201cplaced on shelves, display counters, or in window displays\u201d was advertising within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 55, providing that \u201c \u2018false advertisement\u2019 means an advertisement, other than labeling,\u201d and consequently was not a misbranding of an article in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-35\">Section 8 of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906 provided that the term \u201cmisbrand-ed\u201d should apply to all drugs, or articles of food, the package or label of which bore any statement, design, or device regarding such article, which was false or misleading in any particular, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 9. In interpreting this section, it was held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>a circular <em>enclosed </em>with an article inside the carton in which it was offered for sale was not within the purview of this section. United States v. American Druggists\u2019 Syndicate, C.C., 186 F. 387. Thereafter, in 1912, the Act was amended, specifically extending the definition to include statements, designs and devices <em>contained </em>in the package, \u201cto hit precisely the case of circulars or printed matter placed inside the package.\u201d Seven Cases v. United States, 239'U.S. 510, 515, 36 S.Ct. 190, 192, 60 L.Ed. 411, L.R.A.1916D, 164. The Act was again amended in 1938 so as to include within the term \u201clabeling,\u201d all \u201clabels,\u201d and \u201cother written, printed, or graphic matter * * * accompanying such article.\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321 (m).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We have not had the benefit of a brief on behalf of the defendant, but in the District Court the defendant contended that the word \u201caccompany\u201d did not include literature which did not go along with the product \u2014 in other words, that the test was not nearness, concurrence of display, or availability for reading. With this contention we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The word \u201caccompany\u201d is not defined in the Act, but we observe that among the meanings attributed to the word are \u201cto go along with,\u201d \u201cto go with or attend as a companion or associate,\u201d and \u201cto occur in association with,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d Ed. There can be no question that among the usual characteristics of labeling is that of informing a purchaser of the uses of an article to which the labeling relates, and that the basic character of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is not directly concerned with the sale of the products therein described, or whether the literature is carried away by the purchaser. It was enacted to protect the public health and to prevent fraud, and it ought to be given a liberal construction. Consequently, we are impelled to the conclusion that misbranding is cognizable under the Act if it occurs while the articles are being held for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">This conclusion is sustained by the legislative history of the Act, from which it appears that it was not the purpose of Congress to limit the scope of the phrase \u201caccompanying such articles\u201d to printed matter placed in the carton in which the article is contained. See Senate Report 1944, 73rd Cong., 1st and 2nd Sessions, and Senate Report No. 493 of the Committee on Commerce, 73rd Cong., 2nd Sess.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Our conclusion is also sustained by the decision in the case of United States v. Research Laboratories, 9 Cir., 126 F.2d 42, decided after the District Court had dismissed the complaint in the instant case. The defendant in the Research case contended that the circulars constituted advertising and did not constitute labeling within the meaning of the Act. In disposing of the contention, the court said, 126 F.2d at page 45: \u201cThe contention assumes that printed matter (such as a circular) cannot constitute both advertising and labeling. The assumption is unwarranted. Most, if not all, labeling is advertising. The term \u2018labeling\u2019 is defined in the Act as including all printed matter accompanying any article. Congress did not, and we cannot, exclude from the definition printed matter which constitutes advertising.\u201d The court also said: \u201c * * * nor is it material, whether the packages and the circulars did or did not travel in the same crate, carton or other container or on the same train, truck or other vehicle during their interstate journey. The packages and the circulars had a common origin and a common destination and arrived at their destination simultaneously. Clearly, therefore, they accompanied each other, regardless of whether, physically, they were together or apart during their journey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The decree of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
