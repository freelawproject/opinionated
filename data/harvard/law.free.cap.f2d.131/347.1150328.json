Petitioner\u2019s gross receipts were (1) from sales everywhere, $89,044,490.25, and (2) from sales in the District of Columbia, $339,027.36. The ratio of District sales to total sales was .38073 per cent. Respondent applied that ratio to pfetitioner\u2019s total apportionable net income, $18,298,472.25. The result, $69,667.77, was found by respondent and by the Board of Tax Appeals of the District .to be petitioner\u2019s net income taxable in the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1939 taxes \u201cthe taxable income from District of Columbia sources\u201d of every corporation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and provides that \u201cIn the case of any corporation, gross income includes only the gross income from sources within the District of Columbia. The proper apportionment and allocation of income with respect to sources of income within and without the District may be determined by processes or formulas of general apportionment under rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioners.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commissioners\u2019 regulations provide in Art. 3(b) (1) that \u201cWhere gross income for any taxable year is derived from the manufacture and sale or purchase and sale of tangible personal property, the portion thereof to be allocated to the District shall be taken to be such percentage of the total of such income as the sales within the District during such taxable year bear to the total sales of the corporation for such taxable year. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s attack is directed against that apportionment formula.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It does not contend that its District sales were less profitable than other sales, or that they, together with the manufacture of the goods involved, did not result in a profit of $69,667.77. Petitioner\u2019s contention is that, since the goods sold in the District were produced elsewhere, the profit which \u25a0 resulted was not entirely or even chiefly \u201cincome from sources within the District of Columbia.\u201d Petitioner concedes that no question of constitutionality is involved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The only question is one of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\"> It may be true, as petitioner contends, that from the economic point of view a large portion of the income in question is attributable to activity which took place outside the District. But that is not material to the question whether the income came from \u201csources\u201d within the District, as that term is used in the tax acts. It has been consistently held that, unless a different legislative intention appears, the geographical \u201csource\u201d of income from the manufacture and sale, or purchase and sale, of goods is in the jurisdiction where the sale is made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress must be assumed to have written the District Revenue Act in the light of the authorities. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the District business privilege tax, which the present income tax supplants, was measured solely by gross receipts from District sales.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">Petitioner relies on the fact that Congress has expressed a different intention with respect to the Federal income tax. Section 119(e)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 provides that income \u201cfrom the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within and sold without the United States, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer without and sold within the United States, shall be treated as derived partly from sources within and partly from sources without the United States.\u201d Petitioner relies, further, upon the provision in the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1939, Sec. 29(a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the assessor \u201cshall apply as far as practicable the administrative and judicial interpretations of the Federal income tax law so that computations of income for purposes of this title [chapter] shall be, as nearly as practicable, identical with the calculations required for Federal income tax purposes.\u201d But the language just quoted can apply only to those parts o\u00ed the Federal law which are like parts of the District of Columbia law. There is nothing in the District law which even remotely resembles the quoted language of Section 119(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Moreover, the express purpose of the quoted language of the District act is to make computations of income under that act \u201cas nearly as practicable, identical with the calculations required for Federal income tax purposes.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s proposed insertion in the District law, with regard to interstate allocation, of a principle analogous to the one which Congress has inserted in the Federal law with regard to international allocation would not result in any \u201cidentical calculations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The Internal Revenue Code was adopted on February 10, 1939, and the District of Columbia Revenue Act on July 26, 1939. We cannot assume that Congress acted inadvertently in omitting from the later law what it had inserted in the earlier one. We should be bound by the difference between the two laws even if we could see no reason for the difference. But a possible reason is apparent. In the country at large, as in most of the individual states, whose allocation statutes petitioner has been at pains to collate, tangible goods are not only sold extensively but produced extensively. Few tangible goods are produced in the District of Columbia. Though Congress may prefer to work both sides of the street, it may recognize the fact that the District street has only one side.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> 53 Stat. 1087, Sec. 2(b), Code 1940, \u00a7 47-1502(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\"> 53 Stat. 1088, Sec. 4(b), Code 1940, \u00a7 47-1504(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-11\"> The regulation continues: \u201cOther factors, such as the average monthly value of tangible personal property held and owned by the corporation in connection with its trade or business in the District and the total value of such property held and owned by the corporation in connection with its trade or business, may also be considered whenever, in the opinion of the Assessor, the use of such additional factors in the apportionment formula would result in a more equitable tax.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b420-13\"> On this appeal, petitioner seeks also to question the fact that its gross receipts from sales in the District of Columbia were $339,027.36. It cannot be heard to do so, since it raised no such question before the Board, but on the contrary stipulated that the only issue was the correctness of respondent\u2019s action in using the ratio of Distinct sales to total sales as the sole basis for apportioning petitioner\u2019s net income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b420-17\"> Kent-Coffey Mfg.
