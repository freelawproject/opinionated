Int.Rev.Acts, page 971, and similar provisions of preceding and subsequent Acts, and upon consideration of the briefs and record filed in the cause and the oral argument of counsel, it is the view of the court that the trust has the distinguishing features of an association as they are enumerated in the case of Morrissey v. Commission, 296 U.S. 344, 56 S.Ct. 289, 80 L.Ed. 263, and companion cases, and that there are no material or controlling distinctions between the present trust and that adjudicated as an association in Nashville Trust Co. v.
