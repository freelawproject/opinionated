It consists of the following ingredients :</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Po. Ext. Pokeberries 1/8 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">FI. Ext. Bladder Wrack 1/2 min.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Potassium Iodide 1/8 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">Rochelle Salt 1/2 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">Iodine (Keysall) 1/24 min.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">Carbonated Vegetable 3/8 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">Calcium Carbonate 1/8 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">Sugar Milk qs 3 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-19\">The Commission\u2019s original findings gave her formula as consisting of the following: Po. Ext. Pokeberries 1/8 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-20\">FI. Ext. Bladder Wrack 1/2 min.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-21\">Potassium Iodide 1/8 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">Rochelle Salt 1/2 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-23\">Iodine (Keysall) 1/24 min.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-24\">Carbonated Vegetable 3/8 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-25\">Calcium <em>Carbide </em>1/8 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-26\">Sugar Milk qs 3 gr.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-27\">The contention made is that the order directing her to cease and desist is based on the finding that her remedy contained as an ingredient calcium carbide, whereas admittedly it contained no such ingredient.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-28\">One of the constituent elements of petitioner\u2019s remedy was calcium carbonate. Throughout the hearing the attorney for the Commission referred to this element as calcium carbide. One of the medical experts of the Commission, Dr. Rees, used the term calcium carbide. He testified that calcium carbide is a reducing acid, but that the amount in the formula was inert and would have no effect. Calcium carbide is a crystalline solid made by heating lime and carbon together in an electric furnace. It is quite obvious that while the doctor used the term \u201ccalcium carbide,\u201d he must have had in mind and was testifying concerning calcium carbonate. That the term \u201ccalcium carbide\u201d was inadvertently used when calcium carbonate was in the minds of the witnesses and the Commission is evidenced by the testimony of Dr. Kemper when he testified: \u201cCalcium carbide \u2014 no, calcium carbonate \u2014 is an astringent.\u201d Dr. Connor testified concerning the effect of calcium carbonate. From this it appears that the Commission had before it the testimony concerning the effect of calcium carbonate, an ingredient in petitioner\u2019s formula, and that it inadvertently used the term \u201ccalcium carbide\u201d in its original findings upon which the order was based. When the typographical error thereafter was called to its attention, it properly corrected the error by a nunc pro tunc order making its finding conform to the undisputed testimony in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-29\">It is also urged that the Commission\u2019s experts testified that they were not familiar with Iodine (Keysall), one of the ingredients of petitioner\u2019s preparation. Dr. Rees did testify that he did not know what Key-sall was unless it was a preparation similar to Lugol\u2019s solution of iodine. Keysall is a trade name of an iodine solution and is substantially the same as Lugol\u2019s solution of iodine. This was understood by the witnesses and the Commission. The testimony is uncontradicted that the amount of iodine in petitioner\u2019s preparation did not constitute an active dose and had no therapeutic value.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-30\">The evidence fully supports the finding of the Commission, and the order will therefore be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
