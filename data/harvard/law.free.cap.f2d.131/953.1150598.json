The Commission, on June 16, 1936, made its Order No. 42, adopting a Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utilities and Licensees, subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 791a et seq. By order dated May 11, 1937, the Commission directed all public utilities subject to its jurisdicton under that Act to submit certain data, statements and information concerning their accounts, records and properties. After notice and hearing, as required by the Act, the Commission, by orders dated February 25, 1941, and October 21, 1941, purporting to be entered pursuant to sections 208 and 301(a) of the statute, directed petitioner, Hartford, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>comply with Order No. 42 and the order of May 11, 1937. Petitioner asks this court to review and set aside the orders of February 25, 1941 and October 21, 1941, on the ground that, under the Act, petitioner is <em>not </em>subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction in any respect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">It is clear, and petitioner so concedes, that, if petitioner is a \u201cpublic utility,\u201d as that term is defined in section 201 (e), then those orders arc valid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For section 208, found in Part II of the Act, and section 301 (a), found in Part III, each applies to \u201cevery public utility.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And section 201 (e), found in Part II, reads, \u201cThe term \u2018public utility\u2019 when used in this Part or in the Part next following [sections 824-825r of this title] means any person<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who owns or operates facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under .this Part [sections 824 \u2014 824h of this title].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The pivotal question is, then, whether petitioner owns or operates any facilities subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under Part II.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For answer to that question, we must turn to Section 201 (b), contained in Part II, which reads as follows : \u201cThe provisions of this Part [sections 824 \u2014 824h of this title] shall apply to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, but shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy or deprive a State or State commission of its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a State line. The Commission shall have jurisdiction over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy, but shall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this Part and the Part next following [sections 824 \u2014 824r of this title], over facilities used for the generation of electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce, or over facilities for the transmission of electric energy consumed wholly by the transmitter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>2. The facts pertinent to this review may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Petitioner is a Connecticut corporation engaged in the business of generating, transmitting, distributing and selling electric energy in and near Hartford, Connecticut. It owns a steam-generating plant in Hartford. For some ten years before the President approved the Act, petitioner was a member of a voluntary arrangement for a \u201cPool\u201d of electric energy known as the Connecticut Valley Power Exchange. The Exchange consisted of Massachusetts and Connecticut electric utility companies and was formed and operated for the purpose of exchanging electric energy, \u201cat incremental cost,\u201d between the members. Through the operations of this Exchange, electric energy generated by petitioner was transmitted to, and sold to,' customers -in Massachusetts. Among the facilities used by petitioner in these transmissions of energy through the Exchange were these: (a) Facilities, owned by petitioner, between the connections on its generators in its generating plant and a substation immediately outside its generating plant. (b) That substation, owned by petitioner, (c) A transmission line, owned and operated by the Connecticut Power Company, connecting the substation with the facilities of -a Massachusetts member of the Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">In 1936, petitioner withdrew from the Exchange, Connecticut Power then succeeded it as a member of the Exchange, and petitioner then sold -to Connecticut Power the substation and the facilities from its bushings on the wall of its generating plant to the substation. Since then Connecticut has owned -and operated these facilities. Petitioner retained ownership and operation of the facilities in its gen-crating plant, and between its generators and those wall bushings. The generators are connected to a \u201cMain Bus\u201d inside the generating plant. Numerous circuits connected to that bus are used solely in intrastate distribution and transmission; but -there are three such circuits which lead through the wall bushings of the plant building to the substation; inside the building these circuits to the wall bushings are owned by petitioner, while outside they are now owned by Connecticut Power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">The 1936 sale of assets to Connecticut Power was admittedly made in the hope of escaping the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. After that sale to Connecticut Power, no physical change was made in the transfers of energy under the Exchange arrangement, and the physical plan of operations of the Exchange continued -as theretofore. Connecticut Power supplies to other Exchange members energy which it receives principally from petitioner, and receives from them energy, a considerable part of which it supplies to petitioner. Financial benefits, by way of savings, which had formerly accrued to petitioner as a member of the Exchange, now are received and retained by Connecticut Power. It is admitted by petitioner that it knows that the amount of energy it sells to Connecticut Power exceeds the latter\u2019s load requirements for its needs in the State of Connecticut; that such excess is utilized by Connecticut Power in connection with the operations of the Exchange; that, in such operation, energy is transmitted across the State boundary to Massachusetts, where it is used (except for losses) for sales to ultimate consumers; and that the supply of energy by petitioner is essential to the operations of the Exchange.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Petitioner has a contract with Connecticut Power which obligates petitioner to supply Connecticut Power the firm capacity, up to a designated limit, required by Connecticut for its sales of energy to intrastate customers in a designated area. Outside its contract commitments, petitioner also sells Connecticut Power surplus energy. Were it not for this surplus energy thus sold by petitioner to Connecticut Power, the latter could not transmit energy under the Exchange arrangement. Although in this way energy generated by petitioner is transmitted and resold in Massachusetts, petitioner never sells any designated block of energy for specific interstate use. Connecticut Power may either distribute a particular purchase to its customers or put it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>the transmission line to Massachusetts. Petitioner has no interstate energy business except in so far as its sales of energy to Connecticut Power transmitted to Massachusetts may, as <em>\u201ca </em>matter of law\u201d under the Act, constitute interstate transactions by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Petitioner owns 9.19% of the common stock of Connecticut Power. Four of the eleven directors of petitioner are among the fourteen directors of Connecticut Power, and two of the principal officers of the two companies are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Through the three circuits, above mentioned, which lead from petitioner\u2019s generating plant to the substation owned by Connecticut Power, 166,144,000 kilowatt hours of electric energy from petitioner\u2019s generating plant were supplied to Connecticut Power in the first nine months of 1939, of which 97,932,000 were transmitted to Massachusetts. From June 1 to September 30, 1939, approximately a third of the net generation at petitioner\u2019s plant was sent to Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">3. Section 201(d) defines the \u201csale of electric energy at wholesale\u201d to mean \u201ca sale of electric energy to any person for resale.\u201d Petitioner sells electric energy to Connecticut Power. The Exchange arrangements result in resales, whether they be regarded as sales to the Exchange<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and resales by the Exchange, or as sales by the Exchange as agent for the members, or as an agency whereby each member acts as agent for the others in selling the energy supplied by the others. For the inescapable fact is that energy sold by petitioner to Connecticut Power is resold to consumers in Massachusetts. There can be no doubt that petitioner is making sales at wholesale, as that term is defined in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">Petitioner concedes that Congress has the constitutional power to regulate the sales transactions in which it is engaged, but argues that Congress has not exercised that power in this Act, because it has used the expression \u201cin interstate commerce,\u201d a phrase, says petitioner, not sufficiently comprehensive to cover such transactions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A similar contention was made in Peoples Natural Gas Co. v. Federal Power Commission, App.D.C., 127 F.2d 153, 155, in which a gas company had sold natural gas in Pennsylvania to another company which immediately transported the gas to New York, where it sold it to others for resale. The court rejected the argument, stating that the words \u201csale in interstate commerce\u201d aptly described such a transaction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We adopt that court\u2019s excellent discussion of the pertinent authorities. See also Shafer v. Farmers\u2019 Grain Co., 268 U.S. 189, 199, 45 S.Ct. 481, 485, 69 L.Ed. 909, and Flanagan v. Federal Coal Co., 267 U.S. 222, 225, 45 S.Ct. 233, 69 L.Ed. 583 (in both of which the court used the phrase \u201cin interstate commerce\u201d). Cf. Public Utilities Commission v. Attle-boro Co., 273 U.S. 83, 47 S.Ct. 294, 71 L.Ed. 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-14\">We are not to be taken as saying that a mere sale by A, within a state, to B, who ships the commodity in interstate commerce, would necessarily be a sale in interstate commerce; the character and extent of the seller\u2019s knowledge of the purpose of the purchaser to ship across state lines may be important. Petitioner, in support of its position that it has insufficient knowledge of the transmission to Massachusetts of the energy purchased from it by Connecticut Power, leans heavily on Superior Oil Co. v. Mississippi, 280 U.S. 390, 50 S.Ct. 169, 170, 74 L.Ed. 504, a case which, as the opinion shows, turned on its peculiar facts and which, as the court said, was \u201cnear the line.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>holding that the intrastate sales of gasoline did not become sales in interstate commerce, so as to relieve the seller of taxes in the state where the sale took place, merely because the buyers transported the gasoline to another slate for resale, the court, in an opinion by Holmes, J., said: \u201cA distinction has been taken between sales made with a view to a certain result and those made simply with indifferent knowledge that the buyer contemplates that result. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Parker, 242 U.S. 13, 14, 37 S.Ct. 4, 61 L.Ed. 119; Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros., 222 U.S. 55, 62, 32 S.Ct. 20, 56 L.Ed. 92, Ann.Cas. 1913A, 1285.\u201d The citation of the Kalem case (in which the opinion was also by Holmes, J.) illuminates the meaning of \u201cindifferent knowledge\u201d; for, in that case, it was said that \u201cmere indifferent supposition or knowledge on the part of the seller that the buyer of spirituous liquor in contemplating such unlawful use is not enough to connect him with the possible unlawful consequences, * * * <em>but * * * if the sale was made with a view to the illegal resale, </em>the price could not be recovered.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> [222 U.S. 55, 32 S.Ct. 21, 56 L.Ed. <em>92.]</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>The instant case, far more closely resembles the <em>Kalem </em>case than the Superior Oil case. For the petitioner makes its sales to Connecticut Power with no mere \u201cindifferent knowledge\u201d as to what Connecticut Power contemplates. Because of petitioner\u2019s former membership in the Exchange, because it has directors and officers interlocking with Connecticut Power and owns a sizable block of Connecticut Power\u2019s stock, petitioner cannot possibly lack knowledge of the fact that the sales by it to Connecticut Power are indispensable to those Exchange arrangements which culminate in the transmission to, and sale of, considerable quantities of electric energy in Massachusetts. Indeed, the record \u2022shows that petitioner openly admitted that it has such knowledge. Petitioner, therefore, is fully aware that some of such <em>\u25a0energy is </em>unavoidably destined by the buy\u2022er for interstate use. Cf. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Parker, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">The facts here are, then, ample to \u2022show such knowledge <em>as is </em>required; but we are not to be taken as saying that less facts would not be sufficient. We have not \"based our ruling on \u201caffiliation\u201d between the \u2022companies, or on the thesis that Connecticut Power is an agent of petitioner. Nor have we considered it of any importance that petitioner, in 1936, sold , assets to Connecticut Power and took other steps to \u2022escape the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction; to make such an attempt is not unlawful, is indeed not immoral \u2014 not even if it fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">It is immaterial that the sales are \u25a0\u201cindirect\u201d in that they are sold within the state to another company for transmission and sale outside the state, or that the quantities of energy sold are variable or small (relative to the seller\u2019s total output) or are part of petitioner\u2019s \u201csurplus\u201d production;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or that the sales are made at 'petitioner\u2019s place of business ;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or that petitioner sells without prior obligation to do so.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nor is it of significance that the energy, in the <em>course </em>of transmission, passes through Connecticut Power Company\u2019s transformers where the voltage is changed; the nature of electric energy and of its transmission is such that we regard as inapposite cases (like Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis, S. W. Ry. Co., 249 U.S. 134, 151, 152, 39 S.Ct. 237, 63 L.Ed. 517) where shipments are interrupted for a considerable period during which the goods are processed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-19\">We conclude that the Commission correctly held that petitioner is engaged in \u201cthe sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-20\">4. Petitioner, however, contends that, even if it is engaged in interstate wholesale sales, still it is not a \u201cpublic utility,\u201d and, therefore, the Commission\u2019s orders are invalid. In brief, its position is (a) that a company, although engaged in making such interstate sales, is not a \u201cpublic utility,\u201d subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, unless it has facilities for \u201ctransmission in interstate commerce,\u201d and (b) that petitioner has no such facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-21\">More in detail, its contention is as follows: (1) All facilities of such a company are rigidly divided into those for \u201ctransmission\u201d and those for \u201cgeneration\u201d of electric energy. (2) Petitioner has no facilities for transmission in interstate commerce; accordingly, all its facilities used in connection with its interstate wholesale sales are \u201cgeneration\u201d facilities. (3) The Commission has no jurisdiction under any section found in Part II, over \u201cgeneration\u201d facilities. (4) It follows that the Commission has no jurisdiction, under Part II, over any of petitioner\u2019s facilities. (5) Therefore, petitioner is not a \u201cpublic utility,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7\u00a7 208 and 301(a) pursuant to which the Commission\u2019s orders were entered, since that term, for the purposes of those sections, is defined, in \u00a7 201(e), as a company which owns or operates facilities subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under Part II. (6) The result, says petitioner, is that the Commission\u2019s orders here under review are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>The essential points in this contention are the assertions (1) that in no portion of Part II is the Commission given jurisdiction over generation facilities; (2) that all facilities of such a company are either for generation or for transmission, and that petitioner has no interstate transmission facilities, and no facilities used in connection with its interstate wholesale sales except its generation facilities. If the petitioner errs as to either of these two assertions, its entire contention falls. We hold that it does so err, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Even if we assume that generation facilities are not within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 201 (b) or any other portion of Part II, and also that petitioner has no facilities for interstate transmission, still petitioner\u2019s contention is untenable: Section 201(b) confers jurisdiction over not only facilities (1) for interstate <em>transmission </em>but also \u2014 and <em>disjunctively </em>\u2014 over facilities (2) for interstate wholesale <em>sales. </em>If the Commission has no jurisdiction under \u00a7 201(b) over generation facilities, then that part of that section conferring jurisdiction over facilities for interstate wholesale sales becomes meaningless \u2014 unless there is a third category of facilities, i.e., those used neither for transmission nor for generation. We must, therefore, look for that third category. We find it in petitioner\u2019s corporate organization, contracts, accounts, memoranda, papers and other records, in so far as they are utilized in connection with such sales.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">It should be noted that the word \u201cfacilities\u201d is generally regarded as a widely inclusive term, embracing anything which aids or makes easier the performance of the activities involved in the business of a person or corporation. Cf. Nekoosa-Ed-wards Paper Co. v. M. St. P. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 217 Wis. 426, 259 N.W. 618, 620; Fraters v. Keeling, 20 Cal.App.2d 490, 67 P.2d 118, 119; Funk &amp; Wagnalls Dictionary (1913 Ed.) 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">5. A majority of the court holds that there is also the following alternative ground for rejecting petitioner\u2019s contention : Even if we assume that petitioner has no facilities for interstate transmission,</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-16\">and that petitioner\u2019s books, records, etc., are not facilities for wholesale sales in interstate commerce, so that petitioner has nothing except facilities for generation, still petitioner\u2019s contention is unsound. For we consider that generation facilities, where used as aids to such sales, are within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-17\">As previously noted, that subsection specifically provides that \u201cthe Commission shall have jurisdiction over <em>all </em>facilities\u201d either for (1) \u201ctransmission of electric energy in interstate commerce\u201d or (2) \u201cthe sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\u201d If that sentence, so providing, stopped there, it would be obvious that the Commission has jurisdiction over generation facilities when used in connection with interstate wholesale sales. The sentence, however, continues with a clause (which, for convenience, we shall call the \u201cbut\u201d clause) reading: \u201cbut shall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this Part and the Part next following [sections 824-825r of this title], over facilities used for the generation of electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce, or over facilities for the transmission of electric energy consumed wholly by the transmitter.\u201d This \u201cbut\u201d clause, petitioner argues, reduces the authority conferred on the Commission over \u201call facilities\u201d for \u201cthe sale * * * at wholesale in interstate commerce,\u201d in the earlier part of the sentence, by excluding \u201cfacilities used for the generation.\u201d To this argument there are several answers :</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-18\">(a) In the preceding subsection, 201(a), Congress \u201cdeclared\u201d that \u201c * * * Federal regulation of matters relating to generation to the extent provided in this Part and the Part next following [sections 824-825r of this title] * * * is necessary in the public interest.\u201d The legislative history of the Act also weighs heavily against petitioner\u2019s assertion. As that history is excellently summarized in Jersey Central Power &amp; L. Co. v. Federal Power Commission, supra, we shall do no more than to quote the following from the statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>the House Conferees accompanying the Conference Report:<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cThe Senate hill in Section 210(a) contained a somewhat more lengthy declaration of policy than the House Amendment, the only material difference being that the House Amendment contained no reference to \u2018generation\u2019 of electric energy which appeared in the Senate Bill. The conference substitute follows the language of the House Amendment but inserts a clause relating to generation to the extent regulation thereof is provided in this Part and the Part next following. The House Amendment and Conference substitute also makes reference to the \u2018sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce\u2019 which reference did not appear in the Senate bill. The same general differences between the Senate bill and the House Amendment has been followed with a clarifying phrase added to remove any doubt as to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over the facilities used for the generation and local distribution, of electric energy to the extent provided in other sections of this Part and the Part next following.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Moreover, among the facilities described in the \u201cbut\u201d clause of \u00a7 201(b), are those used \u201conly for the transmission * * *' in intrastate commerce\u201d; as such facilities could not possibly be among those used for interstate transmission or interstate wholesale sales, the \u201cbut\u201d clause becomes foolish if interpreted as carving out of the authority granted in the earlier part of the same sentence the facilities described in the \u201cbut\u201d clause. Such a foolish interpretation is avoided by giving effect to a phrase in the \u201cbut\u201d clause, i.e., \u201cexcept as specifically provided in this Part or the Part next following [sections 824-825r of this title].\u201d The \u201cbut\u201d clause then shows up not as one reducing jurisdiction but as a negatively worded confirmation of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, in certain circumstances, over the facilities mentioned in the \u201cbut\u201d clause. In other words, the \u201cbut\u201d clause is to be construed as if it read: \u201cWherever it is so specifically provided in Parts II and III, the Commission shall have jurisdiction over the facilities used for generation, for local distribution, for intrastate transmission, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Under that interpretation, the Commission, under \u00a7 201(b), has jurisdiction of generation facilities when used in connection with wholesale interstate sales, because jurisdiction of facilities for such sales is \u201cspecifically provided\u201d in that section. Congress, we think, intended to exempt generation facilities when not used for interstate purposes because, when not so used, they are intrastate facilities; accordingly, when not so used, they are grouped, in the \u201cbut\u201d clause, with other non-interstate facilities, i.e., facilities used in local distribution or for intrastate transmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Regarding the \u201cbut\u201d clause as an exception, and keeping in mind the obvious purpose of Congress, disclosed in the legislative history, to see to it that there was effective regulation of interstate wholesale sales of electrical energy, we consider as pertinent the \u201celementary rule requiring that exceptions from a general policy which a law embodies should be strictly construed * * Spokane &amp; Inland R. R. v. United States, 241 U.S. 344, 348, 350, 36 S.Ct. 668, 671, 60 L.Ed. 1037; cf. Piedmont &amp; Northern Ry. v. I. C. C., 286 U.S. 299, 311, 312, 52 S.Ct. 541, 76 L.Ed. 1115; United States v. McElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 639, 47 S.Ct. 219, 71 L.Ed. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">We note that the Natural Gas Act, U. S.C.A.Title 15, \u00a7 717(b) provides that that Act shall apply to the \u201ctransportation\u201d of natural gas \u201cin interstate commerce\u201d or to the \u201csale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale\u201d; the same sentence contains a \u201cbut\u201d clause reading: \u201cbut <em>shall not apply </em>* * * to the local distribution of natural gas or to <em>the </em>* * * <em>production or gathering of natural gas.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet, in People\u2019s Natural Gas Co. v. Federal Power Commission, supra, a company engaged in production of natural gas, but not in its interstate transportation, was held to be subject to the Act because, in the State of Pennsylvania, it sold gas to another company which transported the gas to another state for resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">The point is that it is not as such that the generation facilities are subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 201(b), but as facilities used in the business of knowingly selling electric energy wholesale in interstate commerce. It is the fact of petitioner\u2019s knowledge which should dissipate the apprehension expressed in the brief of amicus curiae that the result of a decision sustaining the Commission in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>this case \u201cwill be to bring under the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction every generating company which generates any electric energy which <em>finds its way </em>into interstate commerce.\u201d We are not holding, nor did the Commission hold, that the Act has \u201cthe effect of bringing all owners of generating facilities\u201d with that jurisdiction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">5a. The Commission argues that there is an additional ground for holding that it has \u201cjurisdiction\u201d under \u00a7 201(b). Since we have held that it has \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d for the reasons heretofore given, we shall not consider that argument but merely note that it runs as follows: In Utah Power &amp; L. Co. v. Pfost, 286 U.S. 165, 181, 52 S.Ct. 548, 552, 76 L.Ed. 1038, the court differentiated between generation and transmission, stating that transmission \u201cbegins * * * definitely at the generator, at which point measuring appliances can be placed and the quantum of electrical energy ascertained with practical accuracy.\u201d As appears from our summary of the facts in the instant case, petitioner owns and operates facilities connecting its generators with the \u201cbus,\u201d and circuits connected with that \u201cbus\u201d which lead, through bushings in the wall of petitioner\u2019s generating plant, to the substation owned by Connecticut Power Company; all those connections, the bus, and that part of the circuits inside the petitioner\u2019s generating plant, are owned by petitioner. The Commission argues that those facilities, under the Pfost case, are transmission facilities and, as the energy sold in Massachusetts passes (with petitioner\u2019s knowledge) through those facilities, they are \u201cfacilities * * * for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce,\u201d and are within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 201(b). Petitioner argues that such facilities are classified in the Commission\u2019s accounting rules as part of a generating plant; but the Commission replies that such an accounting classification cannot be controlling when the question, as here, is one of jurisdiction. Petitioner also argues that these facilities, even if for transmission, are, relatively, so small in extent that they cannot be the basis of jurisdiction; the Commission answers that in Jersey Central Power <em>&amp; </em>L. Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 3 Cir., 129 F.2d 183, jurisdiction, under \u00a7 201(b), was held to be properly based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>a transmission line which was but seven-eighths of a mile in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">6. Petitioner, however, argues that, regardless of all other consideration, Congress cannot have intended, that the Commission should have jurisdiction over any of petitioner\u2019s facilities because of the preamble of the Act, \u00a7 201 (a) which reads as <em>follows: \u201cIt is </em>hereby declared that the business of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest, and that Federal regulation of matters relating to generation to the extent provided in this Part and the Part next following [sections 824-825r of this title] and of that part of such business which consists of the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is necessary in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">On the basis- of -the closing words of that section, two arguments are advanced. The first (as we understand it) runs thus: The Connecticut Commission' asserts that it, absent a federal statute, has complete jurisdiction over all petitioner\u2019s facilities and activities; and perhaps, if the question were to arise today, the Supreme Court would hold that,' absent federal legislation, such a State. Commission can constitutionally exert such jurisdiction; accordingly, the last .phrase in \u00a7 201 (a) should be read as depriving the Federal Commission of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\"> With that suggestion, we cannot agree. For, in ascertaining the legislative purpose, we must read the legislation in the light of the views of Congress at the time of its enactment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Whatever may be the doctrine today (a matter we need not consider), it is clear, from the legislative history, that, when this Act was in Congress, wholesale interstate sales were, even in the absence of Federal legislation, deemed to be beyond State regulatory powers, under Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro, 273 U.S. 83. Yet petitioner would have us adopt an interpretation of the Act which would deprive the Federal Commission of jurisdiction over the very kind of sale which, under the Attleboro case, would then have been held not to be subject to state regulation, although one of the chief purposes of -the Act was to close just that regulatory gap <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">Petitioner also seems to argue that, because of the closing words of \u00a7 201 (a), the Federal Commission is denied jurisdiction over any facilities which are, in part, subject to regulation by any State, and that, since the State of Connecticut, through a State Commission, regulates, in part, all petitioner\u2019s facilities, Congress must be understood as intending that they should not be within the regulatory power of the Federal Commission. That suggestion is without merit. And especially so with reference to accounts, records and the like. For Congress obviously contemplated that there would, in many cases, be both federal and state regulation. Thus, in \u00a7 301 (a), after conferring on the Federal Commission authority over such matters, Congress said, \u201cProvided, however, That nothing in this Act [chapter] shall relieve any public utility from keeping any accounts, memo-randa, or records which such public utility may be required to keep by or under authority of the laws of any State.\u201d Thus a company like petitioner may be required to keep its accounts, etc., in two distinct forms, one pursuant to the orders of the Federal Commission and the other in accord with State requirements <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">&lt;, Section 209 (b) unmistakably recognizes the likelihood of duality in regulation, and is designed to mitigate its effects, by providing for \u201cconferences\u201d and \u201cjoint hearings\u201d by the Federal and State Commissions \u201cregarding the relationship between rate structures, costs, accounts, charges, practices, classifications, and regulations of public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of such State commission and of the [federal] Commission.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Other sections of the Act are also pertinent. For instance, petitioner\u2019s suggested interpretation of 'the last words of \u00a7 201 (a) would render \u00a7 204 partly superfluous and partly inoperative. For Section 204 (a) provides that no public utility shall issue securities without the authorization of the federal commission, while \u00a7 204 (f) exempts from this requirement a utility which is both \u201corganized and operating\u201d in a State under whose laws its security issues are regulated by a State Commission. The suggested interpretation of 201 (a) would make \u00a7 204 (f) unnecessary; and it would nullify \u00a7 204 (b) which gives the federal Commission jurisdiction over the security issues of a utility \u201corganized\u201d but not also \u201coperating\u201d in a State whose Commission is empowered by State law to regulate such securities.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">We cannot agree that Congress intended by the preamble that interstate transactions, which the Attleboro case had held to be beyond the regulatory power of the States, should be exempt from federal regulation where they are carried on by facilities which are also used for intrastate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Moreover, petitioner\u2019s suggested interpretation gives undue weight to a preamble clause worded as generally as \u00a7 201 (a). Cf. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 280, 56 S.Ct. 855, 80 L.Ed. 1160; N. L. R. B. v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 129, 130, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. 893, 108 A.L.R. 1352.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">For that reason, we also reject the following suggestion: Although, as already noted, \u00a7 201 (b), disjunctively, confers jurisdiction over interstate transmission or interstate wholesale sales, yet, it is said, this disjunction must be disregarded because the preamble refers, conjunc-tively, to \u201cthe business of transmitting and selling electric energy\u201d; this reference, it is urged, restricts the application of \u00a7 201 (b) to a \u201cperson\u201d which is in the joint business of transmitting and selling in interstate commerce. It will be noted that the result would be to exempt a corporation engaged in transmitting, but not selling at wholesale, in interstate commerce, &gt;a result which the legislative history shows to be in flat contradiction of the legislative .purpose, for it would relieve such a company from both State and Federal regulation. The preamble of the Natural Gas Act, U.S.C.A. Title 15, \u00a7 717 (a), speaks in similar conjunctive manner of the \u201cbusiness of transporting and selling natural gas,\u201d while \u00a7 717 (b) \u2014 like 201 (b) of the Federal Power Act \u2014 makes the Gas Act applicable, disjunctively, to \u201csuch transportation or sale.\u201d In the People\u2019s Natural Gas case, supra, the court gave effect to the disjunctive treatment in \u00a7 717 (b), paying no attention to the conjunctive description in the preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">7. We are not unmindful of the doctrine of such cases as Federal Trade Commission v. Buntc Brothers. Tnc., 312 U.S. 349, 61 S.Ct. 580, 582, 85 L.Ed. 881; Palmer v. Massachusetts, 308 U.S. 79, 83, 84, 60 S.Ct. 34, 84 L.Ed. 93, and A. A. Kirschbaum v. Walling, Administrator, 316 U.S. 517, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 86 L.Ed. -, i.e., that, having \u201cdue regard for a proper adjustment of the local and national interests in our federal scheme,\u201d [312 U.S. 349, 351], 61 S. Ct. 580, 582, 85 L.Ed. 881, the courts should discountenance \u201cin roads by implication on state authority,\u201d [308 U.S. 79, 84, 60 S.Ct. 37, 84- L.Ed. 93], and that a Congressional intent to extend federal regulation should not be assumed to exist unless Congress is \u201creasonably explicit\u201d in stating such a purpose. We think the Congressional purpose to vest the Commission with the powers it here asserts does not rest upon mere implication and that the Act and its legislative history make that purpose, to say the least, \u201creasonably explicit.\u201d There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>basis for the fear expressed in the brief of amicus curiae that a decision sustaining the Commission\u2019s orders will involve grave encroachments \u201cupon the jurisdiction of state regulatory authorities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">8. The facts and the meaning of the statute are sufficiently clear so that, in arriving at our decision, we have not deemed it necessary to consider whether the doctrine of Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402, 413, 62 S.Ct. 326, 86 L.Ed. 301,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> is applicable here, i.e., that the \u201cexperienced judgment\u201d of the Commission, in its interpretation of the statute as applied to the facts, must be given great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">9. We have discovered no evidence in the record which shows that the findings of fact made by the Commission, necessary to support its orders, are not based on substantial evidence. We cannot, therefore, agree with petitioner that the Commission was under a duty to make further findings of uncontested facts, as requested by .petitioner, which, to quote petitioner\u2019s brief, related to \u201clegal criteria rejected\u201d \u2014 and we hold 'correctly rejected \u2014 \u201cby tlie Commission.\u201d Such a duty no more rests upon the Commission than it does upon a federal trial judge, sitting without a jury, who is also required to make findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">10. Petitioner assigns as error the failure of the Commission to include in the record before us any trial examiner\u2019s report. No such report was ever served on petitioner and petitioner based no arguments on the contents of such a report either here or before the Commission. So far as appears from its findings and legal conclusions, the Commission did not rely upon any such report, nor is it required to do so by the Act. We see no reason why, in the circumstances, that report, if there be one, should be considered by us. Cf. N. L. R. B. v. Air Associates, 2 Cir., 121 F.2d 586; Kidder Oil Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 117 F.2d 892, 902, is not in point;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and we are not prepared to say that we would follow it even if the fac.ts were identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">The petition is denied and the orders of the Commission are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1027-7\"> No question is raised as to the constitutionality of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1027-8\"> Jersey Central Power &amp; L.

Why do you permit The Connecticut Power Company, when convenient, to purchase the surplus electrical energy from the Hartford Company which you know it transmits across the State lines, as you have testified? A. Because when The Hartford Electric Light Company elected to divest itself of all inter-state transactions and of any benefit therefrom, we would, if we had specified that power purchased from the Hartford Company should not be used for such purpose, have deprived the residents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>territory contiguous to the Connecticut Valley of the benefits arising from the saving of large amounts of fuel and thus have acted to vitiate an obvious benefit to the public in this territory.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s executive vice-president testified: \u201cThe Hartford Electric Light Company is the main source of energy for The Connecticut Power Company in connection with The Connecticut Power Company\u2019s exchange operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">The following colloquies occurred in the oral argument before the Commission:</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">\u201cMr. Prettyman (one of counsel for petitioner) : I say that the physical movement, when we were a member of The Exchange, was the same as the physical movement since we have not been a member of The Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">\u201cCommissioner Scott: Let me put it in this way. Are not the various electrical facilities used in the process purely transferring devices, and is it not a fact that the entire combined process \u2014 electric, magnetic and mechanical \u2014 is integral, continuous and essentially simultaneous, and in the movement or transportation of this energy the same today as prior to 1936?</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">\u201cMr. Prettyman: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">\u201cThe Chairman: And is not the timing of deliveries of such energy as does move over into Massachusetts the same as it would have been if the Hartford Company remained a member of The Exchange?</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">\u201cMr. Prettyman: That may he so.

The gasoline was delivered at <em>the </em>wharves of the packers\u2019 packing plants in Mississippi and was thence carried by the packers\u2019 boats to a \u201cneighborhood\u201d in Louisiana and there delivered by the packers to shrimp fishex-men for use in fishing. The Oil Company, in each case of delivery, received from the packers a so-called bill of lading, signed by the master of the packers\u2019 boat on which the gas was loaded, purporting to show a consignment to the packers, to the Louisiana neighborhood as destination, on that boat; the bill of lading provided that the gasoline should remain the property of the Oil Company until delivered to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>consignee or its agent at such \u201cdestination,\u201d and that all risks should be upon the purchaser, the Oil Company paying no freight. The packers, when the gasoline was delivered at their plants, were free to do with it as they pleased. The court held that the sales by the Oil Company were not in interstate commerce and were, therefore, subject to be taxed by the State of Mississippi. The court said that the bills of lading seem \u201cto have had no other use than * * * to try to convert a domestic transaction into one of interstate commerce. There was no consignee at the point of destination. * * * There was no point of destination for delivering of the oil but merely a neighborhood in which the packers that had bought it and already held it expected to sell it again. The document hardly can affect the case, because it is \u2018not within'the power of the parties by the form of their contract to convert wliat was exclusively a local business, subject to state control, into an interstate commerce business transaction protected by the commerce clause* * * at least when the contract achieves nothing else.\u201d The court went on to say: \u201cThe importance of the commerce clause to the Union of course is very great. But it also is important to prevent that clause being used to deprive the States of their lifeblood by a strained interpretation of facts. We may admit that this case is near the line. There was a regular course of business <em>known to </em>the appellant, that took the gasoline into another State, and if by mutual agreement the oil had been put into the hands of a third person, a common carrier, for transportation to Louisiana the mere possibility that the vendor might be able to induce the carrier to forego his rights might not have been enough to keep the transaction out of interstate commerce. A. O. Spalding &amp; Bros. v. Edwards, 262 U.S. 66, 43 S.Ct. 485, 67 L.Ed. 865 (a caso of foreign export, see Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, 262 U.S. 506, 520, 521, 43 S. Ct 643, 67 L.Ed. 1095). But here the gasoline was in the hands of the purchaser to do with as it liked, and there was nothing that in any way committed it to sending the oil to Louisiana except its own wishes. If it had bought bait for fishing that it intended to do itself, the purchase would not have been in interstate commerce because the fishing grounds were known by both parties to be beyond the State line. A distinction has been taken between sales made with a view to a certain result and those made simply with indifferent knowledge that the buyer contemplates that result. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Parker, 242 U.S. 13, 14, 37 S.Ct. 4, 61 L.Ed. 139; Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros., 222 U.S. 55, 62, 32 S.Ct. 20, 56 L.Ed. 92, Ann.Cas. 1913A, 1285. The only purpose of the vendor here was to escape taxation. It was not taxed in Louisiana and hoped not to be in Mississippi. The fact that it desired to evade the law, as it is called, is immaterial, because the very meaning of a line in the law is that you intentionally may go as close to it as you can if you do not pass it. Bullen v. Wisconsin, 240 U.S. 625, 630, 631, 36 S.Ct. 473, 60 L.Ed. 830. But on the other hand the desire to make its act an act in commerce among the States was equally unimportant when it was apparent that the buyer\u2019s journey to Louisiana was accidental so far as the appellant was concerned. It is a matter of proximity and degree as to which minds will differ, but it seems to us that the connection of the seller with the steps taken by the buyer after the sale was too remote to save the seller from the tax. Dramatic circumstances, such as a great universal stream of grain from the State of purchase to a market elsewhere, may affect the legal conclusion by showing the manifest certainty of the destination and exhibiting grounds of policy that are absent here.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"Ahi\"> Emphasis added.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1032-8\"> See Peoples Natural Gas Co. v.

This is true because, once it is decided that the Commission has \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over any of petitioner\u2019s facilities, then the petitioner is a \u201cpublic utility,\u201d and the Commission is then vested with specific powers under the several sections of the Act which refer to a \u201cpublic utilityand some of those sections give the Commission specific powers \u2014 some direct and some indirect \u2014 with respect to the generating facilities of a \u201cpublic utility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">Thus \u00a7 207 relates to \u201cany public utility.\u201d It provides that, on complaint of a State Commission, if the federal Commission finds \u201cany interstate service\u201d of \u201cany public utility\u201d inadequate, it may \u201ccompel the enlargement\u201d of the \u201cgenerating facilities,\u201d unless to do so will impair the public utility\u2019s ability to render adequate service to its customers; and see section 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">Also, since petitioner is a \u201cpublic utility,\u201d the Commission, even if it had \u201cjurisdiction\u201d solely over petitioner\u2019s corporate organization, records, etc., would have authority to regulate petitioner\u2019s rates for interstate sales (\u00a7 205); to investigate the cost of any of its properties, especially so far as that is necessary for rate-making (\u00a7 208); to order petitioner to keep its records, etc., as the Commission prescribes (\u00a7 301); to fix rates of depreciation of petitioner\u2019s \u201cseveral classes of property\u201d (\u00a7 302); and require petitioner to file reports, including data as to earnings, etc., and costs of \u201cgeneration\u201d (\u00a7 304).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">It is true that were we to leave it undecided whether the Commission has any \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over petitioner\u2019s generating facilities, we would thereby leave it undecided whether, as to such facilities, the Commission has authority, with respect to petitioner\u2019s generating facilities, under \u00a7 203, requiring the Commission\u2019s approval of the sale, etc., of a whole or part of a public utility\u2019s facilities \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.\u201d And the same might be true with respect to \u00a7 200(b); ef. however, the Commission\u2019s powers over petitioner under \u00a7\u00a7 205 and 213.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1036-7\"> Cf.
