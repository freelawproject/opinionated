The West Chicago Park Commissioners.</parties><decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b280-11\" pgmap=\"280\">Filed at Ottawa June 13, 1885.</decisiondate><syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b280-12\" pgmap=\"280\">1. Park commissioners\u2014power to levy special assessments. The West Chicago Park Commissioners are a quasi public corporation for park purposes, and as such have the power to take steps to cause property benefited by the establishment of a boulevard, to be specially assessed for the cost of the same.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b280-13\" pgmap=\"280(52) 281(42)\">2. Same\u2014effect of the act of 1873, as granting new powers, and of the mode of procedure under the several acts on the subject. Section 12 of\" the act entitled \u201cAn act in regard to the completion, improvement and management of public parks and boulevards, and to provide a more efficient remedy for the collection of delinquent assessments,\u201d approved May 2,1873, relates to a new and entirely different subject matter not provided in the original act relating to the West Chicago Park Commissioners, and invests them with powers they did not before have.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-5\" pgmap=\"281\">3. The language of that section, to the effect that the cost and expense of acquiring title to land for a connecting boulevard or pleasure way \u201cshall be levied upon, and collected by special assessment upon, the property deemed specially benefited by the location of such boulevard or pleasure way, in the same manner as the cost of other lands for parks and boulevards is assessed,</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ag4\" pgmap=\"281\">under the several acts creating such boards, \u201d means that the same shall be done by and through the same agencies or instrumentalities as were provided in such former acts. Section 4 of the act of May 2, 1873, does not compel action in pursuance of its terms in a proceeding under section 12, and does not repeal section 13 of the act of February 27, 18G9.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-7\" pgmap=\"281\">4. Fobmeb adjudication\u2014as to judgment of confirmation of special assessment. Where a court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and the persons whose property is assessed, and power to adjudicate upon an application to confirm a special assessment, its judgment of confirmation will be conclusive upon all questions and objections that might have been interposed before judgment, and such questions can not be raised by a bill in chancery seeking to enjoin the collection of the assessment.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-8\" pgmap=\"281\">5. Pleading in chancery\u2014allegation of want of notice of application for confirmation in a proceeding for special assessment. An allegation in a bill seeking to enjoin proceedings for the collection of special assessments for park purposes, that \u201c complainants are advised and believe, and therefore charge the fact to be, that no sufficient notice of the application for confirmation of said assessment was given, \u201d is but the statement of a conclusion of law. If a notice was given, the legality of which is denied, it should be specifically set out, that it may be seen whether it conforms with the requirement of the law.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b281-9\" pgmap=\"281\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Judd &amp; Whitehouse, for the appellants:</attorneys><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-11\" pgmap=\"281\">The assessment is void, and the court had no jurisdiction to enter the order of confirmation, because the commissioners had no authority to make the assessment, which should have been made by the corporate authorities designated in section i of the act of May 2, 1873. Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1881, chap. 105, p. 772.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-4\" pgmap=\"282\">Section 4 of the act of May 2, 1873, provides, that the town supervisor, clerk and assessor of such town be and they .are hereby designated and constituted the corporate authorities of such town, and they, or a majority of them, may levy the tax or any assessments herein authorized. It is under the 12th section of the same act that the park commissioners claim their authority to establish the boulevard. The commissioners having no authority to levy the assessment, it is void, and the court will enjoin. McConkey v. Smith, 73 Ill. 313; Munson v. Miller, 66 id. 380; Bank of Shawneetown v. Cook, 77 id. 622.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\" pgmap=\"282\">No action ivas ever taken by any official to ascertain whether the lands in West Chicago would be specially benefited to the amount of said assessment; and the assessment ivas not made according to benefits, but according to value, and is therefore in violation of the constitutional rule requiring uniformity of benefit and burden.

Therein it differs from the ordinary case of a bill to enjoin a tax in the course of collection. But even if there were no judgment, the bill fails to state a case of equitable cognizance.

We are notified by counsel that longer delay in announcing a decision will be highly prejudicial to the rights of the parties, and at their earnest solicitation we have suspended the current business of the June term long enough to dispose of the case. But, in consequence of the many \u2022duties pressing upon us, arising from the holding of daily sessions, we are constrained to be content with announcing the conclusions we have reached upon the questions discussed in the arguments submitted, without setting forth, at length, the reasons which have induced those conclusions. We hold\u2014</p> <p id=\"b284-4\" pgmap=\"284\">First\u2014That the West Chicago Park Commissioners are a quasi municipal corporation for park purposes, and-that they have power to take the steps to cause the property to be specially assessed for the cost of the boulevard, that were here-taken by them.</p> <p id=\"b284-5\" pgmap=\"284\">Second\u2014Section 12 of the act in regard to the completion, improvement and management of public parks and boulevards, and to provide a more efficient remedy for the collection of delinquent assessments, approved May 2, 1873, (Eev. Stat. 1874, p. 747,) relates to a new and entirely different subject matter,\u2014one not provided for in the original act relating to the West Chicago park,\u2014and invests the West Chicago Park Commissioners with a power they did not before have. The language therein, \u201cand the cost and expense of acquiring title to such land shall be levied upon, and collected by special assessment upon, the property deemed specially benefited by the location of such boulevard or pleasure way, in the same manner as the cost of other lands for parks and boulevards is assessed, under the several acts creating such boards, \u201d means that the same shall be done by and through the same agencies or instrumentalities, and so, as applied to the present case, by and through the agencies or instrumentalities provided by section 13 of the act of February 27, 1869, creating these commissioners. We do not think section 4 of the act of May 2, 1873, compelled action in this proceeding pursuant to its terms, and we hold section 13, supra, unrepealed and in full force.</p> <p id=\"b284-6\" pgmap=\"284(87) 285(22)\">Third\u2014We hold that the several steps taken in this special assessment anterior to the action of the circuit court, invested that court with jurisdiction in the proceeding, to reject, revise, amend or confirm the special assessment, in whole or in part, and to make or order a new assessment, in whole or in part, and to revise and confirm the same. The allegation in the bill that \u201ccomplainants are advised and believe, and therefore charge the fact to be, that no legal or sufficient notice of the application for confirmation of said assessment was given, \u201d is but the statement of a conclusion of law. If no notice was</p> <p id=\"b285-5\" pgmap=\"285\">given, that is a fact, and should have been stated. But if a notice was given the legality of which is denied, a question of law is raised, and the notice given should be specifically set out, in order that it may be seen whether it conforms to the requirement of the law.</p> <p id=\"b285-6\" pgmap=\"285\">Fourth\u2014Assuming, as we do, that on the application for confirmation the circuit court had jurisdiction both as respects the person and the subject matter, and hence had power to adjudicate, we hold that no question that could have been there raised can be heard upon bill in chancery to enjoin.</p> <p id=\"b285-7\" pgmap=\"285\">These conclusions lead to an affirmance of the decree below, which is accordingly adjudged.</p> <p id=\"b285-8\" pgmap=\"285\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
