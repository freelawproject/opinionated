Homestead\u2014effect of a divorce at the suit of the wife, as to her \u2022homestead right. Where a wife procures a divorce from her husband, the court is authorized to make disposition as to the homestead; but if the court fails to do this, the relation of husband and wife being severed by the decree of divorce, the latter loses all claim to a homestead, so that the husband may sell the premises without her release of homestead right. It is different in respect to the wife\u2019s dower, which is not lost by a divorce for the husband\u2019s fault.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b375-8\" pgmap=\"375\">2.

Where a son takes land by descent from his father, subject to the dower of his mother in the same, and her dower is afterward assigned to her, such assignment will relate back to the time of the death of the father, so as to prevent the seizin of the son as of a present estate in the third of the premises assigned to the widow' of the father; and the legal effect is to deprive the widow' of the son, who dies in the lifetime of his mother, of dower even in the reversion of the third of the \u25a0estate assigned.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b375-11\" pgmap=\"375\">4. But the rule is different where the father conveys to the son. In such case the son becomes seized of a present estate in the whole of the premises, subject only to the contingent dower right of his mother in one-third thereof, if she survives the grantor, so that upon the death of such grantee during the life of the widow of the grantor, the wife of such grantee is entitled to dower in the whole premises, subject only to the incumbrance of the prior right of dower in one-third of that estate during the actual continuance of that right.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b375-12\" pgmap=\"375\">5. So, applying these rules to the present case, where a husband, seized -of the fee in land subject to the contingent right of dower in a former wife, who had procured a divorce for his fault, marries again, and dies leaving both the divorced wife and the second wife living, the former will take dower in one-third of the whole, unincumbered, and the latter will be entitled to dower in the whole premises, subject to the incumbrance of the first wife\u2019s prior right of dower during the continuance of that right.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b376-4\" pgmap=\"376\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of St. Clair county; the Hon. -William H.

(Lennahan v. O\u2019Keefe, 107 Ill. 620.) Philip Stahl, a minor, now about \u25a0seventeen years of age, was the sole issue of the marriage, who has, ever since the divorce, been in the sole custody of the said Catharine. The decree of divorce made no provision with respect to the custody of the child. After the divorce \u2022Christian Stahl continued to reside on said premises. On November 11, 1882, he was married to Mary Meyers, and lived with her as his wife, on the premises, until his death, \u2022on July 26, 1884, and ever since his death she has occupied the premises as his widow. There was no issue of this second marriage. Catharine Stahl, the first wife, and Philip Stahl, \u25a0son of the first marriage, suing by Catharine Stahl, his next friend, filed their bill in chancery, claiming, on the part of said Catharine, dower and homestead in said real estate, alleging that Mary Stahl, the second wife, was entitled to dower in the land that should remain after the said Catharine\u2019s dower and homestead had been set off, and praying that the respective dower and homestead rights might be set off accordingly. Mary Stahl\", the second wife, answered, denying that Catharine Stahl was entitled to homestead in the real estate, and filed her cross-bill, setting up the facts of the ease, alleging that she was entitled to dower and to an estate of homestead in the premises, and praying that her dower and homestead might be set off to her. The circuit court decreed that Catharine Stahl was entitled - to a homestead estate in said real \u2022estate of the value of $1000, and to a dower estate in what remained of said premises after said homestead estate had been set off, and that after said homestead and dower estates had been set off to said Catharine Stahl, then the said Mary Stahl was entitled to dower in the land then remaining. Mary Stahl took this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b379-5\" pgmap=\"379(56) 380(340)\">The circuit court erred in its decree as to homestead. Section 5, chapter 52, of the Revised Statutes of 1874, provides : \u201cIn ease of a divorce, the court granting the divorce may dispose of the homestead estate according to the equities of the .case.\u201d Here, the court granting the divorce made no order with respect to the homestead. The disposition of it, therefore, must be as directed by the statute. After the divorce, the homestead estate remained and continued in Christian. Stahl, the householder and owner in fee of the premises. Upon the granting of the divorce, Catharine Stahl\u2019s relation of wife to Christian Stahl was severed,\u2014she then- became entirely disconnected with the homestead estate, and had no right pertaining to any property of Christian Stahl by virtue of having been his wife, except dower saved by the statute, the divorce having been for the misconduct of the husband, and the alimony which was allowed. The Homestead Exemption act provides that no release or conveyance of the homestead estate shall be valid unless the same be in writing,, subscribed by the householder and his or her wife or husband, if having one. Now, if, after the divorce and before his. second marriage, Christian Stahl had been minded to release or convey the homestead, he could have done so by his own deed alone, as he would have had then no wife to join with him in the deed. _Upon death,'the statute declares, \u201csuch, exemption (homestead) shall continue after the death of such householder, for the benefit of the husband or wife surviving, so long as he or she continues to occupy such homestead, \u201d etc. The wife surviving here was Mary Stahl, the second wife, and not Catharine Stahl, the divorced wife. The latter had once-been the wife of Christian Stahl, but she was not his wife-at the time of his death. Our law does not admit the idea of a man having two wives at the same time. The surviving wife of a decedent is the one who was his wife at the time-of his death. Mary Stahl was such one here, occupying the-premises at that time with Christian Stahl, and she is the person for whose benefit the statute says the homestead estate shall continue so long as she continues to occupy the homestead.</p> <p id=\"b380-5\" pgmap=\"380(24) 381(357)\">We are of opinion, too, the decree was erroneous in respect to the extent of the dower right of the second wife. There is a case of dower where the rule which the court adopted would be the correct one,\u2014as, where a son takes land by descent from his father, subject to the dower of his mother in the same, and her dower is afterwards assigned to her, such assignment relates back to the death of -the father so as to prevent the seizin of the son as of a present estate in the third of the premises assigned to the widow of the father; and the legal effect is to deprive the widow of the son, who dies in the lifetime of his mother, of dower even in the reversion of the third of the estate assigned to the mother for dower. But the ease is different where the father conveys to the son. In such case the son becomes seized of a present estate in the whole of the premises, subject only to the contingent dower right of his mother in one-third thereof if she survives the grantor,\u2014so that upon the death of such grantee during the life of the widow of the grantor, the wife of such grantee is entitled to an estate in dower in the whole premises, subject only to the incumbrance of the prior right of dower in one-third of that estate during the actual continuance of that right. (Dunham v. Osborn, 1 Paige, 634; In the matter of Cregier, 1 Barb. Ch. 598; Bear v. Snyder, 11 Wend. 592.) The rule is laid down to the same effect in 4 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, marg. page 64, as follows: \u201cIf A be seized, and has a wife, and sells to B, who has a wife, and the husbands then die leaving their wives surviving, the wife of B will be dowable of one-third of two-thirds in the first instance, and of the one-third of the remaining one-third on the death of the widow of A, who, having the elder title in dower, is to be first satisfied of her dower out of the whole farm. \u201d And see 1 Washburn on Beal. Prop. marg. page 210; Steele v. La Frambois\u2019 Admr. 68 Ill. 456.</p> <p id=\"b381-7\" pgmap=\"381(43) 382(24)\">This, we consider, is the rule which should apply here. Christian Stahl was seized of a present estate in the whole premises, subject only to the contingent right of dower of his first wife in one-third thereof; and the second wife is entitled to dower in the whole premises, subject to the incumbrance of the first wife\u2019s prior right of dower during the continuance of that right.</p> <p id=\"b382-5\" pgmap=\"382\">The decree will be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b382-6\" pgmap=\"382\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
