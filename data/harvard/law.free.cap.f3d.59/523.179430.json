We dismiss for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-18\">Grant filed an excessive force claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988) against several prison officials, alleging that they had violated his First and Eighth Amendment rights. He alleged that a prison official had struck him repeatedly with a metal bar and that two other officials had watched without intervening. Grant had objected to the condition of a meal tray he had received, and he claims that the prison official had physically assaulted and verbally abused him when he motioned to summon a supervisor. At the time of this incident, Grant was assigned to a segregation cell for having assaulted a prison official. After conducting a <em>Spears </em>hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court dismissed Grant\u2019s claims as frivolous. Grant filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-19\">Grant\u2019s appellate brief does little more than restate the relevant factual events leading to his original complaint. Accordingly, the prison officials argue that we should dismiss Grant\u2019s appeal for failure to comply with Rule 28(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although we liberally construe briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants and apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>pro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28. <em>See United States v. Wilkes, </em>20 F.3d 651, 653 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201c[P]ro se litigants, like all other parties, must abide by the Federal Rules of Appellate. Procedure.\u201d); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201c \u2018[Arguments must: be briefed to be preserved.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Price, </em>846 F.2d at 1028)).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-20\">The prison officials argue that Grant has abandoned his appeal by failing to brief any issues. This Court has considered a <em>pro se </em>appellant\u2019s brief despite its technical noncompliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure when it at least argued <em>some </em>error on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>part of the district court. <em>See, e.g., Wilkes, </em>20 F.3d at 653 (considering issue even after criticizing brief for failing to cite to the record for argument that his sentence was improper because \u201cthe superseding information failed to specify the type and quantity of drug he possessed\u201d); <em>Price, </em>846 F.2d at 1028 (addressing issue even though the \u201conly reference appellant makes to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his lawsuit is to assert that \u2018this action is not time barred\u2019 \u201d); <em>Amin, </em>706 F.2d at 640 n. 1 (considering brief because it \u201ccontains an assertion of trial court error\u201d). <em>But see Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224 (holding that plaintiff had abandoned issues because he merely \u201crequest[ed] ... the adoption of previously filed legal and factual arguments in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and in various state court pleadings\u201d). In this case, Grant fails to meet even this minimal requirement. Aside from the implication raised by its existence, his brief does not argue that the district court erred in any way.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">This Court has discretion to consider a noncompliant brief,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and it has allowed <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs to proceed when the plaintiffs noncompliance did not prejudice the opposing party. <em>Price, </em>846 F.2d at 1028.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we look to whether Grant\u2019s noncomplianee with procedural rules caused the prison officials harm or unfair surprise. <em>See Price, </em>846 F.2d at 1028 (finding no prejudice when opponent had addressed all issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The district court dismissed Grant\u2019s complaint on the grounds that it was frivolous. A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 31-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 1733-34, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). Because Grant does not state whether the basis for his challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal is legal, factual, or both, he forced the prison officials to speculate as to the relevant issues when they prepared their own brief. They assumed that Grant intended to argue that his complaint was legally nonfrivolous, and they addressed that question. However, the prison officials did not address the question of factual frivolousness, nor did they address every issue relevant to an evaluation of legal frivolousness. Grant\u2019s failure to articulate any appellate argument therefore deprived the prison officials of their opportunity to address fully all the issues and prejudiced their ability to prepare and present arguments to this Court. Consequently, we will not excuse his noncompliance with Rule 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS Grant\u2019s appeal for want of prosecution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-15\">. <em>See Spears v.
