No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). After review, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-12\">\n<em>I. Underlying State Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-13\">In Alabama state court in 1995, Hunter was charged with, <em>inter alia, </em>murder, first degree armed robbery and burglary, and second degree robbery. Hunter initially pled not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-14\">A <em>Competency Evaluation in 1997</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-15\">In April 1997, Dr. Laurence R. Maier, a licensed psychologist and forensic examiner, conducted a court-ordered assessment to determine Hunter\u2019s competency to stand trial and his mental state at the time of the charged offenses. Dr. Maier\u2019s report concluded that Hunter, though mentally retarded, had \u201cminimal capacity to meet competency requirements\u201d to stand trial and understood the difference between right and wrong at the time of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-16\">According to Dr. Maier\u2019s competency report, Hunter is unable to read or write anything other than his name and received special education services for the eight or nine years of his formal education. In 1995, Hunter was given the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-R that indicated he had a Verbal IQ of 57, a Performance IQ of 59 and a Full Scale IQ of 59. Dr. Maier described these scores as \u201cappreciably low, all falling at the 1st Percentile.\u201d Dr. Maier\u2019s report states, \u201cThus, 99 out of a hundred other people Mr. Hunter\u2019s age would obtain higher IQ scores on the same instrument.\u201d Dr. Maier also noted that Hunter\u2019s full scale score of 59 \u201cfalls at the lower-end of the Mildly Mentally Retarded range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-17\">Dr. Maier found the scores \u201cconsistent with [Hunter\u2019s] overall intellectual presentation\u201d during the assessment and stated that Hunter\u2019s \u201cintellectual slowness is obvious to anyone who talks to him for more than a few moments.\u201d Dr. Maier also admitted he had some difficulties during the assessment \u201cdue to defendant\u2019s Mental Retardation and to a severe expressive speech disorder, present since birth.\u201d The speech disorder, which Dr. Maier described as \u201cexpressive speech aphasia,\u201d caused Hunter to have \u201cextensive slurring, sound omissions, incomplete sentence structure, and some stammering.\u201d Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>Maier noted that when Hunter was emotional, he became \u201ccompletely nonunderstandable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">As for Hunter\u2019s mental retardation, Dr. Maier stated that Hunter\u2019s judgment and insight were <em>\u201cmoderately to severely impaired\u201d </em>and that <em>\u201chis problem-solving skills overall are quite limited.\u201d </em>Based on clinical impressions, Dr. Maier diagnosed Hunter with, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cMental Retardation, Degree Mild, Chronic, Irreversible.\u201d Dr. Maier opined that this condition \u201chas apparently been present lifelong and been accompanied by very poor overall performance personally, vocationally, educationally, and obviously in a social sense as well.\u201d Dr. Maier stated that Hunter was <em>\u201cnot able to junction independently in society\u201d </em>and needed to be in a structured environment where <em>\u201chis limited problem-solving skills will allow for needed maintenance and care from others.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">Although Dr. Maier concluded that Hunter was competent to stand trial, he described Hunter\u2019s understanding of the nature and object of the court proceedings as \u201csimplistic\u201d and noted significant impairments in Hunter\u2019s understanding. For example, Dr. Maier rated Hunter\u2019s \u201cappraisal of available legal defenses,\u201d \u201ccapacity to disclose to his attorney pertinent facts,\u201d \u201cability to meaningfully participate in the planning of legal strategies,\u201d and \u201ccapacity to testify relevantly overall\u201d as \u201cmoderately impaired.\u201d Although Dr. Maier found these impairments to be \u201cfairly significant,\u201d he also thought they could \u201cbe overcome and managed by court patience and attorney explanation and education.\u201d Dr. Maier stated that his \u201cbiggest area of concern\u201d was Hunter\u2019s \u201cability to assist his attorney in his own defense\u201d because of his poor communication skills. Dr. Maier concluded that Hunter was \u201cborderline in his overall competency.\u201d Although normally someone with Hunter\u2019s degree of mental retardation \u201cwould probably not have sufficient understanding,\u201d Dr. Maier opined that, because Hunter had prior experience with the criminal justice system, \u201cwith adequate representation and education, [Hunter] can factually and rationally understand the charge and participate to an adequate degree with his attorney in his own defense.\u201d Dr. Maier concluded, however, that Hunter \u201cwill not be an easy man to legally represent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">\n<em>B. Guilty Plea and Sentence in 1999</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">At some point, Hunter changed his plea to guilty. On January 28, 1999, without conducting a competency hearing, the state court accepted Hunter\u2019s guilty plea. The state court imposed a 40-year sentence on the murder conviction and concurrent 20- and 10-year sentences, respectively, on the first degree armed robbery and burglary and second degree robbery convictions. Hunter did not appeal his convictions, which became final on March 11, 1999, when the time for filing a direct appeal expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">\n<em>II. Three State Collateral Proceedings in 2001 to 2008</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-11\">During 2004 to 2008, Hunter filed <em>pro se </em>three state post-conviction petitions. Hunter filed these petitions through the assistance of prison law clerks, he says, because he \u201ccould not manage his affairs or understand his legal rights and act upon them.\u201d On November 9, 2004, Hunter filed his first state post-conviction petition pursuant to Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. The state court granted the petition as to one claim and denied the petition as to two other claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>10, 2005, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">On November 21, 2005, Hunter filed a second Rule 32 petition in state court. The second petition was dismissed as procedurally defaulted and time-barred. On June 16, 2006, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">On September 6, 2006, Hunter filed a third Rule 32 petition in state court, challenging for the first time his mental competency at the time he entered his guilty plea. The state court denied Hunter\u2019s third Rule 32 petition. On August 20, 2008, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">\n<em>III. Federal \u00a7 2251 Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">On May 9, 2008, Hunter filed <em>pro se </em>the instant \u00a7 2254 petition, asserting that Hunter was \u201ccurrently incompetent\u201d and the state trial court violated his due process rights by failing to hold a competency hearing before accepting his guilty plea. Hunter\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was verified and signed by both Hunter and Brian Heath Harrison, who was identified on the pleading as \u201clegal assistant/paralegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">The state filed an answer, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely because it was filed more than one year after Hunter\u2019s state convictions became final. The district court treated the state\u2019s answer as a motion for summary judgment and notified Hunter of his right to respond. Hunter filed a response that was signed by Hunter and Harrison, the legal assistant/paralegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">A magistrate judge entered a report (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) recommending denial of Hunter\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred under the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations and concluding that Hunter had not shown that the limitations period should be equitably tolled. Hunter filed an objection to the R&amp;R and argued that the AEDPA\u2019s limitation period should be equitably tolled due to his mental deficiencies. Hunter\u2019s objection stated that it was filed \u201cby and through Law Clerk, assigned at J.O. Davis Correctional Facility ....\u201d The objection was also signed by Henry Byrd, who was identified as \u201cLaw Clerk.\u201d Hunter\u2019s objection stated that he had challenged his convictions in state court \u201conly after having the assistance of inmate law clerks because he could not manage his affairs or understand his legal rights and act upon them.\u201d Hunter also \u201cassert[ed] and aver[red], through legal assistance of a law clerk, that his mental retardation prevented him from timely filing his federal habeas petition as to warrant the application of equitable tolling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-13\">The district court adopted the R&amp;R and dismissed Hunter\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred. As to Hunter\u2019s equitable tolling argument, the district court found that Hunter\u2019s \u201callegations [fell] short of establishing mental incompetence that prevented him from submitting his habeas petition in a timely fashion.\u201d The district court also found that Hunter had made only \u201ca conclusory allegation that his mental retardation prevented him from timely filing his habeas petition,\u201d and had not proffered \u201cfactual support showing that he is or ever was actually mentally incompetent or completely unable to understand the nature and object of post-conviction proceedings and to present his case for post-conviction relief in a rational manner.\u201d The district court concluded that because the facts did not suggest that Hunter\u2019s delay in filing his \u00a7 2254 petition was due to \u201chis actual mental incompetence,\u201d Hunter had not shown extraordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>nary circumstances warranting equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Hunter filed this appeal. We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of \u201c[wjhether the district court erred [in] concluding that Hunter\u2019s claim of mental incompetence did not equitably toll the statute of limitations for his petition for the writ of <em>habeas corpus.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">\n<em>IV. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">The AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, which begins to run following one of four events, including, \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). However, \u201c[equitable tolling can be applied to prevent the application of the AEDPA\u2019s statutory deadline ....\u201d <em>Helton v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>259 F.3d 1310, 1312 (11th Cir.2001). Because equitable tolling is \u201can extraordinary remedy,\u201d it \u201cis limited to rare and exceptional circumstances\u201d and \u201ctypically applied sparingly.\u201d <em>Lawrence v. Florida, </em>421 F.3d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir.2005), aff<em>'d, </em>549 U.S. 327, 127 S.Ct. 1079, 166 L.Ed.2d 924 (2007). Thus, we have concluded that equitable tolling is available only \u201c \u2018when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even -with diligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999)). The petitioner bears the burden of showing that equitable tolling is warranted. <em>See Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-9\">In <em>Lawrence, </em>we addressed the issue of whether a petitioner\u2019s \u201cmental incapacity\u201d may, under certain circumstances, justify equitable tolling of the one-year limitations period. <em>See Lawrence, </em>421 F.3d at 1226-27. The petitioner in <em>Lawrence </em>stated that his full scale IQ was 81 and he had \u201csuffered from mental impairments his entire life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227. This Court concluded that these contentions, alone, were \u201cinsufficient to justify equitable tolling\u201d because they did not establish a \u201ccausal connection between [the petitioner\u2019s] alleged mental incapacity and his ability to file a timely petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-10\">In this case, there is no dispute that Hunter filed his \u00a7 2254 petition after the one-year limitations period expired.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And, mental impairment is not <em>per se </em>a reason to toll a statute of limitations. <em>Nara v. Frank, </em>264 F.3d 310, 320 (3d Cir.2001), <em>overruled on other grounds, Merritt v. Blaine, </em>326 F.3d 157, 166 (3d Cir.2003). Rather, as we explained in <em>Lawrence, </em>the alleged mental impairment must have affected the petitioner\u2019s ability to file a timely habeas petition. Thus, in the summary judgment posture of this case, the only question is whether Hunter has presented sufficient evidence to create a factual issue as to a causal connection between his mental incapacity and his ability to file a timely \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-11\">In the district court, Hunter submitted Dr. Maier\u2019s 1997 competency report, which, as recounted above, showed that: (1) Hunter was diagnosed with chronic, irreversible mental retardation; (2) he has a full scale IQ score of 59, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>is at the low-end of the mildly retarded range; (3) his IQ is lower than ninety-nine percent of the population; (4) his mental retardation moderately to severely impairs his judgment, insight and problem-solving skills, which makes him unable to function independently; (5) he is illiterate; and (6) he suffers from severe expressive speech aphasia which makes it difficult for him to communicate intelligibly. In addition, although Dr. Maier ultimately concluded in 1997 that Hunter was \u201cborderline\u201d competent to stand trial, Dr. Maier\u2019s opinion hinged on Hunter\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice process and <em>the fact that Hunter would have access to an attorney ioho could adequately represent and educate him. </em>Indeed, Dr. Maier noted that ordinarily someone with Hunter\u2019s mental condition would not have sufficient understanding to be considered competent and that he only found Hunter competent because he was \u201ccourt wise\u201d <em>and would have access to adequate legal counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">Further, at this juncture, the record establishes that Hunter\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was prepared by other prison inmates assigned to him as legal assistants. Hunter averred that his three prior state Rule 32 petitions were filed with the assistance of prison law clerks, as was his \u00a7 2254 petition, because he is unable to \u201cmanage his affairs or understand his legal rights and act upon them.\u201d And, he averred \u201cthat his mental retardation prevented him from timely filing his federal habeas petition .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">Construing Hunter\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, Hunter claims that his mental retardation prevented him from understanding his rights and obligations under the AEDPA and acting upon them in a timely fashion. Dr. Maier\u2019s 1997 competency report corroborates, rather than contradicts, this claim. Whether a criminal defendant is competent to stand trial with an attorney is a materially different question from whether a habeas petitioner\u2019s undisputed, substantial mental retardation prevented him from filing <em>pro se </em>his \u00a7 2254 petition within the AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. While Hunter did file state post-conviction petitions, it was only with the help of others. And, the record contains no indication that Hunter had prior experience with federal courts or filing a \u00a7 2254 petition. Moreover, Hunter did not have an attorney to assist and educate him. In other words, Hunter did not have the benefit of the two factors that led Dr. Maier to conclude Hunter was \u201cborderline\u201d competent to go to trial despite a significant intellectual handicap that Dr. Maier said \u201c[njormally\u201d would indicate an individual does not have sufficient understanding to be competent. Dr. Maier\u2019s report strongly suggests that Hunter\u2019s well-documented, irreversible mental retardation is severe enough that Hunter, by himself, is not able to understand and comply with the AEDPA\u2019s filing requirements and deadlines. Further, Dr. Maier\u2019s report suggests Hunter would have a very difficult time even assisting others in preparing his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">Because Dr. Maier says Hunter\u2019s mental retardation is significant and irreversible, Dr. Maier\u2019s 1997 report remains probative of Hunter\u2019s mental impairment as to the \u00a7 2254 petition during the limitations period and beyond to 2008. And, the state has offered no evidence in response to Hunter\u2019s averments that he is not able to manage his affairs, he is not able to understand his legal rights or act upon them and his mental retardation prevented him from timely filing a \u00a7 2254 petition. Under the totality of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that Hunter\u2019s evidence, while not sufficient to establish definitively that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled (at all or for how long), is sufficient to raise a factual issue as to whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>causal connection exists between his mental impairment and his ability to file a timely \u00a7 2254 petition, precluding summary judgment at this juncture. Hunter\u2019s claims merit further investigation and factual development of the record. <em>See Nara, </em>264 F.3d at 319-20 (remanding to district court to hold an evidentiary hearing where record indicated petitioner was severely mentally disabled shortly after he arrived in prison and was hospitalized several times, but contained no information as to petitioner\u2019s condition during the time period sought to be tolled).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Hunter\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred and remand to the district court for the appointment of counsel pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A and for further investigation and factual development and proceedings on the merits of Hunter\u2019s equitable tolling claim. We leave to the district court\u2019s discretion how best to develop the record. <em>See </em>Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases 6, 7 &amp; 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">. The state court granted Hunter post-conviction relief on his claim that the trial court was without authority to accept Hunter\u2019s guilty plea to second degree robbery because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>indictment did not allege that Hunter was aided by another person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">.
