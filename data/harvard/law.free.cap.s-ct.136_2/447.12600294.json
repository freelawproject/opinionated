Because the Second Amendment confers rights upon individual citizens-not state governments-it was doubly wrong for the Seventh Circuit to delegate to States and localities the power to decide which firearms people may possess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lastly, the Seventh Circuit considered \"whether law-abiding citizens retain adequate means of self-defense,\" and reasoned that the City's ban was permissible because \"[i]f criminals can find substitutes for banned assault weapons, then so can law-abiding homeowners.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180744\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/406/#p410\">\n    784 F.3d, at 410, 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The question under\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   is not whether citizens have adequate alternatives available for self-defense. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   asks whether the law bans types of firearms commonly used for a lawful purpose-regardless of whether alternatives exist.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    554 U.S., at 627-629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
