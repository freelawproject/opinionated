Certiorari was granted in this case to resolve the question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner is Henry Montgomery. In 1963, Montgomery killed Charles Hurt, a deputy sheriff in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Montgomery was 17 years old at the time of the crime. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, but the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed his conviction after finding that public prejudice had prevented a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under Louisiana law, this verdict required the trial court to impose a sentence of life without parole. The sentence was automatic upon the jury's verdict, so Montgomery had no opportunity to present mitigation evidence to justify a less severe sentence. That evidence might have included Montgomery's young age at the time of the crime; expert testimony regarding his limited capacity for foresight, self-discipline, and judgment; and his potential for rehabilitation. Montgomery, now 69 years old, has spent almost his entire life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Almost 50 years after Montgomery was first taken into custody, this Court decided\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

In Louisiana there are two principal mechanisms for collateral challenge to the lawfulness of imprisonment. Each begins with a filing in the trial court where the prisoner was convicted and sentenced. La.Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Arts. 882, 926 (West 2008). The first procedure permits a prisoner to file an application for postconviction relief on one or more of seven grounds set forth in the statute. Art. 930.3. The Louisiana Supreme Court has held that none of those grounds provides a basis for collateral review of sentencing errors. See\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Melinie v. State,\n   </em>\n   93-1380 (La.1/12/96),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441032\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/665/1172/\">\n    665 So.2d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ). Sentencing errors must instead be raised through Louisiana's second collateral review procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This second mechanism allows a prisoner to bring a collateral attack on his or her sentence by filing a motion to correct an illegal sentence. See Art. 882. Montgomery invoked this procedure in the East Baton Rouge Parish District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The state statute provides that \"[a]n illegal sentence may be corrected at any time by the court that imposed the sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . An illegal sentence \"is primarily restricted to those instances in which the\n   <em>\n    term\n   </em>\n   of the prisoner's sentence is not authorized by the statute or statutes which govern the penalty\" for the crime of conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v. Mead,\n   </em>\n   2014-1051, p. 3 (La.App. 4 Cir. 4/22/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6873677\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/165/1044/\">\n    165 So.3d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1047 ; see also\n   <em>\n    State v. Alexander,\n   </em>\n   2014-0401 (La.11/7/14),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896188\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/137/\">\n    152 So.3d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ). In the ordinary course Louisiana courts will not consider a challenge to a disproportionate sentence on collateral review; rather, as a general matter, it appears that prisoners must raise Eighth Amendment sentencing challenges on direct review. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Gibbs,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7469895\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/620/296/#p296\">\n    620 So.2d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 296-297 (La.App.1993) ;\n   <em>\n    Mead,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6873677\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/165/1044/\">\n    165 So.3d, at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Louisiana's collateral review courts will, however, consider a motion to correct\n   an illegal sentence based on a decision of this Court holding that the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution prohibits a punishment for a type of crime or a class of offenders.

See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Chief Justice Johnson and Justice Hughes dissented in\n   <em>\n    Tate\n   </em>\n   , and Chief Justice Johnson again noted her dissent in Montgomery's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court granted Montgomery's petition for certiorari.

To ensure this conclusion is correct, the Court appointed Richard D. Bernstein as\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   to brief and argue the position that the Court lacks jurisdiction. He has ably discharged his assigned responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   argues that a State is under no obligation to give a new rule of constitutional law retroactive effect in its own collateral review proceedings. As those proceedings are created by state law and under the State's plenary control,\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   contends, it is for state courts to define applicable principles of retroactivity. Under this view, the Louisiana Supreme Court's decision does not implicate a federal right; it only determines the scope of relief available in a particular type of state proceeding-a question of state law beyond this Court's power to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   If, however, the Constitution establishes a rule and requires that the rule have retroactive application, then a state court's refusal to give the rule retroactive effect is reviewable by this Court.

Writing for the Court in\n   <em>\n    United States Coin &amp; Currency,\n   </em>\n   Justice Harlan made this point when he declared that \"[n]o circumstances call more for the invocation of a rule of complete retroactivity\" than when \"the conduct being penalized is constitutionally immune from punishment.\" 401 U.S., at 724,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714784\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/715/#p724\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States Coin &amp; Currency\n   </em>\n   involved a case on direct review; yet, for the reasons explained in this opinion, the same principle should govern the application of substantive rules on collateral review.

Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, state collateral review courts have no greater power than federal habeas courts to mandate that a prisoner continue to suffer punishment barred by the Constitution.

Nowhere in\n   <em>\n    Siebold\n   </em>\n   did this Court intimate that relief was constitutionally required-or as the\n   majority puts it, that a court would have had \"no authority\" to leave in place Siebold's conviction,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 730 - 731.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The majority's sorry acknowledgment that \"\n   <em>\n    Siebold\n   </em>\n   and the other cases discussed in this opinion, of course, do not directly control the question the Court now answers for the first time,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   is not nearly enough of a disclaimer. It is not just that they \"do not directly control,\" but that the dicta cherry picked from those cases are irrelevant; they addressed circumstances fundamentally different from those to which the majority now applies them. Indeed, we know for sure that the author of some of those dicta, Justice Harlan, held views that flatly contradict the majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The majority's maxim that \"state collateral review courts have no greater power than federal habeas courts to mandate that a prisoner continue to suffer punishment barred by the Constitution,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 731, begs the question rather than contributes to its solution. Until today, no federal court was\n   <em>\n    constitutionally obliged\n   </em>\n   to grant relief for the past violation of a newly announced substantive rule. Until today, it was Congress's prerogative to do away with\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   's exceptions altogether. Indeed, we had left unresolved the question whether Congress had already done that when it amended a section of the habeas corpus statute to add backward-looking language governing the review of state-court decisions. See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, \u00a7 104,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201219\">\n    110 Stat. 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Greene,\n   </em>\n   565 U.S., at ----, n.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12444041,12185765\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/132/38/\">\n    132 S.Ct., at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n. A maxim shown to be more relevant to this case, by the analysis that the majority omitted, is this: The Supremacy Clause does not impose upon state courts a constitutional obligation it fails to impose upon federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   All that remains to support the majority's conclusion is that all-purpose Latin canon:\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   . The majority opines that because a substantive rule eliminates a State's power to proscribe certain conduct or impose a certain punishment, it has \"the automatic consequence of invalidating a defendant's conviction or sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 730. What provision of the Constitution could conceivably produce such a result? The Due Process Clause? It surely cannot be a denial of due process for a court to pronounce a final judgment which, though fully in accord with federal constitutional law at the time, fails to anticipate a change to be made by this Court half a century into the future. The Equal Protection Clause? Both statutory and (increasingly) constitutional laws change. If it were a denial of equal protection to hold an earlier defendant to a law more stringent than what exists today, it would also be a denial of equal protection to hold a later defendant to a law more stringent than what existed 50 years ago. No principle of equal protection requires the criminal law of all ages to be the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The majority grandly asserts that \"[t]here is no grandfather clause that permits States to\n   <em>\n    enforce punishments the Constitution forbids\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 731 (emphasis added). Of course the italicized phrase begs the question. There most certainly is a grandfather clause-one we have called\n   <em>\n    finality\n   </em>\n   -which says that the Constitution does not require States to revise punishments that were lawful when they were imposed. Once a conviction has become final, whether new rules or old ones will be applied to revisit the conviction is a matter entirely within the State's control; the Constitution has nothing to say about that choice. The majority says that there is no \"possibility of a valid result\" when a new substantive rule is not\n   applied retroactively.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 729 - 730. But the whole controversy here arises because many think there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a valid result when a defendant has been convicted under the law that existed when his conviction became final. And the States are unquestionably entitled to take that view of things.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The majority's imposition of\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   's first exception upon the States is all the worse because it does not adhere to that exception as initially conceived by Justice Harlan-an exception for rules that \"place, as a matter of constitutional interpretation, certain kinds of primary, private individual\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe.\"\n   <em>\n    Mackey,\n   </em>\n   401 U.S., at 692,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714690\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/667/#p692\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Rather, it endorses the exception as expanded by\n   <em>\n    Penry,\n   </em>\n   to include \"rules prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214810\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/302/#p330\">\n    492 U.S., at 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214810\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/302/#p330\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That expansion empowered and obligated federal (and after today state) habeas courts to invoke this Court's Eighth Amendment \"evolving standards of decency\" jurisprudence to upset punishments that were constitutional when imposed but are \"cruel and unusual,\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 8, in our newly enlightened society.

The \"evolving standards\" test concedes that in 1969 the State had the power to punish Henry Montgomery as it did. Indeed, Montgomery could at that time have been sentenced to death by our yet unevolved society. Even 20 years later, this Court reaffirmed that the Constitution posed no bar to death sentences for juveniles.\n   <em>\n    Stanford v.

Not until our People's \"standards of decency\" evolved a mere 10 years ago-nearly 40 years after Montgomery's sentence was imposed-did this Court declare the death penalty unconstitutional for juveniles.\n   <em>\n    Roper v.

Even then, the Court reassured States that \"the punishment of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is itself a severe sanction,\" implicitly still available for juveniles.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/#p573\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/#p573\">\n    at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/#p573\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And again five years ago this Court left in place this severe sanction for juvenile homicide offenders.\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

So for the five decades Montgomery has spent in prison, not one of this Court's precedents called into question the legality of his sentence-until the People's \"standards of decency,\" as perceived by five Justices, \"evolved\" yet again in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   's central purpose was to do away with the old regime's tendency to \"\n   <em>\n    continually\n   </em>\n   force the States to marshal resources in order to keep in prison defendants whose trials and appeals conformed to then-existing constitutional standards.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/\">\n    489 U.S., at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Today's holding thwarts that purpose with a vengeance. Our ever-evolving Constitution changes the rules of \"cruel and unusual punishments\" every few years. In the passage from\n   <em>\n    Mackey\n   </em>\n   that the majority's opinion quotes,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 731 - 732, Justice Harlan noted the diminishing force of finality (and hence the equitable propriety-not the constitutional requirement-of disregarding it) when the law punishes nonpunishable\n   <em>\n    conduct,\n   </em>\n   see 401 U.S., at 693,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714690\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/667/#p692\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But one cannot imagine a clearer frustration of the sensible policy of\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   when the ever-moving target of impermissible\n   <em>\n    punishments\n   </em>\n   is at issue. Today's holding not only forecloses Congress from eliminating this expansion of\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   in federal courts, but also foists this distortion upon the States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   II. The Retroactivity of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Having created jurisdiction by ripping\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   's first exception from its moorings,\n   converting an equitable rule governing federal habeas relief to a constitutional command governing state courts as well, the majority proceeds to the merits. And here it confronts a second obstacle to its desired outcome.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the opinion it wishes to impose upon state postconviction courts, simply does not decree what the first part of the majority's opinion says\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   's first exception requires to be given retroactive effect: a rule \"set[ting] forth\n   <em>\n    categorical\n   </em>\n   constitutional guarantees that place certain criminal laws and punishments\n   <em>\n    altogether\n   </em>\n   beyond the State's power to impose.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 729 (emphasis added). No problem. Having distorted\n   <em>\n    Teague,\n   </em>\n   the majority simply proceeds to rewrite\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The majority asserts that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   \"rendered life without parole an unconstitutional penalty for 'a class of defendants because of their status'-that is, juvenile offenders whose crimes reflect the transient immaturity of youth.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 734. It insists that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   barred life-without-parole sentences \"for all but the rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility. For that reason,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is no less substantive than are\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 734. The problem is that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   stated, quite clearly, precisely the opposite: \"Our decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime-as, for example, we did in\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   . Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer\n   <em>\n    follow a certain process\n   </em>\n   -considering an offender's youth and attendant characteristics-before imposing a particular penalty.\" 567 U.S., at ----, 132 S.Ct., at 2471 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   To contradict that clear statement, the majority opinion quotes passages from\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   that assert such things as \"mandatory life-without-parole sentences for children 'pos[e] too great a risk of disproportionate punishment' \" and \" 'appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 733 - 734 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller, supra,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 132 S.Ct., at 2469 ). But to say that a punishment might be inappropriate and disproportionate for certain juvenile offenders is not to say that it is unconstitutionally void. All of the statements relied on by the majority do nothing more than express the\n   <em>\n    reason\n   </em>\n   why the new, youth-protective\n   <em>\n    procedure\n   </em>\n   prescribed by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is desirable: to deter life sentences for certain juvenile offenders. On the issue of whether\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   rendered life-without-parole penalties unconstitutional, it is impossible to get past\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's unambiguous statement that \"[o]ur decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders\" and \"mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process ... before imposing a particular penalty.\" 567 U.S., at ----, 132 S.Ct., at 2471. It is plain as day that the majority is not applying\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , but rewriting it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   And the rewriting has consequences beyond merely making\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's procedural guarantee retroactive. If, indeed, a State is categorically prohibited from imposing life without parole on juvenile offenders whose crimes do not \"reflect permanent incorrigibility,\" then even when the procedures that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   demands are provided the constitutional requirement is not necessarily satisfied. It remains available for\n   the defendant sentenced to life without parole to argue that his crimes did not in fact \"reflect permanent incorrigibility.\" Or as the majority's opinion puts it: \"That\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   did not impose a formal factfinding requirement does not leave States free to sentence a child\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   whose crime reflects transient immaturity to life without parole. To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   established that this punishment is disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 735.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   How wonderful. Federal and (like it or not) state judges are henceforth to resolve the knotty \"legal\" question: whether a 17-year-old who murdered an innocent sheriff's deputy half a century ago was at the time of his trial \"incorrigible.\" Under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , bear in mind, the inquiry is whether the inmate was seen to be incorrigible when he was sentenced-not whether he has proven corrigible and so can safely be paroled today. What silliness. (And how impossible in practice, see Brief for National District Attorneys Assn. et al. as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   9-17.) When in\n   <em>\n    Lockett v.

And, fairly read,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   did the same. Not so with the \"incorrigibility\" requirement that the Court imposes today to make\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   retroactive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   But have no fear. The majority does not seriously expect state and federal collateral-review tribunals to engage in this silliness, probing the evidence of \"incorrigibility\" that existed decades ago when defendants were sentenced. What the majority expects (and intends) to happen is set forth in the following not-so-subtle invitation: \"A State may remedy a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 736. Of course. This whole exercise, this whole distortion of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , is just a devious way of eliminating life without parole for juvenile offenders. The Court might have done that expressly (as we know, the Court can decree\n   <em>\n    anything\n   </em>\n   ), but that would have been something of an embarrassment. After all, one of the justifications the Court gave for decreeing an end to the death penalty for murders (no matter how many) committed by a juvenile was that life without parole was a severe enough punishment. See\n   <em>\n    Roper,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/#p573\">\n    543 U.S., at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/#p573\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . How could the majority-in an opinion written by the very author of\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   -now say\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   punishment is\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional? The Court expressly refused to say so in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . 567 U.S., at ----, 132 S.Ct., at 2469. So the Court refuses again today, but merely makes imposition of that severe sanction a practical impossibility. And then, in Godfather fashion, the majority makes state legislatures an offer they can't refuse: Avoid all the utterly impossible nonsense we have prescribed by simply \"permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 736.

See Bator,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 473-474, and n. 77. If the Constitution prevented courts from enforcing a void conviction or sentence even after the conviction is final, this Court would have been incapable of withdrawing relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court's purported constitutional right to retroactivity on collateral review has no grounding even in our modern precedents. In the 1950's, this Court began recognizing many new constitutional rights in criminal proceedings. Even then, however, the Court did not perceive any constitutional right for prisoners to vacate their convictions or sentences on collateral review based on the Court's new interpretations of the Constitution. To the contrary, the Court derived\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and the exclusionary rule from the Constitution, yet drew the line at creating a constitutional right to retroactivity.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Linkletter v.

Even then,\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   was a directive only to courts on\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   review. It held that \"a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 328,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6215700\" index=\"406\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/314/#p328\">\n    107 S.Ct. 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It said nothing about what happens once a case becomes final. That was resolved in\n   <em>\n    Teague v.

If, as the Court supposes, the Constitution bars courts from insisting that prisoners remain in prison when their convictions or sentences are later deemed unconstitutional, why can courts let stand a judgment that wrongly decided any constitutional question?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court confronted this question when\n   <em>\n    Siebold\n   </em>\n   and other cases began expanding the federal habeas statute to encompass claims that a sentence or conviction was constitutionally void. But the Court could not find a satisfactory answer: \"A judgment may be erroneous and not void, and it may be erroneous\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   it is void. The distinctions ... are very nice, and they may fall under the one class or the other as they are regarded for different purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Lange,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3426585\" index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/85/163/#p175\">\n    18 Wall. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175-176,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3426585\" index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/85/163/#p175\">\n    21 L.Ed. 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1874).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The lack of any limiting principle became apparent as the Court construed the federal habeas statute to supply jurisdiction to address prerequisites to a valid sentence or conviction (like an indictment). See Bator, 76 Harv. L. Rev., at 467-468, and n. 56, 471. As Justice Bradley,\n   <em>\n    Siebold\n   </em>\n   's author, later observed for the Court: \"It is difficult to see why a conviction and punishment under an unconstitutional law is more violative of a person's constitutional rights, than an unconstitutional conviction and punishment under a valid law.\"\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nielsen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5698295\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/131/176/#p183\">\n    131 U.S. 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 183,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5698507,5698295\" index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/9/672/\">\n    9 S.Ct. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5698295\" index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/131/176/#p183\">\n    33 L.Ed. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1889).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   I doubt that today's rule will fare any better. By refashioning\n   <em>\n    Siebold\n   </em>\n   as the foundation of a purported constitutional right, the Court transforms an unworkable doctrine into an immutable command. Because Justice Bradley's dicta in\n   <em>\n    Siebold\n   </em>\n   was a gloss on the 1789 Judiciary Act, Congress could at least supply a fix to it. But the Court's reinvention of\n   <em>\n    Siebold\n   </em>\n   as a constitutional imperative eliminates any room for legislative adjustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   There is one silver lining to today's ruling: States still have a way to mitigate its impact on their court systems. As the Court explains, States must enforce a constitutional right to remedies on collateral review only if such proceedings are \"open to a claim controlled by federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 731. State courts, on collateral review, thus must provide remedies for claims under\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama,\n   </em>\n   567 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), only if those courts are open to \"claims that a decision of this Court has rendered certain sentences illegal ... under the Eighth Amendment.\" See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 732.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Unlike the rule the Court announces today, this limitation at least reflects a constitutional principle. Only when state courts have chosen to entertain a federal claim can the Supremacy Clause conceivably command a state court to apply federal law. As we explained last Term, private parties have no \"constitutional ... right to enforce federal laws against the States.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong,\n   </em>\n   575 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 1383. Instead, the Constitution leaves the initial choice to entertain federal claims up to state courts, which are \"tribunals over which the government of the Union has no adequate control, and which may be closed to any claim asserted under a law of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Osborn v. Bank of United\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1421282\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/22/738/#p821\">\n    9 Wheat. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 821,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1421282\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/22/738/#p821\">\n    6 L.Ed. 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1824).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   States therefore have a modest path to lessen the burdens that today's decision will inflict on their courts. States can stop entertaining claims alleging that this Court's Eighth Amendment decisions invalidated a sentence, and leave federal habeas courts to shoulder the burden of adjudicating such claims in the first instance. Whatever the desirability of that choice, it is one the Constitution allows States to make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Today's decision repudiates established principles of finality. It finds no support in the Constitution's text, and cannot be reconciled with our Nation's tradition of considering the availability of postconviction remedies a matter about which the Constitution has nothing to say.
