(Pen. Code, \u00a7 273.5, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury also found true the allegations that defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury under circumstances involving domestic violence (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (e)) and personally used a deadly weapon, a knife, in the commission of the offense (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)). The trial court sentenced defendant to six years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred by (1) allowing the jury to conduct an experiment during deliberations, and (2) allowing the jury to reenact the stabbing of the victim without allowing defendant to be personally present during that stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We deem defendant\u2019s first contention regarding the jury\u2019s experiment to be forfeited for lack of objection in the trial court. With regard to defendant\u2019s second contention, we conclude that a defendant has no right to invade a jury\u2019s deliberations by being personally present during an attempt to reenact the events described by witness testimony. After requesting briefing from the parties on the issue of defendant\u2019s entitlement to presentence custody credits amounting to almost 50 percent of his actual days in custody, we conclude that the abstract of judgment errs in listing the number of presentence conduct credits. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction but order the correction of the abstract of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">\n<em>Prosecution Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Late in the evening on October 10, 2009, defendant was cooking dinner with his girlfriend, Ameresh Singh.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When they were finished cooking, Ameresh took a shower. Returning from the bathroom, Ameresh entered the kitchen where she saw defendant using a knife to chop cabbage, lettuce, and tomatoes for a salad. Ameresh twice asked him, \u201cShall we start with dinner?\u201d Defendant responded neither time. When she turned around to find out why he was not responding to her questions, she saw defendant about to fall. At the time, chronic pains in his legs required defendant to use crutches for walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Before defendant fell, Ameresh rushed over to grab him. She held him in a \u201cbear hug\u201d to keep him up. Ameresh then \u201csensed\u201d something wet. She turned to see her reflection in a window and saw that she had blood on her T-shirt and a wound on her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Ameresh grabbed her car keys. Defendant told her, \u201cLet me take you to the hospital.\u201d Ameresh responded, \u201cNo. You stay here. I\u2019ll go.\u201d Defendant walked with her to the car where he announced, \u201cI\u2019m going to hang myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Ameresh drove to the house of Minesh Kumar, who had been her friend at work before she quit her job to take care of defendant. While driving, Ameresh noticed that her arm was hurting. When she looked, she saw that her arm was bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>There was no answer when Ameresh knocked on Kumar\u2019s door. She let herself in and called out to him. Kumar went over to her and asked, \u201cWho did this?\u201d Ameresh named defendant and said that someone should be sent to help defendant because he was going to hang himself. Kumar called 911 and reported, \u201cI think her boyfriend cut her throat.\u201d When a police officer arrived at Kumar\u2019s house, he reported that defendant was going to hang himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Police officers were dispatched to defendant\u2019s house to check on him. The officers found blood inside and outside the house\u2014leading from the kitchen, past the outside steps, and to the street. When defendant was asked about blood on his shirt, he responded \u201cthat he was okay.\u201d One of the officers asked, \u201cWell, what is that, then?\u201d And, defendant \u201csaid that it was his wife\u2019s blood.\u201d Defendant also explained that \u201cthings weren\u2019t going very well between him and his wife\u201d because \u201cshe was dating another man.\u201d Earlier that evening, Ameresh \u201chad gone to the kitchen to get food and stated that she was getting food to take to her other boyfriend.\u201d Defendant told the police that \u201c[h]e told her he wasn\u2019t okay with that.\u201d Defendant also \u201csaid something\u201d to the officers \u201cabout being angry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Defendant told the officers that Ameresh had picked up a knife and came at him with it. Defendant then \u201cgrabbed a hold of her and struggled with her over the knife.\u201d Defendant stated that he was able to grab the knife but did not know how Ameresh\u2019s throat got cut. Defendant described her injury as an accident but could not explain why he did not call anyone to help her.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Defendant told another officer at the scene, \u201cNo, it\u2019s my wife\u2019s blood. She was swinging a knife at me. I took it from her and I cut her throat.\u201d Defendant \u201cinitially had thought about killing himself and then decided not to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Ameresh\u2019s treating physician testified that the victim received \u201ca very large laceration across her neck\u201d in addition to \u201ctwo lacerations to her shoulder.\u201d The laceration on the neck was a \u201cbig gaping open wound\u201d approximately six centimeters in length. Her physician initially examined the wound, concerned that it had the potential to be lethal. The physician testified that Ameresh \u201cstated that her boyfriend stabbed her\u201d with a knife. Ameresh also stated that defendant twice stabbed her shoulder and hit her on the right cheek. However, she added that she did not want the police to be called.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">At trial, Ameresh denied that defendant attacked her. Her denials were contradicted by a victim advocate, who spoke with Ameresh on October 14, 2009. The victim advocate testified that Ameresh stated, \u201cshe went to the kitchen sink to wash her hands and the defendant came up from behind her\u201d and then \u201ccut her on her neck, from the left side of her neck.\u201d Ameresh said that defendant cut her \u201c[fjrom the left to the center.\u201d She looked down to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u201cblood rushing down.\u201d Ameresh said, \u201cshe was afraid she was going to die because she was bleeding profusely.\u201d She stated, \u201c[s]he was also afraid that defendant would get arrested for that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>Defense Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Defendant testified on his own behalf, explaining that he and Ameresh were making chicken curry for a late dinner on October 10, 2009. Ameresh cooked the chicken and made tortillas. When dinner was ready, defendant went to the kitchen table to make a salad as Ameresh had instructed. Ameresh came into the kitchen while defendant was standing at the table. Defendant turned around to reach for a bowl from a nearby cabinet. When he tried to move his chair to reach one of his crutches, the chair slipped and he began to lose balance. Defendant called out to Ameresh and tried to grab onto her shoulder. Defendant remembered her holding him tightly. He then saw her throat was cut open, and he said to her, \u201cYou got hurt from the knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Defendant grabbed his crutches and walked outside with Ameresh following him. Defendant said they had to go to the hospital. Ameresh replied that she was going to the hospital on her own, and defendant responded, \u201c[I]f something [is] going to happen to you, then I\u2019ll hang myself.\u201d Defendant went back inside, sat down, and drank a can of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">At trial, defendant denied telling the police that \u201cthings were not good\u201d between Ameresh and him. Defendant also denied telling the officers that Ameresh came at him with a knife and that they had struggled. Instead, defendant testified he told the officers that her injuries had been accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Defendant acknowledged Ameresh\u2019s friendship with Kumar, but testified that he was not upset about her visits to Kumar\u2019s house. Defendant encouraged her to use Kumar\u2019s computer to gain the skills necessary to secure a better job.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Defendant admitted that Ameresh had come to visit him in jail approximately twice a week and that they had spoken about the case <em>\u201ca </em>little.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">\n<em>Experimentation by the Jury</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Right to be Personally Present During Critical Stages of the Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Defendant argues that, even if the jury had the prerogative to reenact the stabbing, he had a constitutional right to be personally present during the jury\u2019s attempt to replicate the events leading to Ameresh\u2019s injuries. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Under the Sixth Amendment, criminal defendants have the right to be personally present during critical stages of the proceedings against them. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Santos </em>(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 965, 972 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 1] <em>(Santos).) </em>However, \u201c \u2018a criminal defendant does not have a right to be personally present at a particular proceeding unless his appearance is necessary to prevent \u201cinterference with [his] opportunity for effective cross-examination.\u201d [Citations.] [f] Similarly, under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, a criminal defendant does not have a right to be personally present at a particular proceeding unless he finds himself at a \u201cstage . . . that is critical to [the] outcome\u201d and \u201chis presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(People v. Waidla </em>[(2000)] 22 Cal.4th [690,] 741-742 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46].)\u201d <em>(Santos, </em>supra, at pp. 972-973.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Although jury deliberations are a critically important part of the trial of a defendant, a defendant\u2019s right to be present has been greatly limited by the courts. The California Supreme Court has held that rereading of testimony to the jury does not constitute a stage of the proceeding for which a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be present. <em>(People v. Avila </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 598 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 133 P.3d 1076].) So too, the Sixth Amendment does not require that the defendant be present during the jury\u2019s viewing of a crime scene. <em>(People v. Moon </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 1, 20 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 894, 117 P3d 591].) And, in <em>Santos, </em>the Court of Appeal held that allowing a jury to depart by a private exit did not violate a defendant\u2019s right to be personally present. <em>(Santos, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th at pp. 972-974.)  In harmony with this authority, we conclude that a criminal defendant does not have a Sixth Amendment right to be personally present during jury deliberations even when the deliberations include reenactment of the circumstance described by testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>A jury\u2019s use of an exhibit admitted into evidence to reenact the events described by testimony constitutes a legitimate part of deliberations. <em>(People v. Cumpian </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 307, 310, 315 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 861] [rejecting claim of jury misconduct after jurors tried on a duffel bag to see whether its fit and shape supported the defendant\u2019s contention that he did not intend to commit robbery by swinging the bag at the security guard of the store from which he stole it].) Manipulation of an exhibit in evidence does not constitute receipt of new evidence such that a defendant has a right to be personally present during its reception. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 315 [holding that \u201cjury\u2019s use of the exhibit did not invade <em>new fields </em>nor did their experiment with the duffel bag involve matters not within the scope and purview of the evidence\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">A defendant has no right to intrude on jury deliberations simply to observe. As our high court has noted, \u201cCalifornia courts have recognized the need to protect the sanctity of jury deliberations. <em>(People v. McIntyre </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 229, 232, fn. 1 [271 Cal.Rptr. 467] [\u2018The secrecy of jury deliberations should be closely guarded\u2019]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Talkington </em>(1935) 8 Cal.App.2d 75, 85-86 [47 P.2d 368] [recognizing \u2018the secrecy that should surround the deliberations of the jury\u2019], disapproved on another ground in <em>People v. Friend </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 570, 578 [327 P.2d 97].) . . . [Section 167 makes it a misdemeanor to eavesdrop upon or record jury deliberations without the jury\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>(People v. Cleveland </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 466, 475 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 313, 21 P.3d 1225], fn. omitted.) Thus, trial courts are charged with keeping juries \u201cfree from outside attempts at intimidation.\u201d <em>(Williams v. Florida </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 78, 100 [26 L.Ed.2d 446, 90 S.Ct. 1893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Defendant was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to be personally present during a critical stage of the proceedings on grounds that he was not allowed to observe the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\"><em>Presentence Custody </em>Credits<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The judgment is affirmed. The superior court clerk is to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment reflecting that defendant is entitled to a total of 43 days of presentence custody credits, and to forward a certified copy to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Nicholson, Acting P. J., and Robie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 22, 2012, S203750.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\"> Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\"> For the sake of convenience and to avoid confusion, we refer to Ameresh Singh by her first name. Although defendant referred to the victim as his wife, Ameresh testified that they were not married.
