Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)) and one count of receiving stolen property <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 496, subd. (a)) and was sentenced to full consecutive terms on the rape counts. (Further undesignated section references are to the Penal Code.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-11\">He appeals, contending (1) defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to evidence of prior uncharged acts of violence amounted to ineffective assistance; (2) the legal standard for imposing full consecutive sentences under section 667.6, subdivision (d), where multiple sex offenses occur on \u201cseparate occasions\u201d is unconstitutionally vague; (3) he was denied the right to a jury trial on whether the three rapes occurred on separate occasions; and (4) there is insufficient evidence of one of the three rapes or, in the alternative, the trial court erred in failing to instruct on the definition of sexual intercourse necessary for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>We requested supplemental briefing on two additional issues: (5) whether the trial court provided an adequate statement of reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences on the three rape offenses and (6) whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that the three rapes occurred on separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">We reject each of defendant\u2019s contentions. However, we conclude the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s implied finding that the third rape occurred on a separate occasion. We therefore remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">During much of 2008, defendant and the victim, Jenna B., were in a dating relationship. In May of that year, defendant assisted the victim in moving out of her dormitory room at California State University, Chico. Another student, K.S., was moving out of her dorm room around the same time. At one point, K.S. left the door to her room open slightly while she took things to her car. Inside the room, she left a large black purse containing, among other things, a laptop computer. When K.S. returned to her room, the purse and its contents were gone. Sometime later, defendant gave the purse to the victim as a gift and sold the computer to his roommate for $500. At the time of the sale, defendant knew the computer had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">On October 18, 2008, defendant and the victim were together at her residence and got into an argument about defendant eating the rest of a banana bread she had made and calling the victim \u201ca fat Arab bitch,\u201d \u201cslut,\u201d and \u201cwhore.\u201d The victim asked defendant to leave and dropped him off at his residence. Around midnight, the victim sent defendant a text message inviting him to come over and sleep with her. Defendant responded with a message that it was \u201cup to [her].\u201d The victim replied, \u201cnever mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">Nevertheless, around 2:00 a.m. on October 19, defendant showed up at the victim\u2019s residence and knocked on her bedroom window. The victim woke up and let him in. Defendant was belligerent and angry. The victim asked him to leave, but he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-10\">Around this time, defendant got a telephone call from his ex-girlfriend who asked where defendant had been. Defendant responded that he had \u201cbeen dating a fucking slut.\u201d The victim again asked defendant to leave but he refused. He grabbed the victim\u2019s cell phone and tried to break it and then lay down on the floor to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">The victim grabbed defendant\u2019s leg and began dragging him out of her room. Defendant started kicking the victim and she kicked him back. Defendant stood up and overturned a nightstand and chair. He threatened to knock the victim out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>A week or so earlier, the victim had told defendant she might be pregnant and he appeared to be pleased at the prospect. However, the victim later learned she was not pregnant. While arguing with defendant in her room during the early morning hours of October 19, the victim told defendant that if she had been pregnant, she would have aborted the fetus. She was purposely trying to hurt him in order to induce him to leave, but he would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">The victim eventually screamed for her roommate, J.D., who opened her bedroom door and found defendant and the victim standing nearby. The victim was crying and complained that defendant had her cell phone. J.D. told defendant to give the victim back her phone and he complied. J.D. returned to her room and closed the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">The victim and defendant returned to her room, where the victim attempted to call 911. Defendant grabbed her phone and took the battery out of it. The victim later went to sleep in her room and defendant slept on a couch in the common area of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">The next morning, defendant knocked on the victim\u2019s door and she let him in. She returned to her bed. Defendant was still upset and she asked him to leave. He refused. The victim asked for her phone battery and defendant told her she could have it after she gave him a ride home. She refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">Defendant approached the victim\u2019s bed and pulled her toward the middle of it. He grabbed her foot and pushed it behind her head. He got on the bed and placed his body on top of her. The victim was wearing only panties and a T-shirt. Defendant began ripping the victim\u2019s panties and eventually pulled them down over her legs, while the victim struggled to stop him. Defendant \u201cshoved\u201d his finger inside the victim\u2019s vagina and said he would make it so she could not have babies. Defendant was smiling and appeared to be enjoying himself. He then removed his finger and inserted it in her anus. The victim told defendant to stop and he responded, \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">Defendant removed his finger, stood up and said, \u201cI can put my dick in you right now.\u201d Defendant removed his clothes, got on top of the victim, held her legs back with his hands, and inserted his penis in her vagina. She begged him to stop and he again said, \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cHow does it feel to be the first girl I raped?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">Defendant pulled his penis out of the victim\u2019s vagina and told her to turn over. She refused. He told her she had a choice between her \u201cass\u201d and her mouth. She then complied. Defendant inserted his penis inside the victim again, while holding her neck with one hand and her hair with the other. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>Defendant then removed his penis and began rubbing it over her \u201cbutt.\u201d He again inserted his penis in her vagina. Finally, defendant removed his penis, moved up the victim\u2019s back and ejaculated on the side of her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Defendant got up and got dressed and the victim drove him home. When she returned to her residence, the victim met J.D., who was leaving for the gym. The victim was crying and told J.D. defendant had raped her. J.D. called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">The police responded to the scene and the victim was taken to a hospital for examination. The victim had a lot of bruising on her body, mostly on her legs. She also had semen in her hair. The examination of the victim\u2019s vagina was consistent with her report of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">While the police were at the scene, defendant arrived to retrieve his wallet that he had left behind. He was detained and later taken to the police station. While there, the victim placed a pretext call to defendant and repeatedly asked him why he had done \u201cit.\u201d Defendant professed not to know what she was talking about but eventually said, \u201c[bjecause I\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d At one point, the victim said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this side of you,\u201d and defendant responded that he had \u201cnever seen this side of [himself] either.\u201d Defendant further said, \u201cI know I was wrong. I know you know that I\u2019m not like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">Defendant was charged with three counts of forcible rape (\u00a7261, subd. (a)(2)), two counts of sexual penetration with a foreign object (\u00a7 289, subd. (a)(1)), and one count of receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496, subd. (a)). He was convicted by a jury of the rape and stolen property counts, but acquitted of the sexual penetration charges. Defendant was sentenced to the middle term of two years for the property offense and full consecutive middle terms of six years on each of the rapes, for an aggregate sentence of 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-11\">\n<em>Uncharged Acts Evidence</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-13\">\n<em>Vagueness of \u201cSeparate Occasions\u201d Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-14\">Defendant received full consecutive terms on each of the rapes based on a finding by the trial court that the offenses occurred on \u201cseparate occasions,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>within the meaning of section 667.6, subdivision (d). Defendant contends the full consecutive terms cannot stand, because the legal standard for finding offenses were committed on \u201cseparate occasions\u201d is unconstitutionally vague. He further contends that, in the event this contention has been forfeited by counsel\u2019s failure to object, he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">\u201c[A] statute must be sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed. \u2018[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court </em>(Caswell) (1988) 46 Cal.Sd 381, 389 [250 Cal.Rptr. 515, 758 P.2d 1046].) Vague statutes are proscribed both because they fail to alert the public of the conduct required or prohibited and because they do not provide sufficient guidelines for enforcement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 389-390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">Section 667.6, subdivision (d), reads; \u201cA full, separate, and consecutive term shall be imposed for each violation of an offense specified in subdivision (e) [including forcible rape (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (e)(1))] if the crimes involve separate victims or involve the same victim on separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">\u201cIn determining whether crimes against a single victim were committed on separate occasions under this subdivision, the court shall consider whether, between the commission of one sex crime and another, the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his or her actions and nevertheless resumed sexually assaultive behavior. Neither the duration of time between crimes, nor whether or not the defendant lost or abandoned his or her opportunity to attack, shall be, in and of itself, determinative on the issue of whether the crimes in question occurred on separate occasions. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">Defendant contends the vagueness of the foregoing language is evident from the fact the Court of Appeal has not been able to settle on a single standard for assessing whether multiple sex offenses were committed on separate occasions. He cites as support <em>People v. Corona </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 13 [253 Cal.Rptr. 327] <em>(Corona), People v. Pena </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1294 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 550] <em>(Pena), People v. Plaza </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 377 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 710] <em>(Plaza), People </em>v. <em>Garza </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1081 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 831] <em>(Garza), </em>and <em>People v. King </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1281 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 333] <em>(King). </em>However, as we shall explain, there is no inconsistency in the foregoing appellate decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">In <em>Corona, </em>the defendant removed the victim\u2019s pants, put his finger in her vagina, kissed her genitals and then put his penis in her vagina. After five or six minutes, he departed. Five minutes later, the defendant returned and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>victim asked why he was doing this to her. The defendant placed a knife against her thigh and said if she did not cooperate, \u201c \u2018this will hurt you more.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Corona, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 15.) He then resumed his sexual assault. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant was convicted of eight offenses, including four sex offenses, and was sentenced on all four sex offenses under section 667.6, subdivision (d). (206 Cal.App.3d at p. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">On appeal, the defendant argued the trial court erred in imposing full consecutive terms on the four sex offenses. The People conceded the convictions for penetration with a foreign object and oral copulation that preceded the first rape did not occur on separate occasions and we accepted that concession. <em>(Corona, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 16.) We explained: \u201cThere is no evidence of any interval \u2018between\u2019 these sex crimes affording a reasonable opportunity for reflection; there was no cessation of sexually assaultive behavior hence defendant did not \u2018resume[] sexually assaultive behavior.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 18.) However, we also concluded consecutive sentencing on the two rapes was proper because, after the first rape, the defendant left and returned a short time later to resume his assault. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 17-18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">In <em>Pena, </em>the defendant forced the victim into her home and onto a bed where he raped her. He then \u201cgot off of her, twisted her by the legs violently, and orally copulated her.\u201d <em>(Pena, supra, 1 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1299.) The defendant was convicted of burglary, rape and forcible oral copulation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1300.) The trial court found the two sex crimes were committed on separate occasions and imposed full consecutive sentences. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">The Court of Appeal found the evidence insufficient to support the separate occasions finding. Relying in part on <em>Corona </em>and our conclusion that the digital penetration, oral copulation and first rape in that case did not occur on separate occasions, the court concluded: \u201c[Ajppellant did not have a \u2018reasonable opportunity to reflect\u2019 between his acts of rape and forcible oral copulation. As was the case in <em>People </em>v. <em>Corona, </em>nothing in the record before this court indicates <em>any </em>appreciable interval \u2018between\u2019 the rape and oral copulation. After the rape, appellant simply flipped the victim over and orally copulated her. The assault here was also continuous. Appellant simply did not cease his sexually assaultive behavior, and, therefore, could not have \u2018resumed\u2019 sexually assaultive behavior.\u201d <em>(Pena, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at p. 1316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">In <em>Plaza, </em>the defendant put his penis in the victim\u2019s mouth while they were in the bathroom. He then took the victim into her bedroom and onto her bed. There, he ripped off her underwear and inserted his fingers into her vagina. After withdrawing his fingers, he listened to the victim\u2019s answering machine while still on top of her. He got angry, hit the wall several times, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>again forced her to orally copulate him. The defendant removed his penis from her mouth, slid down her body, slapped her face and called her names for several minutes. He then kicked the victim\u2019s legs open and inserted his penis in her vagina. After that, he removed his penis, turned the victim over, and again inserted his penis in her vagina. He then forced the victim to orally copulate him once again. The defendant was interrupted by several phone calls, after which he forced the victim to orally copulate him. The ordeal ended when one of the victim\u2019s friends arrived at her house. <em>(Plaza, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at pp. 380-381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">The defendant was charged with eight separate sex offenses, and was convicted of five of them. <em>(Plaza, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at pp. 381-382.) He was sentenced to five full consecutive terms of six years pursuant to section 667.6, subdivision (d). (41 Cal.App.4th at p. 382.) On appeal, the defendant argued he could not be sentenced under section 667.6, subdivision (d), because he never ceased his assaultive behavior. (41 Cal.App.4th at p. 383.) The Court of Appeal disagreed and affirmed. Relying on both <em>Corona </em>and <em>Pena, </em>the court explained: \u201cThe trial court expressly found, as to each separate offense, that Plaza \u2018had a reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his actions and nevertheless resumed his sexually assaultive behavior.\u2019 Clearly, the evidence supports that finding. The first act of forced oral copulation (count 1) was in the victim\u2019s bathroom. Although Plaza continued to restrain Elizabeth, his assaultive <em>sexual </em>behavior then stopped as he pushed her into the bedroom, forced her onto the bed, grabbed her by the throat, ripped off her underwear and inserted his fingers into her vagina (count 4). Plaza then again stopped his assaultive <em>sexual </em>behavior, listened to Elizabeth\u2019s answering machine, then punched three holes in the wall. Only then did he commit another act of oral copulation (count 2). [1] At that point, although Plaza did not get up, he stopped what he was doing, removed his penis from Elizabeth\u2019s mouth, slid down, repeatedly slapped her face and called her names over and over again for a period of about five minutes and, only after he was through verbally abusing her, kicked her legs apart and raped her (count 3). Although Plaza was not convicted of the rape charged in count 6 or the oral copulation charged in count 5, those acts of intercourse and oral copulation plus three telephone calls preceded the final act of oral copulation of which Plaza was convicted (count 7).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 384-385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">In <em>Garza, </em>the defendant was convicted of 18 offenses, including 15 sex offenses, and received full consecutive terms on three of them. <em>(Garza, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 1084.) We affirmed the imposition of consecutive terms, explaining: \u201cAfter defendant forced the victim to orally copulate him, he let go of her neck, ordered her to strip, punched her in the eye, put his gun to her head and threatened to shoot her, and stripped along with her. That sequence of events afforded him ample opportunity to reflect on his actions and stop his sexual assault, but he nevertheless resumed it. Thus, defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>first act of rape was committed on a separate occasion from the forcible oral copulations. [Citation.] [][] Similarly, defendant had an adequate opportunity to reflect upon his actions between the time he inserted his finger in the victim\u2019s vagina and the commission of the first rape. During this interval, defendant (1) began to play with the victim\u2019s chest; (2) put his gun on the back seat; (3) pulled the victim\u2019s legs around his shoulders and, finally, (4) forced his penis inside her vagina. A reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant had adequate opportunity for reflection between these sex acts and that the acts therefore occurred on separate occasions for purposes of application of section 667.6, subdivision (d).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1092-1093.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Finally, in <em>King, </em>a police officer stopped a motorist and proceeded to grope her under the ruse of performing a patdown search. The officer was convicted of sexual battery, two counts of unlawful genital penetration, and two counts of unlawful sexual penetration. <em>(King, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1286-1287.) In rejecting the defendant\u2019s challenge to consecutive sentencing, the court concluded: \u201cHere, the trial court specifically determined that King, who sexually assaulted Nicole under the ruse that he was performing a lawful search, used the fingers of one hand to penetrate Nicole\u2019s vagina. When he saw lights and a car drove by, he momentarily paused to look around uneasily, and then reinserted the fingers of his other hand in a separate assaultive act. The court observed the fact that King \u2018removed his finger when the lights went by. He looked uneasy; showing he knows what he\u2019s doing was wrong.\u2019 And, later, the court reiterated that, once King \u2018noticed the lights of Marilyn\u2019s car ... he removed his fingers, looked around and looked uneasy. He could have stopped at that point. This was the opportunity giving [King] the opportunity to reflect about his actions, [f] After the coast was clear, this intelligent experienced man then decided to re-insert a finger with his other hand for about another 25 seconds.\u2019 Accordingly, the court specifically found \u2018that this qualifies for a separate full consecutive term.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1325.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">Defendant argues the foregoing cases reflect what is <em>not </em>required for a finding of separate occasions, i.e., no need for movement from one room to another and no need for a particular length of delay between separate acts, but do not explain what <em>is </em>required. According to defendant, \u201cthe courts have inexorably moved in the direction of finding that repeated sexual acts, without more, are sufficient to support an inference that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect and nevertheless continued the abuse.\u201d Defendant argues the courts have thereby emptied the \u201cseparate occasions\u201d requirement of any meaning and left defendants to guess at its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">We disagree. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 98 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 753, 18 P.3d 674], the state high court noted the Court of Appeal has \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>required a break of any specific duration or any change in physical location\u201d in order to qualify for sentencing under section 667.6, subdivision (d). (25 Cal.4th at p. 104.) Nor need there be any \u201cobvious break\u201d in the defendant\u2019s behavior. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nevertheless, the question remains whether, between specific sex acts, \u201cthe defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his or her actions and nevertheless resumed sexually assaultive behavior.\u201d (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (d).) All of the cases cited by defendant agree on this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">\u201cIn determining whether a statute is sufficiently certain to comport with due process standards, the court will \u2018look first to the language of the statute, then to its legislative history, and finally to California decisions construing the statutory language.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Estrada </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 568, 581 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 586, 904 P.2d 1197].)  The language of section 667.6, subdivision (d), requires that, in determining whether crimes against a single victim occurred on separate occasions, the trial court \u201cshall consider\u201d whether the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect between the crimes. (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (d).) Although this language does not make such factor a litmus test for determining the issue, the courts have nevertheless done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">Thus, the question is whether the requirement that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect between sex acts is too vague to satisfy due process. We conclude it is not. A statute is not unconstitutionally vague \u201cso long as an accused can reasonably be held to understand by the terms of the statute that his conduct is prohibited.\u201d <em>(Bowland v. Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 493 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081].) It takes no particular depth of reasoning to be able to distinguish between a situation where a perpetrator engages in a continuous course of conduct involving multiple sex offenses with no break in between and one in which the individual offenses are separated by some other activity, either of the defendant or another, that interrupts the assault and affords the perpetrator an opportunity to reflect on what he or she is doing. The activity need not involve any type of movement of the victim and need not be of any particular duration. It may be nothing more than car lights going by that cause the perpetrator to pause and reflect before proceeding, as in <em>King, </em>or some activity not amounting to a sex offense, like pausing to listen to the victim\u2019s answering machine or punching the wall, as in <em>Plaza. </em>We believe a perpetrator can reasonably be held to recognize this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">Having concluded a vagueness challenge to section 667.6, subdivision (d), should properly have been rejected, we need not consider defendant\u2019s alternate claim of ineffective assistance based on counsel\u2019s failure to raise the vagueness challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>III-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">The convictions are affirmed.
