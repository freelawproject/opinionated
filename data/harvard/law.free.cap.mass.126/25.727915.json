A writ sued out by this plaintiff against this defendant, described to be administratrix of the estate of Charles A. Siefert, not stating the class of action to which it belonged, and containing a declaration precisely similar to that in the present action. 2d. A plea in abatement, that the writ did not state whether it was brought in contract, tort, or replevin, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>that the count did not pursue the writ, the writ being against the defendant as administratrix, and the declaration against her personally. 3d. An order of the court, sustaining the plea in abatement. 4th. A subsequent judgment for the defendant upon the written consent of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that \u201c in this case judgment may enter for the defendant.\u201d The record showed no answer or trial upon the merits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-4\">Upon these facts, the identity of the parties and of the claim declared on being admitted, Putnam, J. ruled that the other action was against the defendant personally, and that the judgment was a conclusive and final adjudication of the matters sought to be recovered in the present <em>action; </em>and found for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-5\"><em>D.

The record shows that no issue on the merits was joined or tried. That judgment, therefore, is no bar to this action. <em>Wilbur </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>21 Pick. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"AQo\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
