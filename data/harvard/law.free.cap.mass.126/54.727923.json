If the grand jury had a full description of the bills, and if the jury so find on the evidence, it is not competent for the government to say that a more particular description of their value was to them unknown; and the jury should for that reason acquit. 2. The government must prove to a moral certainty that the bills were of the precise amount and value of eighty dollars, neither more nor less ; and if, upon the evidence, the government has not satisfied the jury of that precise amount, beyond legal doubt, the jury should for that reason acquit. 3. It is not competent for the government, under the description in the indictment, to ask a conviction for the larceny of national bank bills; and if, upon the evidence, the jury find that such were the 6 promissory notes \u2019 lost by Sheridan, they should acquit the defendant.\u201d The judge declined to give these instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">The defendant called as a witness one Clark, whose evidence tended to confirm that of the defendant, and to contradict' that of Sheridan, as to what transpired at the time of the taking. On the cross-examination of Clark, the government asked him if he was not a friend of the defendant; to which he replied that he was not. He was then asked, \u201c Did you not offer one Alley, or somebody else, forty dollars to go bail for the defendant in this case?\u201d The defendant objected to this question; but the judge allowed it to be put, and the witness answered, \u201c I offered Alley fifteen dollars if he would go on the defendant\u2019s bond.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">For the purpose of affecting the credibility of the defendant, who offered himself as a witness, the government introduced in evidence a record of his prior conviction and sentence for larceny. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The defendant was allowed to testify, that, although he was convicted, he was innocent; and that the officer, who made the complaint in that case, subsequently told him that he was satisfied of his innocence. This officer was a witness for the government, and was also present at the time the defendant made this statement, \"but was not recalled by the government to contradict it. The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury, that, if they believed that the officer told the defendant he was satisfied that he was innocent, that nullified the record. The judge declined to give these instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-5\"><em>G.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5m\">The instructions requested were rightly refused. There was no evidence that the grand jury had a full description of the bills, and it was not necessary to prove that the amount of bills stolen was not more than was alleged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hussey, </em>111 Mass. 432. It is settled by our decisions, that an indictment for stealing \u201c promissory notes \u201d is supported by proof of stealing bank bills. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>124 Mass. 449. The record introduced was conclusive evidence of the conviction and sentence, and all the testimony afterwards admitted on that point was immaterial. The cross-examination of the witness Clark was within the discretion of the presiding judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
