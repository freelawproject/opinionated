In the Superior Court, after a verdict of guilty, the respondent moved in arrest of judgment, because only copies of the original papers of the proceedings before the Police Court of Cambridge, to which the complaint was origi-. nally made, were in court. Allen, J., overruled the motion, and passed the order of affiliation; and the respondent appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-7\"><em>C.

By the St. of 1876, <em>o. </em>60, the provisions of this section are applied \u201cto all appeals and removals to the Superior Court in any civil action or proceeding before any police, municipal or district court.\u201d The complaint in this case was a civil proceeding.

The magistrate who issues the warrant can only proceed so far as is necessary, under the statute, to require the respondent to give bond for his appearance at the higher court. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>110 Mass. 317. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>110 Mass. 152. The case was therefore not transferred to the Superior Court by appeal or removal; and the St. of 1876, <em>e. </em>60, furnishes no reason why the case may not be tried upon certified copies, instead of the original papers. The judgment of the Superior Court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
