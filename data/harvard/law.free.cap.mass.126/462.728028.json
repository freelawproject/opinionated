The defendant called the clerk as a witness, who testified that he had been clerk since June 1, 1878, hired by and in the employ of the defendant\u2019s wife; that she owned the business- and liquors seized; that the latter had been bought since June 1; that he had not seen the defendant at any time during that period sell or deliver intoxicating liquors to any person; that the witness had charge, more or less, of the liquors and of the rooms and places in which they were deposited when seized; and that diese rooms and places were not used by the defendant and his wife for family or domestic purposes.

But the judge refused so to rule; and ruled that the government must show that the liquors found on October 29 were kept for sale by the defendant.; that if, at the time the liquors were kept for sale by the defendant\u2019s wife, the defendant actually aided or assisted her in such keeping, he should be convicted; that if the defendant, without actually and actively aiding his wife in such keeping, was personally present, and knew that his wife was so keeping the liquors, the presumption of law is, that the wife acted under the coercion of her husband, and that he is guilty, and she is not; that this was true, although the place where the liquors were kept was her hotel, and not merely a private dwelling-house; that this presumption might be rebutted by showing that the wife, in fact, acted without the interference or control of her husband; and that, if the defendant directed or advised his wife to keep the liquors for sale, and he was living with her in her hotel, and knew that she was so keeping the liquors, the presumption of law was that she was acting under his coercion, and that he was guilty and she not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b479-6\"><em>J.
