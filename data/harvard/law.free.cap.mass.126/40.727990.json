The first count, upon which alone the defendant was convicted, charged that the defendant, on December 5, 1876, at Pelham, \u201cunlawfully and maliciously did thrust a certain instrument, the name of which is to the jurors aforesaid unknown, into the body and womb of one Mary M. Wilson, then and there being pregnant with child, with intent thereby then and there to cause the said Mary M. Wilson to miscarry and prematurely bring forth from her body the said child with which she was then and there pregnant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Q-ardner, </em>J., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>government offered evidence tending to show that Mrs. Wilson had a miscarriage, at Pelham, on December 7,1876, resulting in her death on December 16, 1876, and that, after death, cuts, wounds and bruises were found in her womb, caused by some instrument used therein with violence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-4\">The government also offered evidence that the defendant, who resided in Holyoke, was, on December 5, 1876, taken to Pelham by the husband of Mrs. Wilson, and passed the night at the house of Wilson, returning to Holyoke on the next day; that he said to the officer, when arrested, that he did not think Wilson would have gone back on him; and that he attempted to escape trial by secretly going to Canada after a former trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">The defendant testified that he was a practising physician and surgeon at Holyoke, denied that he procured any abortion on Mrs. Wilson, and explained the occasion of his visit to Pelham. Upon cross-examination, he was asked if he had not, at the time of the alleged offence, an instrument for procuring abortions, and he answered that he had never had any such. He was then asked if he did not have one at the time that a Mrs. Myrick was at his office in Holyoke, at a time prior to December 5,1876, and he said that he never had any then or at any other time. The government, after the defendant\u2019s testimony was in, called Mrs. Myrick as a witness, and offered to show that, in July or August, 1876, the defendant had in his possession an instrument-adapted to the purpose of procuring abortions, which instrument, the government contended, could have made the wounds found in the womb of Mrs. Wilson, and was evidence tending to show that the defendant had an instrument by means of which the wounds might have been caused at the time of the commission of the crime. The district attorney, on being asked, would not say that he omitted the testimony of the witness Myrick, when putting in the case of the government, unintentionally, but said he had been expecting to elicit the facts from the defendant on cross-examination. The defendant excepted to the admission of the testimony as unseasonable and incompetent; but the judge admitted the testimony, and the witness testified that she was at the defendant\u2019s house in Holyoke, in July or August, 1876, and saw a metallic instrument in the defendant\u2019s hands, in two parts, about a foot long, round and hollow, and that the defendant said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>it was the best kind of instrument for procuring an abortion, because safer than another kind..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-5\"><em>W. </em>G. Bassett, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-6\"><em>C.

Evidence had already been given for the purpose of showing the existence of cuts, wounds, and bruises in the womb of the deceased, such as indicated the forcible use of some instrument. All this, taken in connection with previous testimony, tended to show that the defendant had the opportunity, and was knowingly in possession of the means, of committing such a crime, and the evidence was therefore competent and admissible. Its weight and effect were of course to be judged of by the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Brown, 121 Mass. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Its admission after the defendant had closed his case was a matter of judicial discretion, and not a subject of exception. <em>Commmonwealth </em>v.
