Conditions of sale of house No. 69 A Street: $300 to be paid at sale, one half of the whole purchase money to be paid in cash, balance to remain on mortgage power of sale for three years at seven per cent interest. Taxes for the present year to be paid by the purchaser. Deed to be ready at the office of George R.

Having purchased house No. 69 A Street this day at auction for the sum of $2,275, I hereby agree to conform to the conditions of said sale. William Linton.\u201d It further appeared that, after the sale, certain defects in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>title were discovered and releases procured, to which the plaintiff made no objection ; and on August 17, 1877, a deed of the estate was tendered by the defendants to the plaintiff, which he refused to accept, on the ground that there was an attachment upon the property; and in fact, after the sale, the estate was attached, and the attachment existed at the date of the tender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\">The defendants offered to prove that the attachment was not known to them until they were informed of it by the plaintiff at the time of the tender of the deed; that, had they been informed of it, they would have taken measures to release it; and that they so stated to the plaintiff. But the judge ruled that the attachment was such an incumbrance as justified the plaintiff in refusing to accept the deed, whether the defendants knew of the existence of the attachment or not; and found for the plaintiff for the amount claimed. The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-5\"><em>W. C. </em>Williamson, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC7\">1. The plaintiff waived all objection to the deed, except as to the existing attachment. <em>Gerrish </em>v. Norris, 9 Cush. 167. <em>Dresel </em>v. Jordan, 104 Mass. 407.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">2. The defendants do not contend that the plaintiff was bound to take a title incumbered by an attachment, but, as they were ignorant of the existence of the attachment, they contend that its existence was not, of itself, proof of a breach of their contract. The defendants were, in good faith, and with the acquiescence of the plaintiff, doing all they could to perfect the title. \u201c The fact of there being imperfections in the title at the time of the contract will form no ground of objection thereto if such objections can be removed before the time of completing the purchase.\u201d 1 Chit. Con. (11th Am. ed.) 431.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-7\"><em>D.
