There was no evidence that the plaintiff had any notice of the written lease before Thursday. All this evidence, as to the taking possession and giving notice, was denied by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-4\">The judge instructed the jury that, if they found that the defendant obtained peaceable possession of the premises before he made the attachment, the plaintiff could not recover, because the premises were no longer the premises of the plaintiff, his tenancy being terminated; but if he did not thus obtain possession, the defendant had kept his keeper in the premises an unreasonable time and was a trespasser <em>ab </em>initia, and responsible for such entry and all injury to the building and all his subsequent acts. To this ruling no exception was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">The plaintiff then contended, that, if the tenancy was thus terminated, he should have had reasonable notice of the intended entry upon the premises; and that a notice given on the Thursday previous was not sufficient. The judge stated that, if the defendant obtained peaceable entry and possession' on Saturday, he did not think it was affected by a want of previous notice; but as there was evidence of a previous notice given on Thursday, he should rule, for the purposes of the trial, that a notice was necessary; and further ruled, that, if the jury found that the defendant gave the notice which he claimed he had given on the previous Thursday, that notice, as matter of law, was reasonable notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plain tiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-7\"><em>B.
