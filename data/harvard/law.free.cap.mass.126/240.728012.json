But the judge refused so to rule; and submitted the case to the jury under instructions not objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions to the refusal to rule as requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-6\"><em>H.

But the evidence reported in this bill of exceptions goes beyond this limit. It was not only proved that barrels of ale had been upon the premises, and that one was on tap there, when the officers entered; but a part of the furniture of the establishment, \u2014 the tumblers, the strainer, and especially the apparatus of the beer-pump,\u2014 was appropriate to a shop or place of public resort where intoxicating liquors are kept for sale, and furnished an indication of an intent to sell, rather than to apply to the mere domestic use of a single family All this the jury had a right to consider. It is impossible for us to say that it had no weight or significance, or that there was no evidence to justify their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"ASxV\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
