The judge declined to rule that the government must elect as to which tenement or room it would rely upon; and instructed the jury that a tenement might consist of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>two rooms used together and immediately connected together, and that, if the two were thus used alternately and interchangeably for the illegal sale or the illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors, they might be considered as parts of one and the same tenement, and the illegal use of either, while thus connected and u\u00abed, would be an illegal use of the tenement. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b73-4\">At the trial of an indictment on the Gen.

The judge declined to rule that if the liquors seized were not oSered by exposing them to those who might become purchasers, and that if the liquors were deposited where their presence could not be known to the public, the jury could not find upon such state of facts alone an illegal keeping, although the defendant did keep and intend to sell <em>them; </em>and ruled that, if the liquors were kept in the tenement, and at the time to which the evidence related, for the purpose of being sold when occasion or opportunity offered, the defendant might be convicted. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-5\">Indictment on the Gen.

But the judge refused so to rule; and instructed the jury that a tenement might consist of two rooms used together, and immediately connected with each other, and if the two were thus used alternately or interchangeably for the illegal sale or the illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors, they might be considered to be parts of one and the same tenement, and the illegal use of either, while thus connected and used, would be an illegal use of the tenement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">The defendant also asked the judge to rule that it was necessary for the government to show the illegal keeping for sale of intoxicating liquors; that if the liquors seized were not offered by exposing them to those who might become purchasers, and that if the liquors were deposited where their presence could not be known to the public, the jury could not find upon such state of facts alone an illegal keeping, although the defendant did keep and intend to sell them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">But the judge refused so to rule; and ruled that, if the intoxicating liquors were kept in the tenement, and at the time to which the evidence related, for the purpose of being sold when occasion or opportunity offered, the defendant might be convicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b74-8\"><em>J.
