At the hearing in this court, before <em>Ames, </em>J., it appeared that the petitioner was held in the Police Court of Lowell upon a complaint charging him with the burning of a building on January 20, 1878, and ordered to recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>with sureties in the sum of $10,000 for his appearance to answer to any indictment which the grand jury might find against him for said burning, or to any other indictment which they might find against him at June term 1878 of the Superior Court, and, not so recognizing, was duly committed to jail on a mittimus; that said sum of $10,000 was afterwards reduced to $5000, and the petitioner recognized with sureties in the latter sum, according to said order; that when called to answer to an indictment found against him for said burning, at June term, he made default; that a writ of <em>scire facias </em>was sued out against him and his sureties, returnable to October term 1878 of the Superior Court, when judgment was entered thereon for the sum of $300; that within one week after the default he was surrendered by himself and his sureties to the custody of the sheriff of Middlesex county, upon a copy of the recognizance; that he has remained in jail at Lowell ever since the surrender; that at October term he was arraigned in the Superior Court upon the indictment against him, and a jury was empanelled to try him thereon; that the jury failed to agree upon a verdict, and was discharged; that thereupon he applied to the justice presiding at that term of the Superior Court to fix a sum in which he might recognize, with sureties, for his appearance to answer further to the indictment; that, upon a hearing, the justice found that he had deliberately made default, without any \u201creasonable excuse\u201d therefor, and held that, under the St. of 1874, c. 306, he had no power to admit the petitioner to further bail or recognizance, and denied the application. The petitioner contended that the statute was unconstitutional; and that he was entitled to be admitted to bail, notwithstanding the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-4\">Upon these facts, the judge reserved the case for the consideration of the full court. If the petitioner was entitled to be further admitted to bail, the petition was to stand for hearing \u2022 otherwise, the petition was to be dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-5\"><em>C. </em>Cowley, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-6\"><em>C.
