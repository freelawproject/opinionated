The leading allegation is, that the \u201c said complaint was dismissed.\u201d If the words that follow, \u201c and he was lawfully discharged and acquitted on said complaint,\u201d are to be construed as a substantive allegation of a former acquittal, it is inconsistent with and repugnant to the other allegation. The effect of dismissing a complaint without a trial is like that of quashing or entering a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of an indictment. By neither of these is the defendant acquitted of the offence charged against him, but he is only exempted from liability on that complaint or indictment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gould, 12 Gray, 171. Taking the whole allegation together, the only sensible meaning is that the complaint was dismissed, and so the defendant was acquitted, the latter allegation being not an averment of a fact, but a statement of the defendant\u2019s conclusion of law from the main facts stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">A demurrer admits only those facts which are well pleaded. The demurrer of the - government in this case admitted that a complaint against the defendant for the same offence charged in the indictment had been dismissed. But, as we have before said, this was not an acquittal of the offence, which could be pleaded or given in evidence in bar of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>We are therefore of opinion that the rulings of the Superior Court, sustaining the demurrer and ordering the defendant to plead over to the indictment, were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\n<em>.Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
