Answer, a general denial. Trial in the Superior Court, before Bacon, J.. without a jury, who allowed the following bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-4\">\u201c The plaintiff signed the written conditions of sale, the material part of which was as follows : \u2018$300 to be paid at sale, one half of the whole purchase money to be paid in cash, balance to remain on mortgage power of sale for three years at seven per cent interest. Taxes for the present year to be paid by the purchaser. Deed to be ready at the office of George It. Hichborn &amp; Co., No. 63 Court Street, on or before fifteen days (or as soon as the papers can be completed) from the day of sale.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">\u201c It appeared in evidence that after the sale, and before the tender of the deed of the premises to the plaintiff, some person had injured the estate by unhinging and breaking one of the blinds, breaking two panes of glass in one of the windows, making a hole in the ceiling of one of the rooms, breaking through one of the inner doors, and cutting and carrying away a piece of water-pipe five or six feet long. It did not appear that the vendor of the house, which was occupied by her tenants, she herself living in an adjoining house, or the defendants, had knowledge of these injuries until the plaintiff mentioned them at the time of the tender of the deed, and by reason of them refused to accept the deed. It also was in evidence that, when the plaintiff mentioned these injuries, the defendants offered to repair them, or to compensate the plaintiff for them by an allowance in money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\">\u201c The defendants requested the presiding judge to find that these facts did not constitute in law a breach of the contract on the part of the vendor such as would release the purchaser from his obligations, and render the defendants liable to the present action. But the judge declined so to find; but he did find that, by reason of such injuries, the plaintiff was released from his obligation to take the house; and ordered judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of $300 and interest.\u201d The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-7\"><em>W.

The bill of exceptions fails to show that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>made any ruling in matter of law, beyond declining to rule that the facts which the evidence tended to prove did not constitute in law such a breach of the contract, on the part of the vendor, as would release the purchaser from his obligations, and entitle him to recover back the part of the purchase money already paid; and does not disclose the nature and degree of the injuries to the property with sufficient fulness and distinctness to enable this court to determine that the refusal so to rule was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
