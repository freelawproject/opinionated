Answer, a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Colburn, </em>J., without a jury, it was admitted by the defendants that they were minor children of Josiah Bardwell, who was the duly appointed guardian of each of them; that they were the owners as tenants in common of certain real estate, consisting of a dwelling-house and land in Beverly; that the plaintiffs were employed by the guardian, who has since died, to furnish, and did furnish, the labor and materials sued for, in repairs upon the house; and that the prices were reasonable. The plaintiffs further offered to prove, against the objection of the defendants, that the repairs were necessary. The judge rejected the evidence as immaterial; ruled that, upon the facts admitted, the defendants were not liable; and found for the defendants. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-9\"><em>C. A. Benjamin, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-10\"><em>S. B. Ives, Jr., </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b382-11\">Colt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApfC\">The evidence offered was properly rejected, as immaterial. The rule is, that a guardian can make no contract binding upon the ward, or upon his estate. The guardian has only the control and management of the ward\u2019s estate, with no title to it; a power not coupled with an interest. He may make contracts in his own name, but they only bind himself; and the ward does not become a party to them after the death or discharge of the guardian. <em>Thacher </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>5 Mass. 299. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>10 Allen, 463. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Almy, </em>100 Mass. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">The plaintiffs bring themselves within no exception to the rule. The contract here relied on, moreover, is one which, inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>pendently of the rule, would not be binding on the minors, if made by them; for repairs on a dwelling-house are not necessar ries in the technical sense of the word. <em>Tupper </em>v. <em>Cadwell, </em>12 Met. 559.</p>\n<p id=\"ATg\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
