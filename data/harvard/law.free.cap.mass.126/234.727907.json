The defendant was a witness, and, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, was permitted to testify that, when the goods were purchased, he was sixteen years of age, and that, at the time of the trial, he was twenty-three years of age. It appeared that the defendant\u2019s father was dead at the time of the trial, but it did not appear whether his mother was living or not. The defendant was the only witness as to his age, and no other evidence was offered in relation thereto. The judge found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions to the admission of the defendant\u2019s evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-9\"><em>L.

It is quite clear that one may testify, from his own knowledge of himself, whether he was twenty-one or sixteen years of age at a certain time, (which was the only material point upon which the testimony of the defendant appears to have been admitted,) and that such weight may be given to his testimony as the court or the jury trying the case may think it entitled to receive. See <em>Cheever </em>v. <em>Congdon, </em>34 Mich. 296; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>1 Penn. St. 381, 383; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>9 W. Va. 559, 570.</p>\n<p id=\"AS1\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
