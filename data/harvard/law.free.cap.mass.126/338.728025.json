From that time until the death of Westgate, which occurred on February 8, 1876, they were tenderly attached to each other and were often together; and he occasionally went to her home in Rhode Island to visit her. In September 1875, he was taken ill at Fall River, where he lived, and sent for the plaintiff to come and take care of him, which she did. He got better and she went home just before Thanksgiving. Early in December he had another attack. He again sent for her, and she came and remained until after his death. He seemed to recover also from this attack. On the night before December 11, 1875, he had an unusually severe attack of heart disease. He said if he got out of that he must have some writing done. The next day he went to his place of business, where he made and signed, in the presence of a witness, the instrument declared on. That evening, at his house, he took out a sealed envelope and handed it to the plaintiff, saying to her, there was something which would provide for her in case anything should happen to him; that if they were married, and he wanted it given up, he should expect her to give it up. To this the plaintiff assented. He then said he did not want her to leave it around where a certain person could see it. She then took the sealed envelope and carried it to her room, where she kept it in her possession until after his death, when she took it with her when she returned to her home, and has had possession of it ever since. After West-gate\u2019s death, she opened the envelope, and found inside of it the instrument declared on. After the engagement in June 1874, Westgate was anxious to have the marriage take place in April 1875. She said she had suits pending about her husband\u2019s estate with his brothers, and wanted to wait until those were over, and the marriage was therefore deferred. Finally, in October 1875, Westgate said he could do better by her than the Warrens, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the marriage was fixed for his next birthday, February 16,1876, and, a few days before his death, invitations were given to a few friends to be present. Before and during the engagement, the plaintiff took care of his wardrobe, repaired his clothing, bought his handkerchiefs and stockings, and attended to a good many other things for him, and at various times when he was ill took care of him. The defendants were appointed adminis trators of his estate on March 3, 1876, and on April 1, 1876, demand for the payment of this claim was made upon them, which was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\">Upon these facts, the plaintiff contended that she could recover the full amount of the instrument declared on, with interest from the date of the demand. The defendants contended that the plaintiff could not recover; and that, if she could recover anything, she was only entitled to recover for the services actually rendered to Westgate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">If the plaintiff could recover the full amount claimed, judgment was to be entered for her for such amount; if not, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the services actually rendered, the case was to stand for trial upon that issue; otherwise, judgment for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-6\"><em>J. M. </em>Morton, Jr., for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-7\"><em>G. </em>Marston, <em>(J. C.

The defendants contend that the instrument is not a promissory note, because it was not delivered to take effect during the lifetime of the signer; and that it is invalid for want of consideration, and because it was intended as a testamentary disposition of property by the signer, and not as a contract in payment of a debt or obligation of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Unless the evidence is sufficient to warrant a jury in finding a valid consideration for the instrument, the action cannot be maintained. It is not enough to show that there was an obligation on the part of the signer to the plaintiff, which would have been a good consideration for a note given in sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>isfaction thereof; there must be evidence that the instrument was given and accepted in payment or satisfaction of such obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">We are of opinion, on the evidence in the case, that the circumstances under which the instrument was given, and the statement of the intestate at the time, point to an entirely different purpose from that of payment, either for services or for the promise of a speedy marriage. The intestate had been seriously ill with disease of the heart. While thus ill, he said that if he recovered he must have some writing done; and on the next day made the instrument and gave it to the plaintiff in a sealed envelope, requesting her not to open it till after his death, and saying that there was something which would provide for her in case anything should happen to him; that if they were married, and he wanted it given up, he should expect her to give it up, to which she assented. These circumstances, wholly inconsistent with the theory that the instrument was intended as a settlement of account, are conclusive evidence that the intestate was attempting to make a provision for the plaintiff out of his estate, in case he should die without marrying her. If anything were needed to make this inference from the facts more absolutely inevitable, it is found in the instrument itself, which is, in terms, payable after the maker\u2019s death. Being without consideration, therefore, the note is void. It is not valid either as a gift <em>causa </em>mortis, or as a testamentary disposition of property. <em>Parish </em>v. Stone, 14 Pick. 198. <em>Hulse </em>v. Hulse, 17 C. B. 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The facts in the case at bar are essentially different from those in <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Carruth, </em>108 Mass. 242, where the refusal of the judge to rule that the action could not be maintained was sustained by this court. In that case, the note was contained in a sealed envelope, on which was written a request to the payee not to open it till after the maker\u2019s death, and on the same paper with the note was written a request to the payee to. accept the note from her true friend, the maker. There was evidence of services rendered by the payee, similar to those proved in the case at bar, but there was no marriage. engagement between the parties; and there was no affirmative statement by the maker of the note that the envelope contained something which would provide for the payee in case of the maker\u2019s death; nor any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>evidence of an agreement by the payee to give up the note at request of the maker, on any contingency. The evidence left the question of purpose in giving the note, and of consideration, open as a matter of inference from the evidence, the court holding that the request to accept the note was not, as matter of law, conclusive that it was a gift, as it was consistent with a desire to have the note accepted instead of money, and that the request that the envelope should not be opened till the maker\u2019s decease was not decisive on the question of consideration, and that the two memoranda, construed together, did not, as a matter of legal interpretation, signify that the note was a mere gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In the case at bar, the declaration of the intestate the day before the note was made, while ill, and doubtful of recovering his health, added to his statement when the envelope was delivered, that there was something which would provide for her if anything should happen to him,\u2014which is equivalent to \u201cif he should die,\u201d \u2014 giv\u00e9 a decisive character to the transaction, which precludes the idea of the note being intended otherwise than as a provision for the plaintiff by way of gift, out of the estate of the maker. In <em>Worth </em>v. <em>Case, </em>42 N. Y. 362, relied on by the plaintiff, the note purported on its face to be given \u201c in consideration of services rendered,\u201d and there was evidence that the plaintiff had rendered services which had not been otherwise paid <em>for; </em>the evidence of consideration was therefore distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
