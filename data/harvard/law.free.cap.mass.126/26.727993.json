The plaintiffs asked the judge to rule that full faith and credit should be given to the judgment; that the record should be held to be conclusive; that it was not to be controlled by paroi or other evidence; and that, if the appearance of the attorney was unauthorized, the defendant\u2019s remedy was in the court in which the record existed, and not in this court. But the judge refused so to rule; and found for the defendant. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-5\"><em>S. C. Maine &amp; J.
