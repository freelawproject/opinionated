The entire matter presently before us is procedural. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>We need not, therefore, recite any of the factual situation giving rise to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The record shows that a panel of the Health Claims Arbitration Office (HCAO) dismissed the claim of Seymour Brothers and Bernyce Brothers, his wife, against health care providers, Dr. Joel M. Cherry, Dr. Nelson Stone, Dr. Ray Brodie, Jr., and Sinai Hospital. Obviously dissatisfied with the panel\u2019s rejection, the Brothers, within the time prescribed by Md.Rule BY2 and Courts Art. \u00a7 3-2A-06(a), filed paper writings entitled, \u201cNotice of Rejection of Award,\u201d and \u201cNotice of Action to Nullify Award.\u201d Both were captioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201cSEYMOUR BROTHERS, et al\u201e \u201c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9j\">BEFORE THE HEALTH CLAIMS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aov\">Claimants * ARBITRATION OFFICE OF</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7V\">-vs- * MARYLAND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEJ\">JOEL M. CHERRY, M.D., et al., *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZY\">Health Care</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0c\">Providers \u2019 HCA No.: 82-139\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The notice of action to nullify added the words, \u201cMr. Clerk,\u201d and substituted the noun, \u201cPlaintiffs,\u201d for the noun \u201cClaimants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">It is apparent that copies, not the originals, of the two writings were filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City along with a \u201cdeclaration.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">Two of the health care providers, Drs. Cherry and Stone, filed a motion raising preliminary objection, asserting that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the case because of the Brothers\u2019 failure to abide by the Maryland Rules of Procedure. Those two health care providers noted that the \u201cNotice of Rejection\u201d and the \u201cNotice of Action to Nullify\u201d were filed in the improper forum, and only a copy of the notices was tendered to the circuit court. The hearing judge agreed with Drs. Cherry and Stone. Furthermore, the hearing court \u201cconsidered the issues raised on its own motion,\u201d and then dismissed the Brothers\u2019 action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>against all defendants. Simultaneously, the court affirmed the arbitrator\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Recently in <em>Osheroff v. Chestnut Lodge, Inc., </em>62 Md.App. 519, 490 A.2d 720 (1985), we addressed a somewhat similar situation. There we declined to put form over substance and thus deprive a claimant of the right to litigate an issue of liability. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\u201cIt must be borne in mind that the statute is strictly construed so as to effectuate the legislative purpose of screening malpractice claims <em>before </em>they reach the courts. Upon completion of the arbitration process and the filing of the correct and timely notice of rejection with the parties and court, the statutory screening process is terminated. All further proceedings are conducted in court and regulated, as are all other civil cases, by the Maryland Rules. Although judicial review of the HCAO actions might be regarded as a continuation of the arbitration proceeding, it is not. Rather, it is a new, separate, and distinct proceeding. It is litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Indubitably, the Brothers complied with the statute insofar as proceedings before the HCAO were concerned, and thereby fully satisfied the legislative purpose. <em>Id. </em>It is only when the matter reached the circuit court that the Brothers fell short of strict compliance with the rules, and only then because of the failure to caption the \u201cNotice of Action to Nullify\u201d as being in the circuit court <em>vis 'a vis </em>the HCAO. That error, we think, should not be fatal to the Brothers. The notice to nullify, the notice of rejection, and the declaration were all filed at the same time. The declaration states that the proceeding is in the circuit court, and no one reading the declaration and the other two documents can possibly be misled. Indeed, on oral argument counsel for the health care providers candidly admitted that they were not misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The failure to caption properly the \u201cNotice of Action to Nullify\u201d so as to indicate that it was being filed in the circuit court instead of with the HCAO could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>readily altered by interlineation. Certainly, the health care providers were in no manner prejudiced by the incorrect caption. To dismiss the Brothers\u2019 claim simply because it was miscaptioned, or because the original of the miscaptioned document was filed with the HCAO and a copy thereof filed in the circuit court, patently places form over substance. In our view, the case should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED. CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-13\">. <em>See, </em>however, Md.Rule 2-101 which provides that a \u201ccivil action is commenced by filing a complaint with a court.\u201d Md.Rule BY4, nevertheless, refers to the initial pleading as a \"declaration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
