Did the court commit reversible error in finding him guilty without first affording him the opportunity to present closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">II. Was the evidence sufficient to convict him of assault with intent to murder?</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>III. Can appellant be convicted of, and sentenced for, two counts of assault with intent to murder when he fired only one shot?</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The State adduced evidence that on December 23, 1983, Charles Gibson, a taxicab driver, pulled up in front of 258 Robert Street to pick up a fare. A man, whom Gibson identified in court as appellant, came out, opened the front door to the cab, produced a sawed-off shotgun, and ordered Gibson out of the cab. As Gibson got out, he activated the cab\u2019s emergency warning device known as a \u201ctrouble light.\u201d He then gave appellant $30 to $40 in cash. Two other men came out of the building and Gibson was ordered back into the rear seat of the taxicab. The three other men also got into the cab and drove off with Gibson. Appellant was seated in the front on the passenger side next to the driver, holding the sawed-off shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Gibson testified that while in the cab, he cried and pleaded with appellant not to shoot him but appellant responded by punching him in the mouth. When the cab reached the 900 block of Argyle Avenue, Gibson was told to get out of the cab and into the trunk. Minutes later, from inside the trunk, Gibson heard a police siren and saw the reflection of blue light. He heard a loud \u201cbang\u201d as the car picked up its speed. Eventually the car came to a stop, and Gibson was subsequently let out of the trunk by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Officer Lewis Stotler testified that he and his partner, Dennis Mateo, were driving on Martin Luther King Boulevard when they saw a cab with its red \u201ctrouble light\u201d on. He could see two black males inside the cab. The police attempted to stop the cab by activating the blue light and siren on their patrol car, but the cab did not stop and continued \u201cat a speed of 50 to 60 miles an hour.\u201d As the cab turned onto the Interstate 95 extension, Mateo pulled alongside the cab. Stotler leaned out of the window and shined a flashlight into the driver\u2019s eyes in order to get his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>attention. What happened thereafter was described by Stotler as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">I returned into the vehicle after leaning out, and advised the officer that there was someone hunched down, [in the back seat] and we slacked up and pulled behind him, and broadcast that we were following a cab with the trouble light on, driver failed to stop for us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">We were about two car lengths behind it, and I saw movement in the rear of the vehicle, and I heard a thump, and the cab window was blown out and the glass and so forth was thrown out on our car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">We backed up further, and the helicopter [which by that time had joined in the pursuit] threw its lights over on the cab, and we extended our distance, knowing that we had been shot at.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The cab tried to lose the squad car by turning onto a side street. As it turned a corner, Officer Stotler observed the cab\u2019s rear passenger door open. Moments later he saw a man, whom he identified as appellant, jump out of the cab. Officer Mateo apprehended appellant shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">After appellant was arrested and placed in the custody of another officer on the scene, Stotler and Mateo located the driver, John Vaughn, several blocks away. After appellant and Vaughn were in custody, Stotler heard a \u201cknocking\u201d from the trunk and let Gibson out. In the cab they found a sawed-off shotgun with one spent cartridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Officer Mateo\u2019s description of the events leading to appellant\u2019s arrest was, with minor differences, consistent with that of Stotler. With respect to the shooting, Mateo testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">At around Cat\u00f3n Avenue the suspect in the back jumped up, fired a shot, glass sprayed all over our car making me fear for my life and Officer Stotler\u2019s life, so I backed off approximately ten car lengths.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The defense presented no evidence. Appellant\u2019s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal was denied. Thereafter, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>THE COURT: Anything else to present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">MR. QUISGARD [Defense counsel]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">THE COURT: The test is now beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty as to all four charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">\n<em>Any argument?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">MR. QUISGARD: <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">MR. SILVESTRI [Prosecutor]: Your Honor, I believe the State has met its burden as to the kidnapping and the assault. He had identified first of all the individual who pointed the shotgun and bailed out of the rear seat of the cab. The officer described the man with the brown coat who fired the blast and was in the back seat from where the blast came. The officers testified that they were placed in fear. Certainly it was danger, fired directly at the officers. Your Honor, whether or not the blast did actual damage to the officers is immaterial. Certainly there was an assault here, and they were placed in fear, backed off for their own protection, from any further attacks. And certainly there was an intent to kill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">As to the kidnapping, you heard that Mr. Gibson was placed in the trunk and carried away. Fortunately the officers were able to come to his aid and released him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">I believe, Your Honor, beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the robberies, the kidnapping and assault with intent to murder as to both officers. THE COURT: The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that there was a robbery of the victim in this case, Mr. Gibson, that robbery was at gun point, and there was an exchange of United States currency from the victim, Mr. Gibson, to the assailants in this case, more particularly to the defendant. So the Court finds that robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon has been sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">As to kidnapping, 105, the Court believes that the State has met its burden as to kidnapping in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">As to assault with intent, there was a shotgun blast from the cab in the direction of the police car. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>officers testified that they were in fear at that time. There was a shotgun found in the cab and the Court finds that the defendant was the one who pointed that weapon at the officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">Although there was no direct testimony that the weapon was fired by the defendant, there is evidence that the gun was in the possession of the defendant, and the Court believes it was with the intent to do bodily harm, and to strike a vital organ of the police officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\n<em>Premature Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Appellant, relying on <em>Spence v. State, </em>296 Md. 416, 463 A.2d 808 (1983) and <em>Jones v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 695, 466 A.2d 55 (1983), asserts that the trial judge committed reversible error by finding him guilty without first affording him the opportunity to present closing argument. On the other hand, appellee, relying on <em>Covington v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 454, 367 A.2d 974 (1977), <em>aff'd. </em>282 Md. 540, 386 A.2d 336 (1978) and M.R.P. 1085, contends that appellant failed to raise this issue at trial \u201cby objection or otherwise\u201d and is thus precluded from raising it for the first time on direct appeal. The issues are thus squarely presented: (1) Under <em>Covington, </em>what action was appellant obliged to take at the trial level in order to preserve for appellate review an alleged deprivation of the constitutional right to present closing argument? (2) If the right was denied below, does <em>Spence </em>require our reversal <em>per se, </em>despite the dictates of <em>Covington </em>and M.R.P. 1085? Both issues were resolved by the recent case of <em>Cherry v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 425, 489 A.2d 1138, (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">In <em>Cherry, </em>after a lengthy discussion of <em>Spence, Covington </em>and <em>Jones, </em>the Court reasoned that when a trial judge announces his verdict without first affording the defense an opportunity to present closing argument, \u201cthe defense is presented with at least three alternatives:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>(1) counsel may object to the premature verdict and request a mistrial. Under <em>Spence, </em>failure to grant a mistrial under these circumstances is reversible error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">(2) counsel may remain silent and proceed to the disposition stage of trial. Direct appellate review of the error is waived:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">(3) counsel may object to the premature verdict, request that the verdict be stricken, not move for mistrial and proceed with closing argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">62 Md.App. at 433-434, 489 A.2d 1138 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>although appellant requested closing argument at the trial court\u2019s invitation, the judge did not deprive him of the opportunity to argue until he announced his premature verdict. It is now clear from the discussion in <em>Cherry, supra, </em>that in order to preserve that error for direct appellate review, appellant was obliged to object to the trial court\u2019s action. M.R.P. 1085. For reasons which are not apparent from the record, he failed to do so and the issue is therefore not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">As in <em>Covington, </em>post conviction procedure remains available to appellant. Therefore \u201cour insistence that an appellate court reach its conclusions with full information before it in no way deprives [appellant] of any rights.\u201d 282 Md. at 545, 386 A.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">We are mindful that the factual posture of appellant\u2019s case is closely analogous to that presented in <em>Lee v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>56 Md.App. 613, 468 A.2d 656 (1984). In that case, as in <em>Jones v. State, </em>the court implicitly agreed with the State\u2019s contention that the appellant^ by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s premature verdict, waived the right to direct appellant review of the closing argument issue. Relying on language from <em>Jones, </em>however, the court nevertheless reversed on the issue, holding that <em>\u201cSpence ... </em>precludes us from exercising Rule 1085 discretion not to decide <em>the unpreserved issue.\" </em>56 Md.App. at 625, 468 A.2d 656 (quoting <em>Jones, </em>55 Md.App. at 700, 466 A.2d 55) (Emphasis added). This rule of reversal \u201cper se\u201d regardless of Rule 1085, as announced in <em>Jones </em>and applied in <em>Lee, </em>was expressly overruled in <em>Cherry </em>as inconsistent with the Court of Appeals holdings in <em>Spence </em>and <em>Covington. </em>62 Md.App. at 433, 489 A.2d 1138. Neither <em>Lee </em>nor <em>Jones </em>is helpful to appellant\u2019s cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADR\">Appellant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to permit a conviction for assault with intent to murder. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence the test is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Relying on cases from other jurisdictions, appellant specifically argues that the evidence was legally insufficient because it showed only that appellant fired at the squad car generally and not directly at any vital organ belonging to the officers inside. We have previously held that such facts can, as a matter of law, support an inference of assault with intent to murder. <em>See e.g. Woodard &amp; Demby v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 114, 123-4, 282 A.2d 9, <em>cert. denied, </em>263 Md. 723 (1971) (Evidence that appellants fired shots at pursuing police car sufficient to support inference that shooting was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>directed at vital organs of each officer with intent to do grievous injury). <em>Accord, Nickerson v. State, </em>22 Md.App. 660, 665, 325 A.2d 149 (1974) (Evidence that weapon is aimed toward human being and discharged in general direction of human being in random fashion supports inference of intent to murder); Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes, </em>\u00a7 5.03 (7th Ed.1967). In reliance on the foregoing authorities, we reject appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Multiple Counts of Assault</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Appellant argues that he cannot be convicted or sentenced for two counts of assault with intent to murder because, at best, the State proved that appellant fired only one shot at the two pursuing police officers. The essence of appellant\u2019s argument is that where one criminal incident results in multiple victims, it is necessarily but one offense. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In <em>Harris v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 248, 400 A.2d 6, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom, Countess v. State, </em>286 Md. 444, 408 A.2d 1302 (1979), the appellant was charged with two counts of violating Md.Ann.Code 1957, art. 27, \u00a7 386.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Harris was escaping from the scene of a robbery, when he fired four shots at two police officers who were attempting to apprehend him. He was subsequently charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with two counts of assaulting the officers with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension; one for each officer as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>saulted. The trial court convicted Harris of both counts and sentenced him to two consecutive five year terms of incarceration. We affirmed, holding that the single criminal incident constituted two separate violations of \u00a7 386. We stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">Although there is no case law addressing this precise issue with respect to Article 27, \u00a7 386, we note that there is much authority involving closely analogous situations. The Court of Appeals has held that assaults upon different victims, although arising out of the same transaction, are separate crimes. <em>Cousins v. State, </em>277 Md. 383, 354 A.2d 825, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1027, 97 S.Ct. 652, 50 L.Ed.2d 631 (1976); <em>Novak v. State, </em>139 Md. 538, 115 A. 853 (1921). <em>Cousins </em>is particularly apposite because of its factual similarity to the present case. There the defendant wielded a knife against two store detectives while escaping with stolen property. It was held that the defendant\u2019s acquittal on a charge of assaulting one of the detectives did not bar a subsequent prosecution for assault against the other detective because the two crimes were separate offenses. <em>We also note that the crime of assault is closely analogous to the offenses proscribed in Article 27, \u00a7 386.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">It is true that <em>Cousins </em>and <em>Novak </em>deal with principles of double jeopardy. Nevertheless, their value in the present case is that they demonstrate that <em>assaults against multiple victims arising out of the same criminal incident are separate and distinct crimes. See also Melville v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 118, 268 A.2d 497, <em>cert. denied, </em>259 Md. 729-734 (1970) and <em>Jones v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 608, 240 A.2d 347, <em>cert. denied, </em>251 Md. 750 (1968); 394 U.S. 993, 89 S.Ct. 1484, 22 L.Ed.2d 769 (1969). In both of those cases the defendants were convicted on separate counts of assault against different victims arising out of the same criminal incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">42 Md.App. at 258-9, 400 A.2d 6. (Emphasis added). <em>See also, </em>Gilbert &amp; Moylan, <em>Maryland Criminal Law: </em>Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 37.6, p. 444 (If in the course of a single ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>assault ... a defendant ... assaults ... multiple victims, then the number of victims determines the number of units of legitimate prosecution.) Provided the State can prove that appellant, in firing only one shot at the moving police car, intended to murder or cause grievous bodily harm to each officer and that each officer had a reasonable fear of such consequences, we see no bar to multiple prosecutions under the particular facts of this case. Of course, where a defendant is convicted of two crimes, he is subject to a penalty for each violation. <em>Harris, </em>42 Md.App. at 259, 400 A.2d 6; <em>Kaylor v. State, </em>285 Md. 66, 70, 400 A.2d 419 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-10\">. At post-conviction proceedings, \u201cevidentiary issues may be fully explored [and] [t]he Court will have before it a full record upon which to determine whether the right of closing argument ... was denied ... whether [the defendant] knowingly waived such argument, or whether such argument was waived as a matter of trial tactics.\u201d <em>Covington, </em>282 Md. at 544-5, 386 A.2d 336, <em>Cherry, </em>62 Md.App. at 431, 489 A.2d 1138.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\">. Under this scenario, the defendant would have made a tactical choice between moving for a mistrial and proceeding with the closing argument; having received what he requested, he could not thereafter on direct appeal claim error. <em>See Cherry </em>at 434, 489 A.2d 1138. Obviously, this tactical decision could be reviewed in post-conviction proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\">.
