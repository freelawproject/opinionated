Mullendore, vice-president of appellee Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Company, sued Mercantile and Mullendore in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. In their declaration they charged, among other things, violation of the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act (count I) and intentional infliction of severe emotional dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tress (count II).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court eventually sustained appellees\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend. Appellants aver that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Specifically, appellants argue that the transaction that produced the debt-collection activity was a consumer transaction as defined in \u00a7 14-201(c) of the Commercial Law Article. On the basis of this, they contend that Mullendore (and through him Mercantile) used sufficiently \u201cobscene or grossly abusive language in communicating with [them]\u201d to present a jury question of violation of \u00a7 14-202(7). And they aver that Mullendore\u2019s (and hence the Bank\u2019s) conduct was so \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d as to entitle them to present to a jury their claim of intentional infliction of severe emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Since these questions arise on demurrer, we accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of appellants\u2019 second amended declaration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To withstand a demurrer, a declaration \u201cneed only allege facts which, if proven, would entitle [the plaintiffs] to relief.\u201d <em>Tadjer v. Montgomery County, </em>61 Md.App. 492, 502-03, 487 A.2d 658 (1985). Our first endeavor, therefore, must be to summarize the well-pleaded facts in appellants\u2019 declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">According to the declaration, appellants are licensed pilots, although neither is employed as a commercial pilot. They have a residence in Frederick, Maryland, and another in West Point, Virginia. There are airports near both residences, thus making it convenient to commute between their residences by air.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>In 1981, appellants purchased a 1980 Arrow Aircraft. To fund the purchase they borrowed $93,042 from Mercantile. The loan was to be repaid in 84 consecutive monthly installments of $1,107.65, beginning on March 26, 1981. To help defray the cost of the airplane, appellants occasionally leased it to others when they were not using it for personal and family purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Appellants failed to make all their monthly payments on time. Because of their delinquencies, three telephone conversations and one meeting took place, including either or both of appellants and appellee Mullendore. These incidents occurred over a period of about nine months, beginning in May 1982. Putting aside appellants\u2019 conclusory characterizations of Mullendore\u2019s conduct and language as \u201cthreatening, grossly abusive, vindictive, unprofessional and extreme and outrageous,\u201d we find the following factual allegations in the declaration:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Mullendore shouted at appellants and spoke in angry tones. He said he had heard they were getting a divorce. He threatened that if appellants declared bankruptcy he would attach their homes and wages. He insisted that delinquent payments be made in cash, rather than by check. He demanded that they not contest a summary judgment proceeding Mercantile had brought to collect its indebtedness. At a meeting with Mrs. Dick at the Frederick Airport, following a third repossession of the airplane, Mullendore again threatened to attach her house and salary, insisted on payment of $441, and thanks to his arrogance, reduced Mrs. Dick to tears. After a fourth repossession, Mullendore called Mrs. Dick at her office and shouted so loudly that a third party who was present could hear his remarks. He interrupted Mrs. Dick throughout this conversation, accused her of lying, and said \u201c[yjou\u2019re not as stupid as you act.\u201d When Mrs. Dick suggested that Mercantile might be liable for lost rentals on the airplane, he yelled \u201c[A]re you trying to scare me? I\u2019m not afraid of something like you.\u201d Later, Mullendore reported to The Credit Bu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>reau, Inc., that Mrs. Dick had a history of delinquent credit obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The question we now address is whether these facts, if proven, would be sufficient to sustain an action either for intentional infliction of emotional distress or for violation of \u00a7 14-202(7) of the Commercial Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>Infliction of Emotional Distress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are set forth in <em>Harris v. Jones, </em>281 Md. 560, 566, 380 A.2d 611 (1977), <em>affirming Jones v. Harris, </em>35 Md.App. 556, 371 A.2d 1104 (1977). They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">(1) The conduct must be intentional and reckless;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(2) The conduct must be extreme and outrageous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">(3) There must be a causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the emotional distress;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">(4) The emotional distress must be severe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">All of these elements must \u201ccoalesce\u201d if liability is to be imposed. <em>Id. </em>We focus here on the second element. If the allegations were not sufficient to show extreme and outrageous conduct, the demurrer was properly sustained as to count II even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the other three elements were adequately alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">As to what constitutes extreme and outrageous conduct in the context of this tort, the Court of Appeals has quoted with approval comment d to \u00a7 46, <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts. Vance v. Vance, </em>286 Md. 490, 506, 408 A.2d 728 (1979); <em>Harris, </em>281 Md. at 567, 380 A.2d 611. That comment explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">Liability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. [Liability does not extend, however,] to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities. The rough edges of our society are still in need of a good deal of filing down, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the meantime plaintiffs must necessarily be expected and required to be hardened to a certain amount of rough language, and to occasional acts that are definitely inconsiderate and unkind____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Put otherwise, extreme and outrageous conduct exists only if \u201cthe average member of the community must regard the defendant\u2019s conduct ... as being a complete denial of the plaintiff\u2019s dignity as a person.\u201d <em>Alsteen v. Gehl, </em>21 Wis.2d 349, 124 N.W.2d 312, 318 (1963). We do not think Mullendore\u2019s conduct, as alleged, achieved this level of outrageousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The threats made by Mullendore were essentially that he, or Mercantile, would attach appellants\u2019 home and wages. A creditor has a right to insist on payment of a just debt, however, and may \u201cthreaten to resort to proper legal procedures to enforce the obligation, even if the steps taken cause some degree of mental anguish and anxiety.\u201d An-not., 87 A.L.R.3d 201, 205 (1978). As to the repossessions, appellees had the right to repossess the collateral when appellants were in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">As to harassment by telephone call, the number of calls involved here were fewer, and their content less threatening, than those held not to constitute harassment in <em>Household Finance Corp. v. Bridge, </em>252 Md. 531, 250 A.2d 878 (1969). Moreover, one of the calls in the case <em>sub judice </em>was initiated by Mrs. Dick, not by Mullendore. The \u201clying\u201d accusation may have been rude, but it surely did not amount to \u201ca complete denial of [Mrs. Dick\u2019s] dignity as a person.\u201d So far as shouting is concerned, the declaration suggests that this was often mutual and that there was considerable thrust and parry during the conversations. In any case, in <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Mirabile, </em>52 Md.App. 387, 405, 449 A.2d 1176 (1982), we held that \u201cyelling and screaming\u201d by a supervisor at \u201can extremely sensitive young man,\u201d although perhaps rude and violent, did not amount to conduct so extreme and outrageous as to establish intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Nor can the inquiries about appellants\u2019 marital status be viewed as extreme and outrageous under the circumstances. Mullendore was concerned about a delinquent $93,000 loan, the primary source for repayment of which was the joint incomes of Mr. and Mrs. Dick. Appellants themselves offered their (apparently temporary) separation as an excuse for some missed payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The conduct and language involved in cases such as <em>Harris </em>and <em>Mirabile </em>fairly can be said to have been more egregious than that alleged here, yet in those cases recovery was denied. Of similar import is <em>Beye v. Bureau of National Affairs, </em>59 Md.App. 642, 477 A.2d 1197, <em>cert. denied, </em>301 Md. 639, 484 A.2d 274 (1984). There, the plaintiff alleged that for six years, his supervisor, among other things, \u201cthreatened to fire him, harassed him and physically assaulted him____\u201d Affirming the sustaining of a demurrer, we held that the allegations failed to establish extreme and outrageous conduct. <em>See also Alsteen, </em>124 N.W.2d 312; and <em>Public Finance Corp. v. Davis, </em>66 Ill.2d 85, 4 Ill.Dec. 652, 360 N.E.2d 765 (1976). The short of it is that if appellants\u2019 allegations are true (as we must take them to be for purposes of demurrer), Mullendore\u2019s language and conduct was rude, discourteous, uncivil, and even to some extent unreasonable. It was not what one would expect of a high-ranking officer of a major financial institution. Mr. Jarvis Lorry would not have acted so in attempting to collect a debt for Tellson\u2019s Bank.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But when we apply the teaching of the Maryland cases, we cannot hold that appellants\u2019 declaration charged extreme and outrageous conduct sufficient to establish the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\n<em>Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Section 14-202 of the Commercial Law Art. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>In collecting or attempting to collect an alleged debt a collector may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">* S}! Jfc Sic $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">(7) Use obscene or grossly abusive language in communicating with the debtor or a person related to him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJq\">By virtue of \u00a7 14-203 \u201c[a] collector who violates any provision of this subtitle is liable for any damages proximately caused by the violation, including damages for emotional distress or mental anguish suffered with or without accompanying physical injury.\u201d Count I of appellants\u2019 second amended declaration sought to impose liability on appellees pursuant to these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Sections 14-202 and 14-203 apply only when a \u201ccollector\u201d is attempting to collect \u201can alleged debt.\u201d A \u201ccollector\u201d is \u201ca person collecting or attempting to collect an alleged debt arising out of a consumer transaction.\u201d Section 14-201(b). A \u201cconsumer transaction\u201d is \u201cany transaction involving a person seeking or acquiring real or personal property, services, money, or credit for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d Section 14-201(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The parties disagree as to whether appellants\u2019 purchase of the airplane, and the attendant loan, constituted a \u201cconsumer transaction.\u201d According to appellants, the transaction is covered if the airplane was to be used \u201cprimarily\u201d for \u201cpersonal, family, or household purposes.\u201d Appellees, on the other hand, assert that the statute applies only if the airplane was to be used \u201cexclusively\u201d for those purposes. The issue arises because of appellants\u2019 admission that the airplane was at least occasionally to be leased to others. It is a difficult one because the statutory definition of \u201cconsumer transaction\u201d contains neither the adverb \u201cprimarily\u201d nor the adverb \u201cexclusively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The trial court agreed with appellees\u2019 construction. Whether that was error we need not determine. Even if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>assume, without deciding, that the transaction was within the statute, we hold that Mullendore\u2019s language was not \u201cgrossly abusive.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1976). We do not think that threats to use lawful procedures to collect a delinquent debt fall within this definition. The same is true with respect to inquiries about marital status \u2014 at least in the context of this case \u2014 as well as to Mullendore\u2019s remark that he didn\u2019t \u201cgive a damn\u201d whether appellants took bankruptcy, and his reference to the \u201cdamn airplane.\u201d Some of this may have been harsh, but it was not insulting. Mullendore\u2019s characterization of Mrs. Dick as a liar may have been both harsh and insulting, and hence, abusive. But the statute calls for language that is \u201cgrossly\u201d abusive. Whether this requirement must equate with \u201cextreme and outrageous,\u201d we need not decide. It requires language that is more than merely abusive, \u2014 language that is \u201cflagrantly\u201d (Webster\u2019s) or \u201cgreatly\u201d <em>(Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(Rev. 4th ed.)) abusive. As a matter of law, we hold that Mullendore\u2019s language, as alleged, was not \u201cgrossly abusive.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the demurrer to count I was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
