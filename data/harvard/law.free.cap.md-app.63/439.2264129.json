BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rickey Eiler, appellant, was convicted of felony murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, of which all but thirty years was suspended. Appellant presents the following questions on this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">1. Did the trial court commit prejudicial error in refusing to permit testimony by Dr. Michael Spodak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>regarding the State\u2019s key witness\u2019 psychological history?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">2. Did the trial court commit prejudicial error when it refused to permit appellant the right to present evidence and/or cross-examine the State\u2019s witness regarding pending criminal charges to show bias, prejudice or coercion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">3. Did the trial court commit prejudicial error by permitting the State to cross-examine the appellant about certain derogatory remarks made in the first trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Dorothy Pirotte, an important State\u2019s witness and appellant\u2019s accomplice, testified at trial that she and appellant had planned to rob the victim, Harris Smuckler, of his money and jewelry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plan, conceived by appellant, was that Pirotte would lure Smuckler into her bedroom to engage in sex and appellant would hit him with a stick and then overcome him. When appellant struck Smuckler as planned, Smuckler fought back, which resulted in appellant\u2019s repeatedly striking him, causing his death. The victim\u2019s body was placed in the trunk of the victim\u2019s car, along with several bloody items from Pirotte\u2019s bedroom, and driven to a wooded area, where the bloody items were discarded. The car, with Smuckler\u2019s body still in the trunk, was left in Dundee Village. Appellant and Pirotte returned by taxi to Pirotte\u2019s home and finished cleaning the murder scene. Pirotte and appellant divided money taken from Smuckler and appellant appropriated a pouch containing diamond rings, also taken from Smuckler. Significant during her testimony, on both direct and cross-examination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>was Pirotte\u2019s frequent inability to remember specific incidents, details and conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">On cross-examination, although testified to on direct, appellant delved into Pirotte\u2019s use of cocaine on the day of the murder, her plea agreement with the State,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the fact that she had been convicted of second degree murder, in connection with Smuckler\u2019s death, at the time that she testified. It was also brought out that she was under medication \u2014 Mellaril, 50 miligrams per day and Elavil \u2014 prescribed by a psychiatrist,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> whom she saw once per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Appellant sought to offer the testimony of Dr. Spodak as to Pirotte\u2019s mental history. Because Dr. Spodak had not personally examined her, it was proposed that he testify, not from her conversations with her psychiatrists, but from the records compiled at the County Detention Center while Pirotte was detained there; specifically, it was proffered that he would testify as to Pirotte\u2019s psychological diagnosis and the dosage and type of medication prescribed for her.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant contended at trial, as he does now, that Dr. Spodak\u2019s testimony would have revealed that the disorders suffered by Pirotte \u201ccould have altered her perception in such a manner so as to discredit her testimony\u201d. He further urged, as he does now, relying on <em>Reese v. State, </em>54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Md.App. 281, 458 A.2d 492 (1983), that this testimony was admissible despite the psychiatrist/patient privilege.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The State countered with a motion <em>in limine </em>in which it requested that the testimony be prohibited. The State complained then, as it does now, that because the testimony would rely on records and reports compiled by psychiatrists, and which contained statements made by Pirotte to those psychiatrists, the records are privileged. On appeal, the State additionally contends that the admissibility of Spodak\u2019s testimony has not been preserved for appellate review, appellant having failed to offer the testimony after its motion <em>in limine </em>was granted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">A motion <em>in limine </em>is not a ruling on the evidence. It is a \u201cprocedural step prior to the offer of evidence\u201d, which serves the purpose of pointing out, before trial, certain evidentiary rulings that the court may be called upon to make. <em>Funkhouser v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 16, 440 A.2d 1114 (1982). Neither the grant nor the denial of such a motion constitutes reversible error. <em>Id., Offutt v. State, </em>44 Md.App. 670, 410 A.2d 611 (1980). If the admission of evidence is foreclosed by the ruling on the motion, an attempt to introduce the evidence at trial must be made by the way of proffer, <em>Funkhouser v. State, supra, </em>or an objection must be interposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>There is no exception to the ... rule, which requires the recording of an objection in the trial below, where the question of admissibility of evidence has previously been raised in a pre-trial motion <em>in limine.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><em>Lapelosa v. Cruze, </em>44 Md.App. 202, 207, 407 A.2d 786 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>287 Md. 754 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">After the trial judge\u2019s ruling on the motion <em>in limine, </em>the following colloquy occurred between appellant\u2019s counsel and the court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">MR. WHITE: May I say something just for the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axy4\">THE COURT: Yeah, you certainly may, and you may obviously proffer your testimony of Dr. Spodak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">MR. WHITE: Number one, I would proffer that it would be a conflict of interest for Mr. Steigerwald and Mr. Moore to be representing the witness, Dorothy Pirotte. Their interest doesn\u2019t necessarily coincide with her interest in this matter; their interest being to simply win their case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">Number two, I would proffer that Dr. Spodak could give testimony based on facts other than communications between Dorothy Pirotte and her psychiatrists, and could give expert testimony in that regard without going into any communications between Dr. Rinn or the other psychiatrist and Dorothy Pirotte, which would not violate the statute, (footnote added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">THE COURT: Okay. Do you want to put anything else on the record, Mr. White, with regard to what Dr. Spodak\u2019s testimony would be, unless very possibly by agreement \u2014 and I am just suggesting \u2014 that need not be \u2014 that between you and the State you could proffer that his testimony would be as it was in the prior trial and in the transcript. I don\u2019t know. The State may not be agreeable, and you may not be agreeable; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>you can give further consideration to it, or you can put on the record, if you so desire for preservation of the record what you would proffer would be Dr. Spodak\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">MR. WHITE: Well I would proffer \u2014 one thing would be his testimony that he would describe what the drug Mellaril is used for; and the doses that Dorothy received, is used for psychosis. He could describe what psychosis is, number one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">He could further \u2014 after review of the records he could describe that Dorothy Pirotte has been found by a psychiatrist at the County Jail to be suffering from psychosis, schizophrenia, paranoia, that she was suicidal; and I think he could do that without going into any communications between her and her doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">I think the relative importance of this testimony certainly outweighs any other considerations in the case. That would be it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The colloquy clearly demonstrates that following the court\u2019s ruling on the motion <em>in limine, </em>appellant made a proffer of Dr. Spodak\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, that proffer was adequate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">... a proffer to permit an initial questioning regarding credibility needs but minimal support. Apparently it need be little more than an \u201carticulable suspicion\u201d, or at most \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that the facts elicited will be relevant to credibility. (Citation omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-10\"><em>Reese v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 281, 288, 458 A.2d 492 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"AVi\">In <em>Reese </em>we faced, in a somewhat different context, the very issue which is here presented. The defendant there was charged with armed robbery. He sought to cross-examine the victim as to his psychiatric history, proffering that the victim had been a patient receiving treatment at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Springfield State Hospital. The court sought additional psychiatric information from the Medical Administrator of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore, which resulted in the further proffer that the victim had a substantial psychiatric history, including a contemporary instability which affected his contact with reality. Despite this proffer and the fact that the major issue in the case was the credibility of the victim, the trial court refused to allow the defendant to cross-examine the victim regarding his psychiatric history. We were thus called upon to determine \"... at what point the judge\u2019s discretion totally to restrict credibility cross-examination of a witness begins and ends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, 458 A.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We began our inquiry by noting the role that cross-examination plays in insuring that a defendant is afforded a fair trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We next sought to determine the proper balance between the right of the defendant to cross-examine his accusers and the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d of the trial judge to determine the scope of cross-examination. We concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">What is referred to as a \u201cbroad discretion\u201d of the trial judge, upon examination, becomes a narrow one. The right to discredit an accuser being of constitutional dimension ... can be but limitedly circumscribed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 286, 458 A.2d 492. And further that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">The \u201cdiscretion\u201d then, between the defendant\u2019s right to discredit testimony and the trial judge\u2019s duty to protect a witness is solely one of relevance of the questions to the witness\u2019s credibility. The relevancy test at this juncture does not regard the elucidation of one of the main issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>at trial, it is whether the answer elicited will be a useful aid to the court or jury in appraising the credibility (not necessarily the veracity) of the witness and in assessing the probative value of his direct testimony. (Citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 287, 458 A.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Recognizing that the parameters of relevance are vague when credibility is at issue, that cross-examination is often exploratory, and that too tight a rein on cross-examination may defeat its purpose and effectiveness, we particularly pointed out that exploratory questions should be liberally, but carefully, allowed when the matter inquired into is subject to statutory protection. Recognizing that discretion must still be exercised in determining if a particular psychiatric disorder affects credibility,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we endorsed its careful exercise so as to maintain a balance between the need to control cross-examination and the value of exploratory questioning. Having found, in light of the proffer, that cross-examination had been unduly restricted, we reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Proceeding to a consideration of the case <em>sub judice, </em>we note at the outset that appellant\u2019s chief argument relates to the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the testimony of Dr. Spodak. Notwithstanding this difference, he argues that <em>Reese is </em>apposite and mandates reversal. The State responds on several fronts. First, it contends that the court properly could have construed Dr. Spodak\u2019s testimony as involving \u201ccommunications relating to diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional disorder\u201d and therefore privileged. Second, it argues that because Dr. Spodak did not examine Pirotte, \u201cthe trial court properly determined that Dr. Spodak should not be allowed to testify\u201d. Finally, the State questions the adequacy of the proffer, suggesting that it did not provide a nexus between Pirotte\u2019s condition and how that condition could have affect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ed her credibility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We think the testimony of Dr. Spodak should have been allowed. We will explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We find <em>Reese </em>to be particularly apposite. As in <em>Reese, </em>the court had before it evidence, by way of testimony and proffer, that a key State\u2019s witness had a psychiatric history and a current mental condition which required her to take two medications prescribed by psychiatrists, whom she saw once a week. In addition, it had before it the proffer that the witness, while detained in the County Detention Center shortly after the murder, had been found by psychiatrists to be suffering from psychosis, schizophrenia, paranoia, and to be suicidal. Further, the court was advised that Dr. Spodak would define, in detail, what psychosis means and would describe the conditions for the treatment of which Mellaril<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is prescribed. In addition to all of the foregoing, Pirotte\u2019s testimony was replete with instances of non-recall. On this record, we think it patent that inquiry was likely to disclose defects in relevant factors of credibility. A synthesis of the proffers indicates that appellant offered to demonstrate not only that Pirotte was probably suffering from a mental disorder or disorders, but also that such disorder or disorders could affect her ability accurately to perceive and relate the events about which she testified. See footnote 13, <em>supra. </em>This case, therefore, is different from <em>Testerman v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 257, 486 A.2d 233 (1985), in which no evidence was present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ed to show that the mental disorder (schizophrenia) attributed to the witness would, or was likely to, affect that witness\u2019 credibility, with respect to his ability to perceive, to remember or to relate events accurately.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">That the psychiatrist/patient privilege applies to this case is clear. Its applicability, however, cannot prohibit the liberal, but careful, allowance of exploratory questions into Pirotte\u2019s mental condition for the purpose of testing her credibility. <em>Reese, supra, </em>54 Md.App. at 289, 458 A.2d 492. Nor does the fact that Dr. Spodak did not examine Pirotte affect our decision. Only the weight of his testimony, not its admissibility, is affected by this lack of examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Before leaving this issue, we point out that the trial court did not consider the admissibility of Dr. Spodak\u2019s testimony from the standpoint of its relevance to Pirotte\u2019s credibility. We have found error on that basis. Therefore, we feel constrained to say, as we did in <em>Reese, </em>that \u201c[w]hile that may not seem fair to the trial judge who [sits in a more frenzied atmosphere], it is not the judge who is on trial. Our review is not concerned with fairness to him, but only whether he has been so to the accused.\u201d <em>Reese, supra, </em>at 291, 292, 458 A.2d 492. In this ruling, he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Although the issue is an interesting one, given the unique factual circumstance in which it arose, we will not address appellant\u2019s second issue. We will address his third issue to avoid a recurrence on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">During the cross-examination of appellant, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">Q.

McCormick, <em>Handbook of the Law of Evidence </em>\u00a7 185 (3rd ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">If material and relevant, still, the trial judge must view the evidence in context, <em>Weiner v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 548, 464 A.2d 1096 (1983) and weigh its probative value against the risk of prejudicial impact. <em>Blondes v. Hayes, </em>29 Md.App. 663, 350 A.2d 163 (1976). <em>Moore v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., </em>575 F.Supp. 919 (Md.1983). Evidence should be excluded if it may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s prejudice, hostility, or sympathy. <em>Weiner v. State, supra; Smith v. Executive Club, Ltd., </em>458 A.2d 32 (D.C.App.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Appellant alleges that the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence since the evidence was prejudicial and without probative value, and was likely to cause black jurors to look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>unfavorably upon him because of his racial comments. The State responds that permitting the testimony was not an abuse of discretion because all prospective jurors were voir dired as to whether testimony concerning racial slurs would adversely affect their impartiality<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and because appellant failed to preserve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We find the line of questioning to have been prejudicial, irrelevant, and collateral. We can conceive no possible basis for it and the State does not suggest any. It had no tendency to prove any material issue in the case. The situation was exacerbated by the State unnecessarily prodding appellant to repeat his prior statements merely for the purpose of showing his racial prejudice. We warn the State and advise the trial judge that the State\u2019s conduct in this regard was reprehensible and will not be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We agree that voir dire of prospective jurors is a factor to be considered in determining if error is harmless; however, it is but one factor. When we view the totality of the circumstances surrounding the improper cross-examination, we conclude that the trial judge erred and that the error was not harmless. <em>Dorsey v.

The trial judge stated that \u201d[t]he Court believes that in permitting Dr. Spodak to testify that it would be in direct contravention of the assertion of Dorothy Pirotte\u2019s privilege, in that Dr. Spodak must of necessity rely upon the reports of the psychiatrist ...\u201d Thus, his ruling was based on the applicability of the patient/psychiatrist privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">A second basis for the ruling was that Dr. Spodak\u2019s prior testimony, which was reviewed by the judge, indicated that Dr. Spodak's opinion may have been different if he had examined Pirotte.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\">. The State represented in the motion <em>in limine </em>that Pirotte had assigned Joseph Steigerwald and David Moore, both Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys, as her authorized representatives to assert her psychiatrist-client privilege. <em>See, </em>Md.Code Ann., Courts Article \u00a7 9-109(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b475-11\">. While the ruling and the proffer were both made in the judge\u2019s chambers, the proffer being made immediately following the ruling, we do not perceive that as in any way affecting the preservation of the objection for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\">. We pointed out that in <em>Alford v. U.S., </em>282 U.S. 687, 51 S.Ct. 218, 75 L.Ed. 624 (1931), the right of cross-examinations was characterized by the Supreme Court \"as the essence of a fair trial\"; that the Fifth Circuit in <em>U.S. v. Williams, </em>592 F.2d 1277 (1979), interpreted the Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine for purposes of impeachment as requiring a particularly wide scope on matters relevant to credibility; and that the Eleventh Circuit in <em>U.S. v. Lindstrom, </em>698 F.2d 1154 (1983) considered the denial of broad latitude in cross-examining a witness as to his mental condition an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\">. <em>Testerman v. State, </em>infra, is an example of the proper exercise of discretion by the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\">. A somewhat similar argument (that psychiatric evidence raises only a collateral issue) was rejected in <em>United States v. Lindstrom, </em>supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\">. The proffer made after the ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>was not as detailed as the proffer made during argument on the motion. At that time, appellant\u2019s counsel read from the prior testimony of Dr. Spodak. Significantly, in that testimony Dr. Spodak, in describing the drug, Mellaril, testified that it was a major tranquilizer, indicated \"for individuals who may become psychotic or lose touch with reality\u201d and \"for the individual who is, has a serious mental illness, has schizophrenia, has an inability to distinguish what is real from what is imaginary ...\u201d Not only did the trial court hear this testimony read, it had access to the transcript, which it reviewed on the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b480-26\">. \"Spade\u201d is a derogatory term used to describe a Black person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\">. A typical question asked on voir dire to prospective Black jurors was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">Let me ask you something \u2014 if any phase of the evidence came out that something was something like a racial slur or something like that referring to a black person as a spade, would that prejudice or bias you to the extent that you might be influenced by it, rather than ' from the evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">All prospective jurors responded in the negative.
