Put another way, can the combination of a heart attack and pre-existing atherosclerosis be legally the result of \u201cone accident\u201d? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Appellee, Charles W. Street, III, suffered a heart attack after chasing and apprehending a shoplifting suspect at Lucky Stores on December 14, 1978. At the time, Street was employed full time as a Prince George\u2019s County police officer and part-time (20-25 hours per week) as a security guard for Lucky Stores. Prince George\u2019s County permitted and encouraged their officers to accept such employment. Pursuant to a claim for Worker\u2019s Compensation, Street testified before the Commission that he experienced pains in his chest and left arm after apprehending the suspect. He made the arrest in his capacity as a police officer and then returned to the store floor and finished his shift. Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>then went home but still did not feel well and, accordingly, drove himself to the hospital. He was admitted to the coronary care unit for a period of ten days and readmitted three months later after experiencing additional chest pains.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Street never returned to his job as a police officer or as a security guard following the incident. He retired from the police force after a six month sick leave and is currently employed as a bartender.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Street initially filed a worker\u2019s compensation action (Claim # A791606) against Prince George\u2019s County on June 15, 1980, based on the statutory presumption that his heart attack was an occupational disease. Testimony was taken before the Medical Board on December 2, 1980. Prior to any decision in that case, Street filed an additional claim against Lucky Stores and its insurer (Travelers) alleging that the heart attack was an accidental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The Medical Board issued its finding of no occupational disease on April 29, 1981, finding that \u201cthe claimant ha[d] coronary artherosclerosis which is not considered to be an occupational disease.\u201d The Board took note of Street\u2019s family history of heart disease and his IV2-2 packs of cigarettes per day habit.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">A hearing was held before the Commission on December 9, 1983, during which the accidental injury claim was heard for the first time and the Medical Board\u2019s decision was reviewed. Street again testified that he was employed by Lucky Stores on the date of the incident but acted in the capacity of a police officer when making the actual arrest. Street testified that he chased the suspect approximately 150 feet and that only one of ten arrests (per year) involved a chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The Commission issued its award on January 11, 1984, and reversed the decision of the Medical Board, <em>i.e., </em>found that Street had suffered an occupational disease. Both employers were held jointly liable for medical expenses. Street was deemed to have a \u201cpermanent partial disability under 'Other Cases\u2019 amounting to 85% industrial loss of use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>of his body, 55% under \u2018Other Cases\u2019 is due to the aforesaid occupational disease, and 30% thereof is due to a pre-existing condition.\u201d Each employer was ordered to pay a total of $24,772.50 divided into weekly installments and an additional $10,200.00 was to be paid by the Subsequent Injury Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">A rehearing was held on April 11, 1984, and a modified award of compensation was issued on April 30th. In that award, the Commission cut off all temporary total benefits as to the occupational disease finding that those wages had been fully paid but affirmed the award (A 791606) in all other respects. The Commission then specifically addressed the issue of accidental injury (A 809879) and found that \u201cthe claimant sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment on December 14, 1978; and that the disability of the claimant is causally related to the aforesaid accidental injury and not occupational disease ____\u201d Lucky Stores was held \u201cresponsible for one-half of $49,545.00 and the Commission will modify said Order of this Commission dated January 11, 1984____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Lucky Stores and Prince George\u2019s County noted an appeal to the Circuit Court and filed motions for partial summary judgment on the permissibility of an enhanced award under these facts. Lucky Stores (and its insurer, Travelers) framed the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">Under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation law of Maryland, may the total disability resulting from <em>both </em>an occupational disease and an accidental injury be combined, so as to result in a \u2018serious disability,\u2019 thereby requiring each of two separate employers to pay the increased benefits provided by Section 36(4a) of Article 101?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">In an Opinion and Order dated August 6, 1984, Judge Rea denied the employer-insurer\u2019s motion. \u201cThe finding of the Commission was that the 55% disability was the result of the single myocardial infarction suffered by the claimant. No portion of that figure was allocated to pre-existing conditions.\u201d The trial court further opined: \u201cNotwithstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ing the fact that the claimant has sought recovery from two defendants, the heart attack was a single accidental event. The occupational disease found by the Commission was the heart attack itself, not a pre-existing heart disease.\u201d The trial judge concluded that there was \u201cbut one accident, and two theories of recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Following this adverse ruling, Lucky Stores, their insurer and the County filed a \u201cJoint Motion for Entry of Final Judgment\u201d withdrawing all issues \u201cexcept that issue pertaining to the Award of 'serious disability\u2019 benefits in this case.\u201d The trial judge granted this motion by a final order dated October 9, 1984. A timely appeal was noted and the only issue is whether Md.Ann. Code art. 101 \u00a7 36(4a) (1979, Cum.Supp.1984) permits disability benefits awarded for an accidental injury to be combined with an award for an occupational disease to constitute a serious disability award.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">This appeal arises solely from the interpretation of art. 101 \u00a7 36(4a) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\"><em>Serious disability. </em>\u2014 A person who, from one accident, receives an award of compensation for a period of two hundred and fifty (250) weeks or more under subsections (3) or (4) or a combination of both, is thereby considered to have a serious disability; except any award for disfigurement or mutilation under subsection (3)(f) of this section shall not be considered a determination of serious disability. The weeks for such award shall be increased by one third (computed to the nearest whole number); and the compensation shall be for sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages, in no case to exceed sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the State average weekly wage of the State of Maryland as determined by the Department of Employment Security. The Department of Employment Security shall report the average weekly wage of the State of Maryland as of July 1, to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission Commission no later than December 15th each year. In no case shall the employee receive less than a minimum of fifty dollars per week unless the employee\u2019s established week<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ly wages are less than fifty dollars per week at the time of injury, in which event he shall receive compensation equal to his full wages. This subsection, to the extent of any inconsistency, prevails over subsections (3) and (4); but otherwise subsections (3) and (4) apply to persons covered by this subsection. Provided, however, that any additional compensation for permanent partial disability on a petition to reopen shall not increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and actually paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The language at issue is \u201cfrom one accident.\u201d Appellants argue that the statute provides \u201cadditional benefits for employees severely injured in a single work-related accident.\u201d They argue further that the Commission \u201cignored the clear legislative intent, and awarded serious disability benefits to Mr. Street by combining an occupational disease claim and an accidental injury claim for a single award.\u201d Essentially, appellant feels that the two claims, filed against two employers, were erroneously treated as a single claim by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Appellee counters that \u201ca single <em>incident </em>giving rise to two distinct theories of recovery under Worker\u2019s Compensation law can be considered \u2018one accident\u2019 for purposes of \u2018serious disability\u2019 benefits.\u201d (emphasis added). Appellee points out that each claim, <em>i.e., </em>the accidental injury and the occupational disease, arose \u201cout of a <em>single incident, </em>that being the heart attack of December 14, 1978.\u201d Hence, the appellee essentially interprets the term \u201cone accident\u201d to mean a single incident or \u201cevent from which the disability arises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">This court recently interpreted this statutory language, albeit in a different context, in <em>Barbee v. Hecht Co., </em>61 Md.App. 356, 486 A.2d 785 (1985). The issue in that case was \u201cwhether the \u2018serious disability\u2019 rates of compensation set forth in Md.Ann. Code art. 101 \u00a7 36(4a) (1957, 1984 Cum.Supp.) may be applied to the Subsequent Injury Fund.\u201d 61 Md.App. at 357-58, 486 A.2d 785. Barbee injured his back while working at the Hecht Company and filed for Worker\u2019s Compensation benefits. At the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>it was discovered that Barbee had a pre-existing impairment to his right eye and the Commission ordered that the Subsequent Injury Fund be impleaded. After an additional hearing, the Commission ruled \u201cthat [Barbee\u2019s] back injury amounted to a 25% industrial loss of the use of his body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358, 486 A.2d 785. Barbee was awarded $75 per week at the \u201cstraight rate\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for 125 weeks for his back injury to be paid by the employer-insurer and $74.00 per week (also paid at the \u201cstraight rate\u201d) for 250 weeks to be paid by the Fund. Both parties appealed the decision. Barbee claimed that the benefits he was receiving from the Fund should have been paid at the \u201cserious disability\u201d rate. Barbee\u2019s argument was characterized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">He reasons that Md.Ann. Code art. 101, \u00a7 66(1) (1957, 1984 Cum.Supp.), which explains how one qualifies for payments from the Fund, must be read in <em>pari materia </em>with Section 36, which alone provides for the amount and method of payment. When this is done, appellant urges, it becomes apparent that an injured worker who is awarded 250 weeks of compensation for a single pre-existing impairment is entitled to receive those payments at the \u2018serious disability\u2019 rate from the Fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 486 A.2d 785. Barbee argued that compensation awarded under \u00a7 36(4a) for \u201cone accident\u201d \u201cmay include both weeks for a pre-existing impairment and weeks for the specific new injury,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>he urged a broad reading of the phrase \u201cfrom one accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 486 A.2d 785. The Fund disagreed and countered that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of \u2018from one accident\u2019 ... excludes conditions\u2014 such as pre-existing impairments \u2014 that did not arise from one accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 486 A.2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In reviewing the legislative history of \u00a7 36(4a), Judge Getty noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">A brief analysis of the legislative history of the serious disability statutes reveals that the first such statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>enacted in 1965 as an attempt to achieve parity of benefits for certain injuries on the job subsequent to that date. Before that date, a claimant who was permanently totally disabled received $30,000 in benefits while a claimant who was 99% disabled received only $12,500. The serious disability provisions provided for extra payment of benefits where it was determined that a claimant had sustained a certain percentage of disability \u2018from one accident\u2019; thereby affording an extra protection to workers engaging in high risk and extra-hazardous occupations, and shifting the burden for compensation to employers/insurers in those situations where on the job accidents caused exceptionally severe injuries. Again, appellant has not suggested how this purpose would be furthered by requiring the Fund to pay serious disability rates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 362, 486 A.2d 785. This court found in favor of the employer-insurer noting that \u201cthe Legislature intended a narrow interpretation of the Fund\u2019s liability____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363, 486 A.2d 785 (citing <em>Duckworth v. Kelly-Springfield Tire Co., </em>30 Md.App. 348, 353 A.2d 1, <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>278 Md. 361, 363 A.2d 965 (1976) and <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Chapman, </em>11 Md.App. 369, 274 A.2d 870, <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>262 Md. 367, 277 A.2d 444 (1971)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, there was no indication that the legislature intended anything other than the \u201cplain meaning of the word \u2018accident\u2019 in Section 36 (4a).\u201d The rates accorded in \u00a7 36(4a) were found to be applicable only \u201cto payments made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>employers/insurers when a single accident results in their paying 250 weeks or more of compensation.\u201d Id. </em>[61 McLApp.] at 364, 486 A.2d 785 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In sum, this court chose to employ the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cfrom one accident.\u201d The holding in <em>Barbee </em>clearly supports the position of appellants in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The Commission did find the existence of <em>both </em>an occupational disease and an accidental injury<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and then simply held both employers liable without any attempt to apportion between the two findings. This is not to say that these two findings are incompatible. <em>See Lovellette v. City of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983) (discussed in footnote 3). It is, therefore, necessary to apportion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> between the two findings and thereby determine more specifically the liability of each employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">If appellee-claimant\u2019s disability was actually apportioned between the accidental injury and occupational disease, could these two percentages then be combined, thereby qualifying a claimant for payments at the serious disability rates? The language employed by the <em>Barbee </em>court suggests that this question must be answered in the negative. Appellant also relies on those cases precluding the aggrega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tion of a pre-existing condition and an accidental injury to create a serious disability. For example, in <em>Ferretto v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>53 Md.App. 514, 454 A.2d 866 (1983), the claimant suffered a back injury amounting to an 85% industrial loss of his body. Fifty percent was attributed to the accidental injury and 35% to a pre-existing condition. The issue on appeal was whether the Subsequent Injury Fund<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> should be required to pay benefits for the pre-existing impairment at the serious disability rate (\u00a7 36(4a))<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or at the straight rate (\u00a7 36(4)(a)). Section 66, which governs the Subsequent Injury Fund, does not contain a specific payment schedule, hence, reference must be made to Section 36. <em>Id. </em>at 518, 454 A.2d 866. In finding that the straight rate was applicable, this Court opined: \u201cThree cases<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> have been decided, however, which deal with the issue of aggregating claims in order to qualify a claimant for serious disability compensation, and taken together they demonstrate a clear legislative intent and pattern of judicial construction against such a practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520, 454 A.2d 866. The serious disability rate need not be applied to the award for the accidental injury <em>and </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>award for a pre-existing impairment, \u201cwhere only the former exceeds 250 weeks____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 454 A.2d 866. It must be noted that the <em>Barbee </em>decision overruled <em>Ferretto </em>\u201cto the extent [it] stands for the proposition that Section 36(4a) is applicable to the Fund\u2019s payments for pre-existing impairments____\u201d <em>Barbee, </em>61 Md.App. at 361, 486 A.2d 785. The result in <em>Ferretto </em>would be unchanged. <em>Id. </em>at 361 n. 1, 486 A.2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Also, in <em>Duckworth v. Kelly Springfield Tire Co., </em>30 Md.App. 348, 353 A.2d 1, <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>278 Md. 361, 363 A.2d 965 (1976), the claimant suffered a back injury and received a rating of 52% industrial loss of use of his body. Forty-two percent of said rating related to the accidental injury and 10% related to a pre-existing impairment. The claimant, by combining the two ratings, alleged he was entitled to additional benefits because he had suffered a serious disability under \u00a7 36(4a). Judge Davidson, then speaking for this court, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">In our view, the legislative declaration of intent in Art. 101, \u00a7 66(1) does not mandate than an award of compensation for a previous impairment under that section, and an award of compensation for an injury under Art. 101, \u00a7 36(4), be combined to determine eligibility for serious disability benefits under Art. 101, \u00a7 36(4a). Therefore, we cannot agree that the claimant is entitled to increased benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 352, 353 A.2d 1. Hence, an award for a previous impairment cannot be added to a subsequent injury when computing eligibility for a serious disability. <em>Id. </em>at 354, 353 A.2d 1. \u201cA claimant is entitled to \u2018serious disability\u2019 benefits only when the award of compensation for a subsequent accidental injury <em>alone </em>equals or exceeds 250 weeks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 353 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Although these cases are not exactly on point, appellant contends that they lend support by analogizing a pre-existing impairment with an occupational disease. An occupational disease has been judicially defined as \u201csome ailment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>disorder, or illness which is the expectable result<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of working under conditions naturally inherent in the employment and inseparable therefrom, and is ordinarily slow and insidious in its approach.\u201d <em>Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 486, 6 A.2d 48 (1939). <em>See also </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 101 \u00a7 67(13) (1979) wherein occupational disease is defined as \u201cthe event of an employee\u2019s becoming actually incapacitated, either temporarily, partially or totally, because of a disease contracted as the result of and in the course of employment....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">An occupational disease is analogous to a pre-existing impairment, under the facts of this case, in that there was no prior incapacity until the occurrence of the accidental injury. Appellee is correct in his assertion that he would not have had a disability claim for an occupational disease absent an actual incapacitation. <em>See </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 101 \u00a7 67(13); <em>Belschner v. Anchor Post Products, </em>227 Md. 89, 95, 175 A.2d 419 (1961) (saw operator not entitled to benefits for hearing loss when he was still able to perform the same job). Similarity arises where, as here, pre-existing non-compensable physiological infirmity (manifested by occupational disease or physical impairment) becomes compensable when combined with a converging accidental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Finally, we note that although the Worker\u2019s Compensation statutes are generally construed liberally in favor of the claimant because \u201c[a]ny uncertainty in the meaning of the statute [is] resolved in favor of the claimant,\u201d in the case <em>sub judice </em>there is no ambiguity or uncertainty surrounding the language of \u00a7 36(4a). <em>Lovellette v. City of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 282, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983) (citations omitted). Thus, this rule of statutory construction is inapposite. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in affirming the award of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE WORKER\u2019S COMPENSATION COMMISSION FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">. <em>See </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 101 \u00a7 36(4)(a) (1979, Cum.Supp. 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">. In <em>Chapman </em>this court held that certain benefits paid out of the Subsequent Injury Fund passed to the claimant\u2019s surviving spouse. Subsequent legislation changed the effect of that holding. In the later <em>Duckworth </em>case, this court noted the legislative amendment and stated \u201cthat the language in \u00a7 36(4a) that a person must receive an award of 250 weeks compensation under \u00a7 36(3) or (4) or a combination of both to qualify for serious disability benefits, should not be read as including an award under \u00a7 66(1).\u201d 30 Md.App. at 348, 353 A.2d 1. Thus, a claimant was deemed to be entitled to \"serious disability\u201d benefits \u201conly when the award of compensation for a subsequent injury alone equals or exceeds 250 weeks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[11 Md.

There is nothing wrong in finding the existence of both an accidental injury and an occupational disease as indicated in <em>Lovellette v. City of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983). In <em>Lovellette </em>a fire fighter suffered a heart attack after lifting a heavy overhead door. In light of the strain prior to onset, the Medical Board and Commission ruled the heart attack to be an accidental injury and found that the statutory presumption of occupational disease did not apply. <em>See </em>art. 101 \u00a7 64A. In overruling the Commission, the Court of Appeals stated that nothing in the statute indicated that there could be no occupational disease if the heart attack initially manifested as an accidental injury. 297 Md. at 283, 465 A.2d 1141.
