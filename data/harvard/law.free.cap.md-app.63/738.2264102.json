In particular, we must address policy language which excludes coverage for \u201cintended damages.\u201d This language has not previously been interpreted by the appellate courts of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The parties agree that the losses occurred in the following manner. On the night of 4 October 1981, Frances Sparks, who held a homeowner\u2019s policy and an automobile policy issued by Allstate, permitted her son James to use her car. That night James, with two friends, Greg Bostion and John Schroyer, drove to the premises of Farmers Supply Co., Inc. (Farmers Supply). The youths went to a Farmers Supply feed truck that was parked in or near a mill building, intending to siphon gas from that vehicle into a container. After they began this operation, James, with an extraordinary lack of good judgment, chose to provide illumination with a cigarette lighter. Gas fumes in the area of the truck ignited. Not surprisingly, the resultant fire destroyed the Farmers Supply mill and substantially all of its contents. Amazingly, the boys were not harmed. The parties concur that the boys intended to steal gas but did not intend to burn Farmers Supply\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">To settle the question of whether it might be liable under the automobile and homeowner\u2019s policies, Allstate brought an action for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. Allstate named as defendants Ms. Sparks, her son James, Bostion and Schroyer. Other defendants were Farmers Supply, Paul J. Green (owner of Farmers Supply), the insurer of Bostion, and the insurer of Schroyer. The circuit court granted a motion to intervene by yet another insurance company, Pennsylvania Millers Mutual Insurance Company, which under a policy issued to Farmers Supply had covered a small part of the loss. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>four insurers each filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Following a hearing on the motions the circuit court judge issued a memorandum opinion. After concluding that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact, Md.Rule 2-501(e), the judge indicated that he would grant the motion of Pennsylvania Millers. In so ruling the judge held, in part, that Allstate was obligated to provide coverage. The judge also entered an order reflecting this disposition and further stating that Allstate was obligated under both the automobile and homeowner\u2019s policies issued to Ms. Sparks. Allstate now presents the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">[Did] the trial court [err] in ruling that the appellant was obligated to provide insurance coverage to Frances Sparks and James Sparks as a result of the occurrence at issue under both the automobile insurance policy and the homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued to Frances Sparks by Allstate?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Allstate first argues that the fire in this case was an \u201cintentional act\u201d which was excluded under the terms of both policies. The homeowner\u2019s policy, under a \u201cFamily Liability\u201d clause, provided coverage for \u201call sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages ... caused by an occurrence.\u201d In the applicable definitions section, the homeowner\u2019s policy defines an \u201cInsured\u201d to include members of the \u201cNamed Insured\u2019s household,\u201d and defines an \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201caccident ... which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d The policy excludes, however, coverage of \u201cproperty damage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d Under the automobile policy, coverage includes \u201cdestruction of property, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use, including loading and unloading of the owned automobile,\u201d but excludes \u201cproperty damage caused intentionally by, or at the direction of, the insured.\u201d We need address only the specific language of the homeowner\u2019s policy, because, as we shall explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>below,' the automobile policy contains other language precluding coverage for the fire losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Allstate asserts that our interpretation of the exclusion is governed by four decisions of the Court of Appeals, each involving policies covering losses \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d <em>See State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. v. Treas, </em>254 Md. 615, 255 A.2d 296 (1969); <em>Glens Falls Insurance Co. v. American Oil Co., </em>254 Md. 120, 254 A.2d 658 (1969); <em>Harleysville Mutual Casualty Co. v. Harris &amp; Brooks, Inc., </em>248 Md. 148, 235 A.2d 556 (1967); <em>Haynes v. American Casualty Co., </em>228 Md. 394, 179 A.2d 900 (1962). The trial judge concluded that the language \u201ccaused by accident\u201d was sufficiently dissimilar from that contained in the Allstate policies to render the above cases inapposite. We agree that these cases are not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Of the four decisions, <em>Treas </em>and <em>Harris &amp; Brooks </em>denied coverage based on the \u201ccaused by accident\u201d language. The <em>Harris &amp; Brooks </em>court grounded its interpretation in part on the dictionary definition of \u201caccident,\u201d and concluded therefrom that the clause excluded intentional acts with results not \u201cunforeseen, unusual and unexpected.\u201d 248 Md. at 152, 235 A.2d at 558. Later, the <em>Treas </em>court reiterated the standard laid down in <em>Harris &amp; Brooks. </em>The construction in these cases was derived from and, in our view, dependent on the use of the exclusionary language \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The exclusionary clause in the present case does not contain these words; instead it excepts \u201cdamage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d Admittedly, the issue is the same if stated in rough terms: whether the loss was intentional or accidental. The precise approach to be used, however, differs in two important respects. First, there is the question of whether the <em>results </em>or the <em>means </em>must have been intended. The Allstate policy indicates, in our view, that the insured must have intended the results (\u201cdamages\u201d), not simply the causing act, for coverage not to apply. In contrast, \u201ccaused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>by accident\u201d is ambiguous with regard to this distinction, as the <em>Haynes </em>court noted. 228 Md. at 400, 179 A.2d at 904. Second, the Allstate policy provides that the result must be expected or intended \u201cfrom the standpoint of the Insured,\u201d thereby requiring, we believe, a more subjective standard for intent than the test of foreseeability applied in <em>Harris &amp; Brooks </em>and <em>Treas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Allstate maintains that the prior decisions should control because the homeowner\u2019s policy elsewhere defines an insured \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201caccident.\u201d This language and the intended damages exclusion are <em>in pari materia </em>and should be construed together. We do not believe that the generally-phrased definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d suggests an intent to restrict coverage to a greater degree than under the intended damages exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We find support for our construction of the intended damages clause in treatises and decisions of other states. The circuit court judge cited as authority a Pennsylvania case involving a similar clause applied to facts quite analogous to those at hand. <em>See Eisenman v. Hornberger, </em>438 Pa. 46, 264 A.2d 673 (1970). In concluding that the policy provided coverage for the unintended result of an intended act, the <em>Eisenman </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">[T]he vast majority of courts which have considered such provisions have reached the conclusion that before the insurer may validly disclaim liability, it must be shown that the insured intended by his act to produce the damage which did in fact occur____ We subscribe to such a view. There is a very real distinction between intending an act [and] intending a result and the policy exclusion addresses itself quite clearly to the latter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1Ix\">438 Pa. at 49, 264 A.2d at 674 (citation omitted). This same view is described in somewhat different terms in 7A Apple-man, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 4492.02 (1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">The rebuttable presumption that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary act that is used in determining responsibility for the consequences of a vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>untary act has no application to the interpretation of terms used in insurance contracts. The word \u201cintent\u201d for purposes of tort law and for purposes of exclusionary clauses in insurance policies denotes that the actor desires to cause the consequences of his act or believes that consequences are substantially certain to result from it. In order for an act to be intentional, its consequences must be substantially certain to result as opposed to the feature of wanton acts that the consequences be only., probably certain to result____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 29 (footnote omitted). In this case, Allstate conceded that the youths never intended or expected to cause a fire. The circuit court judge, therefore, properly concluded that Allstate could be held liable under the homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Allstate also challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that coverage applied under both the automobile and the homeowner\u2019s policies. Appellees Green and Pennsylvania Millers agree that the judge erred, in light of language in the policies which render them mutually exclusive. In our view the homeowner\u2019s policy applies and the auto policy does not, because the losses did not arise out of the \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cloading and unloading\u201d of Ms. Sparks\u2019s car. <em>See De-Jarnette v. Federal Kemper Insurance Co., </em>299 Md. 708, 475 A.2d 454 (1984); <em>Vanguard Insurance Co. v. Cantrell, </em>18 Ariz.App. 486, 503 P.2d 962 (1972). The fire at the Farmers Supply mill was the result of an \u201cindependent cause\u201d unrelated to the use of the Sparks car itself. <em>See DeJarnette, </em>299 Md. at 722 &amp; n. 7, 475 A.2d at 461 &amp; n. 7. We must, therefore, reverse the circuit court judgment to the extent that it provided that Allstate was obligated under the automobile policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">\n<em>SO MUCH OF THE JUDGMENT WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGES UNDER THE ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY A UTOMOBILE POLICY REVERSED.
