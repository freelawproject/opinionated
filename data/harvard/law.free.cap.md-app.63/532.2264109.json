Appellant was sentenced to a total of 50 years imprisonment. On appeal, he questions the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his convictions of second degree rape and first degree sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The events giving rise to this appeal occurred on September 18, 1982. On that day the eleven year old victim was approached by appellant, whom she knew, and advised that he had been told by her mother to take her to the store to get some refreshments. The victim entered his truck and was driven to a cornfield in Maryland where the sexual offenses occurred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The victim testified that when appellant did not turn off onto the road to the store she knew she was in trouble but she said nothing. Although the victim resisted appellant\u2019s attempts to undress her by saying \u201cno\u201d and rebuttoning her pants, appellant succeeded in undressing her. He told her to \u201csuck on his thing until it got hard and then jump on it.\u201d She complied, \u201c[bjecause I was scared of him.\u201d No threats were made by appellant at that time; however, he did threaten her later in the day. Although she did not know why, the victim testified that she thought she was going to die. The following colloquy occurred at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">A. (Crying) So I did that, three or four times I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Q. Okay, then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">A. And he told me that it wouldn\u2019t go in and he said he had to stick his finger up in there and I said no. And I told him that when he tried it that it did hurt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">Q. Okay, now what did he try to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">A. Stick his thing up in my hole. So he tried it and kept on trying it and then he told me that it wouldn\u2019t go up inside of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">Q. Did it hurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">Q. Did you feel it up in your hole or near your hole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">Q. And what do you mean by your hole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">A. My Susie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">A. And I told him ... I told him that it hurt and he goes \u201cWell, your hole is too little.\u201d And he goes, \u201cSince it won\u2019t go up in you,\u201d he goes \u201cI have to stick my finger up in there.\u201d And I told him no. And he goes, \u201cWell,\u201d he goes \u201cThere\u2019s only one way, to get on my lap.\u201d And he goes \u201cSuck on my thing until something comes out.\u201d So I did that because I wanted to get home and I wanted to see Mom. I did that and he told me and then after I did that I got my clothes back on and he told me to pull up his clothes and button them, so I did that. And then he just sat there and he sat me on his lap and told ... he told me that ... that if I told my Mom that he would kill me and my Mom both if I told her the truth and ... so he sat there and he was I don\u2019t know but he just sat there and I was on his lap and he had his hands around my throat and he he had his arms like this and he kept pushing and pushing and then I couldn\u2019t breathe any more. So I put my finger down in there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>and I told him I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sleep on this.\u201d And I said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this in the morning.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The examination of the victim failed to reveal the presence of sperm in the vagina. Acid phosphatase, an enzyme secreted by the male prostate gland, was found in the victim\u2019s underwear and jeans. The medical examination revealed \u201ca recent superficial abrasion, caused by mechanical trauma,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and fresh blood on the posterial aspects of the vaginal opening.\u201d The abrasion was described by the doctor as being \u201cat ... the door of the vagina at the bottom side,\u201d and \u201c... not in the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">While acknowledging that all other requirements of the statute have been met by the evidence, appellant concentrates his attack on the evidence of \u201cpenetration\u201d adduced by the State. He contends that the testimony of the victim and the medical evidence are entirely unclear and too uncertain to permit the trier of the facts to find beyond reasonable doubt that penetration occurred. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Penetration is a necessary element of the crime of second degree rape, Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 463(a)(3); <em>Smith v. State, </em>224 Md. 509, 168 A.2d 356 (1961); <em>Craig v. State, </em>214 Md. 546, 136 A.2d 243 (1957); and \u201cpenetration, however slight, will sustain a conviction ... but the proof thereof must sustain a <em>res in re; </em>that is, an actual entrance of the sexual organ of the male within the <em>labia </em>(majora) of the <em>pudendum </em>(the external folds of the vulva) of the female organ, and nothing less will suffice.\u201d <em>Craig v. State, supra, </em>citing 1 Wharton, <em>Criminal Law </em>(12th ed.), \u00a7 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">A brief description of the female genital area, referred to in <em>Craig, </em>is in order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The <em>mons pubis </em>is the fat filled cushion over the anterior surface of the hair triangle. The <em>labia majora </em>consists of two rounded folds of adipose tissue extending downward and backward from the <em>mons pubis. </em>Within the <em>labia majora </em>are two flat, reddish folds of tissue that encase the clitoris; this tissue is clinically known as the <em>labia minora.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">The <em>pudenda, </em>or the external organs of generation, commonly designated as the <em>vulva, </em>includes all structures visible externally from the <em>pubis </em>to the <em>perineum </em>(the area bounded by the <em>mons </em>in front, the buttocks behind and the thighs laterally). <em>Williams Obstetrics, </em>16th Ed., Pritchard-McDonald (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Thus, penetration into either the <em>labia minora </em>or the vagina is not required; invasion of the <em>labia majora, </em>however slight, is sufficient to establish penetration. The proof may be supplied by medical evidence, <em>Edmondson v. State, </em>230 Md. 66, 185 A.2d 497 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 949, 83 S.Ct. 946, 9 L.Ed.2d 974 (1963); <em>Green v. State, </em>243 Md. 75, 220 A.2d 131 (1966); <em>Smith v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 581, 252 A.2d 277 (1969); by the testimony of the victim, <em>Moore v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 540, 329 A.2d 48 (1974), or by a combination of both, <em>Briscoe v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 120, 388 A.2d 153 (1978), <em>Simms v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 448, 449 A.2d 1196 (1982). The proof must provide a reasonable basis for an inference that penetration has occurred. When the evidence is offered through the testimony of the victim, we note that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\"... it is clear that the victim need not go into sordid detail to effectively establish that penetration occurred during the course of a sexual assault. Where the key witness to the prosecutor\u2019s case rests with the victim\u2019s testimony, the courts are normally satisfied with descriptions which in light of all surrounding facts, provide a reasonable basis from which to infer that penetration has occurred.\u201d <em>Simms v. State, supra, </em>at 453, 449 A.2d 1196.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The evidence in this case includes a combination of testimony by the victim and the examining physician. Dr. Franklin Ross performed a pelvic examination which revealed \u201csuperficial abrasions on the posterior aspects of the vaginal opening.\u201d Fresh blood was detected in the child\u2019s underwear and the abrasions, according to the physician, resulted from \u201cmechanical trauma.\u201d Although the source of the mechanical trauma was not described, the victim testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cAnd I told him ... I told him that it hurt and he goes \u2018Well, your hole is too little.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018since it won\u2019t go up in you I have to stick my finger up in there.\u2019 And I told him no____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">There is a fair inference from this testimony that the appellant\u2019s effort to accomplish intercourse was by his penis and not with his fingers or any other object. Finally, the forensic chemist who examined the child\u2019s clothing found that the victim\u2019s jeans and underwear were positive for acid phosphatase, but not for sperm. The presence of semen, while not conclusive as to whether penetration occurred is, nevertheless, to be considered along with the other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Appellant lamely suggests that by saying \u201cmy hole\u201d and \u201cmy Susie\u201d the victim may have meant her rectum. The record, however, is totally devoid of any attempt to commit anal intercourse. This eleven year old did not speak in sophisticated or clinical terms in describing her ordeal. We think, however, that the evidence that appellant attempted, in the victim\u2019s words, to \u201cstick his thing up in my hole ... and kept on trying it ...\u201d coupled with the medical testimony of an abrasion \u201cat the door of the vagina\u201d was clearly sufficient to establish penetration of the <em>labia majora </em>which is all that the law requires. The jury, therefore, could determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the essential elements of the crime of second degree rape were proved. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Appellant seemingly relies on <em>Craig, supra, </em>where an eight year old stated that the defendant \u201cmessed with her\u201d and when asked what she meant by that statement she first said \u201che stuck his hand in me\u201d and then, \u201che put his private in my legs.\u201d The Court pointed out that what an eight year old child meant by language of this nature was subject to too much conjecture and speculation on which to support a conviction. The reddened condition of the external genitalia, furthermore, was consistent with her testimony that appellant had engaged in an act of cunnilingus, and a laceration of the mucous membrane was consistent with her statement that \u201che stuck his hand up in me.\u201d We think the instant case presents far stronger <em>indicia </em>of penetration than was introduced in <em>Craig.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Appellant next asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to first degree sexual offense. He argues that there was insufficient proof of an aggravating circumstance to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 464(a) defines first degree sexual offense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u00a7 464. First degree sexual offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">(a) What constitutes. \u2014 A person is guilty of sexual offense in the first degree if the person engages in a sexual act:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">(1) With another person by force or threat of force against the will and without the consent of the other person, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>(i) Employs or displays a dangerous or deadly weapon or an article which the other person reasonably concludes is a dangerous or deadly weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">(ii) Inflicts suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, or serious physical injury upon the other person or upon anyone else in the course of committing the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">(iii) Threatens or places the victim in fear that the victim or any person known to the victim will be imminently subjected to death, suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, serious physical injury, or kidnapping; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">(iv) The person commits the offense aided and abetted by one or more other persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In order for appellant\u2019s conviction to be sustained, there must be proof that appellant engaged in a sexual act with the victim by force or threat of force against her will and without her consent <em>and </em>under one of the four aggravating circumstances. Appellant\u2019s focus is on the absence of an aggravating circumstance; he concedes the presence of the other elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The only aggravating circumstance that could apply in this case is (iii) requiring that the victim be threatened or placed in fear of imminent death, suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, serious physical injury or kidnapping. Indeed, the trial court acknowledged as much when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">I think there is sufficient evidence of force or threat of force without the consent surely of this eleven year child who was placed in a situation of expecting to just ride with the individual to the store and is then found to be in a situation of being taken all over several counties and states. The physical appearance of the defendant to the young lady together with all his actions and words, I think is sufficient evidence of placing in that child reasonably calculated fear that she was in imminent bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Relying on <em>Mayes v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 628, 440 A.2d 1093 (1982), appellant argues that there was no aggravating conduct by appellant or circumstances prior to the occurrence of the sexual acts. He asserts that \u201c[t]he only reference in the victim\u2019s testimony to any violence or threatened violence occurred after the sexual activities were completed.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The State reports that the circumstances surrounding the victim\u2019s kidnapping \u2014 appellant\u2019s appearance, her transport through several counties and states, the differences in ages, the fact that she was kept out all night<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014support an inference that appellant threatened or placed the victim in fear of imminent death, suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, physical injury or kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In <em>Mayes v. State, supra, </em>we determined the evidence to be insufficient to sustain a conviction for first degree rape where the victim was accosted on a public street, \u201csmacked in the face,\u201d and dragged into a wooded area where she was forcibly raped; there was not testimony of the use of a weapon or of any serious injuries. We stated our findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUS\">Here, no inquiry was made of the victim regarding her state of mind, i.e., whether she was, in fact, in fear of serious physical injury. Moreover, appellant did not threaten the victim with serious physical injury____ The critical question, as we view it, is whether this evidence, standing alone, was sufficient to constitute placing the victim in fear of serious physical injury as contemplated by the statute. We think not. The statute requires more than the placing of the victim in fear of physical injury generally. It specifically requires the victim to be placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>in fear of serious physical injury which, in the context of the statute, means being placed in fear of physical injury analogous to \u201cdeath, suffocation, strangulation or disfigurement.\u201d This was not the case here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 636, 440 A.2d 1093. On the other hand, in <em>Brooks v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 285, 452 A.2d 1285 (1982), we affirmed a conviction where the victim was attacked at night in her apartment, struck twice in the face and threatened with additional blows if she did not accede to the attacker\u2019s wishes and the victim was in a \u201chighly nervous state.\u201d Noting that the victim was helpless and at the mercy of the alleged rapist, we found \u201c[t]he blows combined with the threats of continued assaults were ... more than enough to create an actual apprehension of serious and imminent bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We glean from the cases that the victim\u2019s fear must not only be genuine, <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464, 157 A.2d 922 (1960), but it must also be reasonable. <em>State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 424 A.2d 720 (1981); <em>Mayes v. State, supra. </em>In <em>State v. Rusk, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals made clear that \u201c... threats of force need not be made in any particular manner in order to put a person in fear of bodily harm ...\u201d and that the question of the reasonableness of a victim\u2019s fear or apprehension is a question of fact for the jury. In <em>Mayes v. State, supra </em>[50 Md.App.], at 636, 440 A.2d 1093, we pointed out, with respect to the victim\u2019s fear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cIn determining whether appellant placed the victim in fear of serious physical injury, we consider not only the conduct of appellant but the state of mind of the victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Viewing the totality of the circumstances here presented, we are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to prove that appellant placed the victim in reasonable fear of serious physical injury. An eleven year old girl, through a ruse, was induced to enter the truck of appellant, a 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>year old man of formidable appearance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She was abducted and driven far from home, into another state, to a cornfield. She testified to fear \u2014 fear of appellant and of death. She also testified to wanting to get home and to see her mother. Such fears, considering the age of the victim, the place where the events occurred and the physical appearance of appellant, were not unreasonable. Appellant\u2019s subsequent threats to kill the victim and her mother if she told the truth along with appellant\u2019s choking the victim, as if to demonstrate one method of accomplishing the deed, lend support to the reasonableness of the victim\u2019s fears of serious physical injury. Certainly, the issue was, at the least one for the jury. <em>State v. Rusk, supra. </em>We discern no error in submitting the matter to the jury for determination. Furthermore, we believe the evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 415 A.2d 830 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\">. Count I of the indictment charged first degree rape. The trial court granted appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to that count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-11\">. The abduction occurred in West Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">. Appellant professed to have no recollection of the events of September 18, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\">. The doctor testified that he could not say what caused the trauma.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\">. Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 461(e) provides: (e) Sexual Act. \u2014 \"Sexual act\u201d means cunnilingus, fellatio, analingus, or anal intercourse, but does not include vaginal intercourse. Emission of semen is not required. Penetration, however slight, is evidence of anal intercourse. Sexual act also means the penetration, however slight, by any object into the genital or anal opening of another person\u2019s body if the penetration can be reasonably construed as being for the purposes of sexual arousal or gratification or for abuse of either party and if the penetration is not for accepted medical purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. Appellant mentioned in passing that the aggravating circumstances required for a conviction of first degree sexual offense are the same as those required for conviction of first degree rape, thus implying that granting appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to first degree rape warranted a similar ruling as to Count III. He cites no authority for such a proposition and we know of none.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\">. The evidence showed that the events began about 3:00 in the afternoon in West Virginia and the victim was not returned until the next morning. Appellant and the victim spent the night in the cornfield.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b571-10\">.

BELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AY4\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">I concur. I write a separate opinion, however, because while I view the evidence of penetration presented by the State to have been sufficient, it was just barely so. I do not agree that that evidence was clearly sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The victim testified that the appellant <em>tried </em>to \u201cstick his thing up in my hole\u201d, that she felt pain and that appellant told her \u201cthat it wouldn\u2019t go up inside of me\u201d. Further, no definitive answer was ever elicited to the question whether she felt appellant\u2019s penis in her \u201chole\u201d because that question was asked in conjunction with a second question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>whether she felt his penis near her \u201chole\u201d. Her affirmative response to those two questions, therefore, does not supply-clear evidence of penetration. Neither does the presence of acid phosphatase in the victim\u2019s panties and jeans supply the necessary link. Finally, the victim when asked to what she referred when she used the term \u201chole\u201d, replied my \u201cSusie\u201d. There was no explanation elicited as to which of her bodily openings \u201cSusie\u201d referred. Thus, the evidence from the victim does not support an inference that penetration occurred. <em>See Craig v. State, </em>214 Md. 546, 136 A.2d 243 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The evidence which tips the scale in this case is that elicited from the medical witness. The doctor testified that there was a laceration \u201cat the door of the vagina\u201d. I agree that this evidence, coupled with the victim\u2019s testimony as to appellant\u2019s attempt to stick his \u201cthing\u201d in her hole, was sufficient to allow the jury to determine that the essential elements of the crime of second degree rape were proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Despite the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, I feel constrained to say again, as we said in <em>Simms v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 448, 449 A.2d 1196 (1982), that the prosecution did not do in this case all it could have done to prove the offense and yet avoid the sordid details of the incident. With a few simple questions, the prosecution could have rendered this case a clear, rather than a close, one. It would not have involved going into sordid details to have inquired of the victim what she meant by \u201cSusie\u201d; nor would it have been inappropriate to ask the doctor whether the door of the vagina was within the <em>labia majora.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The burden to prove every material element of the offense charged is on the prosecution. That burden must be borne by the prosecution. This court will not relieve it of its burden, even in an egregious case. The prosecution, therefore, should be especially mindful in such cases of its burden and to take great care to meet it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
