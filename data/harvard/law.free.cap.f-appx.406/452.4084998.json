Lagunas-Cavaller asserts his sentence was substantively unreasonable, because it was unsupported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He further argues a 60-month sentence would lead to unwarranted discrepancies between his sentence and those of similarly situated defendants. After review, we affirm Lagunas-Cavaller\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-21\">Lagunas-Cavaller\u2019s 60-month sentence is substantively reasonable. The sentence was within the applicable guideline range and well below the statutory maximum for the offense. Moreover, the court gave due consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and imposed a sentence that was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing. Lastly, Lagunas-Cavaller has failed to demonstrate that he was similarly situated to any defendant who had a similar record and was found guilty of similar conduct, but who received a shorter sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-15\">. We review a final sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-45 (11th Cir.2005).
