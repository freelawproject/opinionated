In a special finding, the jury determined that Ulimengu was responsible for 5 kilograms or more of cocaine. Ulimengu argues that the district court clearly erred when it determined that the drug quantity involved in the offense was greater than five kilograms and sentenced him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-26\">Ulimengu raised the substance of his guidelines argument in the district court. Accordingly, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>for clear error. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>445 F.3d 815, 817 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The district court found Ulimengu responsible for five or more kilograms of cocaine based on the PSR\u2019s reliance on the jury\u2019s verdict and on coconspirator Maurice Smith\u2019s testimony and assigned him a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(4). Ulimengu contends Maurice Smith\u2019s testimony was not credible because he was a coeonspirator and because his testimony was uncorroborated. Smith testified that he sold Ulimengu approximately 15 to 25 kilograms of cocaine to Ulimengu during his involvement in the conspiracy, and this testimony was corroborated by a Government agent. The record establishes that the district court\u2019s finding regarding the amount of cocaine was not clearly erroneous, <em>see Gonzalez, </em>445 F.3d at 817, and, additionally, the district court\u2019s determination regarding Smith\u2019s credibility will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 799 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b944-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
