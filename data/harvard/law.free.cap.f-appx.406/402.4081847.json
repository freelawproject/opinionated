Stem-bridge argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-16\">Stembridge argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider whether he was entitled to a reduction of sentence for his substantial assistance, but this argument lacks merit. The district court \u201cmay depart from the guidelines ... [u]pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance,\u201d and the comments to the provision state that \u201c[substantial weight should be given to the government\u2019s evaluation of the extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1 <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n. 3 (2009). The government did not move for Stembridge to receive a lesser sentence and, when the district court discussed the matter with the parties, the government stated that Stembridge \u201cdid not qualify\u201d for the reduction because he did not \u201ccooperate[ ] [until] after [he was] in federal custody.\u201d The district court determined that a sentence at the top of the guideline range was necessary because Stembridge\u2019s \u201cCriminal History Category underrepresented] the seriousness of his criminal history\u201d and that \u201c[a] lower sentence would not be sufficient.\u201d <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010) (discussing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). The district court did not commit a procedural error in sentencing Stembridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-18\">We AFFIRM Stembridge\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
