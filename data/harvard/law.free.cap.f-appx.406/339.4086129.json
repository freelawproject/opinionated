McCarty argues that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable and violates the Eighth Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence deferentially for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review an objection raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-19\">McCarty\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court adopted the undisputed facts in the presentencing information report; considered the relevant sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the factors addressed by McCarty\u2019s witness; and stated a sufficient reason for imposing a sentence in the middle of the guideline range. McCarty also was sentenced well below the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-20\">McCarty\u2019s remaining argument, raised for the first time on appeal, also fails. McCarty cannot establish that his sentence is so grossly disproportionate to his offense as to violate the Eighth Amendment. The district court did not plainly err in sentencing McCarty within the statutory limits, which neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has held are cruel or unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-21\">McCarty\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b365-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
