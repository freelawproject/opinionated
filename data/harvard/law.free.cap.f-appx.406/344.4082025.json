Campbell challenges the court\u2019s denial of his request for appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>counsel. However, Campbell\u2019s request was moot because his Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint was untimely \u2014 well beyond the 180-day limit. Equitable tolling was inapplicable to this deadline because Campbell did not provide any reason for his late filing. <em>See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 398, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982). Thus, the court correctly dismissed his case and denied his request for counsel as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
