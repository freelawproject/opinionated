Under \u00a7 1915(g), a prisoner may not proceed IFP in a civil action or in an appeal of a judgment in a civil action if the prisoner has, on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated, brought an action or appeal that was dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g). The determination whether a prisoner is under \u201cimminent danger\u201d must be made at the time the prisoner seeks to file his suit in district court or to proceed with his appeal, or when he files a motion to proceed IFP. <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 885 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">King\u2019s allegations cannot show that he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury from the alleged actions of these defendants. King has failed to show that he should be allowed to proceed IFP under \u00a7 1915(g) on appeal and that his appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). King\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-15\">The facts surrounding the IFP decision are inextricably intertwined with the merits of the appeal. <em>See e.g. Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the appeal of the judgment of the district court presents no nonfrivolous issues, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b958-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
