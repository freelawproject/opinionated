He illegally reentered the United States the following year. In 2009, he was arrested in connection with a state charge of battery that was later dismissed. He was then charged in federal court with illegal reentry, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), and he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The district court determined PinedaFuentes\u2019 sentencing guideline range as 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutory maximum sentence under \u00a7 1326 is twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. PinedaFuentes argued that the court should vary downward from the guideline range because he had returned to the United States to visit his son, who required multiple surgeries to correct a cleft palate. After considering all of the sentencing factors, the district court determined that a guideline sentence was necessary to deter Pineda-Fuentes from committing future crimes. The court sentenced him to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the abuse of discretion standard, we will affirm the sentence \u201cunless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of <em>all </em>the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The district court is required to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The \u00a7 3553(a)(2) purposes include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">We determine whether a sentence was substantively reasonable by examining the sentence in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe party challenging a sentence has the burden of establishing that it was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Snipes, </em>611 F.3d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Here, we conclude that the sentence imposed is reasonable and Pineda-Fuentes has not shown otherwise. The 46-month sentence represented the lowest sentence within the applicable guideline range and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 735 (11th Cir.2010). Pineda-Fuentes\u2019s sentence was also well below the 20-year statutory maximum penalty, further indicating that it was a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). In addition, the sentence met the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing goals; considering PinedaFuentes\u2019s criminal history and disregard for the criminal and immigration laws of the United States, a sentence within the guideline range was necessary to promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>respect for the law, provide just punishment, deter Pineda-Fuentes from further criminal activity, and protect the public. Furthermore, although Pineda-Fuentes argues that his guideline sentence was unreasonably long, his low-end sentence indicates that the court considered PinedaFuentes\u2019s characteristics, history, and reason for returning to the United States. We will not re-weigh these factors. <em>Snipes, </em>611 F.3d at 872. Accordingly, the sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
