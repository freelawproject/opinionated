Richards argues that her appellate attorney was ineffective for failing to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court and she is entitled to relief from her conviction for conspiracy to launder money, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), based on the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-21\">Both of Richards\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by caselaw. Richards\u2019s appellate attorney cannot be deemed to have acted ineffectively for failing to file a petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>Wainwright v. Torna, </em>455 U.S. 586, 587-88, 102 S.Ct. 1300, 1301, 71 L.Ed.2d 475 (1982), because there is no right under the Sixth Amendment to counsel to pursue a discretionary application for review in the Supreme Court, <em>Ross v. Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 616-18, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 2447, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974). The decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Santos </em>that \u201cthe gross receipts of an unlicensed gambling operation were not \u2018proceeds\u2019 under section 1956,\u201d <em>United States v. Demarest, </em>570 F.3d 1232, 1242 (11th Cir.2009), does not invalidate Richards\u2019s conviction for laundering money acquired from health care fraud. <em>See United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1252 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Demarest, </em>570 F.3d at 1242. The district court did not err by denying Richards\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
