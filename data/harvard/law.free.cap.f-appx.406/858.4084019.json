Gonzalez\u2019s supervised release was revoked, and he was sentenced to serve 24 months of imprisonment. The district court ordered the sentences to run consecutively to each other and to any future imprisonment term imposed in a pending state case.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">Gonzalez now appeals, presenting arguments that he concedes are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006), which held that a district court may order a term of imprisonment to run consecutively with an unimposed state sentence. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court and order revoking supervised release and imposing sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
