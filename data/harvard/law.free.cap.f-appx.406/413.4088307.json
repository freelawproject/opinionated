In an earlier appeal we held that the district court had failed to address Saldana\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims about the admission of expert testimony and an alleged <em>Brady </em>violation during his trial, and we remanded the case for the district court to consider those claims. <em>See Saldana v. United States, </em>273 Fed.Appx. 842 (11th Cir.2008) (unpublished). On remand the magistrate judge issued a report analyzing those claims and recommending denial of them, and the district court adopted that report, denying Saldana\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">Saldana then filed with the district court a \u201cMotion to File Objections to Magistrate Judge P.A. White\u2019s Report and Recommendation in an Out-of-Time Fashion And, Simultaneously, Motion Pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Fed.R.Civ.P. to Alter or Amend Judgment in an Out-of-Time Fashion,\u201d asserting that he did not receive a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation until he requested one from the clerk\u2019s office, and by the time he received the report, the district court had already issued an order adopting it. <em>See </em>Doc. 69 at 2. Specifically, Saldana objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s \u201cfailure to address his motion for resentencing in conjunction with reopening of \u00a7 2255 proceeding, or in the alternative, motion for issuance of writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. He also asked the district court to alter or amend its judgment, alleging that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to impose an enhanced sentence because the government had failed to comply with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. The district court denied Saldana\u2019s motion. He then asked the district court for a certificate of appealability, which it also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>For the second time in this case, we granted a certificate of appealability \u2014 this time on the issue of whether Saldana should have been allowed to file untimely objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation before the district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion. We framed that issue this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">Whether the district court erred by denying Saldana\u2019s motion to file untimely objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, where it appears that Saldana was not provided with a copy of the report and recommendation prior to the district court\u2019s decision denying his claims that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">(1) the trial court erred by admitting expert testimony by Detective Andrade under Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) and 702, and that this trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to challenge the trial court\u2019s admission of that testimony; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">(2) the prosecutor committed a <em>Brady </em>violation by failing to disclose evidence that a government witness committed armed robbery of a dwelling, and that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to make a <em>Brady </em>challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose this information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Under Rule 72, when hearing a \u201cpretrial matter dispositive of a claim or defense,\u201d a magistrate judge is required to \u201center a recommended disposition,\u201d and the clerk must \u201cpromptly mail\u201d a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s report to each party. Fed. R.Civ.P. 72(b)(1). The parties in the present case had ten days after the receipt of the magistrate judge\u2019s report to file their objections with the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Saldana contends that Rule 72 was violated in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">\u201c[Wjhen reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus, we review its findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). When a petitioner challenges a district court\u2019s decision denying habeas relief based on a violation of Rule 72, we will affirm if the Rule 72 violation is harmless. <em>Braxton v. Estelle, </em>641 F.2d 392, 397 (5th Cir. Unit A Apr.3, 1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Braxton </em>a \u00a7 2254 petitioner alleged that he was never notified of a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and as a result he was unable to file his objections with the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We held that, assuming the petitioner did not receive the report in time to file objections, any error was harmless because none of the petitioner\u2019s arguments arose from a factual dispute, and \u201cthe district judge could assess the merits of the petition from its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). We further noted that the petitioner did not allege any new contention or fact that he would have asserted by way of objections to the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>judge\u2019s report. <em>Id. </em>Because any Rule 72 violation was harmless, we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision denying the \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In the present case the district court reviewed the record <em>de novo </em>before adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Doc. 66 (stating that the court had \u201creviewed the entire file and record\u201d and had conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the issues presented in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation). As in <em>Braxton, </em>none of Saldana\u2019s arguments arose from a factual dispute, and \u201cthe district judge could assess the merits of the [motion] from its face.\u201d 641 F.2d at 397. Saldana\u2019s proposed objections were not even related to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, which addressed the specific issues that this Court had directed the district court to consider on remand. <em>See Saldana, </em>273 Fed.Appx. at 844. Instead, Saldana challenged the magistrate judge\u2019s report for failing to address issues that were not before the district court. Saldana raises those same issues before this Court, and we cannot consider them. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA). Considering the grounds on which Saldana objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, any error in denying his motion to file objections after a <em>de novo </em>review of that report and recommendation was harmless. <em>See Braxton, </em>641 F.2d at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\">. Effective December 1, 2009, Rule 72 was amended to extend the time limit from 10 days to 14 days for the parties to file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72 advisory committee\u2019s note (2009). The magistrate judge\u2019s report in the present case was issued on May 1, 2009, when the earlier version of Rule 72 applied, so the parties had ten days to file their objections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-10\">.
