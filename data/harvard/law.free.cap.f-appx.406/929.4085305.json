He does not argue that he was entitled to withholding of removal based on his religious beliefs or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>that he was entitled to relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Ge has not shown that any past persecution was on account of his political views or that there was a clear probability that he would be persecuted on account of his political views upon his return to China. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132,138 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, the evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA and IJ. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
