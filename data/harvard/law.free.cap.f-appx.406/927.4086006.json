Quintanilla asserts that he did not abandon his adjustment application and that he has shown good cause for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">We generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) decision influences the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Quintanilla\u2019s requests for relief because he is removable for having committed at least two separate criminal offenses involving moral turpitude. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), (ii) and 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 277-78 &amp; n. 10 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">Although we are not precluded from reviewing claims raising constitutional or purely legal questions, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Quintanilla\u2019s assertion that the BIA violated his due process rights by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance \u201cdoes not present a constitutional claim or issue of law that this court has jurisdiction to consider.\u201d <em>Ogunfuye v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 303, 307 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">Quintanilla does raise one issue that arguably presents a question of law\u2014that the IJ and BIA applied the wrong legal standard in finding that he had failed to establish prima facie evidence of entitlement to an adjustment of status. <em>Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 546 (5th Cir.2008) (accepting jurisdiction to interpret INA \u00a7 212(h) and holding that \u201cfor aliens who adjust post-entry to [lawful permanent resident] status, \u00a7 212(h)\u2019s plain language demonstrates unambiguously Congress\u2019 intent <em>not </em>to bar them from <em>seeking </em>a waiver of inadmissibility\u201d despite conviction of an aggravated felony); <em>but see Lakhavani v. Mukasey, </em>255 Fed.Appx. 819, 823-24 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished) (\u201cAlthough [petitioner] couches this claim [that the BIA used the wrong legal standard] in legal terms, he is actually requesting this Court to revist the BIA\u2019s factual determination with regard to his eligibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-16\">We need not reach this issue, however, because the BIA denied Quintanilla\u2019s request for a continuance on discretionary grounds, which we lack jurisdiction to review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). <em>Ogunfuye. </em>Namely, the BIA found, in its discretion, that Quintanilla had abandoned his opportunity to seek an adjustment by failing to file a timely application for adjustment of status, and furthermore had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>to identify good cause for a continuance because he had not provided satisfactory explanation for his failure to file the timely application and had not even filed a visa petition \u2014 a prerequisite to adjustment of status \u2014 in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Accordingly, Quintanilla\u2019s petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b954-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
