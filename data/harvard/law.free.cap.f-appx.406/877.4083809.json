The district court departed downward from Trevino\u2019s career offender guidelines range and sentenced him to 240 months of imprisonment. Trevino appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>tion based on Amendment 706 to the crack cocaine Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">\u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Trevino argues that, although he was designated a career offender, the district court downwardly departed so that he was ultimately sentenced based on the crack cocaine guidelines and, thus, he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. Trevino\u2019s argument is unsupported by the record, which reflects that the district court adopted the career offender calculations. There is no indication that the district court based its departure sentence on the crack cocaine guidelines. Consequently, Trevino was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Trevino\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. <em>See id.; United States v. Townsend, </em>55 F.3d 168, 170 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
