Martinez contends: (1) the district court abused its discretion by admitting alleged hearsay testimony of Agent Holguin, a member of the Drug Enforcement Agency Task Force, regarding a description of Martinez\u2019 personal appearance; and (2) his rights were substantially affected by admission of this testimony because it improperly bolstered the testimony of his two co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d. FedR.Evid. 801(c). Such testimony is generally <em>not </em>admissible as evidence, unless it falls within an exception. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 802. The district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion, subject to a harmless-error analysis. <em>United States v. Crawley, </em>533 F.3d 349, 353 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a). In other words, an evidentiary-ruling error is reversible only where it substantially affects defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>Crawley, </em>533 F.3d at 353; Fed.R.Evid. 103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The district court did <em>not </em>abuse its discretion in admitting Agent Holguin\u2019s testimony. The Government asked Agent Holguin to testify specifically about information he provided to another law enforcement agent during the course of the investigation. The information relayed was based on details provided during interviews of Martinez\u2019 co-defendants and included: a description of Martinez as wearing a black T-shirt and camouflage trousers during the commission of the crime, and having a distinctive tattoo around his right eye. The description was <em>not </em>offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to explain how Agent Holguin proceeded in the investigation. Out-of-court statements, offered to provide background information to explain the actions of investigators, are <em>not </em>hearsay. <em>United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 507 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2450, 174 L.Ed.2d 240 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">In any event, any error was harmless because admission of the testimony did <em>not </em>substantially affect Martinez\u2019 rights. <em>See id. </em>at 509 (holding prosecutor\u2019s statements did not substantially effect defendant\u2019s right to fair trial). The record is replete with evidence of the description co-defendants provided to Agents regarding Martinez\u2019 appearance, including the testimony of two co-defendants who explained the descriptions they provided to agents. Furthermore, the record reflects additional, overwhelming evidence of Martinez\u2019 participation in the drug venture: two co-defendants testified Martinez was one of seven men recruited to transport marijuana into the United States from Mexico, carried one of the bags containing a substance confirmed to be marijuana, acted as a translator for the non-English speaking participants, and even made some of the decisions during the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b886-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
