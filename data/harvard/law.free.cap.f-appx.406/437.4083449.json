He now appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in finding that the sexual offenses he committed in 1994, as to which adjudication was withheld, were convictions sufficient to serve as a predicate for a 16-level enhancement of his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), and constituted \u201caggravated felonies\u201d so as to trigger a 20-year statutory maximum sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). He also contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>1. <em>Prior sexual offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines and any relevant criminal statutes <em>de novo. United States v. Lazo-Ortiz, </em>136 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.1998). We also review the legality of a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Section \u00a7 1326, forbids an alien who once was deported from returning to the United States without special permission, and it authorizes a maximum prison term of two years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, if an alien was convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d prior to the initial deportation, \u00a7 1326(b)(2) authorizes a 20-year maximum sentence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The statute defines an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d among other things, as including the \u201cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). \u201c[Sexual abuse of a minor\u201d means a perpetrator\u2019s physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification. <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158, 1163-64 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Ortiz-Delgado, </em>451 F.3d 752, 756 (11th Cir.2006) (under the Guidelines, California conviction for committing lewd act on a child under the age of 14 is a crime of violence because it constitutes sexual abuse of a minor); <em>United States v. Marin-Navarette, </em>244 F.3d 1284, 1286 (11th Cir.2001) (attempted child molestation in the third degree constitutes sexual abuse of a minor). As amended on September 1, 1987, the Texas Penal Code defined aggravated sexual assault to include the intentional penetration, by any means, of the female sexual organ of a child less than 14 years old. Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.021 (1987). Along the same time frame, the Penal Code also defined indecency with a child to include intentional sexual contact with a child under the age of 17 who is not the spouse of the accused, with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, which included the touching of the child\u2019s breast. <em>Moreno v. State, </em>823 S.W.2d 366, 367 (Tex.App.1991) (citing Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Next, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A) defines a conviction, where adjudication of guilt has been withheld, as requiring the following two elements: (1) a judge or jury has to find the alien guilty, or the alien has to plead guilty or admit sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and (2) the judge has to order \u201csome form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien\u2019s liberty to be imposed.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A). A formal adjudication of guilt is not required. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 809-10 (11th Cir.2006). Further, even a probationary term is sufficient to fall within the second prong of the statutory test. <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The Guideline for a \u00a7 1326 conviction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, provides a base offense level of 8, with a 16-level enhancement if the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for a felony that qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), (b)(l)(A)(ii). The commentary section defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as including the sexual abuse of a minor. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">We conclude that the district court did not err in making the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and in determining that Santiago was subject to the maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment established by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), because his 1994 offenses constitute both actual convictions and aggravated felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">2. <em>Reasonableness of sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>we established a two-part process for district courts to use in calculating sentences. <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir.2007). First, the district court must consult and correctly calculate the sentencing range recommended by the Guidelines. Second, the district court must fashion a reasonable sentence by considering the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">When reviewing for procedural reasonableness, we ensure that the district court (1) properly calculated the Guidelines range, (2) treated the Guidelines as advisory, (3) considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (4) did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and (5) adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) requires the district court to state its reasons for the sentence in open court. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). In complying with \u00a7 3553(c), \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). However, \u201c[t]he appropriateness of ... what to say, depends upon [the] circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, <em>Booker </em>does not require the district court to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or mention on record that it has explicitly considered each factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">After we determine that the district' court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201c[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We consider the final sentence in its entirety in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir. 2006). The district court is \u201cpermitted to attach great weight to one factor over others.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). In arriving at a reasonable sentence, the district court shall impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the need for the sentence imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-13\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Other factors that the sentencing court should consider are the following: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the kinds of sentences available; (3) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (4) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (5) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants; and (6) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>issue: the sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
