Lin contended in his \u00a7 3582 motion that his sentence was based upon \u201cinaccurate and fraudulent information,\u201d that his guidelines sentence was determined incorrectly, and that errors were committed during the guilty plea proceeding. The district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to modify Lin\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s jurisdiction to correct or modify a defendant\u2019s sentence is limited to those specific circumstances enumerated by Congress in [] \u00a7 3582.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 209, 212 n. 5 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3582(b) &amp; (c). None of those circumstances appertain to this case. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b941-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
