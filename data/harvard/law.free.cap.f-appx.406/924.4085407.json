He was convicted after a two-day jury trial. The district court sentenced Patterson to 96 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-23\">On direct appeal, Patterson now argues that his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights were violated when the district court sustained two of the prosecutor\u2019s objections and thereby limited Patterson\u2019s cross-examination of Jessica Owens, the mother of his child. Patterson contends that if he had been allowed to further question Owens about her personal feelings toward him, he would have exposed her bias to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-24\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to confront the witnesses against him. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 678, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). Where a Confrontation Clause violation is found to have occurred due to a district court\u2019s erroneous limitation on cross-examination, harmless error review applies. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431. \u201cThe correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Factors that a court takes into account when considering harmlessness include: (1) the importance of the witness\u2019s testimony to the case against the defendant; (2) whether the witness\u2019s testimony was cumulative; (3) whether any other evidence corroborates or contradicts the witness\u2019s testimony on material points; (4) the extent of any cross-examination permitted of the witness; and (5) the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-25\">Here, even assuming that Patterson has established a Sixth Amendment violation (i.e., that the jury would have had a significantly different impression of Owens\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>credibility if her cross-examination had not been limited, <em>see United States v. Davis, </em>393 F.3d 540, 548 (5th Cir.2004)), due to the corroboration of Owens\u2019s material testimony by other witnesses and the overwhelming strength of the Government\u2019s case against Patterson, any error by the district court was harmless. <em>See Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
