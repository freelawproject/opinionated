We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the district court had erred by concluding that counsel was not ineffective for failing to advise Corley of the possibility of an obstruction-of-justice enhancement if he testified at his sentencing hearing. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-19\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to vacate, we examine the legal issues <em>de novo </em>and the factual findings for clear error. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>224 F.3d 1251, 1256 (11th Cir.2000). We review <em>de novo </em>the mixed question of law and fact presented in a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 1256-57. We afford great deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>376 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-20\">A defendant is entitled to effective assistance of counsel during sentencing. <em>Jones, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>224 F.3d at 1259. In reviewing a claim for ineffective assistance at sentencing, we apply the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Jones, </em>224 F.3d at 1259. First, we must consider whether counsel\u2019s performance was objectively reasonable under the prevailing professional norms. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The review is highly deferential and must \u201cindulge a strong presumption that the counsel\u2019s conduct f[ell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Second, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability,\u201d \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,\u201d \u201cthat, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d considering the totality of the evidence before the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 694-95, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201c[I]f the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one\u201d component of the inquiry, it is not necessary for the court to address the other. <em>Id. </em>at 697,104 S.Ct. 2052. The burden lies with the movant to establish his claim by a preponderance of competent evidence. <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1313 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">A defendant in a criminal case has \u201ca fundamental constitutional right to testify ... at trial,\u201d but not to commit perjury. <em>United States v. Teague, </em>953 F.2d 1525, 1530, 1532 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc). Although the defendant\u2019s counsel cannot compel him to testify or to remain silent, counsel \u201cbears the primary responsibility for advising the defendant of his right to testify or not to testify\u201d and of \u201cthe strategic implications of each choice,\u201d because absent such advice and knowledge, the defendant can not intentionally relinquish the right to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 1532-33. \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s right to testify does not include a right to commit perjury.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 96, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Here, the record shows that Corley\u2019s attorney testified at the evidentiary hearing that he thought that he had advised Corley about the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, as it was his usual practice to do so. The attorney further testified that even if he could not remember specifically advising Corley that he would be subject to an obstruction-of-justice enhancement if he testified at sentencing, he was confident that he reviewed the possible consequences of Corley testifying and having no one believe him. Based on this testimony, the district court found that Corley failed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Soto neglected to impart information regarding the obstruction-of-justice charge to him. The district court also found that Corley established only that Soto could not \u201cspecifically testify, that he had informed Corley, in line with his standard practice.\u201d We afford these credibility determinations great deference, <em>see Clay, </em>376 F.3d at 1302, and Corley has shown no clear error in the district court\u2019s factual findings that Corley failed to show that his attorney failed to impart to him information regarding the risks of an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. The district court therefore did not err in finding that Corley failed to establish deficient performance by his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
