In support, Romero relies in large part on <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>568 F.3d 564 (5th Cir. 2009), wherein we stated that when a district court disagrees with the Guidelines\u2019 policy considerations, \u201cwhat is necessary is that a court explain its reasons for disagreeing with [same].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570. Romero\u2019s claim of procedural error is premised on his assertion that the Sentencing Commission has made the policy decision that courts should not consider an illegal reentry defendant\u2019s prior deportations in assessing the severity of the defendant\u2019s offense conduct. Romero, however, points to no provision, policy statement, or commentary within the Guidelines that supports his assertion. Accordingly, <em>Simmons </em>is not applicable to the instant case, and Romero has not shown that the district court committed any procedural error. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-24\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b901-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
