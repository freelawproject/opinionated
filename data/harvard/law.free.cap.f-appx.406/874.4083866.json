Santos-Guevara appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment as barred by the applicable five-year statute of limitations. The Government concedes that the indictment was returned more that five years after Santos-Guevara was \u201cfound in\u201d the United States and that the indictment is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-19\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Gunera, </em>479 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir.2007). Prosecution under \u00a7 1326 for unlawful presence must be instituted by indictment returned or information filed within five years after the alien is found in the United States. <em>Id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282(a). \u201c[A] previously deported alien is \u2018found in\u2019 the United States when his physical presence is discovered and noted by the immigration authorities, and the knowledge of the illegality of his presence, through the exercise of diligence typical of law enforcement authorities, can reasonably be attributed to the immigration authorities.\u201d <em>United States v. Santana-Castellano, </em>74 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-20\">A December 2003 letter from immigration authorities sent to Santos-Guevara under his alias shows that by that date immigration authorities had enough information, including an FBI fingerprint background check, to be reasonably attributed with knowledge of Santos-Guevara\u2019s illegal presence in the United States, despite any false, misleading, or missing information in Santos-Guevara\u2019s applications for temporary protected status. Because knowledge of Santos-Guevara\u2019s illegal presence in the United States can reasonably be attributed to immigration authorities more than five years before the July 15, 2009, indictment was returned, the indictment was not timely. <em>See Santana-Castellano, </em>74 F.3d at 598.
