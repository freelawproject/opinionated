On appeal, she argues that the district court committed clear error by denying her request for a role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. She believes that the record entitles her to a four-level reduction as a minimal participant in the conspiracy, or, alternatively, a two-level reduction as a minor participant. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. Bernal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d 1303, 1320 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2123, 176 L.Ed.2d 746 (2010). \u201c[T]he proponent of the downward adjustment bears the burden at all times of establishing her role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The district court need not make any specific or supplemental findings prior to its ultimate decision on a defendant\u2019s role in an offense. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Generally, a defendant is responsible for her own acts and those reasonably foreseeable actions taken by others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). Nevertheless, a defendant may be entitled to a role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These reductions are available for defendants who participate in the underlying offense in such a way that makes them <em>\u201csubstantially less culpable </em>than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 3(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">Under \u00a7 3B1.2(a), \u201cminimal participantes]\u201d are eligible for a four-level reduction. This applies to those defendants that are \u201cplainly among the least culpable\u201d of those involved in the group activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a), cmt. n. 4. It can be inferred that a defendant is a minimal participant if she lacks an understanding of the operation of the organization and the activities of others. <em>See id. </em>Such reductions are to be given \u201cinfrequently.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">A \u201cminor participant\u201d may be granted a two-level reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Such a designation is appropriate if a defendant is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but [her] role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">The process for analyzing whether a defendant should receive a \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction is well settled. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au9\">\u201cFirst and foremost, the district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against her relevant conduct, that is, the conduct for which she has been held accountable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. The Guidelines and our case precedent plainly require the district court to undertake this method of analysis in every case where a role adjustment is at issue. Second, where the record evidence is sufficient, the district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant. These principles advance both the di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>rectives of the Guidelines and our case precedent by recognizing the fact-intensive nature of this inquiry and by maximizing the discretion of the trial court in determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Here, McCallister failed to demonstrate that the district court committed clear error. Although much of her argument focuses on the level of involvement of her co-defendant, McCallister fails to diminish her own role in the admitted conspiracy. McCallister repeatedly describes herself only as a \u201cdrug mule,\u201d but that label fails to capture her involvement in the enterprise. She completed five sales of methamphetamine to one confidential informant in less than two weeks. More than 60 grams of the drugs and $4,700 dollars changed hands in 12 days. Furthermore, she made at least two trips with her co-defendant to purchase methamphetamine from a supplier. McCallister admitted, in a signed statement, that the government could prove that she conspired with others to possess and distribute more than five-hundred grams of methamphetamine over a five-month period. These undisputed facts demonstrate that McCallister\u2019s role and the relevant conduct attributed to her are the same. Therefore, the district court committed no error in determining that a role reduction was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">After thoroughly reviewing the record, including the transcript of the sentencing proceedings, we conclude that the district court engaged in a meaningful consideration of McCallister\u2019s request for a minimal participant or minor participant reduction and committed no clear error. McCallister\u2019s actual role matched the conduct for which she is being held accountable. Despite her repeated emphasis on the need to compare her role with that of her co-defendant, it is always \u201cpossible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944. This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\">.
