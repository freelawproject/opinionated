Brown appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her claim that the Florida courts\u2019 requirement that practicing attorneys be members of the Florida Bar violates her Freedom of Association and her Equal Protection Rights. But Brown concedes that Circuit precedent forecloses her suit, <em>see Kaimowitz v. The Florida Bar, </em>996 F.2d 1151 (11th Cir.1993), and she presents no compelling reason for overturning Kaimowitz\u2019s holding that mandatory bar membership does not violate the Constitution. <em>See also Keller v. State Bar of California, </em>496 U.S. 1, 14, 110 S.Ct. 2228, 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990) (upholding over First Amendment challenge mandatory Bar dues so long as their use was limited to furthering the goals of \u201cregulating the legal profession or improving the quality of legal services\u201d); <em>Railway Employees\u2019 Dep\u2019t v. Hanson, </em>351 U.S. 225, 238, 76 S.Ct. 714,100 L.Ed. 1112 (1956) (upholding compelled union membership as \u201cno more an infringement or impairment of First Amendment rights than there would be in the case of a lawyer who by state law is required to be a member of an integrated bar\u201d). Thus, the court did not err in dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>missing her suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor did the court err in concluding a trial judge\u2019s membership in the Florida Bar did not require recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-17\">. Having rejected the appeal on the merits, and no Judge in active service having requested that the court be polled on hearing the case en banc, we deny the Petition for Hearing En Banc as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
