In his petition, Abebaw argues that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Abebaw also argues that the BIA erred in finding that he had not suffered past persecution nor demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution. Finally, Abebaw argues that he also met his burden of proving his entitlement to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">As an initial matter, Abebaw abandoned his claim for CAT relief by failing to argue that issue to this court. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that an issue is abandoned when an appellant fails to offer argument on the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision, unless the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). Here, because the BIA issued its own opinion upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the denial of asylum, withholding, and CAT, we will only review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004). Under the substantial evidence test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Credibility is a factual determination for the trier of fact, and we \u201cmay not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Credibility determinations \u201ccan be reversed only if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">An alien is eligible for discretionary asylum relief if the alien is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he qualifies as a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). In order to meet this burden, \u201cthe applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u201cThe asylum applicant must establish eligibility for asylum by offering credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). The alien\u2019s testimony, \u201cif credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof [for asylum] without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIf the applicant produces no evidence other than his testimony, an adverse credibility determination is alone sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cIf, however, the applicant produces other evidence of persecution, whatever form it may take, the IJ must consider that evidence, and it is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The IJ must make a \u201cclean\u201d determination of credibility, <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201, offering \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for an adverse credibility finding, <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Congress amended the law regarding credibility determinations in applications filed after May 11, 2005. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir. 2006) (discussing the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302, \u00a7 101(h)(2)). Under the new standard, credibility determinations must be based on the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors, regardless of whether they go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>Abebaw filed his asylum application in 2002, well before May 11, 2005, so this new standard does not apply. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Our review of the record persuades us that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding because of Abebaw\u2019s vague and implausible testimony and the lack of corroborating documentary evidence to support his version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Whether an alien has proved persecution is a factual determination that we review under the substantial evidence test. <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256-58. As noted above, to prove persecution \u201cthe applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)). An applicant for asylum who has established past persecution on a protected ground is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The government may rebut this presumption by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, either (1) a change in the country\u2019s conditions, or (2) that relocation within the country would avoid future persecution and that it was reasonable to expect the alien to do so. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">If the petitioner \u201ccannot show past persecution, then the petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir. 2006). \u201cThe subjective component can be proved \u2018by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u2019 while the objective component \u2018can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1289, (11th Cir.2001)). The petitioner must establish \u201cthat there is \u2018a reasonable possibility he or she would be singled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>out individually for persecution,\u2019 or that he is a member of, or is identified with, a group that is subjected to a pattern or practice of persecution.\u201d <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir. 2008) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">We have indicated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept,\u201d and that \u201cmere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Though we have stated that \u201cunder certain circumstances detention may rise to the level of persecution,\u201d it has often held otherwise in cases regarding detention. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a five-day detention during which the alien was not harmed does not compel a finding of past persecution). In a case where the applicant received threats and attempted attacks over a period of 18 months that culminated in a physical attack on account of his political opinion, we held such mistreatment to be sufficient evidence of past persecution. <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1257-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Abebaw failed to establish past persecution with credible testimony or other corroborating documentation, and failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution because his incredible testimony demonstrated that any claimed fear was not subjectively genuine. Thus, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusion that Abebaw failed to independently demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">To be eligible for withholding of removal, an \u201calien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to her country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. Because this is a more stringent standard than for asylum, \u201cif an applicant is unable to meet the well-founded fear standard for asylum, [s]he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33, quoting <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1324 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001) (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Because Abebaw failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, he necessarily cannot qualify for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">For the above-stated reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
