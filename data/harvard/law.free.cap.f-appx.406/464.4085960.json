Zheng\u2019s claim of past persecution is based on (1) his 1998 arrest, 5-minute beating that left bruises, and 24-hour detention following his objection to the examination of his then-girlfriend and current wife based on a falsely reported pregnancy, (2) his wife\u2019s 2007 involuntary sterilization while he was in the United States, and (3) the Chinese government\u2019s act of requiring his wife to pay a fine of 25,600 yuan, which she paid the same day it was assessed. Other than the 1998 incident, Zheng does not identify any basis for his fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment unless the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). Here, the BIA issued its own opinion, so we only review the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-19\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, which requires us to view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted). We will not engage in a <em>de novo </em>review of the BIA\u2019s factual findings. <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d includes any person who is unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of, the country of his nationality where he last habitually resided, \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The applicant has the burden of proof to establish that he is a refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). However, an alien who has not shown past persecution still may be entitled to asylum if he can demonstrate a future threat in his country to his life or freedom on a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). To establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u201d fear of persecution that is (2) on account of a protected ground. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287, 1289. \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while \u201cthe objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1289 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The \u201ccumulative effects\u201d of the alleged incidents of persecution must amount to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861-62 (11th Cir.2007). Persecution is not defined in the INA, but it is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted); <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a finding of persecution was not compelled based on evidence showing that the alien suffered a minor beating that resulted in scratches and bruises, was detained 36 hours, and was threatened with arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The INA includes in its definition of a \u201crefugee\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">a person who has been forced to ... undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for ... other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(B); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">The fact that an asylum applicant\u2019s spouse underwent a forced abortion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>sterilization does not automatically confer upon the applicant refugee status. <em>Yu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cRather, the person who did not physically undergo the forced procedure, or is not subject to a well-founded fear of one, must establish actual persecution for resisting a country\u2019s coercive family planning policy, or a well-founded fear of future persecution for doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1333 (quotation omitted). The BIA defines the term \u201cresistance\u201d to include \u201cexpressions of general opposition, attempts to interfere with enforcement of government policy in particular cases, and other overt forms of resistance to the requirements of the family law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1334 (quotation omitted). \u201cIn simple terms, persecution, or the fear thereof, must be personally endured by the applicant,\u201d as a result of his resistance to the forced family planning policy. <em>Id. </em>at 1333. Further, the potential for prosecution and punishment for leaving a country illegally is not a statutorily protected ground entitling an alien to asylum. <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1310, 1316-17 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum because Zheng did not demonstrate past persecution based on political opinion or a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to China. His petition is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-15\">. The BIA\u2019s order of removal denied petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and relief under the U.N. Convention Against Torture. His brief to us only challenges the denial of asylum; hence, we do not address the denial of the other applied for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
