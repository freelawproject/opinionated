De Nobrega argues that the BIA violated his right to due process by applying its decisions in <em>Matter of Blake, </em>23 I <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 722 (BIA 2005), and <em>Matter of Brieva-Perez, </em>23 I &amp; N Dec. 766 (BIA 2005) retroactively to his case. De Nobrega also contends that the BIA erred when it concluded that his ground of deportation did not have a statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility. The government responds that we lack jurisdiction over De Nobrega\u2019s petition because he was found to be removable based on a conviction for an aggravated felony, and his petition does not raise any colorable constitutional claims or questions of law. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that we have jurisdiction, but we deny the petition for review on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear to Nobrega, charging that he was removable from the United States because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony crime of violence and a crime involving moral turpitude. Specifically, the notice alleged that, on June 26,1984, De Nobrega was convicted in Bronx County, New York, of the offense of murder in the second degree, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 125.25. De Nobrega admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear, conceded removability, and requested a waiver of removal under former INA \u00a7 212(c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The IJ denied De Nobrega\u2019s application for \u00a7 212(c) relief based on <em>Matter of Brieva-Perez, </em>which held that an alien found to be removable based on an aggravated felony conviction for a crime of violence may not apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief because that ground of deportation does not have a statutory counterpart in any of the grounds of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">De Nobrega appealed to the BIA, but the BIA dismissed his appeal. The BIA observed that the statutory counterpart test applied in <em>Matter of Brieva-Perez </em>was based on well-settled precedent that predated De Nobrega\u2019s 1984 guilty plea. Therefore, the BIA concluded that applying the statutory counterpart test to De Nobrega\u2019s conviction did not result in an impermissible retroactive effect. The BIA explained that <em>I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), was not controlling because De Nobrega was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time when he entered his plea. Finally, the BIA stated that De Nobrega did not meaningfully challenge the IJ\u2019s conclusion that his aggravated felony ground of deportation did not have a statutory counterpart in the grounds for inadmissibility. Accordingly, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that De Nobrega was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">As an initial matter, we must consider whether we may exercise jurisdiction over De Nobrega\u2019s petition. We review our own subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2007). We generally lack jurisdiction over a petition for review filed by an alien who is removable on account of a conviction for an aggravated felony. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C) 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Nevertheless, we retain jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims or questions of law. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We have explained that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) only confers jurisdiction over a \u201ccolorable\u201d constitutional claim, meaning a claim that has \u201csome possible validity.\u201d <em>Arias, </em>482 F.3d at 1284 and n. 2 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">In order to determine whether De Nobrega\u2019s legal claims are colorable, such that may exercise jurisdiction over them, we must examine the merits of those claims. <em>See Oguejiofor v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>277 F.3d 1305, 1308-10 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that appellate jurisdiction was lacking over a petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims after determining that they lacked merit). Because De Nobrega\u2019s claims are not squarely foreclosed by precedent, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review them. Nevertheless, for the reasons described below, De Nobrega\u2019s arguments fail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. De la Rosa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>579 F.3d 1327, 1335 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3272, 176 L.Ed.2d 1182 (2010). Since 1988, Congress has provided that aliens who commit certain aggravated felonies are deportable from the United States. INA \u00a7\u00a7 101(a)(43), 237(a)(2)(A)(iii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); Anti-Drug Abuse Act of ,1988, Pub.L.No. 100-690, \u00a7\u00a7 7342, 7344, 102 Stat. 4181 (1988). The definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d applies to all convictions, regardless of when they occurred. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Thus, an alien who has committed an aggravated felony is deportable from the United States even if the conviction occurred before Congress added the aggravated felony provisions to the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Former INA \u00a7 212(c) authorizes the Attorney General to permit a lawful permanent resident who leaves the United States to reenter the country even though the individual would normally be ineligible for admission under the INA. Congress repealed INA \u00a7 212(c) as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d). <em>St. Cyr, </em>538 U.S. at 297, 121 S.Ct. at 2277. In <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) did not apply retroactively to aliens who pled guilty before the effective date of the IIRIRA. The Court recognized that Congress has the power to make a statute retroactive, but it observed that there is a general presumption against retroactivity. <em>Id. </em>at 315-16, 121 S.Ct. at 2287-88. The Court concluded that Congress had not expressed a clear intent to make the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) retroactive. <em>Id. </em>at 314-20, 121 S.Ct. at 2287-90. The Court also noted that applying the statute retroactively would upset the settled expectations of aliens who pled guilty in reliance on the fact that they could later apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Id. </em>at 320-25, 121 S.Ct. at 2290-93. In the absence of a clear Congressional intent to the contrary, the Court declined to give the statute such an effect. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 121 S.Ct. at 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">By its terms, former INA \u00a7 212(c) only applies to aliens in exclusion proceedings who have been found to be inadmissible. <em>See De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1329 (describing the history of INA \u00a7 212(c)). Nevertheless, for several decades, the BIA has permitted certain aliens in deportation proceedings to apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief as well. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. Specifically, the BIA allowed an alien in deportation proceedings to apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief if his ground of deportability was comparable to one of the statutory grounds for inadmissibility in INA \u00a7 212(a). <em>Matter of Wadud, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 182, 184-85 (BIA 1984); <em>Matter of Granados, </em>16 I &amp; N Dec. 726, 728 (BIA 1979); <em>see also De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1330-31 (describing the evolution of the comparable grounds test). The purpose of this extension \u201cwas to equalize the treatment of aliens who were deportable versus excludable on equivalent grounds.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In 2004, the agency promulgated 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5), which provides that an alien who is deportable or removable may not apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief if his ground of deportation or removal does not have a statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility. We have recognized that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) is a codification of the BIA\u2019s preexisting case law concerning the comparable grounds test. <em>De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1332. In <em>Matter of Blake, </em>the BIA explained that a ground of removal is a statutory counterpart of a ground of inadmissibility if \u201cCongress has employed similar language to describe substantially equivalent categories of offenses.\u201d 23 I &amp; N. Dec. at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Although De Nobrega phrases his argument in terms of due process, a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(c) is a purely discretionary form of relief. <em>See Oguejiofor, </em>277 F.3d at 1309 (explaining that an alien does not have a constitutionally protected right to be eligible for discretionary relief). Therefore, De Nobrega cannot raise a due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s determination that he was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. De Nobrega\u2019s retroactivity argument is more properly viewed as a question of law, rather than a constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">We conclude that the BIA did not err in applying <em>Matter of Blake </em>and the statutory counterpoint test to De Nobrega\u2019s case. The statutory counterpart rule is based on longstanding BIA precedent that predates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>De Nobrega\u2019s 1984 conviction. <em>See Matter of Granados, </em>16 I &amp; N Dec. at 728 (1979 case holding that \u00a7 212(c) relief is only available to an alien in deportation proceedings if the alien\u2019s ground of deportability is also a ground of inadmissibility); <em>see also De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1330-32 (describing the evolution of the statutory counterpart test explaining that the statutory counterpart rule is the agency\u2019s most recent formulation of the comparable grounds test). Therefore, the application of <em>Matter of Blake </em>and the statutory counterpart test to his case did not result in an impermissible retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">As noted above, we review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1335. Under the prior panel precedent rule, a prior decision of a panel of this Court is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until the panel\u2019s decision is overturned by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc. Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1300 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In <em>Matter of Blake, </em>the BIA adopted a categorical approach to the statutory counterpart test. The BIA explained that two offenses are statutory counterparts only if \u201cCongress has employed similar language to describe substantially equivalent categories of offenses.\u201d 23 I &amp; N Dec. at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In <em>Matter of Brieva-Perez, </em>the BIA applied this categorical approach and concluded that the respondent\u2019s aggravated felony conviction for a crime of violence was not equivalent to a crime involving moral turpitude. 23 I &amp; N Dec. at 773. The BIA explained that there does not have to be a \u201cperfect symmetry\u201d between the ground of deportation and the ground of inadmissibility, but it reasoned that there \u201cmust be a closer match than the incidental overlap\u201d between the crime of violence ground and the crime involving moral turpitude ground. <em>Id. </em>The BIA pointed out that Congress had used \u201cdistinctly different terminology\u201d to describe the two offenses, and that there was a \u201csignificant variance\u201d in the types of offenses that fell into each category. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">In <em>Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d at 101-04, the Second Circuit rejected the BIA\u2019s categorical approach to the statutory counterpoint test. The Second Circuit reasoned that the analysis should. focus on the alien\u2019s particular criminal offense, rather than the category of deportation at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 103. Under the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, an alien found to be removable based on an aggravated felony may apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief if his conviction also would be considered a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">In <em>De la Rosa, </em>we adopted the categorical approach to the statutory counterpoint test. <em>De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1337-40. We explained that a reviewing court must determine whether the alien\u2019s statutory ground of removal is substantially equivalent to one of the grounds of exclusion under INA \u00a7 212(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1339. Under that test, it is irrelevant whether the actual offense of conviction would also be a crime involving moral turpitude \u2014 the focus is on the statutory categories in the INA. <em>Id. </em>We declined to adopt the Second Circuit\u2019s alternative, offense-based approach. <em>Id. </em>at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Although De Nobrega urges us to adopt the offense-based approach to the statutory counterpart test laid out by the Second Circuit in <em>Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007) his argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>De la Rosa. </em>In that case, we adopted the BIA\u2019s categorical approach to the statutory counterpart test, rather than Second Circuit\u2019s alternative approach. <em>See De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1337-40. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>der the prior panel precedent rule, we are bound to follow <em>De la Rosa </em>unless it is overruled by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc. See Smith, </em>236 F.3d at 1300 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Applying the categorical approach, we conclude that the BIA did not err in finding that De Nobrega\u2019s ground of deportation is not a counterpart of any of the grounds of inadmissibility in INA \u00a7 212(a). As the BIA observed in <em>Matter of Brieva-Perez, </em>Congress used significantly different language to describe the two categories, and each category includes certain types of offenses not covered by the other category. <em>Matter of Brieva-Perez, </em>23 I &amp; N Dec. at 773. Therefore, the BIA correctly ruled that De Nobrega was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Accordingly, after review of the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny De Nobrega\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
