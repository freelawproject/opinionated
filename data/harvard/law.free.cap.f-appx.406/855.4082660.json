Burling, Texas prisoner # 1026184, appeals the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>summary judgment dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 complaint against three correctional officers and the warden for failure protect him from an assault by another inmate. The district court dismissed the claims against Defendants Harlean Howard, Laticia Jones, and David Doughty for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and dismissed the claim against Defendant Porsche Simon based on qualified immunity-</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Burling contends that the district court erred by dismissing his claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies because the district court applied the wrong legal standard and his grievances were sufficient to alert prison officials to his claims. Contrary to Burling\u2019s contention, the standard set forth in <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 517 (5th Cir.2004), for assessing the sufficiency of a grievance continues to be applicable following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 218, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). The district court correctly applied this standard when it determined that Burling\u2019s grievances were sufficient to alert prison officials that he contended Simon failed to properly conduct the life endangerment investigation but insufficient to alert prison officials that he contended Howard and Jones failed to intervene during the assault and Doughty failed to properly supervise and train his employees. Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment as to these defendants is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">For the first time on appeal, Burling contends that Simon was not entitled to qualified immunity because she falsely stated that he did not request a housing reassignment and did not actually submit the life endangerment report to the supervising officer until after he was assaulted. This argument is waived, and we decline to consider it. <em>See Jennings v. Owens, </em>602 F.3d 652, 657 n. 7 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Burling contends alternatively that Simon was not entitled to qualified immunity because she did not order or recommend that he be transferred to a different housing unit. Simon was not authorized to change Burling\u2019s housing assignment. However, Burling has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Simon was deliberately indifferent for failing to recommend that he be transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Simon moved for summary judgment on the basis of her reliance on Burling\u2019s statement that he was not in fear for his safety and the assurance of the inmate who threatened him that he did not intend to harm Burling. In his affidavit, Burling averred that he asked to be transferred and communicated his fear of serious, imminent injury to Simon when she informed him that he was not going to be transferred. For summary judgment purposes, we must accept his version of events as true. <em>See Celestine v. Petroleos de Venezuella SA, </em>266 F.3d 343, 349 (5th Cir.2001). In addition, the inmate who threatened Burling made conflicting statements about his intent to harm him. A reasonable jury could thus conclude that Simon\u2019s reliance on the inmate\u2019s conflicting statements as a basis for not recommending a transfer was unreasonable in light of the threats made against Burling, which were substantiated by a fellow officer; Burling\u2019s request to be transferred; and Burling\u2019s stated fear of serious, imminent injury. Therefore, there was a genuine issue of material fact whether Simon was on notice of a serious threat of harm to Burling.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">However, Simon was \u201centitled to qualified immunity unless clearly established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>law showed that ... [her] response was insufficient.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>385 F.3d at 526. Burling\u2019s version of events, which we must accept as true, demonstrates that Simon\u2019s failure to take further action in light of the substantial risk of harm to Burling might be viewed as objectively unreasonable under the parameters set forth in <em>Johnson. See id. </em>at 526-27. Therefore, the district court erroneously granted Simon summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, and the judgment is VACATED as to Burling\u2019s claim against Simon.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Burling also contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his requests for discovery prior to ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Burling\u2019s reliance on <em>Hinojosa v. Johnson, </em>277 Fed.Appx. 370, 374-78 (5th Cir.2008), is misplaced. Burling\u2019s speculation that Simon\u2019s relationship with the inmate who assaulted him tainted her investigation is raised for the first time on appeal. Even if we considered this argument and its relevance to the qualified immunity issue, the discovery request Bur-ling made in the district court was not narrowly tailored to this issue. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Finally, Burling contends that appointed counsel was ineffective and requests that we order the district court to appoint different counsel. Assuming that counsel rendered ineffective assistance in conn\u00e9ction with the instant proceedings, counsel\u2019s deficient performance does not constitute a basis upon which to invalidate the district court\u2019s judgment. The constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel does not apply in a civil case. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>785 F.2d 1236, 1237 (5th Cir. 1986). Accordingly, Burling\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART and VACATED IN PART, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
