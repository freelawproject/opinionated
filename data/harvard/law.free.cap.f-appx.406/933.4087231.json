The district court dismissed his claims against most of the defendants as frivolous, leaving only his claim against the deputy warden of his prison. Both the deputy warden and Gins moved for summary judgment. The district court grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>ed summary judgment in favor of the defendant and denied Gins\u2019s motion. The court also denied Gins\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Gins seeks this court\u2019s leave to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Gins fails to make any coherent argument in support of his IFP motion. A de novo review of the record reveals that the defendant directed that Gins wait overnight to be transported to a hospital for treatment of his ankle injury despite a nurse\u2019s initial recommendation that he be taken to the hospital that night. The delay was caused by the need to transport another prisoner to the emergency room whose \u201cradial and Brachial pulses were not palpable\u201d due to a suspected spider bite that had swollen his arm from wrist to elbow. The nurse spoke to the defendant at length about the need for Gins to go to the hospital that night because the nurse was concerned that he was suffering from Compartment Syndrome or Deep Vein Thrombosis. Though the nurse voiced concern about the urgency of the situation, she was reassured by the defendant\u2019s promise that Gins would be transported to the hospital the following morning and decided that transportation to the hospital the next day was acceptable treatment for Gins\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The following day, Gins was transported to the hospital in stable condition in the prison\u2019s van. Following x-rays, he was diagnosed with a sprained ankle and discharged. He returned to the prison the same day in stable condition. After reviewing Gins\u2019s medical records, the prison\u2019s physician stated in an affidavit that treatment a day earlier \u201cwould not have shown any different medical outcome.\u201d An MRI taken several weeks later indicated that Gins had a \u201cvery subtle stress fracture\u201d to one of the bones in his ankle. The test showed that \u201csome minimal joint fluid [was] present,\u201d but \u201cno other abnormality [was] noted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">In light of the foregoing, the record evidence creates no genuine issue of material fact as to whether (1) the defendant was deliberately indifferent to a serious medical need of Gins\u2019s or (2) substantial harm resulted from the delay in treatment. Accordingly, the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1998); Fed.R.CivP. 56(c)(2). Gins fails to demonstrate that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue; therefore, the motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The appeal is DISMISSED because it lacks arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Gins is WARNED that, once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b959-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
