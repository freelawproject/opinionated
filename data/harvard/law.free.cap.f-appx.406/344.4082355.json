The district court heard Defendant\u2019s arguments about Mexico, his family circumstances, and lack of criminal history. Defendant\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable, as the district court acted within its discretion in determining that a 24-month total sentence, which was the lowest possible guideline range sentence, was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
