Rocca argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider both his substantial assistance to authorities and his extraordinary family circumstances. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">We review a final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Reasonableness review is akin to the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and we will reverse only if the district court\u2019s error constitutes a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). The party who challenges the sentence must establish that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both the record and the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">Rocca first argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the substantial assistance he provided to federal authorities after he was apprehended. Although the court did not engage in an extensive discussion of Rocca\u2019s assistance, we conclude that the court gave adequate consideration to whether that assistance warranted a lesser sentence. Furthermore, the district court explained that it had considered the advisory guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. Under the circumstances of this case, this explanation was sufficient. <em>See United States v. Scott, 426 </em>F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">We also reject Rocca\u2019s contention that the district court failed to consider his family circumstances when imposing his sentence. Before imposing his sentence, the district court listened to testimony from Rocca\u2019s defense counsel and his fianc\u00e9e. Both asked the court to impose a lenient sentence because Rocca was the primary income-earner for his family. The district court listened to those arguments, but concluded that a within guidelines sentence was nonetheless warranted. There was no error in this conclusion. As a result, under these circumstances Rocca\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
