Caffrey) submitted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>proposal, but was not awarded the contract. Subsequently, Petitioner submitted requests to Respondents (the Montgomery County\u2019s Department of Liquor Control, Board of License Commissioners, Office of Procurement, and Ethics Commission) under the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cthe MPIA\u201d), Maryland Code (1999 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), State Government Article, \u00a7\u00a7 10-611-10-628 (\u201cMPIA \u00a7\u00a7 10-611-10-628\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for inspection of various documents relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>relevant proposal and selection process. Respondents produced some of the documents, but withheld others, citing various privileges and grounds for denial available under the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Petitioner, in early 2000, filed an action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County seeking a review of Respondents\u2019 denials of his requests to review the withheld documents. Respondents subsequently released the documents requested by Petitioner, but filed a motion for summary judgment requesting that the Circuit Court uphold their prior decisions not to disclose the disputed documents \u201cas reasonable and justified at the time.\u201d Petitioner, in response, filed a cross-motion for summary judgement seeking an \u201caward of attorney\u2019s fees and actual and punitive damages in accordance with the [MJPIA\u201d based on Respondents\u2019 initial denials and the necessity to initiate the legal action to obtain disclosure of the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In the first phase of an agreed upon bifurcated procedure, the Circuit Court held, on 30 October 2000, that the Department of Liquor Control for Montgomery County (\u201cthe Department\u201d) was immune from suits for damages, including counsel fees, under Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-504.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, the Circuit Court refrained from determining whether the Department erred in withholding nineteen documents from Petitioner. With regard to the remaining documents withheld by the Board of License Commissioners (\u201cthe Board\u201d), the Office of Procure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ment, and the Ethics Commission, the Circuit Court ruled that Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not waive the asserted attorney-client or deliberative executive (interagency) privileges protected under the MPIA and that, therefore, Respondents were entitled to withhold certain documents pursuant to those privileges. After considering each document individually, the Circuit Court found that six documents were withheld properly and that two documents were withheld improperly from Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Subsequently, in the second phase of the proceeding, held on 17 January 2001, the Circuit Court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for counsel fees and costs. In addition, the Circuit Court also dismissed with prejudice Petitioner\u2019s request for actual and punitive damages under the MPIA. .</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In particular, Petitioner challenged the Circuit Court\u2019s determinations that the Department was immune from an award of counsel fees under Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-504, and that Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505 did not waive the attorney-client privilege and the deliberative executive (interagency) privilege protected in the MPIA. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Caffrey v. Dep\u2019t of Liquor Control, </em>368 Md. 239, 792 A.2d 1177 (2002), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">Did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying an award of counsel fees and costs to Petitioner because it erred as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>matter of law in its rulings concerning the disclosed documents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">A. Does the Montgomery County Department of Liquor Control, which is \u201cimmune from all suits for damages\u201d under Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 5-504 have immunity from an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the Maryland Public Information Act, State Government Article, Section 10 \u2014 623(f)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">B. Does the Montgomery County Charter, section 505 waive attorney-client privilege and deliberative privilege so that these exemptions cannot be asserted to sustain an otherwise permissible denial under Section 10-618 of the Maryland Public Information Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">I. <em>Relevant Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">As described by the Court of Special Appeals in its unreported opinion in the instant case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">[i]n 1997, Montgomery County requested proposals to operate and manage county owned liquor stores. The request for proposals provided that any offeror should submit a proposal outlining a plan for the operation and management of stores, a statement of the offeror\u2019s retail business and management expertise, and a staffing plan. If an offeror received a grade of 70 percent or higher, the offeror could submit a cost proposal. The award was to be made to the offeror submitting the lowest price proposal. [Petitioner] was an offeror, and he was not awarded the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">On October 29, 1997, [Petitioner] filed a bid protest, and on February 4, 1998, he filed a complaint with the County Ethics Commission. The latter was based on the fact that a principal in the entity which was awarded the bid, Mr. Leonard Kligman, sat on the Board of License Commission<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ers. The bid protest was dismissed. Subsequently, Mr. Kligman resigned from the Board, acknowledged a violation of the ethics laws, and was reprimanded by the Ethics Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Following those events, Petitioner, pursuant to the MPIA, submitted a number of requests to Respondents for inspection of various documents relating to the relevant procurement process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Respondents granted Petitioner access to a number of documents, but also denied Petitioner access to certain documents. More specifically, the Department denied Petitioner access to over thirty documents, the Board denied him access to three documents, and the Office of Procurement and the Ethics Commission each denied him access to four documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">On 3 March 2000, Petitioner filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Respondents requesting that the Circuit Court \u201creview the denials by the custodians of records for agencies and units of Montgomery County, Maryland of requests by [Petitioner] to review documents pursuant to\u201d the MPIA. Over a month later, Petitioner filed an amended complaint in the Circuit Court. Respondents, on 17 May 2000, filed an answer to Petitioner\u2019s amended complaint. In their answer, Respondents requested that the Circuit Court \u201c[dismiss [Petitioner\u2019s] ... amended complaint,\u201d \u201c[d]eny [Petitioner] all relief requested,\u201d \u201c[e]nter judgment in favor of the [Respondents],\u201d and \u201c[a]ward the [Respondents] costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Petitioner, on 25 July 2000, resubmitted his document requests to Respondents. ' The County Attorney\u2019s Office for Montgomery County, on behalf of the records custodians, granted Petitioner\u2019s resubmitted requests. As described in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>letter to Petitioner from the Chief of the Division of General Counsel in the County Attorney\u2019s Office, dated 28 August 2000,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">[although the original decision to deny [Petitioner] access to these documents was justified under the circumstances at the time of [Petitioner\u2019s] earlier [M]PIA requests, recent press coverage has generated the potential for larger public concern arising over the 1997 liquor store procurement, and has shifted the analysis concerning whether release of the previously denied documents to [Petitioner] would not be in the public interest. Because they have concluded that releasing these documents will help the general public better understand what transpired under the liquor store procurement, the Office of Procurement, the Board of License Commissioners, and the Department of Liquor Control have authorized this officer to release those documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">A pre-trial conference was held on 30 August 2000, at which the hearing judge agreed to the parties\u2019 request to bifurcate the proceedings. As described in Petitioner\u2019s pre-trial statement, the parties \u201cagreed to jointly propose a bifurcated procedure ... to focus on the threshold issue of whether the interposed [M]PIA exemptions [we]re proper.\u201d Pursuant to that procedure, \u201c[a]fter oral argument and the Court\u2019s review and ruling on the validity of the exemptions, subsequent proceedings consistent with that ruling would follow, including proceedings as appropriate to establish [Respondents\u2019] liability for damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On 13 October 2000, Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment. In that motion, Respondents argued that the Department was \u201c \u2018immune from all suits for damages\u2019 \u201d (quoting Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-504) and maintained, therefore, that the Circuit Court \u201cneed not address whether the [Department\u2019s] asserted exemptions to disclosure of the documents encompassed in [Petitioner\u2019s] ... [M]PIA request were appropriate because it would only be rendering an advisory opinion.\u201d Alternatively, Respondents addressed the propriety of their decisions to withhold certain documents from Petitioner and requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>.that the Circuit Court uphold those decisions \u201cas reasonable and justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Petitioner filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. In that motion, Petitioner sought an order that all withheld documents \u201cbe released immediately\u201d and, as to released documents, Petitioner sought an \u201caward of attorney\u2019s fees and actual and punitive damages in accordance with the [M]PIA for [Respondents\u2019] willful and knowing refusal to release the[ ] non-exempt documents.\u201d Replying to Respondents\u2019 argument that the Circuit Court need not address the Department\u2019s exemptions to disclosure of the documents, Petitioner contended that \u201cthere [wa]s no basis to find that the [Department\u2019s] immunity from \u2018suits for damages\u2019 nullifies the [Department\u2019s] exposure to a penal assessment of \u2018counsel fees\u2019 and \u2018litigation costs\u2019 under the [M]PIA.\u201d Petitioner also argued that Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505 waived \u201cthe permissible [M]PIA exemptions asserted by\u201d the Department and, therefore, maintained that the Department never had \u201ca basis to withhold the documents at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">At the start of the hearing on Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment, held on 30 October 2000, the Circuit Court addressed the disputed immunity of the Department. As in their motion for summary judgment, Respondents argued that the Department was immune from suit and that, therefore, \u201cthex'e really [wa]s no need to decide or discuss those specific documents [withheld by the Department] and the justifications for their exemption from disclosure ... because the issue [wa]s advisory.\u201d Petitioner, on the other hand, maintained that to constnxe the Department\u2019s \u201cimmunity to prevent statutorily imposed quasi-penal sanctions such as attorneys\u2019 fees [and] actual and punitive damages\u201d woxxld invalidate \u201cthe guts, the teeth of the [M]PIA.\u201d The Circuit Court, after hearing these arguments, concluded that \u201c[d]am-ages are damages, whether they are attorneys\u2019 fees or compensatox-y or whatever they are, and ... read into [\u00a7 5-504] that they [ (the Department) ] do have, in fact, that immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The Circuit Court proceeded to consider the propriety of the decisions of the Board, the Office of Procurement, and the Ethics Commission to withhold certain documents from Petitioner. In so doing, the Circuit Court ruled that the language of Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505\" did \u201cnot indicate an intent to waive attorney/client privilege.\u201d As a result, the Circuit Court determined that four documents were properly withheld by the Board pursuant to the attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the hearing judge also concluded that the Ethics Commission properly withheld one document as a deliberative interagency memorandum<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the Office of Procurement properly withheld one document that was beyond the scope of Petitioner\u2019s request. On the other hand, the hearing judge ruled that the Ethics Commission and the Office of Procurement each withheld improperly one document. With regards to the propriety of the Department\u2019s withholding of nineteen documents, the Circuit Court made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>[I]n view of the Court\u2019s ruling that the [Department] has immunity as does its custodian, the Court has not reviewed whether or not these particular documents should or should not have been supplied under the requests for information and has made no decision on the theory that it is unimportant since the Court has ruled that the [Department] has immunity as does its custodian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">Obviously, if the Court is in error and it comes back then the Court would be required to review it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On 17 January 2001, the Circuit Court heard Petitioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment seeking an award of counsel fees and costs. At the start of the hearing, the hearing judge articulated the \u201csubstantive test\u201d for determining whether an individual is entitled to counsel fees and costs under the MPIA. According to the hearing judge, \u201cthere were three issues: Was the plaintiff a substantially prevailing party under the [MPIA]? If the plaintiff was a substantially prevailing party, is the plaintiff eligible for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs? And is the plaintiff thereafter entitled to the same?\u201d As to whether the plaintiff was \u201ca substantially prevailing party,\u201d the Circuit Court noted three important considerations\u2014 \u201cwhether the lawsuit was required to gain the information, whether there was \u00e1 nexus between the lawsuit and the release of the information,\u201d and whether the documents it found to be improperly withheld were \u201ckey documents.\u201d Under the entitlement issue, the Circuit Court identified three sub-issues: (1) \u201cWas there a public benefit from [Petitioner\u2019s] case versus a private benefit to the plaintiff?\u201d; (2) What was the nature of Petitioner\u2019s interest in the release of the records?; and (3) \u201cDid the Government and its four agencies have a reasonable basis for withholding the record?\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">After hearing oral arguments, the Circuit Court announced the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>As to the first issue; namely, was [Petitioner] a substantially prevailing party under the Maryland Public Information Act, the Court believes that the lawsuit can be regarded as necessary to gain the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">The Court believes that there was a nexus between the lawsuit and the release of the information of the documents in the late summer of 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">Finally, the Court accepts that the score sheets ..., documents for the 1997 liquor store procurement, were \u201ckey\u201d documents because they revealed to some degree the basis for the evaluation of each proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">As to the second issue, [Petitioner] does become \u201celigible\u201d for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs since by substantially prevailing in his lawsuit with regards to production of the key documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">The third issue, though, is the critical issue; namely, [Petitioner\u2019s] entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">[T]he Court finds that there was a public benefit, but it is the Court\u2019s belief that the public benefit from this lawsuit was marginal at best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">Now in the next issue, the Court finds that [Petitioner] really had little interest in the release of the records because he was the fourth bidder out of the sixth bidder and was not going to improve his rank to the extent that any release of documents was going to be meaningful to him in securing any operation of a County liquor store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">The final issue is, Did the Government and its four agencies have a reasonable basis for withholding the record. The arguments go back and forth on this issue, but the Court notes that the Ethics Commission and the procurement agency both sought legal advice from the Office of the County Attorney, received the legal advice and literally followed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The Court notes that it earlier held that the [Department] was immune and that therefore there was a reasonable basis in withholding any of the documents that were sought from the [Department],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">The [Board] was not ordered to produce any documents to the best of the Court\u2019s recollection unless there was a reasonable basis for withholding exhibits 31 through 34.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">So finally, gentlemen, under the <em>Kerwin </em>[sic] <em>versus Diamondback </em>analysis, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, does not find, having answered all of the issues, that [Petitioner] is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and dismisses its motion for award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgJ\">Petitioner filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In its brief, Petitioner maintained that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion was flawed because two of its underlying rulings were not legally correct.\u201d Specifically, Petitioner argued that the Circuit Court incorrectly ruled that the Department \u201cwas immune to an award of counsel fees\u201d under Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-504, and that \u201cthe attorney-client privilege and deliberative privilege (as applied to letters and memoranda) was not waived\u201d by Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505 and could be asserted by Respondents. Therefore, according to Petitioner, \u201cthe proper remedy [wa]s to remand for reconsideration on the issue of attorney fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Respondents, on the other hand, maintained that \u201cthe language of [Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-504] plainly reflects a legislative intent that no suits for damages or liability could be pursued against the Department,\u201d including a suit for counsel fees. In the alternative, Respondents posited that \u201c[e]ven without immunity,\u201d the fact that the Department \u201cacted no differently than the other agencies ... fully supported a conclusion that the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>... did not willfully violate the MPIA.\u201d Thus, \u201c[a]n award of costs, including attorney\u2019s fees, did not become appropriate in this instance.\u201d Finally, Respondents argued that Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505 did not \u201celiminate executive privilege and attorney-client privilege,\u201d but, in any event, observed that the Court \u201cneed not reach a definitive decision on the meaning of the charter, but only whether the County\u2019s interpretation of the Charter was reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. On the issue of the Department\u2019s immunity, the intermediate appellate court noted that \u201csubsection (2) of section 5-504 ma[de] it clear that the intent of the Legislature was to grant general immunity to the [Department], except for suits for the enforcement of contracts.\u201d Thus, it resolved that the Circuit Court correctly concluded that the Department was immune from a suit for counsel fees and costs. Regarding the meaning of Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505, the Court of Special Appeals deemed it unnecessary \u201cdefinitively [to] interpret the charter provision.\u201d According to the intermediate appellate court, because Petitioner was challenging the denial of counsel fees and costs, rather than damages, the \u201cspecific question before [it wa]s whether [Respondents] had a reasonable basis in law to withhold the documents.\u201d Based on its reading of \u00a7 505, a \u201creasonable interpretation of that section is that it does not waive privileges existing at common law or by statute.\u201d Therefore, the Court of Special Appeals found no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Generally, the decision whether to award counsel fees to an eligible party under the MPIA rests within the sound exercise of discretion by the trial judge. <em>See Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 95-96, 721 A.2d 196, 206 (1998) (noting that in a case involving the MPIA, \u201cthe award of counsel fees to a prevailing complainant is within the discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tion of the trial court.\u201d); <em>Kline v. Fuller, </em>64 Md.App. 375, 388, 496 A.2d 325, 332 (1985) (explaining in a case involving the MPIA that, \u201c[a] decision on whether to award counsel fees to an eligible party resides in the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d). Thus, absent a showing of abuse of that discretion or a predicate erroneous legal conclusion, the determination to award or deny such fees generally will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In this case, prior to exercising its discretion in determining whether to award Petitioner counsel fees, the Circuit Court made two legal determinations. Specifically, it found that the Department was immune from liability for an award of counsel fees under Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-504, and it refused to interpret Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505 as waiving the privileges permitting the withholding of certain documents protected in the MPIA. Arguably, had the Circuit Court ruled differently on these issues, it may have had a larger number of improperly withheld documents before it for consideration in its exercise of discretion regarding the counsel fees. In light of the potential effect that the Circuit Court\u2019s preliminary rulings on Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-504 and Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505 may have had on its subsequent discretionary determination to deny Petitioner an award of counsel fees, our review in this matter appropriately focuses on the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusions of law regarding \u00a7 5-504 and \u00a7 505. We review those rulings <em>de novo. See J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 71, 92, 792 A.2d 288, 300 (2002) (\u201c[W]hen the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a legal question, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo.\u201d) </em>(citing <em>Walter v.

In the absence of any indication to the contrary, we presume that the Legislature was mindful in 1941, at the time it enacted the predecessor of \u00a7 5-504, of the generally accepted proposition that counsel fees are different than damages ordinarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In support of this, we note that in the years subsequent to the enactment of \u00a7 5-504, the Article containing the provision was amended a number of times, but the actual language of the provision was never amended substantively. <em>See </em>Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>501, Acts of 1947 (\u201crevising and re-codifying the alcoholic beverages laws of th[e] State, and generally rearranging and simplifying all laws having to do with alcoholic beverages\u201d); Chapter 956, Acts of 1978 (amending various subsections of the \u201cAlcoholic Beverages\u201d Article); Chapter 546, \u00a7 3 of the Acts of 1990 (enumerating separately the Department\u2019s immunity from all suits for damages and its capacity to be sued for the enforcement of contracts made by it); Chapter 14, \u00a7 9 of the Acts of 1997 (renumbering sections and placing them under new subtitles). Although not wholly dispositive of this issue, the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend \u00a7 5-504, especially following our explicit adoption of the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d further indicates to us the legislature\u2019s intention that \u201cdamages\u201d as used in \u00a7 5-504 not include counsel fees. <em>See NCR Corp., </em>313 Md. at 126, 544 A.2d at 767 (\u201cThe \u2018General Assembly is presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute ....\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Bd. of Educ., Garrett County v.

The determination in that case, however, was dependant on Md.Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol., 1982 Cum.Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 517 (re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>pealed by Chapter 35, Acts' of 1997), which provided that \u201c[t]here shall be no <em>liability </em>on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against\u201d the MIGA \u201cfor any action taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this subtitle.\u201d (Emphasis added). Addressing Respondents\u2019 reliance on this case, the Court of Special Appeals noted that <em>Mezzanote </em>\u201cis not controlling because the immunity statute ... granted immunity from \u2018liability\u2019 whereas [\u00a7 ] 5-504 grants immunity from \u2018all suits for damages.\u2019 \u201d We agree with that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Therefore, the Department is not immune, based on \u00a7 5-504, from an award of costs, including counsel fees, under the MPIA. In this case, after ruling that the Department was immune from suits for counsel fees, the Circuit Court explicitly chose not to consider the propriety of the Department\u2019s withholding of nineteen documents from Petitioner. <em>See supra </em>pages 285-86. Arguably, had the trial court determined that any of those nineteen documents were withheld improperly, its subsequent determination regarding counsel fees may have been affected. <em>See infra </em>pages 298-99. For that reason, we must remand this case to the Circuit Court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Pursuant to the MPIA, there are some records for which the custodian<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>must </em>deny inspection. <em>See </em>MPIA \u00a7\u00a7 10-615-10-617 (enumerating those records that the custodian \u201cshall deny\u201d). For example, as provided in MPIA \u00a7 10-615,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">[a] custodian shall deny inspection of a public record or any part of a public record if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>(1) by law, the public record is privileged or confidential; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">(2) the inspection would be contrary to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">(i) a State statute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">(ii) a federal statute or a regulation that is issued under the statute and has the force of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">(iii) the rules adopted by the Court of Appeals; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">(iv) an order of a court of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">As delineated in MPIA \u00a7 10-618, there are also records for which the custodian <em>may </em>deny inspection, \u201cif the custodian believes that such inspection would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d <em>Office of the Governor v.

Relevant here, MPIA \u00a7 10-618(b) mandates that, \u201cthe custodian may deny inspection by the applicant of ... any part of an interagency or intra-agency letter or memorandum that would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the unit.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFD\">At issue in this case is the effect of the \u201cRight to Information\u201d section of the Montgomeiy County Charter on the availability to the custodian of Montgomery County\u2019s public records of the MPIA\u2019s mandatory and permissible denials. <em>See </em>Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 505 (\u201c505\u201d).

As the Court of Special Appeals explained in <em>Kline, </em>64 Md.App. at 385, 496 A.2d at 330, \u201c[although an actual judgment in claimant\u2019s favor is not required\u201d to meet the \u201cthreshold of substantial prevailance,\u201d \u201cit must be demonstrated that prosecution of the lawsuit could reasonably be regarded as having been necessary in order to gain release of the information,\u201d that \u201cthere was a causal nexus between the prosecution of the suit and the agency\u2019s surrender of the requested information,\u201d and that the complainant recovered \u201ckey documents.\u201d Then, \u201c[o]nce the court determines that the complainant has substantially prevailed, that litigant becomes \u2018eligible\u2019 but not \u2018entitled\u2019 to an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether to award counsel fees, the trial court may consider \u201c \u2018the benefit to the public, if any, derived from the suit,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018the nature of the complainant\u2019s interest in the released information,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018whether the agency\u2019s withholding of the information had a reasonable basis in the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 96, 721 A.2d at 207 (quoting <em>Kline, </em>64 Md.App. at 386, 496 A,2d at 331 (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">In this case, pursuant to its ruling that the language of \u00a7 505 did not indicate an intent to waive the attorney-client privilege or, by implication, the interagency memorandum exception, the Circuit Court concluded, in part, that the Board properly withheld four documents (attorney-client privilege) and that the Ethics Commission properly withheld one document (deliberative interagency memorandum). Arguably, had the Circuit Court concluded that the Board and the Ethics Commission were not entitled to withhold those documents on the asserted bases, its determination as to whether to award Petitioner counsel fees may have been affected. For instance, while a \u201creasonable basis in the law for withholding\u201d documents does not require that an agency be legally correct in its withholding <em>(see, e.g., Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 96-97, 721 A.2d at 207 (finding that a University\u2019s withholding of information was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u201cnot entirely unjustified\u201d where the definition of \u201c \u2018education records\u2019 in the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act is broad,\u201d there \u201chave been no prior reported Maryland cases dealing with the particular issues\u201d in the case, there \u201cis not very much case-law elsewhere concerning the meaning\u201d of the term, and \u201cthe federal agency which administers the federal statute supported the University as to some of the records involved\u201d)), the Circuit Court may not have concluded so readily that Respondents had a \u201creasonable basis in the law for withholding\u201d the documents here had it interpreted \u00a7 505. as waiving the privileges invoked by Respondents. For that reason, we shall not focus simply on whether Respondents\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 505 was \u201creasonable,\u201d but shall interpret \u00a7 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In asceifaining the meaning of Montgomery County Chax'ter, \u00a7 505, we begin by examining the plain meaning of its terms. <em>See Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 585, 632 A.2d at 804 (explaining that in interpreting a statute \u201cour first recourse is to the words of the statute, giving them their ox'dinary and natural import.\u201d) (citations omitted). <em>See also supra </em>pages 291-93. As enumerated in \u00a7 505, \u201c[a]ny person shall have the right to inspect any document, except confidential police records, personnel x\u2019ecords, or records of a confidential pi-ivate natux\u2019e as defined by law.\u201d Based' on the plain meaning of \u201cconfidential police records\u201d and \u201cpersonnel records,\u201d it is clear that the mandatory and permissible denials provided for in the MPIA are not incorporated, in their entirety, under either of those \u00a7 505 exemptions. Although there may be some overlap between the denial provisions in the MPIA and the personnel and confidential police record exemptions under \u00a7 505 (see, <em>e.g., </em>MPIA \u00a7 10-617(e) (pertaining to the home addresses and telephone numbers of employees \u201cof a unit or instrumentality of the State or of a political subdivision\u201d); MPIA \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f) (x-egax-ding records of investigations conducted by \u201cthe Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, or a sheriff\u2019)), the majority of the recox-ds covered by the mandatory axxd pex-missible denials in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>MPIA do not appear to qualify as personnel or confidential police records under \u00a7 <em>505.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">In like manner, \u201crecords of a confidential private nature\u201d also may not be interpreted to include the mandatory and permissible denials of the MPIA. Specifically, due to the placement of the words \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d together in \u00a7 505, it is apparent that the Montgomery County Council (and electorate) intended that those terms be assigned separate meanings. As such, we are precluded from interpreting \u201cprivate\u201d as simply a synonym of \u201cconfidential.\u201d The legislative history of \u00a7 505 supports that conclusion and illuminates the intended meaning of \u201cprivate.\u201d As described in the 1968 \u201cCommentary Upon Proposed Charter\u201d prepared by the Charter Review Commission, \u00a7 505</p>\n<p id=\"AoT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>1968 Commentary Upon Proposed Charter, </em>Charter Review Commission (Committee on Style), p. 37 (10 July 1968).

As such, absent any overlap between the mandatory and permissible denials of the MPIA and the \u201crecords of a confidential private nature\u201d exemption of \u00a7 505, those denials do not appear to be available under the exemption of \u00a7 505.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>is similar to Article VIII, Section 3 of the present charter.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] The limitation to taxpayers of the right to inspect has been eliminated.

Specifically, in so far as the MPIA explicitly prohibits the release of certain public records through its mandatory denials, <em>see </em>MPIA \u00a7\u00a7 10-615-10-617, we may not interpret \u00a7 505 as permitting their release. For example, where MPIA \u00a7 10-615(2) mandates that a custodian \u201cdeny inspection of a public record\u201d if the \u201cinspection would be contrary to\u201d \u201ca State statute,\u201d \u201ca federal statute or a regulation that is issued under the statute and has the force of law,\u201d \u201cthe rules adopted by the Court of Appeals,\u201d or \u201can order of a court of record,\u201d Montgomery County cannot permit, by waiver of its interests, the release of those records in the control of a County custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Nevertheless, the availability to Respondents of the mandatory denials of the MPIA is not without limitation. Relevant here, under MPIA \u00a7 10-615(1), public records subject to the attorney-client privilege \u201cshall\u201d be denied. <em>See </em>MPIA \u00a7 10-615(1) (mandating that a custodian \u201cshall deny inspection of a public record\u201d if \u201cby law, the public record is privileged or confidential\u201d); <em>Harris v. Baltimore Sun, </em>330 Md. 595, 604-05, 625 A.2d 941, 945 (1993) (\u201cIf the requested public record is \u2018information relating to representation of a client,\u2019 which, if disclosed by the attorney, would place the attorney in violation of M[aryland Rule of Professional Conduct] 1.6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>[(\u201cConfidentiality of Information\u201d)], the information is confidential under \u00a7 10-615(1) and not to be produced under the Act.\u201d). It is recognized generally, however, that the attorney-client privilege may be waived by a party entitled to assert it, in this case, Montgomery County and its agencies. <em>See Parler &amp; Wobber v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>359 Md. 671, 691, 756 A.2d 526, 537 (2000) (explaining that waivers of the attorney-client privilege \u201care universally recognized limitations on client power to hold the privilege\u201d); <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 415, 718 A.2d 1129, 1138 (1998) (explaining that the attorney-client privilege may be waived). As we have explained, the language of \u00a7 505 appears to waive the County\u2019s ability to deny inspection of all records, \u201cexcept confidential police records, personnel records, or records of a confidential private nature as defined by law.\u201d Although in some instances records subject to those three exemptions also may be protected under the attorney-client privilege, those exemptions do not include, by them terms, all records that may be protected by the attorney-client privilege. Thus, insofar as the attorney-client privilege may be waived by the individual or entity entitled to invoke that privilege, we find that the language of \u00a7 505, effectuates a limited waiver of that privilege.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The permissible denials of the MPIA are also subject to waiver by the County.

Relevant to the present case, it is well established that \u201c \u2018the provisions of the [MPIA] reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 81, 721 A.2d at 199 (quoting <em>Fioretti v.

As a result, where the language of \u00a7 505 clearly forgoes the permissive denials provided in the MPIA, we do not contravene the spirit of the MPIA in interpreting \u00a7 505 as such.

Section 505 of the Montgomery County Charter was ratified in 1968.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In 1980, twelve years subsequent to the enactment of \u00a7 505 and ten years subsequent to the enactment of the MPIA, the County Attorney\u2019s Office for Montgomery County, in a memorandum regarding the \u201ctypes of County Executive\u2019s correspondence subject to public disclosure,\u201d addressed the interplay between the MPIA and \u00a7 505. Memorandum from the Office of the County Attorney for Montgomery County, Maryland, to the Chief Administrative Officer for Montgomery County, Maryland (7 February 1980) <em>(\u201c1980 Memo\"). </em>Relevant here, it correctly noted that \u201cwhere the Charter provides disclosure policy supplemental to the State\u2019s pronouncements, th[o]se County level provisions are to be followed.\u201d <em>1980 Memo, </em>p. 2. In reference to \u00a7 505, it acknowledged that the discretionary disclosures available under the MPIA at that time \u201cappear[ed] open to County level policy,\u201d and significantly, it indicated that \u201c[i]t should be understood ... that there is potential for refinement of County disclosure policy with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>spect to discretionary disclosures of the State Act under Section 505 of the Charter.\u201d <em>1980 Memo, </em>p. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In more recent years, concerns about the effect on County records custodians of \u00a7 505 on the availability of denials under the MPIA have continued to reverberate throughout Montgomery County government. In a memorandum dated 14 July 2000, the County Attorney urged the Montgomery County Council to \u201cconsider proposing\u201d an amendment to \u00a7 505 \u201cso that there is no question that\u201d it \u201cshould be interpreted in a manner consistent with the [MPIA].\u201d Memorandmn from the Office of the County Attorney for Montgomery County, Maryland, to the County Council for Montgomery County, Maryland, p. 1 (14 July 2000) <em>(\u201c2000 Memo\u201d). </em>In so doing, the County Attorney correctly observed that \u201cthe weight of [\u00a7 ] 505\u2019s legislative history coupled with the policy of the [MPIA] favoring disclosure (except with regard to private information about an individual) could well lead a court to conclude that [\u00a7 ] 505 prevents county custodians from utilizing the permissible denials under the [MPIA], including the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>2000 Memo, </em>p. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Following distribution of that memorandum, an amendment to \u00a7 505 was introduced by the Montgomery County Council for intended inclusion on the 2000 general election ballot. <em>See Proposed Amendments to Montgomei\"y County Charter and Ballot Titles, </em>County Council for Montgomery County, Maryland, Resolution No. 14 (18 July 2000). The proposed amendment to \u00a7 505 would have provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">[a]ny person shall have the right to inspect any document <em>held by County government, </em>except confidential police records, personnel records, records of a confidential private nature as defined by law, <em>or records that may be exempted from disclosure under the state Public Information Act or other applicable state or federal law. </em>The Council may adopt reasonable regulations for such inspection. A certified copy of any such document shall be furnished upon payment of a reasonable fee established by such regulations. This section shall not apply to a document or other material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>obtained or prepared in anticipation of litigation or for use in legal proceedings to which the County is a party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">(Emphasis added to indicate the added language). For reasons not apparent on the record before us, the proposed amendment to the Charter was withdrawn before final legislative action. Although the County Council\u2019s failure to pursue the amendment is not \u201can infallible indication\u201d of the Council\u2019s original intent in enacting \u00a7 505, <em>NCR Corp., </em>313 Md. at 125, 544 A.2d at 767, the plain language of the proposal and the discussion surrounding its introduction leave no doubt that the County was aware that \u00a7 505 was susceptible to being interpreted as waiving the permissive denials permitted under the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In addition, while \u201c \u2018we have never held that the amendment-rejection theory is a completely determinative method of ascertaining legislative intent, we have indicated that such action strengthens the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to achieve the results that the amendment would have achieved, <em>if </em>adopted.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. at 721, 720 A.2d at 317 (quoting <em>Demory Bros., </em>273 Md. at 326, 329 A.2d at 677) (citing, in part, <em>NCR Corp., </em>313 Md. at 125, 544 A.2d at 767 (\u201cWhile a committee\u2019s rejection of an amendment is clearly not an infallible indication of legislative intent, it may help our understanding of overall legislative history.\u201d)). Thus, in this case, where the County Council introduced a proposed amendment to exempt \u201crecords that may be exempted from disclosure under the state Public Information Act or other applicable state or federal law\u201d from public inspection and subsequently withdrew the proposal from consideration, we are left to conclude that the County Council intended that its public information provision not be limited by the MPIA. While we do not mistrust the sincerity of Montgomery County\u2019s current desire to prevent more liberal access to its public records, we will not tailor our interpretation of \u00a7 505 to account for the County\u2019s failure to effectuate that desire itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Respondents maintain that we should avoid interpreting \u00a7 505 as waiving the permissive denials and waivable privileges recognized by the MPIA because such an interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>would conflict with Montgomery County Charter, \u00a7 209. That section provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">[t]he County Executive shall provide the Council with any information concerning the Executive Branch that the Council may require for the exercise of its powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeX\">Specifically, Respondents maintain that \u00a7 209 provides the County Council with \u201climited access to information.\u201d A review of the legislative history of that section reveals, however, that \u00a7 209 effectuates the opposite result.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Prior to 1968, the legislative and executive powers in Montgomery County were vested in the County Council. <em>See </em>Montgomery County Charter, Art. II, \u00a7 1 (1965) (\u201cThe legislative branch of the county government shall be composed of the county council in legislative session and the officers and employees thereof.\u201d); Montgomery County Charter, Art. III, \u00a7 1 (1965) (\u201cThe executive branch of the county government shall be composed of the county council in executive session, the county manager, the heads of the several departments of county government, the county personnel board, the office of the county attorney, and other administrative agencies of the county government.\u201d). In 1968, the current Montgomery County Charter was enacted to \u201cachieve[ ] a union of political leadership and professional administration\u201d by providing \u201ca full-time elected County Executive to be the chief executive of the County\u201d and maintaining the County Council as \u201cthe County\u2019s legislative body performing the legislative functions it now performs in both legislative session and executive session.\u201d <em>1968 Commentary Upon Proposed </em>Charter; Charter Review Commission (Committee on Style), Introduction (10 July 1968). As part of the new enactment, \u00a7 209 and \u00a7 505 were created. As described in the 1968 \u201cCommentary Upon Proposed Charter\u201d prepared by the Charter Review Commission, \u00a7 209,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">permits the Council to require the County Executive to furnish information.

It is considered that the Council should have the authority to obtain from the County Executive such information as it requires for the exercise of its powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><em>1968 Commentary Upon Proposed Charter, </em>Charter Review Commission (Committee on Style), p. 21 (10 July 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Contrary to Respondents argument that \u00a7 209 limits the County Council\u2019s ability to obtain certain information from the County Executive, the commentary of the Charter Review Commission suggests that \u00a7 209 expressly preserves the County Council\u2019s access to information by waiving the County Executive\u2019s ability to invoke his or her executive privilege to withhold documents. As evidenced by the commentary, although the County Council acquiesced in the transfer of the executive powers under the new Charter, it endeavored to retain, at least to some degree, direct access to information held by the County Executive. Thus, rather than conflicting with our construction of \u00a7 505, this section comports with and lends support to our holding that \u00a7 505 was intended to provide greater public access than the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In conclusion, based on our interpretation of \u00a7 505, the Circuit Court erred in concluding that the Ethics Commission properly withheld one document as a deliberative interagency memorandum under the permissible inter-agency/intra-agency document exemption, <em>see </em>MPIA \u00a7 10-618(b). In addition, insofar as they individually were not \u201cobtained or prepared in anticipation of litigation or for use in legal proceedings to which the County is a party,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 505, the Circuit Court also erred in its determination that four documents were withheld properly by the Board pursuant to its attorney-client privilege.

For the sake of clarity, we note that Petitioner's contention that the attorney-client privilege qualifies as a permissible denial is not based on the privilege\u2019s treatment in the statutory scheme of the MPIA, but rather, as Petitioner explains in his brief, on the notion that \"it is within any client\u2019s authority (here the Montgomery County government) to waive the privilege.\u201d As discussed <em>infra, </em>however, the attorney-client privilege falls under the mandatory denials of MPIA \u00a7 10-615(1), while the attorney work-product doctrine may be invoked as a permissible denial under MPIA \u00a7 10-618(b). Therefore, in those circumstances in which a record may be protected by the attorney-client privilege of MPIA \u00a7 10-615(1), Petitioner's description of the attorney-client privilege as \"permissible\u201d may be misleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\">.

Our use of the term \"waiver\u201d here is unrelated to the timing of the enactments of the MPIA and \u00a7 505. Specifically, although the MPIA was enacted two years after \u00a7 505 <em>{see </em>Montgomery County Charter, Editor\u2019s Note, p. 1 (explaining that the current County Charter was adopted at an election on 5 November 1968); <em>Office of the Governor, </em>360 Md. at 533, 759 A.2d at 256 (noting that the MPIA was \"originally enacted and codified in 1970\u201d)), that subsequent enactment does not negate the possibility that \u00a7 505 nonetheless could waive, by its terms, the MPIA. Our use of waiver here is not dependant on the order of adoption of the relevant enactments, but rather on an analysis of their contents and scope.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b352-5\">. Obviously, if documents qualify as \"a document or other material obtained or prepared in anticipation of litigation or for use in legal proceedings to which the County is a party,\u201d they would be exempted expressly from release under \u00a7 505, quite apart from any separate common law attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In addition, MPIA \u00a7 10-615(1) also prohibits the release of public records subject to the executive privilege. <em>See Office of the Governor, </em>360 Md. at 557, 759 A.2d at 269 (explaining that if the records at issue in that case were \"non-disclosable under the executive privilege doctrine, then such records or parts of records [wejre exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-615(1) of the Maryland Public Information Act\u201d).

As we have already recognized, there may be some overlap between the permissive denials of the MPIA and the personnel and confidential police record exemptions of \u00a7 505. For example, as provided in MPIA \u00a7 10-618(1),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\"><em>Investigations. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a custodian may deny inspection of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">(i) records of investigations conducted by the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, or a sheriff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">(ii) an investigatory file compiled for any other law enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purpose; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">(iii) records that contain intelligence information or security procedures of the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, a State or local correctional facility, or a sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">(2) A custodian may deny inspection by a person in interest only to the extent that the inspection would:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">(i) interfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">(ii) deprive another person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">(iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">(iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">(v) disclose an investigative technique or procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">(vi) prejudice an investigation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-16\">(vii) endanger the life or physical safety of an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">A record subject to this permissible denial also may qualify for exemption as a \"confidential police record\u201d in \u00a7 505. The distinction to be made, however, is that Respondents, in withholding such a document, would be relying on the provisions of \u00a7 505, rather than on the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-18\">In addition, it is also worth noting that MPIA \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(b), the interagency/intra-agency exemption, has been interpreted to include information privileged under the attorney work product doctrine. <em>See Cranford v. Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 759, 773, 481 A.2d 221, 228 (1984). Generally, the work product doctrine \"protects from discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the work of an attorney done in anticipation of litigation or in readiness for trial.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 407, 718 A.2d 1129, 1134 (1998). In Montgomery Counly, however, while \u00a7 505 effectuates a general waiver of the permissible denials provided in MPIA \u00a7 10-618, it also specifically exempts from release \"a document or other material obtained or prepared in anticipation of litigation or for use in legal proceedings to which the County is a party.\u201d Thus, in so far as a document qualifying as an attorney work product also qualifies for exemption under \u00a7 505, the custodian would be permitted to rely on \u00a7 505 in withholding that document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\">.
