We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">From The Heart Church Ministries, Inc., one of the appellants (\u201cFrom The Heart\u201d), was organized in Marlow Heights, Maryland in 1981, as an affiliate of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, one of the appellees<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cA.M.E. Zion\u201d). It was organized by Reverend Doctor John A. Cherry, the other appellant, its pastor, to whom A.M.E. Zion had given a Pastor\u2019s Certif\u00edcate of Appointment and whom it had reappointed to that position for every term thereafter until the withdrawal, and the church\u2019s 24 members. On May 2, 1983, trustees, who had been elected by the congregation a year earlier, formally incorporated the church under the Maryland Religious Corporations Law, <em>see </em>\u00a7 5-304,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as Full Gospel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>A.M.E. Zion Church, Inc.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Its purpose, as stated in the Articles of Incorporation (\u201ccharter\u201d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">\u201cTo conduct a church for Christian religious purposes and to perform all necessary and allowable activities in connection therewith or incidental thereto, and to engage in any other lawful activity in accordance with the Disciplines of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">\u201cTo do anything permitted by Subtitle 3 of Title 5 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, the Religious Corporations law.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Shortly after its incorporation, Full Gospel, on May 13, 1983, purchased \u201cfor use in its growing ministry\u201d property located at 5311 St. Barnabas Road in Oxen Hill, Maryland. The deed to that property listed as owner Full Gospel A.M.E. Zion Church, Inc., a Maryland Religious Corporation. Full Gospel subsequently acquired additional, adjacent property, which it also took in its name alone, and, between 1988 and 1999, other real and personal properties, which were similarly titled. None of the deeds to the real properties, nor the documents reflecting ownership of any of the personal property, moreover, contained a clause creating a trust in favor of, or providing for reversion to, A.M.E. Zion, which did not make any direct financial contribution to the purchase of any of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In 1991, Full Gospel\u2019s Board of Trustees adopted church By-laws and amended its Articles of Incorporation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The By<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>laws broadened Full Gospel\u2019s purpose, stating that it \u201cis to conduct a church for Christian religious activities,\u201d as contrasted with the requirement to act \u201cin accordance with the Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church.\u201d Pursuant to the By-laws, moreover, the trustees were vested with full control of Full Gospel\u2019s church property. The Bylaws provided that, in furtherance of the church\u2019s purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">\u201c[T]he Corporation may receive property by gift, devise or bequest, invest and reinvest the same and apply the income and principal thereof, as the Board of Trustees may from time to time determine, either directly or through contributions through any charitable organization or organizations, exclusively for religious, charitable, and educational purposes, and engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the general laws of the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">\u201cIn furtherance of its corporate purposes, the Corporation shall have all the general powers enumerated in Section 2-103 of the Maryland General Corporation Law as now in effect or as may hereafter be amended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The amendment of the Articles of Incorporation deleted all reference to the A.M.E. Zion denomination. In addition to the same broad statement of purpose as in the By-laws, the amended Articles addressed specifically the disposition of church property on the dissolution of the corporation. As amended, the Articles provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201cIn the event of dissolution or final liquidation of the Corporation, all remaining assets of the Corporation [the church] shall ... be distributed to such organization or organizations organized and operated exclusively for religious, or charitable, or educational purposes as shall at the time qualify as an exempt organization or organizations ... as the Board of Trustees shall determine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Full Gospel amended its Articles of Incorporation again on June 15,1998. This amendment adopted the church\u2019s present name, From The Heart Ministries, Inc., and provided, consistent with its By-laws, that the church would have all of the general powers of a Maryland corporation, as enumerated in \u00a7 2-103 of the Corporations &amp; Associations. Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>1998 charter amendment, like the predecessor 1991 amendment did with respect to Full Gospel, also expressly authorized From The Heart to distribute its assets and property, upon dissolution or final liquidation, to such charitable organizations as its Board of Trustees should determine. Moreover, the 1998 amendment gave the Board of Trustees full power to act on behalf of the church and to conduct any business matters of the church, to adopt By-laws for the church, and to amend, or promulgate new, Articles of Incorporation for the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The A.M.E. Zion Church,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> founded in 1898, is a religious denomination, international in scope, made up of affiliated churches. It\u2019s organizational structure is hierarchical, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the church itself characterizes it as \u201cconnectional.\u201d Under this structure, the affiliated local churches report to one of twelve bishops, who in turn report, quadrennially, every four years, to the General Conference, the governing body of A.M.E. Zion. Comprised of clergy and lay delegates from around the world, the responsibilities of the General Conference include revising the <em>Book of Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopalian Zion Church, </em>A.M.E. Zion\u2019s governing policies. Between sessions of the General Conference, A.M.E. Zion is governed by its bishops, who also oversee the various Annual Conferences, which meet yearly to address concerns of the clergy and laity located within the various regions into which the administration of the church is divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The rules and regulations of the A.M.E. Zion denomination are codified, and published, in its <em>Book of Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopalian Zion Church. </em>The <em>\u201cBook of Discipline\u201d </em>is published quadrennially. Because they were applicable either when property was purchased or while it was being held prior to From the Heart\u2019s disaffiliation, several editions of the <em>Book of Discipline, </em>specifically those dating from 1980 through 1996, are relevant to the resolution of the case <em>sub judice. </em>Given that the applicable provisions of each of those editions are identical and both parties rely only on the 1996 edition of the Book of Discipline, however, we likewise shall restrict our consideration to that edition. .</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The 1996 <em>Book of Discipline </em>addresses, as did the predecessor and successor editions, the requirement that places held or hereafter acquired by a local church, for the purpose of worship or parsonage, be held in trust for A.M.E. Zion denomination. Paragraph 494 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\u201cAll written instruments of conveyance by which premises are held or hereafter acquired, for use as a place of Divine worship for members of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church or for other church activities, shall contain the following trust clause:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">\u2018In trust, that said premises shall be used, kept, maintained, and disposed of as a place of divine worship for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the use of the ministry and membership of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in America; subject to the discipline, usage and ministerial appointments of said church as from time to time authorized and declared by the General Conference of said church, and the Annual Conference in whose bounds the said premises are situated. This provision is solely for the benefit of the grantee, and the grantor reserve[s] no right or interest in said premises.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The same requirement is imposed on the deeds for parsonage property by \u00b6 495.1. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201c1. All written instruments by which premises are held or hereafter acquired as a parsonage for the use and occupancy of the ministers of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church shall contain [the same trust clause as set out in \u00b6 494, creating a trust, solely for the benefit of the grantee, over such parsonage property].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Under \u00b6 493, \u201c[i]t is the duty of the <em>Pastor and Presiding Elder </em>to see that our Church Property is deeded according to our Book of Discipline, and duly incorporated in accordance with the laws of the State or the Territory in which it is situated.\u201d The <em>Book of Discipline </em>also provides for the eventuality that the trust clause is, for one reason or another, omitted from a deed. In \u00b6 495.2, it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u201c2. However, the absence of the trust clause stipulated in \u00b6 494 and \u00b6 495 in deeds and conveyances previously executed, shall in no way exclude a local church from, or relieve it of, its African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church Connectional responsibilities nor shall it absolve a local congregation or board of trustees of its responsibility to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, provided that the intent and desire of the founders and/or the later congregations and board of Trustees is shown by any or all of the following indications: (a) The conveyance of the property to the trustees of the local African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church or any of its predecessors; (b) The use of the name, customs, and policy of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in such a way as to be thus known to the community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>as a part of this denomination; (c) The acceptance of the pastorate or ministers appointed by a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, or employed by the Presiding Elder of the district in which it is located.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In addition, the <em>Book of Discipline </em>contains provisions that do not directly require conveyance of church property in trust, but nevertheless have been argued to be relevant to the determination of the ownership of church property upon withdrawal of a local church from the A.M.E. Zion church. Under \u00b6 495.3, it is required that property be sold \u201cin conformity with the Discipline.\u201d Paragraph 498.1 is to similar effect, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR7\">\u201c1. The Trustees shall not in any case whatsoever dispose of Church Property by sale or otherwise without the consent of the majority of the Members in Full Connection, expressed by vote in a meeting called for that purpose, of which due notice has been given. Provided, however, that no congregation, pastor, nor Trustee Board or agent of the congregation shall mortgage or sell <em>any </em>property of the A.M.E. Zion Church without confirmation of the Quarterly Conference and written consent of the Bishop of the District or the Annual Conference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Finally, \u00b6 498.2, applicable to the situation where there is no pastor because there is no local congregation, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\u201c2. It is further provided that where there is a Church or circuit, or a Station, without a Pastor, because the membership has withdrawn and scattered and there is no Congregation, and no need for an appointment of a Preacher to this place, that the Conference in which the Church is located may pass a resolution declaring the Church or Circuit, or Station discontinued or abandoned and ordering the sale of the property, and approved by the Bishop; the Bishop of the District shall give a deed to the purchaser for the same., and the proceeds from the sale of said property turned over to the Annual Conference for its disposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Upon being notified by From The Heart that it intended to withdraw from the A.M.E. Zion denomination,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the appellee requested From The Heart to turn over, and transfer ownership of, the real and personal church property it had amassed, to it. From The Heart declined to do so and, instead, filed, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, an action,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that it was the sole and rightful owner of the real and personal property it had acquired, to quiet title to that real and personal property and preliminary injunctive relief.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A.M.E. Zion answered and filed a counterclaim, in which, among other relief, it sought its own declaratory judgment with respect to property ownership.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moving to intervene, appellees Phila<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>delphia-Baltimore Annual Conference and the newly incorporated Full Gospel A.M.E. Zion Church, filed a separate action against the appellants, also seeking, among other relief, declaratory judgment with respect to property ownership, which it moved to consolidate with the pending actions. A.M.E. Zion later filed a motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment and quiet title counts of From the Heart\u2019s complaint and the appellants moved to dismiss both A.M.E. Zion\u2019s counterclaim and the separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The Circuit Court granted the motion to intervene and consolidated the actions. Then, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(c),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it treated the motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court concluded that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact with regard to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201c[Djuring its affiliation with the A.M.E. Zion Church, (From the Heart) accepted the pastors appointed by the bishops of the A.M.E. Zion Church ... used the name, customs and polity of the A.M.E. Zion Church in such a way as to be known in the community as a part of the A.M.E. Zion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>denomination . .. [and,] at all material times, [the Discipline] included provisions requiring all local church property to be held in trust for the A.M.E. Zion Church.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Accordingly, it granted summary judgment: in favor of A.M.E. Zion, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church Mid-Atlantic II Episcopal District and Bishop Milton A. Williams, Sr., as to the declaratory judgment and quiet title counts of the appellants\u2019 complaint;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in favor of A.M.E. Zion, as to the declaratory judgment, ejectment and detinue counts of its Answer and Counterclaims; and in favor of the Philadelphia-Baltimore Annual Conference and the newiy incorporated Full Gospel A.M.E. Zion Church, as to the ejectment and misappropriation/wrongful conversion counts of their separate action. In addition, the court declared</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cthat, under the neutral principles of property law, all property acquired by From the Heart Church Ministries, Inc. including all property acquired under the name Full Gospel A.M.E. Zion Church, prior to July 8, 1999, is subject to a trust in favor of the A.M.E. Zion Church, as expressed in <em>The Book of Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Chivrch, </em>which trust has the legal effect of requiring the property to stay within the A.M.E. Zion denomination and preventing From the Heart Church Ministries, Inc., from retaining the property upon its decision to end its affiliation with the A.M.E. Zion Church.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">While the appellant\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals was pending in that court, we issued the Writ of Certiorari, on our own motion, to address the important issue of whether, when a local church withdraws from a religious denomination, the property belongs to the local church or to the denomination. <em>From the Heart v. African Methodist, </em>358 Md. 380, 749 A.2d 171 (2000). As already indicated, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In this Court, From the Heart argues that summary judgment in favor of A.M.E. Zion was inappropriate. It asserts that A.M.E. Zion, an hierarchical denomination, failed to avail itself of any one of the three methods this Court has held is available to such denominations to maintain control of local church property when the local church withdraws from the affiliation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In particular, From the Heart points out that there is no provision calling for the reversion of the property amassed by the local church in the deeds of the property or A.M.E. Zion\u2019s <em>Book of Discipline </em>and there is no Maryland statute that so provides for the benefit of the A.M.E. Zion denomination, as there is with regard to the Methodist denomination, for example. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5-321-828 of the Corporations and Associations Article.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> More specifically, it notes that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>did not hold its property in trust for A.M.E. Zion and that A.M.E. Zion was aware of that fact, thus consenting to it. From the Heart argues, in any event, that, rather than establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, an intent to create a trust, the evidence proved the opposite, that From the Heart had no intention to hold its property in trust for A.M.E. Zion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">From the Heart further maintains that, even if <em>Eldership </em>method two were implicated, and a finding in favor of A.M.E. Zion were possible on the merits, a trial, nevertheless would be required. In that regard, it contends that genuine disputes as to material facts exist with respect to the affirmative defenses of consent, waiver and estoppel and that those disputes can only be resolved at trial. From the Heart also believes that a trial is required with regard to whether From the Heart, in its former existence as Full Gospel, consented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the property provisions in the <em>Book of Discipline </em>and with regard to whether, because its interest was not expressed in the proper form, of which A.M.E. Zion was aware, A.M.E. Zion waived its rights to the property or is estopped to rely on the property provisions of the <em>Book of Discipline.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Moreover, the appellant, From the Heart, contends that there is a factual dispute concerning whether A.M.E. Zion dealt with From the Heart in an hierarchical manner, noting the evidence that A.M.E. Zion, as reflected in Bishop Foggie\u2019s Report to the 1988 Quadrennial Conference, maintained an unconventional relationship with From the Heart, with respect to, among other matters, the manner in which it held its property.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The appellees, of course, see the issue differently. They characterize the principle issue in this case as whether local church property impressed with a trust in favor of the religious denomination with which the local church has affiliated must remain with the denomination when the majority of the membership, of the local church withdraws from the denomination. The answer required by application of the neutral principles approach is, yes, they submit, citing and quoting <em>Brown v. Scott, </em>138 Md. 237, 242, 113 A. 727, 730 (1921) (\u201cany number of the members of a church, whether small or great, have the power to join whatever church they may please, however it may be in disregard of the rules and constitution of the church to which they may have formerly belonged, but they cannot by so doing affect the rights of others, nor divert the use of property held in trust for a particular and specified purpose, to another and different purpose or use\u201d). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>that approach, it must be determined if the local church property is held in trust for the use of the parent church, the religious denomination.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The appellees dispute that, in order that local church property revert to the religious denomination when the local church withdraws from that denomination, there must be an explicit provision calling for such reversion in the denomination\u2019s constitution or other authoritative source. On the contrary, they submit, all that is required is unconditional trust language like that in the <em>Book of Discipline </em>in this case. Indeed, the appellees argue that a reverter upon withdrawal rule is not a neutral principle of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Summary judgment was appropriately granted in the case <em>sub judice </em>based on two facts that the appellants concede, the appellees argue. From the Heart accepted the pastoral appointments each year and it used the A.M.E. Zion name, customs and polity so that it was known in the community as a part of the denomination. The appellees maintain that anyone who joins a religious denomination is bound by all of the rules of that denomination. They assert that From the Heart knew about the trust language and the trust requirement in the A.M.E. Zion <em>Book of Discipline. </em>Thus, the appellees maintain, its failure to deed the church property correctly or A.M.E. Zion\u2019s failure to enforce the deed requirement does not raise any issue of consent, waiver or estoppel, the terms and structure of the <em>Book of Discipline </em>being so clear and plain that once the conditions set out in \u00b6 494 and \u00b6 495 are satisfied, i.e. acceptance of pastoral appointments and use of the A.M.E. Zion name, customs and polity, awareness that the church doctrine required church property to be held in trust, a trust exists, even when no trust clause is included in the property deeds. In fact, the appellees argue that the only way to avoid the creation of the trust is to make sure that the conditions are not complied with. They conclude, \u201chaving prospered by its affiliation with A.M.E. Zion for nearly 20 years, and having participated in the functioning of the denomination throughout, appellants may not now pretend that Full Gospel was exempt from any of A.M.E. Zion\u2019s rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The issue this case presents is not a new one for this Court, albeit it has never before been presented in this precise context. We most recently addressed it in <em>Mt. Olive African Methodist Episcopal Church of Fruitland, Inc. v. Board of Incorporators of African Methodist Episcopal Church Inc., </em>348 Md. 299, 703 A.2d 194 (1997). In that case, we framed the question as \u201cwhether the trustees and local congregation lost the rights given' them by the deed of the property and confirmed by the Religious Corporation Law and the corporate charter, to own, use and control that property, when the pastor, trustees, officers, and a majority of the congregation of the local church withdrew from ... affiliation [with the denomination], hierarchical in form, with which it had been affiliated for more than one hundred years. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 703 A.2d at 195. In answering the question, \u201cno,\u201d thus reversing the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which had reversed the summary judgment entered by the Circuit Court, we set out the appropriate analytical framework:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cit is clear that the resolution of church property disputes demand an analysis that involves the review of all relevant documents and circumstances. Unless the deed to the property clearly provides for the holding of the property in trust for the parent church, it is not enough to consider simply the form of the church government, the constitution or other authoritative sources pertinent to the parent church\u2019s claim to the property, consideration must also be given to the Religious Corporations Law, the relations between the parties, and the local church charter. The latter at the very least provides insight into the relations between the parties and may evidence the local church\u2019s consent to the form of government and to be bound by provisions in the parent church\u2019s constitution or other authoritative sources pertaining to the ownership and control of its property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 320, 703 A.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In formulating this analytical framework, the Court began with a review of the Maryland precedents, which resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>confirmation of the principles enunciated in <em>Maryland and Virginia Eldership of Churches of God v. Church of God at Sharpsburg, </em>249 Md. 650, 663, 241 A.2d 691, 699 (1968) <em>(Eldership </em>I) and <em>Maryland and Virginia Eldership of Churches of God v. Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc., </em>254 Md. 162, 165, 254 A.2d 162, 165 (1969), <em>aff'd, </em>396 U.S. 367, 90 S.Ct. 499, 24 L.Ed.2d 582 (1970) <em>(Eldership </em>II). <em>Eldership I </em>started with the proposition that it is clear that incorporation under the General Religious Corporations Law applicable to all religious groups results in the trustees and the local congregation having ownership and control of the property of the local church. 249 Md. at 658, 241 A.2d at 696. <em>See, </em>to the same effect, <em>Eldership II, </em>254 Md. at 174, 254 A.2d at 169 (\u201cBy the nature of the law in regard to the formation of corporations generally, the religious corporation formed under it is controlled by trustees elected by the local membership.\u201d). We concluded that, of the \u201c[a]t least three kinds of internal structure, of \u2018polity\u2019 \u201d \u2014 congregational, presbyterial, and episcopal \u2014 identified in <em>Eldership I, see </em>249 Md. at 662, 241 A.2d at 698, \u201cMaryland law contemplates a congregational form of church government.\u201d <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 314, 703 A.2d at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The ownership and control of such corporations need not remain perpetually with the trustees, however. <em>Id. </em>at 315, 703 A.2d at 202. That point, we noted, is clearly made by the enumeration in <em>Eldership I </em>of three ways an hierarchical denomination may insure its control over local church property, <em>id.; see also </em>249 Md. at 663, 241 A.2d at 699, as well as by the recognition that \u201cthe nature, extent, and consequences of an affiliation are ... matters to be determined by the trustees and the congregation, in conjunction with the denomination or parent church with which the local church chooses to affiliate,\u201d ordinarily is a matter of contract. <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 316, 703 A.2d at 202. <em>See also Eldership I, </em>249 Md. at 672, 241 A.2d at 704; <em>Eldership II, </em>254 Md. at 176, 254 A.2d at 170. The \u201cpolity\u201d or the form of the church government of the particular denomination, though not controlling, is an important consideration when deciding whether there is a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>which alters the ownership and control of the property, at least when there is no express language bearing on the subject in the deed conveying the property. <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 317, 703 A.2d at 203, (citing and quoting <em>Eldership </em>I, 249 Md. at 662, 241 A.2d at 698).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">That the form of church government is not dispositive was illustrated by <em>Eldership I. </em>There, although the General Elder-ship of the Church of God was hierarchal in nature, its constitution did not address the ownership and control of local church property, beyond recommending both that such property be deeded in trust to trustees and the insertion in such deeds of provisions requiring reversion to the appropriate annual eldership upon the church\u2019s becoming extinct or failure to remain doctrinally compatible, the local charter of one of the local churches was explicit in its inclusion of a statement that affiliation with a religious denomination would not affect its control and ownership of its property. <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 317-18, 703 A.2d at 203, (citing <em>Eldership I, </em>249 Md. at 665-66, 241 A.2d at 700) To the <em>Eldership </em>Court, it was \u201cplain that it was never contemplated that the property of the local churches should be subject to the control of the Eldership.\u201d 254 Md. at 170, 254 A.2d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><em>Babcock Mem.

In <em>Babcock, </em>express consent to a provision in the religious denomination\u2019s constitution prohibiting sale, mortgage or encumbrance of local church property without the consent of the Presbytery was supplied by a provision in the charter of the local church stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the local church should \u201cforever remain a Presbyterian Church in accordance with the Standards of the Presbyterian Church of the United States\u201d and a by-law affirming the local church\u2019 affiliation with the United Presbyterian Church of the United States and acknowledging the subordination of the bylaws to the Constitution of the United Presbyterian Church. <em>Id. </em>at 318-19, 703 A.2d at 203-04, (citing and quoting <em>Babcock, </em>296 Md. at 580, 577, 579, 464 A.2d at 1012, 1011, 1018).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The minutes of the General Assembly of the parent church which denied \u201cthe right of any local church as a whole to withdraw from the General Assembly\u201d provided the basis for parental church control of the local church property in <em>Polen. Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 318, 703 A.2d at 203,(quoting <em>Polen, </em>259 Md. at 34, 267 A.2d at 206). The local church\u2019s consent to that provision \u201cwas implied and was inferred from the relationship between the parent church and the local congregation.\u201d Id. at 319, 703 A.2d at 204,(citing <em>Polen, </em>259 Md. at 36, 267 A.2d at 207).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">With this background, we turned to a consideration of the decision of the intermediate appellate court. As indicated, that court reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, but on a ground different from that on which the trial court relied. The Circuit Court granted summary judgment on two grounds, the absence of trust language in the deeds to the church property and the failure of the applicable Book of Discipline to provide for the reversion of the property in the event of a withdrawal from the denomination. Although agreeing with the Circuit Court that the deeds supported the retention of the church property by the local church and assuming the correctness of its finding with regard to the Book of Discipline, the Court of Special Appeals reached the opposite conclusion, based on a provision in the local church\u2019s certificate of incorporation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>This Court, in rejecting the intermediate appellate court\u2019s rationalization, noted its satisfaction that the trial court was legally correct. 348 Md. at 323, 703 A.2d at 206. In making that determination, we reviewed the arguments made to the trial court, concluding that \u201c[t]he major thrust ... was that the A.M.E. Discipline ... mandates a result in its favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By confirming the legal correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, acknowledging that it responded to the arguments presented, rejecting in the process, the contention that a Book of Discipline containing trust language was applicable, we impliedly rejected the A.M.E. Church\u2019s reliance on church doctrine to the exclusion of the evidence derived from an inspection of the relevant documents along with the applicable Book of Discipline. <em>Id. </em>at 323-26, 703 A.2d at 206-07. What we said with respect to the office of the local church charter is consistent with such a rejection and, therefore, instructive on the issue this case presents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">\u201cThe charter is, on the one hand, a relevant document which must be considered when there is a question raised as to the adequacy of the proof that the parent church has acted, consistent with its form of church government, to maintain ownership or control over local church property and, therefore, the local congregation\u2019s consent to the parent church\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>hegemony in that regard must be shown. Where, on the other hand, there is no evidence of the parent church having so acted, its constitution and other authoritative documents being silent on the critical issue, the deed to the property lacking any indication of its interest, and there being no legislation to bridge the gap, the relevance of the charter is at best marginal. In that circumstance, where the only evidence is essentially the form of church government, which as we have seen is hardly dispositive, without more, nothing less than the clearest statement of intention that the parent church own and control property deeded to the local church, which also paid for it, will suffice. The office of the charter, in short, ordinarily, is to provide evidence of the local church\u2019s consent to be bound by the parent church\u2019s polity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">348 Md. at 326 n. 14, 703 A.2d at 207 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">As in <em>Mt. Olive, </em>the issue is the ownership of the church property acquired by From the Heart during its affiliation with A.M. E. Zion. More specifically, it is whether, because the case was decided on summary judgment, there is in the record evidence, of which there is no genuine dispute, <em>see </em>Maryland Rule 2-501 (a), that the church property was impressed with a trust, express or implied, in favor of A.M.E. Zion, as and when From the Heart acquired it. This issue must be resolved without determining ecclesiastical questions, <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 310, 703 A.2d at 199, (citing <em>Watson v. Jones, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) at 729, 20 L.Ed. at 676-77), and by applying \u201cneutral principles of law, developed for use in all property disputes, which can be applied without \u2018establishing\u2019 churches to which property is awarded.\u201d <em>Presbyterian Church, </em>393 U.S. at 449, 89 S.Ct. at 606, 21 L.Ed.2d at 665. Stated simply, the neutral principles of law approach \u201crelies exclusively on objective, well-established concepts of trust and property law familiar to lawyers and judges. It thereby promises to free civil courts completely from entanglement in questions of religious doctrine, polity, and practice.\u201d <em>Jones v. Wolf, </em>443 U.S. 595, 603, 99 S.Ct. 3020, 3025, 61 L.Ed.2d 775, 785 (1979)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Jones v. Wolf, </em>supra, concerned a property dispute between the local church and the denomination with which it was affiliated. Having examined the property deeds, state statutes, local church charter, the denomination\u2019s constitution and Book of Church Order for language of trust in favor of the denomination, and finding none, the Georgia courts held that legal title to the local church property was vested in the local church congregation, concluding that the mere connectional relationship between the local church and the denomination was an insufficient basis upon which to establish property rights in the denomination. The United States Supreme Court approved this \u201cneutral principles of law\u201d approach as an acceptable method of resolving that church property dispute. It cautioned, however, that although the analysis may involve examination of some religious instruments, such as a church constitution, the inquiry must be performed in purely secular terms without relying \u201con religious precepts in determining whether the document indicates that the parties have intended to create a trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604, 99 S.Ct. at 3026, 61 L.Ed.2d at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Thus, neutral principles of law are principles that are \u201capplicable not only to religious bodies, but to public and private lay organizations and to civil governments as well.\u201d <em>Kennedy v.

The creation of a trust depends upon the intention of the settlor. <em>See Mory v. Michael, </em>18 Md. 227, 240-41 (1862). In fact, it is that purpose and intention, rather than the use of any particular term, that determines whether a valid trust has been established. Thus, a trust will not be created where none in fact was contemplated. <em>See Doty v.

Kelley, </em>178 Md. 389, 399, 13 A.2d 529, 533 (1940) (an express, resulting or constructive trust must be proven by clear and convincing evidence). <em>See Masters v. Masters, </em>200 Md. 318, 332, 89 A.2d 576, 582 (1952). This Court has recognized that, because it may be one of the consequences of affiliation with a denomination or parent church, matters to be determined by the trustees and the local congregation, the control of the local property may be modified, ordinarily by contract, express or implied, or otherwise. <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 316, 703 A.2d at 202; <em>Eldership I, </em>249 Md. at 672, 241 A.2d at 704; <em>Eldership II, </em>254 Md. at 176, 254 A.2d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Under Maryland law, the property of a charitable or religious nonprofit corporation is held in trust. <em>See Inasmuch Gospel Mission, Inc. v. Mercantile Trust Co., </em>184 Md. 231, 239, 40 A.2d 506, 510 (1945). Indeed, the property of a local church is held in trust by the religious nonprofit corporation for the benefit of the local church congregation, <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 314, 703 A.2d at 201, and cases therein cited at n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>10, unless the control of that property is modified by contract, express or implied. <em>Id </em>at 316-17, 703 A.2d at 202-03. <em>See Watson v. Jones, </em>80 U.S. at 720, 20 L.Ed. at 673 (holding that \u201ctrustees obviously hold possession for the use of the persons who by the constitution, usages and laws of the [church], are entitled to that use\u201d). This is the effect of incorporation under the General Religious Corporation Law, as we made clear in <em>Eldership I, </em>in which we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">\u201cIt is clear that when a congregation is incorporated under the General Religious Law applicable to all religious groups, the trustees and the local congregation own and control the property of the local church.... There is no provision in the General Religious Law that the local congregation conform to or follow any particular religious tenet or doctrine and it is apparent that it would be inappropriate for the General Assembly to have made such a provision. In short, the General Religious Law is concerned with the ownership, use and disposition of property, not with any religious theories, doctrines or tenets.... So far as the Maryland statutory law is concerned, there seems little doubt that the trustees and congregations of the local churches are entitled to own, use and control the property of the respective corporations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM9\">249 Md. at 658, 241 A.2d at 696 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Once established, a trust may be modified without the beneficiaries\u2019 consent, but only if the power to do so is reserved. <em>Milholland, </em>89 Md. at 215, 43 A. at 44. If no such right has been reserved, then the beneficiaries\u2019 consent is required before the trust may be modified. <em>See Allen v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>177 Md. 26, 29, 7 A.2d 180, 181 (1939). A trust may be designated as either revocable or irrevocable, <em>See Hoffa v. Hough, </em>181 Md. 472, 475, 30 A.2d 761, 762 (1943); in the absence of a designation, the trust is revocable by any act sufficient to manifest the settlor\u2019s intention to revoke the trust. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We now turn to apply the foregoing principles to the case <em>sub judice. </em>As we have seen, A.M.E. Zion is hierarchal in its internal government structure. It also provides in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>governing documents, the <em>Book of Discipline </em>in effect at all times relevant to the case <em>sub judice, </em>a trust clause that requires places held, or thereafter acquired by a local church, for the purpose of worship or parsonage, to be held in trust for the denomination. The <em>Book of Discipline </em>further provides that this requirement applies whether, or not, the deed or other written instrument by which the premises are held contains the trust clause prescribed in the <em>Book of Discipline, </em>so long as \u201cany or all\u201d of certain enumerated occurrences are shown. Insofar as the property acquired by From the Heart is concerned, it is undisputed that these indications existed and have been shown: the property was conveyed to the trustees for From the Heart, From the Heart, as Full Gospel, used the name, customs, and polity of A.M.E. Zion and was known in the community as a member of the congregation of the denomination and From the Heart, as Full Gospel, accepted the pastor appointed by a Bishop of A.M.E. Zion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">It is also undisputed that the property acquired by From the Heart while a member of A.M.E. Zion was titled in its name, as a Maryland Religious Corporation, with no mention of A.M.E. Zion. None of the deeds to the property contained language indicating that the property was being held in trust for A.M.E. Zion. Moreover, From the Heart\u2019s Articles of Incorporation do not mention A.M.E. Zion and, in fact, vests its trustees with broad power to act, consistent with the General Corporation law. To be sure, the initial charter, by stating as part of its purpose, \u201cto engage in any other lawful activity in accordance with the Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church,\u201d acknowledged From the Heart\u2019s affiliation with A.M.E. Zion. As it was permitted by \u00a7 5-308 to do, however, From the Heart amended its charter to delete that reference and to expand its corporate powers, both consistent with the General Corporation law provisions. In addition, the church by-laws do not mention or contain any reference to A.M.E. Zion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Under <em>Mt. Olive, </em>consistent with the <em>Eldership </em>cases, a court faced with a church property dispute must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>review all relevant documents and circumstances, to include the denomination\u2019s polity, its constitution and other authoritative sources, the Religious Corporations law, the relations between the parties, the local church\u2019s charter and other pertinent documents to determine the proper resolution. 348 Md. at 320, 703 A.2d at 204. Indeed, we made clear, unless the deed to the property contains a trust provision in favor of the denomination, review solely of the doctrine and polity of the denomination simply is not sufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In entering summary judgment in favor of A.M.E. Zion, the trial court noted the existence of the factors enumerated in the Book of Discipline as indicating the acceptance of the denomination\u2019s polity and its requirement as to the holding of church property in trust and entered the judgment on the denomination\u2019s behalf on that basis. Because those factors apply only when there is no provision in the local church\u2019s deeds directing that the property is being held in trust for A.M.E. Zion and the record does not reflect consideration of any other documents or circumstances, it appears that the court failed to comply with <em>Mt. Olive. </em>For that reason alone, summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><em>Mt. Olive, </em>as indicated, requires that <em>all </em>relevant documents and circumstances must be reviewed. To be sure, the trial court considered that From the Heart, as Full Gospel, complied with the enumerated actions in the Discipline that purport to indicate From the Heart\u2019s agreement, as Full Gospel, to the establishment of a trust even though it did not include in the deeds to the property it acquired the trust language specified in the Discipline. The trial court, however, did not consider the contrary evidence, i.e., From the Heart\u2019s intentional deeding of the property in its name only, not in trust, the national, denomination\u2019s acknowledgment of, and acquiescence in, this deeding irregularity, From the Heart\u2019s amendment of its charter to remove any reference to the A.M.E. Zion church and to vest its trustees with even greater authority to control the property of the church, evidence that may be construed to suggest that From the Heart did not, in fact, consent to the trust provisions. In effect, therefore, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>court considered only the church polity, from which it determined that From the Heart consented to abide by the A.M.E. Zion Discipline. By so doing, and, thus, failing to consider all of the relevant documents and circumstances, the trial court simply and inappropriately has deferred to the church doctrine; it has relied on religious precepts to enforce From the Heart\u2019s \u201cConnectional responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The Supreme Court, <em>see Presbyterian Church, </em>393 U.S. at 449, 89 S.Ct. at 606, 21 L.Ed.2d at 665, <em>Watson, </em>80 U.S. at 727, 20 L.Ed. at 676, as has this Court, <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 309-312, 703 A.2d at 199-200, and those of our sister States that have addressed the issue, e.g., <em>West v. Belin, </em>858 S.W.2d at 101; <em>Holmstrom v. Sir, </em>590 N.W.2d at 540, have made clear that not only are civil courts prohibited from deciding religious disputes, but that they must refrain from resolving property disputes on a doctrinal basis. In fact, as we have seen, this Court has instructed that where there is no clear provision in the deed to local church property calling for the holding of the property in trust for the parent church, \u201cit is not enough to consider simply the form of the church government, the constitution or other authoritative sources pertinent to the parent church\u2019s claim to the property, consideration must also be given to the Religious Corporations Law, the relations between the parties and the local church charter.\u201d <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 320, 703 A.2d at 204. This is consistent with what the Supreme Court said in <em>Jones v. Wolf, </em>supra,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">\u201cIn undertaking an examination of religious documents, such as a church constitution, a civil court must take special care to scrutinize the document in purely secular terms, and not to rely on religious precepts in determining whether the document indicates that the parties have intended to create a trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">443 U.S. at 604, 99 S.Ct. at 3026, 61 L.Ed.2d at 785. <em>See also Swanson v. Roman Catholic Bishop, </em>692 A.2d 441, 445 n. 7 (Me.1997) (When applying neutral principles of law to resolve church-related disputes, courts may examine church docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>merits when they can be scrutinized in \u201cpurely secular terms\u201d and the court is not required to rely on religious precepts in determining the question before it). Moreover, allowing consent to be found from examination of the church Discipline alone, with no consideration of the other documents and circumstances is not simply to disregard <em>Mt. Olive, </em>but it comes quite close to, if it does not do so, violating the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition against resolving \u201crights to the use and control of church property on the basis of a judicial determination that one group of claimants has adhered faithfully to the fundamental faiths, doctrines and practices of the church prior to the schism, while the other group of claimants has departed substantially therefrom. Pressed to its logical conclusion, such a judicial inquiry becomes a heresy trial. Such trials may not properly be conducted by any civil court, state or Federal.\u201d <em>Atkins v. Walker, </em>200 S.E.2d at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><em>Presbytery of Beaver-Butler of United Presbyterian Church v. Middlesex Presbyterian Church, </em>is relevant on this issue. In that case, by corporate charter amendment, an affiliated church of the United Presbyterian Church of the United States of America (UPCUSA) voted to disaffiliate. It defended an action by UPCUSA for ownership of the church property by contending that they never agreed to surrender title to the national denomination. Reversing the judgment of the Commonwealth Court, which rejected the defense, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201cThe Commonwealth Court chose to accept that the question was one of deference and yielded the issue to the judicature of UPCUSA. We believe, under the circumstances, they went further than required. Indeed they seemed to have mandated deference simply because there existed a judicature in the national church body. They would have been correct if the issue was doctrinal, it however is, whether there ever existed an agreement at all: an issue that requires no doctrinal exegesis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">489 A.2d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The argument that the A.M.E. Zion makes, that where the Church Discipline contains trust language and provides for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>situation in which the local church fails to deed the local church property in trust to the national denomination, the court need resort only to the church Discipline to resolve the property dispute was also made in <em>Mt. Olive, </em>and rejected. Only when there is clear trust/reverter language in the deed to the property (Eldership option I), or a statute enacted by the Legislature (Eldership option III), is there no need to consider other documentation. When, however, Eldership option II is at issue, it is necessary to consider other documentation or circumstances to determine whether the local church has consented to the provision in the Discipline providing for the reversion of that property. Indeed, we have indicated that \u201c[t]he office of the charter ... ordinarily, is to provide evidence of the local church\u2019s consent to be bound by the parent church\u2019s polity.\u201d <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 326 n. 14, 703 A.2d at 207 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"> In any event, in Maryland, unless otherwise specifically provided, a trust is revocable. <em>See Hoffa v. Hough, </em>181 Md. 472, 30 A.2d 761 (1943) (holding that a settlor creating a trust may designate it to be either revocable or irrevocable, and if no designation is made, the trust is then revocable, by any act sufficient to manifest the settlor\u2019s intention to revoke the trust). Thus, as circumstances and situations change, a trust may be revoked. Paragraphs 494 and 495. 1 of the Book of Discipline provide for a trust in favor of A.M.E. Zion as to premises \u201cheld or hereafter acquired\u201d for use and occupancy of a place of worship or a parsonage for the use of its ministers. These provisions apply, clearly, to the situation when the local church is affiliated with the denomination. Neither indicates that the trust thus created is irrevocable nor that it addresses the situation in which, as occurred here, the local church terminates the affiliation. There is no express provision dealing with the disposition of church property when a local church dis-affiliates from the denomination and certainly there is not an express provision mandating that such church relinquish its property upon that occurrence. Consent to holding property in trust during the course of affiliation does not automatically constitute consent to relinquishing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>property once the affiliation terminates. This is particularly the case where the trust is revocable and is, therefore, another reason that there must be a more expanded review of documents and circumstances, as required by Mt. Olive, rather than merely the review of the church Discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

In the Report, Bishop Foggie stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\"All kinds of misconceptions arose: criticism of the A.M.E., taking in members already Zionites, worship practices not in accordance with Zion\u2019s' tradition, presumption to hold an International Institute for pastors and leaders, the property was not correctly deeded to the Denomination, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u201cWhat those who were misinformed or ill-informed did not know was that Brother Cherry did not move without calling me or coming to Pittsburgh to discuss matters with me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\">. That provision was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\"Know all men by these presents,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">\u201cThat the members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church situated at Fruitland Wicomico Counly State of Maryland ... at the church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>building known as Mount Olive on the thirteenth day of April Eighteen hundred and ninety four ... then and there resolved to organize and constitute themselves as a body politic or corporate and for that purpose elected Ebin Stanford, William Cornish, William Cottman, Nathaniel Stanford, S.C. Bulter and Ephraim Banks as Trustees in the name and on behalf of the said Mount Olive African Methodist Episcopal Church and congregation under the provisions of the Public General laws of Maryland and at the said meeting adopted the following regulations, to Wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaK\">4: * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\"4.

The power and authority of said Trustees shall be in subjection to the discipline of said church and the property held by them in trust for the use of the ministry and membership of said church as a place of worship and as a parsonage or dwelling house for the preacher subject to the ministerial appointment of the proper authorities in said church.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b230-5\">. An implied trust results from the legal implication of the facts and circumstances presumed to evidence the intent of the parties. When an express trust fails, an implied trust usually arises. <em>Taylor v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., 269 </em>Md. 531, 539, 307 A.2d 670, 674-75 (1973). <em>See Rector v. Episcopal Church, </em>224 Conn. 797, 620 A.2d 1280, 1283 (1993). In that case, the Supreme Court of Connecticut applied the implied trust doctrine to uphold the trial court\u2019s finding of a trust in favor of the national denomination. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">\u2018\u2018[I]in resolving ownership disputes over church property, a civil court must first determine whether an express trust exists, and if it does, the court must enforce its terms. If no express trust is found, the court must determine whether an implicit trust exists in favor of the general church. In conducting this inquiry, the court must examine the polity of the church, in addition to the church constitution and its canons, for language of trust in favor of the general church.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">. An essential element of constructive trusts is fraud. <em>Eisinger Mill &amp; Lumber Co. v. Dillon, </em>159 Md. 185, 191, 150 A. 267, 270 (1930). No such allegation has been made in the case sub judice and, so, this category of trusts is not applicable and will not further be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
