We answer in the affirmative to both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The Maryl\u00e1nd Commission on Human Relations (\u201cCommission\u201d) is an independent agency charged with investigating complaints of discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations under Article 49B of the Maryland Code and bringing legal and equitable actions pertaining to those violations. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two verified complaints of employment discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>were filed with the Commission against the Talbot County Detention Center (\u201cDetention Center\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One complainant alleged that he had been subject to race and gender discrimination in the workplace, the Talbot County Detention Center, and another alleged that she had been sexually harassed in the same workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">In accordance with statutory obligations, the Executive Director referred the complaints to the Commission staff to investigate and ascertain facts surrounding the allegations. <em>See </em>Art. 49B, \u00a7 10. As part of its investigation, the Commission conducted, or attempted to conduct, numerous interviews of employees of the Detention Center. According to the Commission, however, these interviews were seriously impeded by the Detention Center\u2019s interference, namely, its efforts to discourage nonparty witnesses (other employees) from participating in the interviews and its insistence on appearing at confidential interviews of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>As a result, on June 29, 2001, the Commission sought injunctive relief in the Circuit Court for Talbot County to stop the Detention Center from obstructing the Commission\u2019s investigation of employment discrimination. The Commission\u2019s petition for injunctive relief sought to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axt\">prohibit [the Detention Center] and [its] agents from appearing at confidential witness interviews, or influencing witness testimony with regard to the instant investigation into allegations of employment discrimination, and from contacting Commission investigative staff, except as required by the investigation, and that the injunction remain in effect until the completion of the administrative proceedings, and that [the Detention Center] post notices in the workplace, as approved by the Commission, setting forth the State\u2019s anti-discrimination law, including a statement that it is unlawful for an employer to retaliate against one who flies, or participates as. a witness in, a complaint of discrimination, ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The Detention Center, in its response dated July 3, 2001, asserted that the Circuit Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Petition for Temporary Injunctive Relief. The Detention Center further alleged that the Commission\u2019s authority to investigate was limited to the investigative mechanisms set forth in Title 14, Subtitle 3 of the Code of Maryland Regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the Detention Center argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the Commission is <em>only </em>allowed to: (1) require a fact-finding conference; (2) require the respondent to promptly provide answers to requests for information; (3) serve interrogatories on a respondent; and (4) issue subpoenas, if necessary, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of documents. <em>See </em>COMAR 14.03.01.04. With respect to the latter, the Detention Center claimed that the use of the word \u201ctestimony\u201d indicated that the Commission\u2019s interviews of the witnesses should be formal recorded proceedings, and thus the Commission had no authority to conduct interviews confidentially and in the absence of a representative from the Detention Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">On August 17, 2001, the Circuit Court heard oral argmnent on the Commission\u2019s petition and, ruling from the bench, denied the Commission injunctive relief. In so ruling, the Circuit Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">[w]hat you are asking the Court to do is to tell counsel or anyone not to go to your office and this is your office, you have control over it .... if this is your investigation then you can conduct it in your own office, on your own terms. And I don\u2019t see why the Court has to get involved in this. You also asked me to prevent ... [the Detention Center] or their agents from contacting the Commission\u2019s investigation staff....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">but <em>that is not this Court\u2019s function </em>to step in here and tell them not to call your office .... you haven\u2019t even filed a complaint against the Detention Center. You don\u2019t even know at this time that there is a reason to do that, you haven\u2019t held a hearing. So it seems to me that <em>what you are asking the Court to do is not what was intended by granting the Court this authority.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">And ... the other thing is you want to prevent the agents of the Detention Center from contacting or influencing witness testimony .... <em>that is not the purpose of this statutory provision </em>... it seems to me you have a right to conduct an investigation under the law. And how you do that at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>stage is not the Court\u2019s interest.... So the Court will deny the requested injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">(emphasis added). It is unclear from the Circuit Court\u2019s verbal ruling whether its denial of the injunction was based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, as was initially proffered by the Detention Center, or whether the denial itself was an exercise of the Circuit Court\u2019s discretion. The parties have proceeded on the assumption that the court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief was for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Our discussion will address this premise as well as the propriety of the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the injunction based on the merits of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The Commission appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the injunction to the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court ordered, on its own initiative, that a writ of certiorari be issued to consider whether the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Generally, appellate courts review a trial court\u2019s determination to grant or deny injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion because trial courts, sitting as courts of equity, are granted broad discretionary authority to issue equitable relief. <em>See J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm., </em>368 Md. 71, 93, 792 A.2d 288, 301 (2002). <em>See El Bey v. Moorish Sci. Temple of Am., </em>362 Md. 339, 354-55, 765 A.2d 132, 140 (2001) (stating that while normally a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny injunctive relief is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, \u201cno such deference [is given] when we find \u2018an obvious error in the application of the principles of equity\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Western Md. Dairy, Inc. v. Chenowith, </em>180 Md. 236, 244, 23 A.2d 660, 665 (1942)); <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 394, 761 A.2d 899, 911 (2000). When injunctive relief is provided by statute, however, a court\u2019s decision to issue injunctive relief is no longer rooted in traditional principles of equity; rather, it is based upon the statutory guidelines. <em>See United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers\u2019 Co-op., </em>532 U.S. 483, 497, 121 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>1711, 1721, 149 L.Ed.2d 722, 736 (2001) (\u201ca court sitting in equity cannot \u2018ignore the judgment of Congress, deliberately expressed in legislation.\u2019 ... A district court cannot, for example, override Congress\u2019 policy choice, articulated in a statute as to what behavior should be prohibited.\u201d) (internal citations omitted); <em>Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, </em>456 U.S. 305, 313, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 1803, 72 L.Ed.2d 91, 99 (1982)(stating that \u201cCongress may <em>intervene and guide or control the exercise of the courts\u2019 discretion.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>United States v. Massachusetts Water Res. Auth., </em>256 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir.2001). Rather than relying on the broader notions in equity, our Legislature provided explicit guidelines within which a court must exercise its authority to issue an injunction; thus, it is these criteria to which we look when determining whether the court\u2019s decision to grant or deny injunctive relief was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">We digress momentarily to note that the degree of discretionary authority a court maintains when considering injunctions sought pursuant to, and authorized by, a specific statute is a novel question, not explored by this Court to date. Federal jurisdictions, including the United States Supreme Court, have had the opportunity to consider the inherent differences that exist when a court is asked to issue injunctive relief under its equitable powers versus when the court entertains requests for injunctive relief pursuant to a specific statute and have outlined some considerations for determining whether equitable powers are usurped by statutory mandates. On one end of the spectrum, in <em>Tennessee Authority v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978), the Supreme Court held that Congress, in the Endangered Species Act, clearly circumscribed the courts\u2019 jurisdiction in equity because the statute contained a blanket prohibition against \u201cjeopardizing] the continued existence of endangered species;\u201d thus, upon a concession that the Tellico Dam would destroy the snail darter, the court was required to issue an injunction. <em>Id. </em>at 193-95, 98 S.Ct. at 2301-02, 57 L.Ed.2d at 146-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>In other cases, however, the Supreme Court has refused to find that other statutes spawned an absolute duty upon courts to issue injunctive relief. Most recently, in <em>United States v. Oakland Cannibus Buyers Co-op., supra, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized that its ruling in <em>Hill, </em>i.e. that the District Court lacked discretion to deny an injunction, was based solely on the fact that an injunction in that case was the \u201conly means of ensuring compliance\u201d with the statute and the \u201corder of priorities\u201d established by Congress would otherwise be \u201cdeprived of effect.\u201d <em>Oakland Cannibus Buyers Co-op., </em>532 U.S. at 496-97, 121 S.Ct. at 1721, 149 L.Ed.2d at 735-36. <em>See also Romero-Barcelo, </em>456 U.S. at 313, 102 S.Ct. at 1803, 72 L.Ed.2d at 99 (stating that while \u201cCongress may intervene and guide or control the exercise of the courts\u2019 discretion, ... we do not lightly assume that Congress has intended to depart from established principles [of equitable jurisdiction]\u201d)(internal quotations omitted). As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Romero-Barcelo, supra, </em>\u201c[t]he grant of jurisdiction to ensure compliance with a statute hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances, and a federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law.\u201d 456 U.S. at 313, 102 S.Ct. at 1803, 72 L.Ed.2d at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are not presented with requests to enjoin actions which violate the law; rather we are presented with requests to enjoin actions which arguably impede the Commission from performing a lawful task, i.e. conducting an uninhibited investigation, actions for which irreparable harm must be evidenced. Section 4 of Article 49B grants the Commission the power to bring a civil action for injunctive relief, outlines when and where such action can be brought, and further establishes the criteria under which an injunction may be sought and granted, i.e. \u201cto preserve the status of the parties or to prevent irreparable harm.\u201d While Section 4 does not expressly eliminate the circuit court\u2019s discretionary authority or expressly create an automatic injunction, it does, in a sense, \u201cnarrow\u201d the circuit court\u2019s discretionary authority by replacing the considerations in eq<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>uity with the statutory criteria: the Commission need only establish a reasonable necessity for an injunction \u201cto preserve the status of the parties or prevent irreparable harm.\u201d Art. 49B? \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Again, while the statute in question may confine the judicial discretion, it does not altogether eliminate it. In <em>United States Postal Service v. Beamish, </em>466 F.2d 804 (3rd% Cir.1972), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed an injunction by the district court even though the district court did not apply traditional equitable standards. The Third Circuit held that the statute under which the injunction was sought clearly circumscribed the traditional equitable discretion that courts possess in granting injunctive relief. <em>See Beamish, </em>466 F.2d at 806. The statute provided that \u201cthe United States district court ... shall ... upon a showing of probable cause to believe [that 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005] is being violated, enter a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3007). The critical difference between the statute in <em>Beamish </em>and the statute before us today is that the <em>Beamish </em>provision spoke <em>directly to the judiciary </em>concerning its authority, or rather its duty, to issue an injunction upon a showing of probable cause. Conversely, in Article 49B, Section 4, the Legislature authorizes the Commission to bring action for injunctive relief when reasonably necessary to prevent irreparable harm or preserve the status of the parties. While the Legislature establishes statutory guidelines for the issuance of injunctive relief, it <em>does not directly eliminate a court\u2019s discretion by mandating a certain outcome. </em>Thus, we shall consider the propriety of the court\u2019s decision to deny injunctive relief with the understanding that the court\u2019s equitable discretion is limited to the extent that the Legislature articulated the applicable guidelines for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Maryland\u2019s anti-discrimination laws are embodied in Article 49B of the Maryland Code, as is the Commission\u2019s investigatory and enforcement authority with respect to the anti-discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>nation legislation. The Commission\u2019s comprehensive investigatory powers include the authority to hold investigatory hearings for fact finding, file civil actions for injunctive relief, receive and issue complaints alleging discrimination, conduct investigations into discrimination complaints, endeavor to reach conciliation between the parties, and initiate and pursue litigation to enforce compliance. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 9A, 10, 11, 12; <em>Molesworth v. Brandon, </em>341 Md. 621, 631, 672 A.2d 608, 613 (1996)(citing <em>Weathersby v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Nat\u2019l Management Co., </em>86 Md.App. 533, 545, 587 A.2d 569, 574 (1991); <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>326 Md. 663, 607 A.2d 8 (1992)); <em>Gutwein v. Easton Publishing Co., </em>272 Md. 563, 564-65, 325 A.2d 740, 741 (1974). The Commission\u2019s enforcement powers, then, cover the gamut, from investigation to commencement and pursuit of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">As noted, the Commission\u2019s powers include the power to bring a civil action to obtain an injunction pursuant to Section 4 of Article 49B. Section 4 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\"><em>At any time after a complaint has been filed, </em>if the Commission believes that appropriate civil action is necessary <em>to preserve the status of the parties or to prevent irreparable harm </em>from the time the complaint is filed until the time of its final disposition, the Commission may bring action to obtain a temporary injunction. The action shall be brought in the circuit court for the county where the place of public accommodation which is the subject of the alleged discrimination is located, or where the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have occurred, or where the dwelling which is the subject of the alleged discrimination is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Md.Code, Art. 49B, \u00a7 4 (emphasis added). Section 4 clearly provides a circuit court with statutory jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief at any time after a complaint has been filed with the Commission. Thus, a circuit court\u2019s authority to entertain actions for injunctive relief and issue appropriate orders while discrimination complaints are pending before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Commission is absolute and unmistakable. Any conclusion to the contrary by the Circuit Court is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The Circuit Court also claimed that it had no authority to instruct counsel for the Detention Center not to appear at witness interviews and not to contact witnesses or investigative agents. The Circuit Court further commented that the Commission \u201c[hasn\u2019t] even filed a complaint against the Detention Center ... [it doesn\u2019t] even know at this time that there is a reason to do that, [it hasn\u2019t] held a hearing.\u201d The Circuit Court erred in basing its ruling on the fact that the Commission had not filed a complaint against the Detention Center; the Circuit Court\u2019s authority to review claims for injunctive relief is triggered upon a filing of a complaint with the Commission, not upon the Commission\u2019s filing of a complaint against the employer. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Art. 49B, \u00a7 4. The Circuit Court did have jurisdiction to issue an injunction, an injunction that might specifically instruct the Detention Center not to appear at interviews and not to contact witnesses, and generally speaking, to prevent the frustration of an investigation by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">With subject matter jurisdiction of the Circuit Court confirmed, we pause to note this Court\u2019s authority under Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to review final judgments of the circuit courts, including judgments denying a request for injunctive relief, and our authority, pursuant to Mainland Rule 8-604(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to order the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>issuance of injunctive relief. Therefore, we will review the propriety of the Commission\u2019s request for injunctive relief, the Detention Center\u2019s counter-arguments, and the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling and, where appropriate, order the issuance of an injunction as requested by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">B. Investigative Mechanisms of the Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Prior to determining the propriety of injunctive relief, however, we shall pause to discuss a few procedural arguments raised by the Detention Center concerning the methods by which the Commission is authorized the conduct its preliminary investigations into employment discrimination claims. The Detention Center alleges that the Commission is limited to the formal investigative mechanisms described in the Code of Maryland Regulations. Specifically, the Detention Center argues that because COMAR 14.03.01.04(5)(a) provides that a subpoena may \u201ccompel the attendance and <em>testimony </em>of witnesses,\u201d the fact-finding interviews of witnesses must be recorded and taken under path. COMAR 14.03.01.04(5)(a). The use of the word \u201ctestimony,\u201d according to the Detention Center, indicates that a subpoenaed witness must be interviewed formally, i.e. under oath or affirmation, and the interview must be recorded and transcribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We disagree with the Detention Center\u2019s suppositions. Most significantly, the statutory authority provided the Commission by Article 49B, Section 10 is not restricted by the subsequently enacted regulations concerning the Commission\u2019s subpoena authority; rather, the regulations provide a more thorough description of the investigative tools that may be utilized by the Commission and the proper procedures for employing these tools. That COMAR contemplates the Commission\u2019s ability to utilize a subpoena during its investigation does not mean that the investigatory and fact-finding powers of the Commission are limited to eliciting information from subpoenaed witnesses or documents; the provisions in CO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>MAR regarding the Commission\u2019s investigatory process are not exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The Commission has the ability, as one of its many investigatory tools, to use a subpoena to compel the attendance or testimony of witnesses or the production of documents. Again, that this is a permissible tool, does not mean that it is the only tool. In fact, subpoena use is qualified by the premise that \u201cif completion of an investigation requires the issuance of a subpoena ...\u201d Thus, it is implied that the Commission\u2019s attempts at acquiring the information without a subpoena have failed, which is, in turn, indicative of the Commission\u2019s inherent ability to gather such information absent a subpoena.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Detention Center further argues that Section 10 was enacted to protect employers from unwarranted or frivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>lous complaints by requiring a preliminary investigation before the employer can be subject to a Commission complaint. The Detention Center claims that because the investigatory process is for its benefit, the Detention Center was entitled to be present during the interviews and to ensure that testimony was taken properly, i.e. recorded and transcribed. Again, we find no merit in this assertion. While the investigative process may, in part, protect an employer from frivolous claims, it was never intended to provide an impenetrable shield through which no investigation could be completed in confidence and without undue influence or intimidation by the employer accused of violating the statute. The Legislature did not mandate that the preliminary investigation must be conducted through formal transcribed interviews where both the witness and the accused are privy to the questioning process; to the contrary, Section 13 of Article 49B indicates that the Legislature intended to keep the investigations confidential, to the extent feasible. As such, we refuse to find that the Detention Center\u2019s presence was required at the witness interviews during the preliminary investigation; nor do we conclude that the statute and regulations require recording and/or transcription of the interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">C. The Propriety of Injunctive Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We turn now to the pivotal issue in this case, i.e. whether the Commission\u2019s request for injunctive relief pursuant to Article 49B, Section 4, should have been granted by the Circuit Court. While the title of Section 4, i.e. \u201c[pjower to bring civil actions for <em>temporary </em>injunction,\u201d would seemingly allude that such an injunction is interlocutory or preliminary in nature, in reality, this statutory injunction shares more of the characteristics of a permanent injunction. As we reiterated in <em>Bey v. Moorish Sci. Temple of Am., </em>362 Md. 339, 765 A.2d 132 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">A permanent injunction is, as its names indicates, \u201can injunction final or permanent in its nature granted after a determination of the merits of the action.\u201d But a permanent injunction is not \u201cpermanent\u201d in the sense that it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>invariably last indefinitely. Rather, it \u201cis one granted by the judgment which finally disposes of the injunction suit.\u201d The difference between an interlocutory injunction and a permanent injunction turns on \u201cwhether there has been a determination on the merits of the claim. If that determination has been made, then the injunction may be final; if not, it is interlocutory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 354, 765 A.2d at 140 (quoting <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 395, 761 A.2d 899, 911 (2000)(intemal. citations omitted)). The statutory injunction authorized by Section 4 is one which may finally dispose of the injunction suit, although its length may only be for the duration of the investigation, as in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Therefore, the factors traditionally required to obtain an interlocutory or preliminary injunction in equity, i.e. (1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits; (2) the \u201cbalance of convenience\u201d determined by whether greater injury would be done to the defendant by granting the injunction than would result from its refusal; (3) whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction is granted; and (4) the public interest, <em>see J.L. Matthews, Inc., </em>368 Md. at 83 n. 8, 792 A.2d at 294-95 n. 8 (quoting <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Rest., Inc., </em>337 Md. 441, 455-56, 654 A.2d 449, 456 (1995)); <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 404-05, 474 A.2d 191, 197 (1984), are largely inapplicable when reviewing the propriety of a statutorily authorized injunction. <em>See Massachusetts Water Res. Auth., </em>256 F.3d at 47 (explaining that court\u2019s usual role of chancery is not appropriate where Congress has provided guidelines for assessing the propriety of a statutory injunction); <em>Gov\u2019t of the Virgin Islands, Dept. of Conservation v.

As the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">The function of a court in deciding whether to issue an injunction authorized by a statute ... to enforce and implement Congressional policy is a different one from that of the court when weighing claims of two private litigants. This is not to say that the [statutory] violation ... automatically requires a district court to issue an injunction. The essence of equity jurisdiction is the power of the court to fashion a remedy depending upon the necessities of the particular case. However, the fact that a federal statute is being enforced by the agency charged with that duty may alter the burden of proof of a particular element necessary to obtain injunctive relief. Once Congress, exercising its delegated powers, has decided the order of priorities in a given area, it is for the courts to enforce them when asked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah\"><em>United States v. Odessa Union Warehouse Co-op, </em>833 F.2d 172, 174-75 (9th Cir.1987)(internal citations omitted). Similarly, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in <em>United States v. Massachusetts Water Res. Auth., supra, </em>discussed the different roles a court must play in terms of considering an injunction under statute or in equity and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">The role a court plays in deciding whether to grant a statutory injunction is different than the one it plays when it weighs the equitable claims of two private parties in a suit seeking injunctive relief. This is so because a court asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>to order a statutory injunction must reconcile two sets of competing concerns. Courts asked to issue an injunction must ordinarily assume the role of a court of chancery \u2014 a role that requires them to determine whether the equities of the case favor, and whether the public interest would be served by, the granting of injunctive relief. But <em>in the context of statutory injunctions, the court\u2019s freedom to make an independent assessment of the equities and the public interest is circumscribed to the extent that Congress has already made such assessments.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">256 F.3d at 47 (internal citations omitted)(emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Because the traditional factors in equity are largely inapplicable to a court\u2019s determination regarding a statutory injunction, and to our review on appeal, we are instead guided by the explicit language of the Legislature which provides that \u201cif the Commission believes that appropriate civil action is necessary to ... prevent irreparable harm ... the Commission may bring action to obtain a temporary injunction.\u201d Md.Code, Art. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>49B, \u00a7 4. The purpose of Section 4 was to \u201cprovid[e] ... the Human Relations Commission [the ability to] seek certain types of court relief in certain cases.... \u201d <em>See </em>1975 Md. Laws, ch. 419, \u00a7 1. In providing for the occasions in which the Commission may seek injunctive relief, the Legislature implicitly established a standard for courts reviewing these requests for injunctive relief; namely, that so long as the Commission satisfies the court that a reasonable necessity exists to preserve the status of the parties or prevent irreparable harm, the requested injunction should be granted. <em>See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, </em>47 F.3d 473, 479 (2nd Cir.1995)(stating that \u201ca railroad seeking statutorily authorized injunctive relief ... is not governed by ... equitable criteria ... a railroad <em>need only demonstrate that there is reasonable cause to believe </em>that a violation of the [Railroad Revitalization Act and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976] has occurred or is about to occur\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted)(emphasis added); <em>United States v. Kaun, </em>827 F.2d 1144, 1148 (7th Cir.1987) (explaining that for statutory injunctions, \u201cthe moving party <em>need only show that there is a reasonable likelihood </em>of future violations in order to obtain relief\u2019Xquoting <em>S.E.C. v. Holschuh, </em>694 F.2d 130, 144 (7th Cir.1982)(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">In considering whether injunctive relief is reasonably necessary, it is important to first understand the utility of an injunction, in general, and that which was contemplated by the Legislature in its use of \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d \u201cAn injunction is a writ framed according to the circumstances of the case commanding an act which the court regards as essential to justice, or restraining an act which it esteems contrary to equity and good conscience.\u201d <em>Bey, </em>362 Md. at 353, 765 A.2d at 139 (internal quotations and citations omitted). In providing the Commission the ability to seek; and the circuit courts the ability to grant, injunctive relief, the Legislature clearly hoped to remedy circumstances that otherwise could result in inequitable or unjust results.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>While case law concerning the issuance of injunctive relief in this State predominately involves a non-statutory injunction, the purpose for issuance of an injunction under statutory authority is similar. As we stated in <em>Bey:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">The very function of an injunction is to furnish <em>preventative relief against imparable mischief or injw% and the remedy will not be awarded where it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the injury complained of is wot of such character. </em>Suitors may not resort to a court of equity to restrain acts, actual or threatened, merely because they are illegal or transcend constitutional powers, unless it is apparent that irremediable injury will result. The mere assertion that apprehended acts will inflict irreparable injury is not enough. The complaining party must allege and prove facts from which the court can reasonably infer that such would be the result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 354, 765 A.2d at 139 (quoting <em>Coster v. Dep\u2019t of Personnel, </em>36 Md.App. 523, 373 A.2d 1287, 1289-90 (1977))(emphasis added). The general function of an injunction in equity, as articulated above, i.e. to furnish preventative relief against irreparable mischief or injury, is markedly similar to the language utilized by the Legislature in Section 4, i.e. to prevent irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Irreparable harm is a pliant term adaptable to the unique circumstances which an individual case might present. We explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">an injury is irreparable, within the law of injunctions, where it is of such a character that a fair and reasonable redress may not be had in a court of law, so <em>that to refuse the injunction would be a denial of justice </em>\u2014 in other words, where, from the nature of the act, or from the circumstances surrounding the person injured, or from the financial condition of the person committing it, it cannot be readily, adequately, and completely compensated for with money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am\"><em>Bey, </em>362 Md. at 356, 765 A.2d at 140 (quoting <em>Coster v. Dep\u2019t of Personnel, </em>36 Md.App. 523, 526, 373 A.2d 1287, 1290 (1977))(emphasis added).' So long as the seeker of injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>relief, (in this case, the Commission, pursuant to Section 4), establishes that there exists some reasonable basis for its belief that an injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable harm, i.e. that the actions of the Detention Center would, if not prevented, cause a denial of justice, see <em>id., </em>the statutory injunction should be granted. <em>See Kaun, </em>827 F.2d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">We pause to reiterate that which the Commission specifically sought, as is ascertained from its petition for injunctive relief and the arguments at the subsequent hearing regarding the petition. It is clear that the Commission sought to prohibit agents from the Detention Center from appearing at confidential witness interviews and insisting that the interviews be recorded and transcribed. The Commission also noted its desire to \u201cprohibit the Detention Center from contacting Commission staff, except as required\u201d and \u201crequire the Detention Center to post notices in the workplace setting forth the State\u2019s anti-discrimination laws.\u201d Evidence was not presented in the record, however, which would allow this Court to determine whether injunctive relief may be appropriate in these circumstances. <em>See State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Suburban Hosp., Inc., </em>348 Md. 413, 417, 704 A.2d 445, 447 (explaining that an appellate court may examine the propriety of a court\u2019s grant or denial of injunctive relief only when the parties have had the opportunity to present evidence on the issues of injunctive relief). Therefore, our analysis will be directed towards the request to enjoin the Detention Center from appearing at confidential witness interviews and insisting that the interviews be recorded and transcribed. Should the Commission desire the injunction to extend to these alternative requests, it must, on remand, present additional evidence before the Circuit Court to establish the reasonableness of its belief that an injunction concerning these requests is necessary to prevent irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The Commission\u2019s request, i.e. to prevent the Detention Center from hindering its investigation into complaints of discrimination by insisting on being present and recording and transcribing confidential interviews, is temperate and reasonable. The public has an interest in ensuring unfettered inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tigati\u00f3ns of illegal company practices, particularly when civil rights are at issue. Accordingly, the Legislature has given the Commission broad authority to conduct such investigations; the Commission has statutory authority to begin a preliminary fact-finding process once a verified complaint is received. The rights of the accused, in this case the Detention Center, are not encumbered by this preliminary investigation; it will have full opportunity to view and contest the evidence gathered, and present its own, <em>if </em>after the preliminary investigation, the Commission decides to file a formal legal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The Commission\u2019s belief that it will suffer irreparable injury is not unreasonable or without basis. Absent an injunction, the Detention Center\u2019s practice of interfering with the investigation by, as the evidence in the record suggests, insisting on being present at witness interviews and by demanding that those interviews be recorded and transcribed may continue, and will likely have the effect of intimidating or influencing witnesses and frustrating the truth-seeking and confidential nature of the investigative process. Furthermore, greater injury would result from the refusal of the injunction than in the granting of it, as ordering the Detention Center to refrain from disrupting the interviews and other aspects of the investigation does not inconvenience the Detention Center, particularly when it has no statutory right to be involved at this preliminary stage of the investigative process. <em>See e.g. Rowe v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., </em>56 Md.App. 23, 30, 466 A.2d 538, 542 (1983)(stating that under the balance of convenience test, the benefits to the complainant must equal or outweigh any harm which the other party might incur should an injunction be granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The Commission presented adequate evidence to support its belief that irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief would occur. The Legislature\u2019s interest in preventing and proscribing, employment discrimination is beyond dispute. Pursuant to that interest, the Legislature explicitly provided the Commission the ability to seek an injunction when prompt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>judicial action is necessary to carry out its purpose and that of the anti-discrimination legislation of Article 49B. Logically speaking, without an unimpeded fact-finding process, the Commission would be precluded from gathering the type of evidence that would normally be necessary to file a bill of complaint, and hence, the enforcement authority of the Commission would be inherently limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The Detention Center argues that the requirements for this statutory injunctive relief \u2014 to preserve the status of the parties or to prevent irreparable harm \u2014 do not exist in this case, and therefore, the court lacks the authority to issue an injunction as a matter of law. The Detention Center bases its argument largely on the fact that the complainants\u2019 employment continued without interruption after the complaint had been filed with the commission; neither of the complainants was terminated, suspended, demoted, or reduced in pay. As such, according to the Detention Center, the status of the parties had not changed and an injunction would be unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In so arguing, the Detention Center cites <em>State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Amecom Div. of Litton Sys., Inc., </em>278 Md. 120, 125, 360 A.2d 1, 5 (1976), as authority for its proposition that the employment of a complainant must somehow be adversely impacted before an injunction could be issued. Notwithstanding that <em>Amecom </em>is distinguishable because it involved an alleged disruption of the \u201cstatus of the parties,\u201d the Detention Center misapplies the <em>Amecom </em>holding in an attempt to narrow the scope of injunctive relief available pursuant to Section 4. In examining Section 4, it is true that \u201cin creating an interlocutory remedy available without a determination on the merits establishing a preexisting right, the Legislature has created, in effect, a new substantive right\u201d with respect to an employee\u2019s right to be free from discrimination in employment. <em>Amecom, </em>278 Md. at 126, 360 A.2d at 5. The protection of this substantive right, however, is not to the exclusion of other possible purposes for which Section 4 may be implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The Commission\u2019s pursuit of an unfettered, uninterrupted, and comprehensive preliminary investigation, if hindered or disrupted by the Detention Center\u2019s actions, would constitute a denial of justice, particularly because the comprehensive and ubiquitous nature of our State\u2019s anti-discrimination legislation suggests both the Legislature\u2019s goals and the indispensable nature of tools of enforcement it afforded the Commission, such as the injunctive relief provided in Section 4. <em>See Molesworth, </em>341 Md. at 632, 672 A.2d at 613-14 (\u201cSection 14 [of Article 49B] is one of at least thirty-four statutes, one executive order, and one constitutional amendment in Maryland that prohibits discrimination based on sex in certain circumstances. Together these provisions provide strong evidence of a legislative intent to end discrimination based on sex in Maryland.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The aforementioned analysis leads this Court to conclude that injunctive relief, pursuant to Article 49B, Section 4, should have been granted to the Commission to enjoin the Detention Center\u2019s practice of interference with its preliminary investigation into employment discrimination complaints by insisting on being present and transcribing the confidential witness interviews. Injunctive relief may be granted when the investigation is so hindered by a party as to cause irreparable harm to the investigative process as a whole, and with respect to this case, the Circuit Court erred in denying injunctive relief to the Commission for the Detention Center\u2019s disruption of the preliminary investigation. Accordingly, we hereby reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s order and remand the case to that court with instructions to issue an injunction to enjoin the Detention Center from interfering with the Commission\u2019s statutorily sanctioned preliminary investigation by insisting on being present at' confidential witness interviews and demanding that those interviews be transcribed for the duration of its preliminary investigation and for any other proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\n<em>THE CIRCUIT COURT OF TALBOT COUNTY\u2019S DENIAL OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS REVERSED AND THE CASE IS REMANDED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF AN IN</em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\n<em>JUNCTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION.

The Detention Center also argued that the Commission\u2019s action for injunctive relief was, itself, invalid because if the Detention Center were, in fact, frustrating the investigation, then Article 49B, Section 11 provides the Commission a method to enforce its investigative authority, i.e. the Commission could issue a subpoena. <em>See Banach </em>v. <em>State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 502, 512-13, 356 A.2d 242, 249 (1976) (holding that the Commission has the authority to issue subpoenas in its preliminary investigation). The Detention Center's assertion is without merit. While a subpoena could certainly compel resistant witnesses to come forward or compel the Detention Center, itself, to produce documents, a subpoena would not have the legal authority to prevent the representatives of the Detention Center from appearing at the confidential interviews. Only an injunction, such as the one the Commission attempted to obtain, could have prevented the frustration of the investigation. Again, this is not an issue of subpoena enforcement. The subpoenaed witnesses arrived and were willing to testify; the Commission objected to interviewing these witnesses because of presence of third party, an agent of the Detention Center, in violation of confidentiality requirements and the undue influence these agents potentially could have on the investigation process. Thus, the subpoena, itself, was honored, but the interview was disrupted by an (unsubpoenaed) third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The Detention Center alternatively challenges the validity of the issuance of a subpoena in the first place by arguing that the issuance of a subpoena was improper because there was no showing \u2022 that the subpoenas were necessary to complete the investigation. Because the County Attorney was not representing the witnesses, the Detention Center has no standing to challenge the issuance of these subpoenas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\">. The decision of the First Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Massachusetts Water Rest.
