We shall hold that because the evidence did not satisfy the test we adopted in <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364 (1978), which guides the admissibility of expert testimony in Maryland, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Garrett Eldred Wilson, petitioner, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of first degree premeditated murder of his infant son, Garrett Michael Wilson. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of life without the possibility of parole. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed his conviction. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>136 Md.App. 27, 764 A.2d 284 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We granted Wilson\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR3\">\u201c1. May the State use statistical data and a product rule computation to prove the improbability of two SIDS deaths in a family where such evidence lacks an adequate foundation and is highly susceptible to misuse by the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">2. Did the trial judge take inadequate corrective action when the State\u2019s Attorney argued to the jury that a statistical computation he performed accurately represented the 1 in 10 million probability of petitioner\u2019s innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">3. May State experts in forensic pathology tell the jury that they drew incriminatory inferences from the defendant\u2019s purchase of life insurance on his infant children and that they made credibility assessments of witnesses in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">4. Did the trial judge err in prohibiting the defense pathologist from explaining why, in his opinion, the defendant\u2019s purchase of life insurance on his children is irrelevant to an expert pathologist\u2019s opinion as to matter of death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">5. Did the trial judge err in admitting evidence of Appellant\u2019s alleged murder of his infant daughter six years before the alleged murder in this case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-11\"><em>Wilson v. State, </em>363 Md. 662, 770 A.2d 169 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">On February 25, 1981, Deborah Oliver Fennell, then petitioner\u2019s wife, gave birth to a daughter, Brandi Jean Wilson. After Brandi\u2019s birth, petitioner purchased two life insurance policies, worth a total of $40,000, on Brandi\u2019s life. Petitioner was the primary beneficiary of these policies, Ms. Fennell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>contingent beneficiary. On April 30, 1981, Brandi died. After an autopsy, her death was labeled as a SIDS death.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On March 22, 1987, Mary Anastasi, petitioner\u2019s wife as of March 1986, gave birth to a son, Garrett Michael Wilson. After Garrett\u2019s birth, petitioner purchased two life insurance policies, worth a total of $150,000, on his son\u2019s life. As with his daughter Brandi\u2019s insurance policies, petitioner was the primary beneficiary and his wife the contingent beneficiary. On August 13, 1987, Garrett died. After an autopsy, his death was also attributed to SIDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On May 28, 1998, the Grand Jury for Montgomery County indicted petitioner for the murder of Garrett Michael Wilson. Wilson proceeded to trial before a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">At trial, Ms. Fennell testified that the night Brandi died was the first and only night that petitioner took care of the child. Soon after Brandi\u2019s death, petitioner filed claims with the two insurance companies from which he had purchased the policies on Brandi\u2019s life, and he collected the insurance proceeds. Like Ms. Fennell, Ms. Anastasi testified that the night of Garrett\u2019s death was the first night that petitioner alone took care of their baby. Petitioner collected the money from insurance policies he had taken out on Garrett\u2019s life soon after the infant\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">At trial, the State presented testimony from the doctors who performed autopsies on Brandi and Garrett. Dr. Ann Dixon performed the autopsy on Brandi. Dr. Dixon testified that she changed her opinion as to the cause of death in Brandi\u2019s case to \u201cprobable suffocation\u201d and the manner of death to \u201cundetermined\u201d on the basis of information provided by the police, including witnesses\u2019 statements and information about the life insurance policies on the two children taken out by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Dr. Charles Kokes performed the autopsy on Garrett. He testified that he changed his opinion as to the cause of death in Garrett\u2019s case to smothering and the manner of death to homicide. Dr. Kokes changed his opinion based on additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>investigative information provided by the State, including the facts surrounding Brandi\u2019s death and interviews with Garrett\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Dr. John Smialek, the chief medical examiner for the State of Maryland, reviewed the original autopsy reports on Brandi and Garrett. In addition, the State provided Dr. Smialek with statements by the children\u2019s parents, family friends, and information regarding the life insurance policies. Dr. Smialek changed his opinion as to the cause of death in Brandi\u2019s case to suffocation and the manner of death to undetermined. Focusing largely on swelling in Garrett\u2019s brain, Dr. Smialek changed his opinion in Garrett\u2019s case to suffocation and the manner of death to homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Dr. Linda Norton did not conduct the autopsy on Brandi or Garrett. She was hired by the State to review the children\u2019s deaths. Dr. Norton concluded that the cause of death in Brandi\u2019s case should be changed to suffocation and the manner of death to homicide. She focused on the similarity between Brandi and Garrett\u2019s deaths and pictures that suggested Brandi\u2019s face was pushed into the mattress of her crib. Dr. Norton also concluded that the cause of death in Garrett\u2019s case was suffocation and that the manner of death was homicide. Her opinion was based on the fact that petitioner was caring for both children at the time they died, and that these occasions were the only times petitioner had cared for either child during the night. She also considered statements from Garrett\u2019s mother and the insurance policies taken out by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Two of the experts, Dr. Kokes and Dr. Norton, also relied on statistics, utilizing the product rule,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a basis for their opinion and in calculating the probability that Garrett had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>died of SIDS. Dr. Kokes testified that \u201c[t]he death rate from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome back in 1987 was somewhere between 1 to 2 deaths for every 1,000 live births.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also noted that Garret had cerebral swelling, a condition that effects less than one percent of children who die from SIDS. Employing the product rule, Dr. Kokes multiplied the probability of a child\u2019s dying of SIDS and the probability of a SIDS death involving cerebral swelling. He concluded that the \u201cthe mathematical possibility of having a SIDS death occurring with cerebral swelling would be 1 in 100,000 live births.\u201d Dr. Kokes then took into account the fact that Garrett was the second child in the family to die of SIDS. He multiplied the probability of Garrett\u2019s dying from SIDS, 1 in 100,000, by the probability of Brandi\u2019s dying of SIDS, 1 in 1,000. He concluded that the probability that Garrett died from SIDS was 1 in 100,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Dr. Norton also testified as to the probability that Garrett died of SIDS. Dr. Norton relied on different statistics that indicated that SIDS occurs in 1 infant out of every 2,000 live births.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Norton employed the product rule and concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>that the probability of two SIDS deaths occurring in one family is 1 in 2,000 multiplied by 1 in 2,000, or 1 in 4,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Petitioner moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the expert testimony regarding the probability that a single family would suffer two SIDS deaths as well as the evidence that he was involved in Brandi\u2019s death. The trial judge denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">During rebuttal closing argument, the State\u2019s Attorney referred to the statistics that the experts relied on in forming their opinion that Garrett\u2019s death was criminal homicide, and argued the probability of petitioner\u2019s innocence. The State\u2019s Attorney did not merely argue that there was a low probability that two SIDS deaths would occur in one family; he argued that there was a low probability that petitioner was innocent. He told the jury, \u201c[i]f you multiply his numbers, instead of 1 in 4 million, you get 1 in 10 million that the man sitting here is innocent. That was what a doctor, their expert, told you.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied and, instead, the court gave a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">We turn first to petitioner\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony that relied on the product rule to calculate the probability that petitioner\u2019s children died of SIDS. It is the general rule that the admissibility of expert testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous. In this regard, the trial judge has wide latitude in determining whether expert testimony is sufficiently reliable to be admissible. <em>See In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. CCJ14746, </em>360 Md. 634, 759 A.2d 755 (2000). Maryland Rule 5-702, addressing the admissibility of expert testimony; provides that such testimony is admissible \u201cif the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Testimony concerning an unreliable scientific process, technique or unreliable opinion is of little value to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>In <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364 (1978), this Court adopted the standard set forth in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923), for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence and expert testimony. <em>See Reed, </em>283 Md. at 389, 391 A.2d at 372. Writing for the Court, Judge Eldridge noted that prior to the admission of expert testimony based on the application of new scientific techniques, it must be first established that the particular scientific method is itself reliable. <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 380, 391 A.2d at 367. Where the validity and reliability of a scientific technique is so broadly and generally accepted within the scientific community, as is the case of ballistic tests, blood tests, and the like, a trial court may take judicial notice of its reliability. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, a court may take judicial notice that certain procedures, widely recognized as bogus or experimental, are unreliable. <em>Id. </em>When the reliability of a particular technique is not subject to judicial notice, however, \u201cit is necessary that the reliability be demonstrated before testimony based on the technique can be introduced into evidence. Although this demonstration will normally include testimony by witnesses, a court can and should also take notice of law journal articles, articles from reliable sources that appear in scientific journals, and other publications which bear on the degree of acceptance by recognized experts that a particular process has achieved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that the proper test for establishing the reliability of scientific opinion is whether the basis of the opinion is generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field. <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 381, 391 A.2d at 368.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The question of whether <em>Frye-Reed </em>applies to the use of statistics arose in <em>Armstead v. </em>State, 342 Md. 38, 673 A.2d 221 (1996). We held there that the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test applies where the proper choice of statistical technique depends upon the applicability of an underlying scientific phenomenon or principle. <em>Id. </em>at 80 n. 33, 673 A.2d at 242 n. 33. We reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201cThe <em>Frye-Reed </em>test often will not apply to statistical calculations because the choice between alternative statistical techniques, although subjective, is often merely a choice between equally valid methods of describing the same underlying scientific data. Statistics are inherently flexible, and thus there are usually multiple correct statistics that can be used to describe the same set of data. Statisticians routinely make choices in presenting data; for example, they may choose to present either the mean, the median, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the mode to describe the \u201ccenter\u201d of a data set. This type of format choice is not subject to <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis. There are, however, instances, as in this case, where the proper choice of statistical techniques is dependent on an underlying scientific phenomenon or principle. For example, suppose that a new species of flower is 'discovered. When it is discovered, a white-flowered variety and a red-flowered variety are observed. It would be incorrect to calculate the probability of a new plant having white flowers based on a normal distribution, because this would depend on whether flower colors varied along a continuum from white to pink to red, or whether there were only discrete possibilities for the flower color, <em>ie., </em>white or red. <em>See </em>R. FREUND &amp; W. WILSON, STATISTICAL METHODS 65-66, 70-76. Under this scenario, the correct choice of probability calculations would depend on the underlying genetics of the plant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>Armstead, </em>342 Md. at 80 n. 33, 673 A.2d at 242 n. 38. Thus, before a scientific expert opinion may be received in evidence, the basis of that opinion must be shown to be generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">A brief discussion of SIDS and the product rule is helpful in understanding how <em>Frye-Reed </em>applies to the case before us. Approximately fifty years ago, the medical community began a search to understand and prevent SIDS. <em>See </em>Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, <em>Distinguishing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome From Child Abuse Fatalities, </em>107 Pediatrics 437 (2001). Today, understanding of the etiology of SIDS still is incomplete. SIDS remains a \u201cdiagnosis of exclusion,\u201d meaning that a \u201cdiagnosis of SIDS reflects the clear admission by medical professionals that an infant\u2019s death remains completely unexplained.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Medical studies consistently have identified the following risk factors for SIDS: prone sleep position, sleeping on a soft surface, maternal smoking during pregnancy, overheating, late or no prenatal care, young maternal age, prematurity and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>low birth weight, and male sex. <em>See </em>Task Force on Infant Positioning and SIDS, <em>Changing Concepts of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Implications for Infant Sleeping Environment and Sleep Position, </em>105 Pediatrics 650 (2000). African Americans and American Indians have consistently higher rates, two to three times the national average. <em>Id. </em>Because the cause of SIDS remains unknown, none of those risk factors are of help in calculating the probability that a child will die of SIDS. Robert M. Reece, <em>Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision, </em>91 Pediatrics 423 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Beyond these commonly accepted risk factors, there is little agreement as to the causes of SIDS. This is particularly true with regard to the role of genetics. Some, including the State, argue that it is generally accepted that there is no genetic defect or condition that can be tied to SIDS. <em>See id. </em>(noting that \u201c[t]he issue of recurrent SIDS within a family raises the possibility of genetically determined conditions.... But when SIDS occurrences among siblings of SIDS cases were compared with those among non-SIDS siblings in maternal age\u2014 and birth rank matched \u2014 control families, there was no statistically significant difference in SIDS rates.... Thus, the notion that having a SIDS baby makes having another more likely was dispelled.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In contrast, a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association presents a study suggesting that SIDS may result from a genetic condition. <em>See </em>Michael J. Ackerman et al., <em>Postmortem Molecular Analysis of SCN5A Defects in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, </em>286 JAMA 2264 (2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>This study draws into question the assertion that SIDS deaths within a single family are independent or unrelated events. Similarly, in the March 2000 edition of <em>Pediatrics, </em>the Task Force on Infant Positioning and SIDS, chaired by John Kattwinkel, M.D., expressed uncertainty as to the risk of SIDS among siblings. The report noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cSeveral studies that have evaluated SIDS among siblings have found that having a sibling who died of SIDS is a significant risk factor. However, others have failed to find such a relationship or have shown that siblings of infants who have died of SIDS are at risk for all causes of infant death, not just SIDS. In addition, most of the studies reporting familial SIDS have the limitation of having been conducted during a period when case and scene investigations were not routine and assignment of the SIDS diagnosis may have been flawed. Thus, the true risk is unknown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">John Kattwinkel, et al., <em>Changing Concepts of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Implications for Infant Sleeping Environment and Sleep Position, </em>105 Pediatrics 650 (2000). In addition, the recent discovery of a deficit in a serotonergic pathway in the brainstem has provided promising insight into the mechanisms responsible for SIDS. <em>Id. See also, </em>HC Kinney et al., <em>Medullary Serotonergic Nework Deficiency in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, </em>60 J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 228 (2001); A. Panigraphy et al., <em>Decreased Serotonergic Recepter Binding in Rhombic Lipderived Regions of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>the Medulla Oblongata in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, </em>59 J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 377 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">With this background in mind, we now turn to the product rule. The product rule \u201cstates that the probability of the joint occurrence of a number of <em>mutually independent </em>events is equal to the product of the individual probabilities that each of the events will occur.\u201d <em>People v. Collins, </em>68 Cal.2d 319, 66 Cal.Rptr. 497, 438 P.2d 33, 36 (1968) (emphasis in original). <em>See also Armstead, </em>342 Md. at 69-70, 673 A.2d at 236 (noting that the product rule is a probability principle that establishes that \u201cthe probability of two events occurring together is equal to the probability that event one will occur multiplied by the probability that event two will occur.\u201d). In <em>Armstead, </em>we explained that \u201c[t]he classic illustration is coin tossing; the probability of finding heads on two successive coin tosses is equal to the probability of heads on the first toss, 50%, times the probability of heads on the second toss, 50%, equaling 25%.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 673 A.2d at 236. We noted that the product rule may be applied only to events that are unrelated to one another, or are independent. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201cIn the coin toss example, this means that the outcome of the first coin toss does not affect the outcome of the second coin toss, which is a valid assumption. By comparison, assume we wish to calculate the probability of having both a checking account and a loan from a particular bank. This is an example of non-independent or linked events. We can not calculate the probability of having both a loan and a checking account at the same bank by multiplying together the individual probabilities under the product rule because a person is more likely to obtain a loan from the bank where he maintains a checking account. To illustrate nonindependence as it applies to human characteristics (although not genetic characteristics), assume we wish to determine the probability a man will have both a beard and a moustache. Also assume that the probability of having a beard is <em>%, </em>and the probability of having a moustache is V It would be incorrect to infer that the probability of having both a beard and a moustache, applying the product rule, is j\u00e1oo, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>it is likely that these are non-independent events; men who have beards are probably more likely than others to also have moustaches.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 70, 673 A.2d at 236 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>petitioner contends that the product rule should not have been used to calculate the likelihood that both of his children died of SIDS because it is not generally accepted in the medical field that SIDS deaths within a single family are independent. The State argues that the statistical evidence introduced at trial was generally accepted and reliable, and further, that because the risk factors for SIDS are independent, it was appropriate for the experts to utilize the product rule and to multiply the probability of one child dying of SIDS times the probability of a second child also dying of SIDS. The State posits that it is accepted universally that SIDS is not caused by any genetic defect, and that the testimony based on the product rule was therefore permissible. The State relies heavily on the conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals that SIDS deaths are independent events. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201c[W]e merely note that appellant\u2019s argument that SIDS deaths are interrelated is not totally accurate. It is accurate to assert that the deaths labeled as SIDS deaths may indeed have a connection. The inaccuracy arises once that, connection is discovered, because the deaths should no longer be identified as SIDS deaths. We must keep in mind that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion that is subject to change if an actual cause is uncovered. The scientific literature has shown that, from what is currently known, SIDS risk factors are not interrelated but are independent. This is particularly true of multiple SIDS deaths in one family, where the likelihood of recurrence is less than one percent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\"><em>Wilson, </em>136 Md.App. at 70, 764 A.2d at 307 (citing Catherine L.

As evidenced by the authorities above cited, there is not general agreement in the scientific community as to the relationship between SIDS deaths within a single family. Stated another way, there is not general agreement in the medical community that multiple SIDS deaths in a single family are genetically unrelated. The literature continues to reflect a lively debate concerning the role of genetics in SIDS. Moreover, the recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that there may well be a genetic component to SIDS. <em>See </em>Michael J. Ackerman et al, <em>Postmortem Molecular Analysis of SCN5A Defects in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, </em>286 JAMA 2264 (2001). If there is any consensus in the field, it is that more research into the question is necessary before general acceptance is reached. One article, which is reflective of thinking in the field, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201cThe extent to which the risk of SIDS is increased in subsequent siblings of a prior SIDS victim has been a subject of active debate. A ten-fold increase in United States SIDS rates in subsequent siblings was initially re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ported, and an 18% SIDS rate was reported among 27 infants with at least two prior SIDS events in siblings. A report from Norway indicated a 3.7 times greater SIDS incidence in subsequent siblings. A subsequent United States study found a four-fold increase but attributed this to increased parity and maternal .age. Taking the average of these and other studies, the increased risk of SIDS in subsequent siblings is about five-fold; assuming a SIDS risk of LS/iooo live births in the United States, then subsequent siblings have about a 0.65% risk of also dying of SIDS. This relationship was further confirmed in an analysis of the SIDS rate in prior siblings of SIDS victims; Beal <em>et al, </em>reported a relative risk of 6.8 for SIDS in prior siblings compared with controls, and a comparable rate has been reported in twins. It is also important to note that the risk for infant death from causes other than SIDS also increases about six-fold in siblings of a prior SIDS victim; because many of the epidemiological risk factors for SIDS and other causes of infant mortality are identical, it has not been possible to determine whether increased infant mortality in subsequent siblings of prior SIDS victims relates to biological and/or to epidemiological risk factors. Regardless of cause, however, the important question is thus not whether infant mortality increases in subsequent siblings of prior SIDS victims, but what are the biological and/or epidemiological mechanisms?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Carl E. Hunt, <em>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Subsequent Siblings, </em>95 Pediatrics 430 (1995). <em>See also </em>Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, <em>Distinguishing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome From Child Abuse Fatalities, </em>107 Pediatrics 437 (2001) (noting that \u201c[d]espite extensive research, understanding of the etiology of SIDS remains incomplete\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In light of the widespread disagreement as to the causes of SIDS, we are unable to find general acceptance of the. notion that there is no genetic component to SIDS. Unanimity is not required for general acceptance, <em>see State v. Copeland, </em>130 Wash.2d 244, 922 P.2d 1304, 1319 (Wa.1996), but it is clear to us that a genuine controversy exists within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the relevant scientific community. In sum, there was inadequate proof of the statistical independence of SIDS deaths within a single family. Therefore, based on the current state of medical opinion, the product rule should not be employed in calculating the likelihood of multiple SIDS deaths within a single family. <em>See People v. Collins, </em>68 Cal.2d 319, 66 Cal. Rptr. 497, 438 P.2d 33, 39 n. 14 (1968) (noting that \u201cthe multiplication rule cannot be used without some degree of error where the traits are not independent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The State argues that error, if there be any, was cured by the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on the use of statistics. In this regard, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cDuring this trial, you have heard testimony regarding statistical probabilities. Certain experts in rendering their opinions relied in part on the statistical probabilities of a SIDS death occurring twice within the same family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">You may consider this testimony only in evaluating the weight to be given to those opinions. The weight of the evidence does not depend on the number of witnesses on either side.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The instruction did not, in any way, communicate to the jury that the experts\u2019 calculations may have been based on a theory that is not commonly accepted in the relevant scientific community. The instruction therefore failed to alleviate any of the dangers that arise when jurors are left to assess scientific evidence that is not generally accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">As a fall back position, the State argues harmless error. Two of the State\u2019s four expert witnesses testified that the chances of two SIDS deaths in one family were infinitesimal. Dr. Kokes testified that there was one chance in 100,-000,000 that two babies of a single family would die of SIDS, where one has brain edema. He characterized these odds as \u201cso low [as] to make it impossible.\u201d Dr. Kokes also testified that absent these statistics, his characterization of Garrett\u2019s death would have changed. Dr. Norton testified that the chance of SIDS occurring twice in the same family is one in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>4,000,000. She also testified that the statistics contributed to her conclusion that Garrett\u2019s death was a homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In <em>Reed, </em>we noted that \u201c[l]ay jurors tend to give considerable weight to \u2018scientific\u2019 evidence when presented by \u2018experts\u2019 with impressive credentials.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 386, 391 A.2d at 370 (quoting <em>People v. Kelly, </em>17 Cal.3d 24, 130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240, 1245 (1976)). The case sub judice was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. In light of the role the statistics, and particularly the product rule, played in the expert\u2019s testimony, we are unable \u201cto declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). The error was not harmless. Accordingly, we find that the trial committed reversible error in admitting the statistical calculations based on the product rule. Inasmuch as the other matters raised on appeal by petitioner may come up again at any new trial, for the guidance of the trial court, we shall comment upon petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Petitioner argues that the trial court took inadequate corrective action when the State\u2019s Attorney, in closing argument, calculated the statistical probability of petitioner\u2019s innocence. Prior to closing arguments, the court reviewed proposed jury instructions with counsel. The State\u2019s Attorney desired a particular instruction to guide the jury\u2019s consideration of the statistical evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\u201cSTATE\u2019S ATTORNEY: <em>I mean we shouldn\u2019t stand up </em>... <em>and say there is a one-in-200-million chance that this man is innocent. We shouldn\u2019t be able to say that. </em>What we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>should be able to say is \u2014 and this limits it.... \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Kokes thinks that the chances of SIDS happening the second time is one in 200 million. And you\u2014 that is the only purpose for which we can argue and for which they can consider. They can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be able to perhaps\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">COURT: And you are afraid they are going to misuse that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY: They might. And if this instruction is given \u2014 and the jurors are presumed to follow the Court\u2019s instructions \u2014 then there could be no prejudice inured from the use of statistics at all during the course of this trial, because the only purpose for the statistics to be introduced was to assist \u2014 was because the medical experts relied on those statistics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Despite his knowledge that he was prohibited from using the statistics to calculate the probability of petitioner\u2019s innocence, the State\u2019s Attorney argued, in closing, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">\u201cBut what he also told you in terms of the statistics we have talked about, the doctors, relying on the statistics of SIDS, he told you that in his numbers that it was 8 in 1,000 certain SIDS deaths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">The second time, the death could be attributed to SIDS. There is 3 in 1,000 live births that would be a SIDS. Well, let us use his numbers and be conservative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">Assuming it is 3 in 1,000 for the first. He also told you that less than 1 percent of SIDS deaths had the brain swelling, the edema.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\"><em>If you multiply his numbers, instead of 1 in k million, you get 1 in 10 million that the man sitting here is innocent. </em>That was what a doctor, their expert, told you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcS\">Petitioner moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the State improperly used the statistical evidence to calculate the probability that petitioner was innocent. The court denied the motion, and petitioner requested a curative instruction. Defense counsel stated: \u201cI would ask you to ... tell [the jury] that you can disregard it. You can never ever, ever, use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>statistics and compare that to the burden of proof or reasonable doubt. They have no place in this case, and that is what I am asking.\u201d The court declined to instruct the jury as requested by defense counsel and, instead, essentially reiterated the earlier instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s comment constituted error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The statistics stated by the experts in this case were admitted as evidence to satisfy the State\u2019s burden that Garrett\u2019s death was a homicide, <em>not </em>that petitioner was the person who committed the homicide. The State\u2019s Attorney, however, improperly used the statistics to argue that there was only a minuscule possibility that the defendant was innocent. The State\u2019s Attorney was well aware that the statistical evidence could not be used to calculate the probability of petitioner\u2019s innocence. The colloquy at the bench makes this crystal clear. His argument was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The courts that' have considered this issue have concluded that it is impermissible to assign a number to the probability of guilt or innocence. <em>See e.g., People v. Collins, </em>68 Cal.2d 319, 66 Cal.Rptr. 497, 438 P.2d 33, 40 (1968). In <em>Collins, </em>the Supreme Court of California stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201cConfronted with an equation which purports to yield a numerical index of probable guilt, few juries could resist the temptation to accord disproportionate weight to that index; only an exceptional juror, and indeed only a defense attorney schooled in mathematics, could successfully keep in mind the fact that the probability commuted by the prosecution can represent, <em>at best, </em>the likelihood that a random couple would share the characteristics testified to by the People\u2019s <em>witnesses </em>\u2014 not <em>necessarily the characteristics of the actually guilty couple. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Id.

Strong ed., 5th ed.1999); Annotation, <em>Admissibility, in Criminal Case, of Statistical or Mathematical Evidence Offered for Purpose of Showing Probabilities, </em>36 A.L.R.3d 1194 (1971). Other courts have addressed the impact of probability statistics upon the jury. In <em>State v. Harbold, </em>124 Ill.App.3d 363, 79 Ill.Dec. 830, 464 N.E.2d 734 (1984), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201c \u2018Testimony expressing opinions or conclusions in terms of statistical probabilities can make the uncertain seem all but proven, and suggest, by quantification, satisfaction of the requirement that guilt be established \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 We believe that testimony to statistical probabilities encouraged the jury to disregard evidential risks traditionally weighed in determining guilt or innocence, and focused unfairly upon a numerical conclusion. As such, we find that the testimony violated one of the primary requirements of expert opinion, that the opinion be an aid to the jury. In light of the closeness of this circumstantial case, we cannot say that this improper testimony, which gave a false impression of precision in the measurement of guilt, did not affect the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><em>Id., </em>79 Ill.Dec. 830, 464 N.E.2d at 749 (quoting <em>State v. Carlson, </em>267 N.W.2d 170, 176 (Minn.1978)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In general, counsel are permitted wide latitude in closing arguments. Counsel may comment on matters in evidence and any reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. Arguments that diminish the presumption of innocence, however, are not permitted. It is self-evident that an attorney may not argue inferences that are improper or are not warranted by the evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Moreover, the trial judge\u2019s supplemental instruction did not cure the prejudice caused by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s remark. The instructions directed the jurors to use the statistical evidence only to evaluate the expert\u2019s testimony, but, given the powerful nature of statistics, did nothing to cure the prosecutor\u2019s invitation to misuse the evidence to conclude that there was a 1 in 10,000,000 chance that petitioner was innocent. The trial court\u2019s instructions did not cure the prejudice the State\u2019s comment engendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We now address petitioner\u2019s argument that the trial court abused its discretion in prohibiting the defense pathologist from testifying as to retail practices in the life insurance industry. The trial judge sustained the State\u2019s objection that Dr. Jones, the defense pathologist, was not qualified to testify as to statistics concerning the number of people who purchase life insurance on their children.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Under Maryland Rule 5-702, the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201cshall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience or training or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Trial judges have \u201cwide latitude in deciding whether to qualify a witness as an expert or to admit or exclude particular expert testimony.\u201d <em>Massie v. State, </em>349 Md. 834, 850-51, 709 A.2d 1316, 1324 (1998). The record supports the trial judge\u2019s ruling that Dr. Jones was not qualified as an expert in the insurance industry and was not competent to express an opinion as to what percentage of the population buys life insurance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>infants. The trial judge did not abuse her discretion in excluding the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We turn next to petitioner\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the alleged murder of his infant daughter, Brandi, six years before the alleged murder in this case. The State sought a pre-trial ruling regarding the admissibility of evidence related to Brandi\u2019s death. The court considered certain exhibits introduced by the State, facts agreed to by both parties as uncontested and the arguments of counsel. In a memorandum opinion and order, the trial court ruled that the evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Before this Court, petitioner argues that the evidence of Brandi\u2019s death was inadmissible other crimes or bad act evidence under Md. Rule 5M04(b) because it lacked special relevance, there was not clear and convincing evidence of his involvement in Brandi\u2019s death, and the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by unfair prejudice. The State argues that the evidence was admissible on several bases \u2014 for identity, motive, absence of accident and intent. The State maintains that petitioner\u2019s involvement in Brandi\u2019s death was established by clear and convincing evidence, and that the probative nature of the evidence outweighed the prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We shall not address this issue because in light of our ruling as to the expert\u2019s reliance on the product rule, it is unclear what the substance of the testimony will be in any future proceeding. The expert testimony on the cause and manner of Brandi\u2019s death will bear on the determination of whether her death is viewed properly as a prior bad act and, consequently, whether the admissibility of evidence surrounding her death is subject to Maryland Rule 5-404(b). The expert testimony will also affect if, and how, the evidence of Brandi\u2019s death may be used to prove the <em>cotyus delicti.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>For all the reasons stated herein, the judgment of conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

But when SIDS occurrences among siblings of SIDS cases were compared with those among non-SIDS siblings in maternal age- and birth rank-matched control families, there was no statistically significant difference in SIDS rates or in total infant mortality rates in families with a history of SIDS compared with families with no SIDS. Thus, the notion that having a SIDS baby makes having another more likely was dispelled. With the exclusion from the S.IDS statistics of some of the deaths' now thought to be due to inborn errors of metabolism, the chances for subsequent SIDS in families seems even less likely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">As demonstrated above, few authors in this area exhibit such confidence that there is no genetic component to SIDS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">.
