Archer, </em>No. 84, September Term, 2001, and <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>No. 83, September Term, 2001, share a common issue: whether local government emergency telephone system employees (specifically operators, dispatchers, and managers) owe an individual tort duty to persons in need of their services, and, if so, under what circumstances the employees may be held liable for the negligent performance of that duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These cases also present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>other issues which we shall address, but at the core of both is this shared issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Following our examination of the separate factual and pro-, cedural backgrounds in both cases, we shall rephrase and consolidate the questions presented for our review. We will consider separately, however, the issues unique to each case. Our general review of the law applicable to 911 employees will then be applied specifically to both cases at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\n<em>A. Fried,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">On 11 November 1995, Tiffany Fouts, the daughter of Petitioner, Ms. Sarah Fried, arranged to spend the night at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the home of her friend, Melanie Meadowcroft. That evening, Tiffany and Melanie visited the home of one of Melanie\u2019s acquaintances, Eric F., located at 1443 Charleston Drive, K Court, in Edgewood, Maryland. Three other boys also were present that evening at Eric\u2019s home, Donte W., Ricky W., and Louis D., along with Eric\u2019s mother, Ms. Tresa F.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Shortly after Tiffany and Melanie arrived, \u201calcoholic beverages were made available and consumed by all of\u2019 the minors at the home. Within one hour, Tiffany began to vomit and \u201cbecame semiconscious.\u201d At that time, \u201ccertain guests engaged in non consensual sexual acts with Tiffany,\u201d dropped \u201cheavy objects\u201d on her head, and \u201curinated upon her.\u201d In an effort to conceal Tiffany\u2019s condition, Eric F. and Donte W. dragged her outside of the home through the basement. They \u201cleft Tiffany, wearing only a tee shirt, skirt, socks, and shoes, in an area of woods located directly behind the townhome.\u201d <em>Fried v. Archer, </em>139 Md.App. 229, 238, 775 A.2d 430, 435, <em>cert. granted, </em>366 Md. 246, 783 A.2d 221 (2001). The weather at that time \u201cwas cold and wet\u201d with a \u201cforecast[ed] winter storm, including snow, approaching the area.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Subsequently, Donte W., in the presence of Eric F. and Ricky W., called the Harford County Sheriffs Office (\u201cthe HCSO\u201d) ostensibly to inform them of the location of Tiffany.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Kim Archer, Respondent, a police communications officer, received the call. The conversation unfolded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>[Archer:] Harford County Sheriffs <em>Office, </em>PCO Archer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">[DonteW.:] Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">[Archer:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">[Donte W.:] Um, there\u2019s a girl in the back of the woods like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">[Archer:] Back of what woods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">[Donte W.:] Um, Harford Square.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">[Archer:] Okay.

Harford Square.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\">[DonteW.:] Yes, K Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-13\">[Archer:] Okay. And what\u2019s she doing, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-14\">[Donte W.:] Just laying there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-15\">[Archer:] Okay. She\u2019s just laying to the rear of the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoI\">[Donte W.:] Yes, she was. She was over a \u2014 . She was over here drinking and she was laying there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-16\">[Archer:] Okay. Is she a white female? Black female?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aek\">[DonteW.:] Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-17\">[Archer:] Which one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-18\">[Donte W.:] White female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-19\">[Archer:] Okay. White female. Okay. And your last name, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-20\">[Donte W.:] I\u2019d just say anonymous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-21\">[Archer:] Okay. We\u2019ll send someone out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>[Donte W.:] Thanks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Following the call, Archer dispatched Deputy Sheriff Kevin Thomas (\u201cDeputy Thomas\u201d) to investigate. In a transmission to Deputy Thomas, which occurred at approximately 10 p.m., Archer erroneously reported that Tiffany was lying to the rear of a residence on J Court, not K Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The content of the transmission was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">10-25 to the rear of 1436 Harford Square Drive \u2014 1-4-3-6 \u2014 Harford Square. It will be J \u2014 John\u2014Court. Cross street is Charleston. Anonymous male\u2019s requesting a check on well being of a number 2 female. She is lying to the rear of this residence. He believes she\u2019s 10-56. Unable to give us any further in reference to description.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Upon Deputy Thomas\u2019s arrival at 1436 J Court, \u201c \u2018it was raining pretty hard\u2019 and was \u2018[v]ery cold.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 242, 775 A.2d at 437 (alteration in original). Deputy Thomas exited his car and walked around the rear of the J Court townhomes, but was unable to locate Tiffany. He returned to his car and called Archer to request a recontact. He asked, \u201cMould the complainant come out to the back and point out where this young lady might be?\u201d Archer replied that there was no reconnect information, stating, \u201c[i]t\u2019s an anonymous male. He didn\u2019t want to give his information.\u201d Deputy Thomas then \u201c \u2018walked th[e] whole line of houses on that side of the court and then back around to the front.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>He \u201cencountered a Maryland State trooper who had also responded to the call, but had searched behind J1 Court, another separate court next to J Court.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>few minutes later, after finding no one, Deputy Thomas radioed Archer and stated, \u201c10-8,10-12.\u201d According to Deputy Thomas\u2019s testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>ny, \u201cCode 12\u201d indicated his determination that the call was an \u201cunfounded complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Although the precise time frame is unclear, Eric F. testified that after making their report to Archer, the boys went \u201cout back\u201d once and checked on Tiffany. Some time later, Eric F. testified that he and Ricky W. attempted To go outside again, but were prevented by his mother, who \u201ccame downstairs [and] told [him that he] had to stay in the house.\u201d Neither Eric F. or Ricky W. attempted to go outside again that evening. Unfortunately, in the early hours of 12 November 1995, Tiffany died from hypothermia in the location where Eric F. and Donte W. had left her.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Petitioner Fried, Tiffany\u2019s mother, filed a wrongful death and survival action in the Circuit Court for Harford County against Respondent Archer, Mr. James Terrell (the chief of Harford County\u2019s Emergency Management and Operations Division), Harford County, Maryland, John/Jane Doe (\u201cunidentified dispatch or emergency service employees of Harford County\u2019s Emergency Management and Operations Division\u201d), the HCSO, Deputy Thomas, Ms. Tresa F., and the State of Maryland. Fried alleged that Archer \u201cbreached her duty of care by failing to make basis inquiries of Donte W.\u201d and was negligent \u201cin reporting that Tiffany ... was behind \u2018J\u2019 Court when in fact she was reported to be and was in fact behind \u2018K\u2019 Court.\u201d Fried also maintained that Archer was \u201cfurther negligent in failing to report that Tiffany . . . was behind townhomes [sic] near a forested area.\u201d Regarding Terrell, Fried asserted that he negligently \u201cemployed improper procedures and/or failed to properly train [Archer]\u201d which was \u201ca proximate cause of the death of Tiffany.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">On 28 December 1998, the \u201ccounty defendants,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> including Archer and Terrell, filed a motion to dismiss the claims against them. According to their motion, Archer enjoyed public official immunity, and Archer and Terrell owed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u201cduty to protect [Tiffany] from the criminal acts of the teenage boys in whose company she voluntarily placed herself ....\u201d In addition, the HCSO, Deputy Thomas, and the State of Maryland also filed motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The Circuit Court, on 16 November 1999, filed its memorandum opinion dismissing Archer, Terrell, the State of Maryland, and John/Jane Doe.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court relied on Fried\u2019s complaint and her opposition to Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss to conclude that Archer did not \u201cenjoy public official status.\u201d It held, however, that the \u201clack of a legal duty between Archer and the victim [ (Tiffany) ] preclude[d] a favorable judgment for the Plaintiff.\u201d According to the Circuit Court, \u201cno special relationship existed between Archer .and [Tiffany] and without the existence of a special relationship, Archer had no legal duty to [Tiffany].\u201d Likewise, even though the trial court found that Terrell enjoyed public official immunity, it also found that he owed \u201cno general duty to [Tiffany]\u201d and that \u201cno special relationship ever existed between [Tiffany] and Terrell to bring about a legal duty in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">On 22 June 2000, Fried filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the judgment dismissing Archer and Terrell. Fried argued that \u201c \u2018Archer and Terrell did owe a legal duty of care to [Tiffany] based on the fact that [Tiffany] was an individual and a member of the class of persons who are the subjects of 911 or emergency calls, ... and injury to her from failing to give correct location information was readily foreseeable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 243, 775 A.2d at 438 (some alterations in original). Additionally, she maintained that the lower court \u201cerroneously applie[d] the concept of a \u2018special relationship\u2019 \u201d to Archer because she is \u201ca mere government employee,\u201d rather than a public official. As to Terrell, Fried argued that the \u201clower court erred in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>ing that [he] ... was a public official\u201d and \u201cerroneously determined that no duty of care existed\u201d between Terrell and Tiffany. According to Fried, \u201cby virtue of the foreseeability of harm resulting from a potential failure to establish proper policies, procedures and safeguards with respect to the training of emergency dispatch operators, a legal duty of care\u201d existed between Terrell and Tiffany.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals held that the \u201clegal duty owed by police dispatchers to the class of persons who are the subject of 911 or emergency calls, by virtue of their position, is a <em>public duty </em>to aid.\u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 257, 775 A.2d at 446. The Court found it appropriate, therefore, to \u201cmeasure the negligence liability of police dispatchers by the same standard applied to the police officers who respond to their dispatches,\u201d and applied the case-by-case application of the special duty rule set forth in <em>Ashburn v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 510 A.2d 1078 (1986), in its determination of the liability of Archer and Terrell. <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 257, 775 A.2d at 446. The special duty rule provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">[i]n order for a special relationship between police officer and victim to be found, it must be shown that the local government affirmatively acted to protect the specific victim or a specific group of individuals like the victim, thereby inducing the victim\u2019s specific reliance upon the police protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"><em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 250-51, 775 A.2d at 442 (quoting <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085). As the Court of Special Appeals explained, without such a relationship, \u201c \u2018liability for failure to protect another citizen does not lie against police officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 250, 775 A.2d at 442 (quoting <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d at 1083).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In its application of the <em>Ashburn </em>test, the Court of Special Appeals interpreted \u201cspecific reliance,\u201d as mentioned in <em>Ash-bum, </em>to mean \u201cdetrimental and justifiable reliance\u201d and subsequently found that Fried failed to allege the reliance \u201cnecessary to establish a special duty.\u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 265, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>775 A.2d at 451. According to the intermediate appellate court, the trial court did not err in dismissing Fried\u2019s claims against Archer because Tiffany did not rely to her detriment on Archer\u2019s promise to send an officer and the boys did not rely justifiably on Archer\u2019s promise. <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 266-67, 273-75, 775 A.2d at 452, 456. Likewise, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Fried\u2019s claims against Terrell because there were \u201cno allegations indicating Tiffany or her assailants specifically relied on Terrell\u2019s allegedly insufficient training and procedures.\u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 276-77, 775 A.2d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">On 12 October 2001, we granted Fried\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to determine the proper analysis to be utilized in evaluating the scope of the duties and tort liabilities of Archer and Terrell.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\n<em>B. Muthukumarana</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">On 23 August 1998, Ms. Sriyani Muthukumarana, Appellant, and her children, Emil and Budrani, celebrated, along with other family members, Emil\u2019s birthday at Wheaton Regional Park in Montgomery County. After returning home from the celebration, Appellant\u2019s husband, Mr. Basaru Muthukumarana, who did not attend the birthday party, became agitated with her, reportedly because she had used a tray that belonged to him. While Emil, Budrani, and their cousin, Tharanie, were outside playing, Appellant Muthukumarana and her husband argued inside their home. At some point during the argument, her husband \u201cbashed [Appellant\u2019s] head against the wall\u201d which caused her to scream. Upon hearing her scream, all three of the children entered the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">After the children entered the home, Mr. Muthukumarana ran upstairs. Appellant Muthukumarana dialed 911 from the kitchen,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> where all three of the children had gathered, and spoke to police services aide Kelley Woodward, Appellee, located at the Montgomery County Emergency Communication Center. Upon receipt of the call, Woodward classified the call as \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d entered information about the call into her computer, and sent the call onto dispatch. Woodward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>then remained on the line with Appellant, attempting to obtain information from her, and continuously entered that information into her computer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A transcript of that conversation and background sounds follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">[Appellant:] (Screaming)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">[Woodward:] Montgomery County 911, Hello, Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtH\">[Appellant:] (Screaming) Hello?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">[Woodward:] What is the nature of the emergency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApJ\">[Appellant:] I need help please.

In her complaint, Appellant Muthukumarana alleged that Woodward \u201cnegligently and carelessly failed to discharge her responsibilities\u201d to Appellant Muthukumarana in \u201ca reasonable and careful manner by, among other things, failing to timely advise [her] to leave the premises and call back from a safe location such as a neighbor\u2019s house or a pay phone.\u201d She also maintained that Montgomery County, \u201cthrough its employees at the E[mergency] C[ommunication] C[enter], ha[d] a duty to discharge its responsibilities to 911 callers in a reasonable and careful manner.\u201d According to her, Montgomery County \u201cnegligently and carelessly failed to discharge\u201d those responsibilities \u201cby, among other things, failing to timely advise [her] to leave the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">On 30 November 2000, Woodward, along with Montgomery County, filed a motion for summary judgment in the Circuit Court arguing that Muthukumarana had \u201cfailed to state a claim for negligence\u201d and that Montgomery County was \u201centitled to governmental immunity from\u201d her claims. A hearing on the motion was held on 8 February 2001. At that hearing, Appellant Muthukumarana \u201cconceded that [Montgomery C]ounty ha[d] governmental immunity,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but maintained that it was unnecessary to determine whether a \u201cspecial relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ship\u201d existed between Woodward and Appellant because the \u201cGood Samaritan doctrine [wa]s triggered immediately by Woodward\u2019s undertaking to assist\u201d her.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the alternative, Muthukumarana asserted that a special relationship existed between Woodward and herself because \u201cMontgomery County acted affirmatively by acting to assist and protect persons in imminent danger by implementing the 911 system,\u201d and \u201caffirmatively encouraged [her] to call ... by providing her ... with an instruction sheet for <em>ex parte </em>orders ... in the context of a previous domestic violence incident.\u201d In addition, Appellant maintained that Woodward \u201caffirmatively acted by asking the specific questions that she chose to ask throughout the phone call ...\u201d and that she \u201crelied on that assistance\u201d and on \u201cthose affirmative questions,\u201d \u201creasonably believ[ing] she had to respond to those questions to get help.\u201d Finally, Muthukumarana argued that Woodward was \u201ca mere government employee,\u201d not \u201ca public official,\u201d and, therefore, was \u201cnot entitled to any public official immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Woodward, on the other hand, argued that the Good Samaritan doctrine should not apply. In addition, she maintained that the trial court should \u201clook at what [she] did, not what Montgomery County did in enacting the 911 system.\u201d According to her argument, she was entitled to summary judgment because \u201cthere [wa]s no special relationship, and [she wa]s not liable to [Appellant Muthukumarana].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>On 9 February 2001, the Circuit Court granted Woodward\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In its order and opinion, the Circuit Court held that Woodward was \u201ca public official and therefore entitled to qualified immunity from tort liability.\u201d The Circuit Court also concluded that Woodward had not \u201ccreated a \u2018special relationship\u2019 with\u201d Appellant Muthukumarana because there was \u201cabsolutely no affirmative action by Woodward upon which [she] relied that would create a liability \u2014 inducing special relationship.\u201d While the court agreed \u201cthat the circumstances leading to this cause of action [we]re incredibly tragic and soul wrenching, it c[ould] not find that Woodward, in the performance of her duties as a 911 operator, incurred any <em>legal </em>liability for th[e] tragedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u25a0 Appellant Muthukumarana then filed an appeal in the Court of Special Appeals. On 12 October 2001, we issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion while the case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals in order to consider the scope of the duties and the possible tort liability of Woodward.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On 14 January 2002, we granted the motion of numerous governmental entities and associations to file an amicus brief on behalf of Appellee.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">In an effort to enhance the fluidity, organization, and readability of this opinion, we shall consolidate and rephrase the overlapping questions presented in <em>Fried </em>and <em>Muthukumarana </em>and separately address the unique issues in each case. The following questions will form the basis of our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">1. Whether the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Fried </em>was permitted to determine, as a matter of law, if the boys \u201crelied\u201d on Respondent Archer\u2019s promise of assistance for purposes of satisfying the special relationship test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\"><em>2. </em>Whether the Circuit Court in <em>Muthukumarana </em>denied Appellant Muthukumarana her procedural due process right under Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 311(f) by ruling that Appellee Woodward was a public official and thus entitled to qualified immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">3. Whether 911 operators and dispatchers, as a threshold matter, may assert common law public official immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">4. Whether the Good Samaritan doctrine applies to actions taken by 911 operators and dispatchers in handling emergency calls in the course of their employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">5. Whether the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Fried </em>and the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in <em>Muthukumarana </em>erred in applying the special relationship test to 911 employees, specifically to operators, dispatchers, and managers, and in subsequently determining that the employees in question had no special relationship with or special duty owed to the individual victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">II. Standard(s) of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">To delineate the standard(s) of our review, we must first address whether the determination that a special relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>exists between two individuals, thereby creating a duty in tort, is a question of fact or law in these cases. Assuming the application of the special relationship test to 911 employees is appropriate, <em>see infra </em>Part IV. C. (discussing the applicability of the special relationship test), both Petitioner Fried and Appellant Muthukumarana argue that the lower courts erred in determining whether a special relationship existed between the 911 employees and the victims. Specifically, they maintain that such determinations were questions of fact and should have been left to the trier of fact, rather than decided as a matter of law. Under the circumstances of these cases, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In <em>Liberto v. Holfeldt, </em>221 Md. 62, 67, 155 A.2d 698, 701 (1959), we recognized that \u201cwhen the facts are not disputed and it is certain that reasonable minds could draw but one inference from such facts,\u201d the issues of duty and causation \u201cmay be resolved as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See also Dersookian v. Helmick, </em>256 Md. 627, 631, 261 A.2d 472, 473 (1970) (quoting Liberto). We recently reaffirmed this notion in <em>Valentine v. On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 727 A.2d 947 (1999), and explained that, \u201c[generally, whether there is adequate proof of the required elements needed to succeed in a negligence action is a question of fact to be determined by the fact finder; but, the existence of a legal duty is [a] question of law to be decided by the court.\u201d <em>Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 549, 727 A.2d at 949. <em>See also Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 716, 697 A.2d 1371, 1376 (1997) (\u201cThe existence of a duty is a matter of law to be determined by the court and, therefore, is an appropriate issue to be disposed of on motion for dismissal.\u201d). This reasoning is applicable to the cases at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In both cases before us, there are no disputes as to the material facts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The conversation between Archer and Donte W., as well as the conversation between Woodward and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Appellant Muthukumarana, were each recorded and transcribed prior to the circuit courts\u2019 considerations of the motions. Petitioner Fried and Appellant Muthukumarana do not allege that the transcriptions are other than accurate and complete, nor do they dispute the sequence of events in their cases as reflected in the police and court papers in the records. Consistent with our prior holdings, therefore, the determinations of whether a special relationship existed between the 911 employees and the victims in <em>Fried </em>and <em>Muthukumarana </em>were considered below appropriately as questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Regarding our review of <em>Muthukumarana, </em>we have explained that in reviewing a grant of a motion for summary judgment,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">we are \u201cmost often concerned with whether a dispute of material fact exists.\u201d <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 227, 783 A.2d 206, 209 (2001). Where there is no dispute of material fact, however, this Court has stated that the \u201c \u2018standard of review for a grant of summary judgment is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Id.] </em>(quoting <em>Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp. of Balt., Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 204, 680 A.2d 1067, 1076 (1996)). <em>See also [County Comm\u2019rs of Caroline County v.] J. Roland Dashiell &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>358 Md. [83], 94, 747 A.2d [600], 606 [ (2000) ] (\u201c \u2018In reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment, it is our responsibility to determine whether there was any issue of fact pertinent to the ruling and, if not, whether the substantive law was correctly applied.... Thus, to be upheld, the summary judgment under review must withstand scrutiny on both its factual and legal foundations.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Bloomgarden v. Coyer, </em>479 F.2d 201, 206-07 (D.C.Cir.1973)) (alteration in original). We review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions in rendering summary judgment <em>de novo. Matthews v. Howell, </em>359 Md. [152,] 162, 753 A.2d [69,] 74 [ (2000) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\"><em>Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t v. Underwood, </em>368 Md. 160, 171, 792 A.2d 1130, 1136-37 (2002) (some citations omitted). In <em>Muthukumarana, </em>there are no genuine disputes as <em>to </em>the materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>al facts, <em>see supra </em>page 472; therefore, our review is limited to whether the Circuit Court was legally correct in granting Appellee Woodward\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In <em>Fried, </em>Petitioner Fried contests the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss. When \u201creviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, trial and appellate courts must assume the truth of all well-pleaded, relevant, and material facts in the complaint and any reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Allied Inv. Corp. &amp; Allied Venture P\u2019ship v. Jasen, </em>354 Md. 547, 555, 731 A.2d 957, 961 (1999) (citing <em>Bobo, </em>346 Md. at 708, 697 A.2d at 1372). Under Md. Rule 2-322(c), however, if, on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, \u201cmatters outside the [complaint] are presented to and not excluded by the [trial] court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment .... \u201d <em>See also Hrehorovich v. Harbor Hosp. Ctr., Inc., </em>93 Md.App. 772, 782, 614 A.2d 1021, 1026 (1992) (quoting Md. Rule 2-322(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In the context of Md. Rule 2-322(c), our review of the record in <em>Fried </em>reveals that \u201cmatters outside the [complaint]\u201d were presented to the Circuit Court which the trial court judge did not exclude. Specifically, Petitioner Fried, subsequent to the hearing on the motion to dismiss, but prior to the issuance and filing of the Circuit Court\u2019s opinion and order, filed a supplemental memorandum in support of her position and included, as exhibits, sections of Deputy Thomas\u2019s testimony in one of the juvenile proceedings (including portions of his transmissions with Archer) and a transcript of the telephone conversation between Donte W. and Archer. The trial judge did not explicitly exclude any of these additional materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Pursuant to Md. Rule 2-322(c), the trial judge\u2019s failure to exclude the additional facts operated to transmute the motion to dismiss into consideration of a motion for summary judgment. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIf the court does not exclude the outside matters, ... the rule mandates that \u2018the motion <em>shall </em>be treated as one for summary judgment ....\u2019\u201d) (citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ted) (alteration in original). To construe the trial court\u2019s action thusly works no surprise or unfairness upon Fried as she, presumably intending that the court consider the information, introduced factual matters beyond the allegations of, and reasonable inferences drawable from, her complaint. Therefore, in <em>Fried </em>we will apply the standard of review applicable in reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, set forth at <em>supra </em>pages 472-74. As in <em>Muthukumarana, </em>there are no genuine disputes as to the material facts in <em>Fried, </em>so our review is limited to whether the Circuit Court was legally correct in granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">III. Procedural Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Au_\"><em>A. Issue 1 </em>\u2014 Fried</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Fried argues that the Court of Special Appeals wrongfully determined whether Donte W., Eric F., and Ricky W. \u201crelied\u201d on Archer\u2019s conduct, as applicable in the special relationship test, because \u201ca jury should have determined th[at] issue[ ] of fact.\u201d In addition, Fried contends that \u201cinstead of ... looking to the complaint ... to determine whether a cause of action had been properly alleged,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals erroneously \u201ctook it upon itself to make rulings on matters of fact\u201d and exceeded its \u201cauthority under a motion to dismiss.\u201d For the following reasons, both of these arguments shall fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">As we noted at <em>supra </em>pages 471-73, where there is no genuine dispute as to the material facts, it is proper for a court to decide, as a matter of law, whether a special relationship exists. It requires a court to infer as a matter of law, from the uncontroverted material facts, whether the alleged reliance is one that the law is prepared to recognize as sufficient to trigger application of the special relationship test. That <em>determination is not </em>based, as Petitioner Fried alleges, on judicial fact-finding in this case. Therefore, if we assume the application of the special relationship test was appropriate, <em>see infra </em>Part IV.C., because there was no dispute as to the material facts in <em>Fried, </em>it was proper for the trial and intermediate appellate courts to determine, as a matter of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>whether a special relationship existed between Respondent Archer and Tiffany. <em>See Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 549, 727 A.2d at 949 (\u201c[T]he existence of a legal duty is question of law to be decided by the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Likewise, we do not accept Petitioner Fried\u2019s contention that the Court of Special Appeals improperly exceeded its judicial authority by relying on factual sources beyond the original complaint in explaining its judgment. Pursuant to our discussion at <em>supra </em>pages 474-75, the trial court, in opting not to exclude \u201cthe matters outside the [complaint]\u201d presented by Petitioner Fried and Archer, treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. Md. Rule 2-322(c). Therefore, on appeal, the Court of Special Appeals was not required to limit itself to the original pleading in its consideration of the case. <em>See Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 79, 660 A.2d 447, 452 (1995) (\u201cIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, this Court must consider the facts reflected in the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and affidavits in the light most favorable to the non-moving plaintiffs ----\u201d) (quoting <em>Clea v. Mayor of Balt., </em>312 Md. 662, 677, 541 A.2d 1303, 1310 (1988)). <em>See also Grimes v. Kennedy Krieger Inst., Inc., </em>366 Md. 29, 73, 782 A.2d 807, 834 (2001) (quoting Ashton).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\"><em>B. Issue 2 </em>\u2014 Muthukumarana</p>\n<p id=\"AkG\">Appellant Muthukumarana maintains the Circuit Court frustrated her \u201cprocedural due process right to be heard on the issue of Woodward\u2019s public official status\u201d under Md. Rule 2 \u2014 311(f).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Specifically, Muthukumarana contends the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Court erred in ruling that Woodward was entitled to public official immunity because Woodward \u201cdid not argue\u201d she was entitled to such immunity in her \u201csummary judgment motion or memorandum in support\u201d or \u201cat the summary judgment hearing.\u201d Woodward, on the other hand, maintains that Muthukumarana \u201cmistakenly relies on M[d.] Rule 2-311(f) as support for her procedural due process argument\u201d and asserts that she \u201chas pointed to no authority that prohibits a court from disposing of claims on summary judgment on grounds other than those that the moving party proposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">It is not necessary for us to tarry long on this argument. While maintaining that she was \u201cdenied her ... right to be heard\u201d on the issue of Woodward\u2019s public official status, Muthukumarana concurrently acknowledges that she raised in her opposition to the motion for summary judgment that Woodward was not entitled to public official immunity, even though Woodward had not asserted it. As Muthukumarana explained, \u201c[i]n both her brief and at oral argument, [she] plainly asserted that Woodward was not a public official.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We fail to see how these circumstances amount to a denial of a \u201cprocedural due process right to be heard.\u201d Despite Woodward\u2019s failure to mention the doctrine of public official immunity in her motion for summary judgment, Muthukumarana obviously anticipated and argued the issue. Appellant Muthukumarana injected the issue of public official immunity before the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">We now shall generally address the overlapping questions presented in <em>Fried </em>and <em>Muthukumarana </em>regarding whether 911 employees, specifically operators, dispatchers, and managers, owe a special duty in tort to persons in need of their services, and whether those employees may be held liable for the negligent performance of their duties. Our review of the remaining three issues will address as a whole, rather than individually, the arguments and issues relevant to both cases, as set forth below. Individual application of our conclusions to each case at hand will follow that review.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\n<em>A. Public Official Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Petitioner Fried and Appellant Muthukumarana maintain that 911 operators and dispatchers are not entitled to public official immunity. According to Muthukumarana, the Circuit Court erred, in concluding that Woodward was entitled to public official immunity because Woodward does not \u201csatisfy the prerequisite of being a public official\u201d and was \u201cnot performing a \u2018discretionary act\u2019 as required ... to claim public official immunity.\u201d In like manner, Fried asserts that Archer was \u201cnot a governmental official, but merely an employee, and was not performing a discretionary but, rather, merely a ministerial act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Woodward contends that because the Circuit Court \u201cfound that [she] did not have a special relationship with [Appellant] Muthukumarana,\u201d the determination as to whether the Circuit Court \u201cerred in holding that [she] was a public official entitled to qualified immunity [wa]s not dispositive to [her] appeal.\u201d Archer cotmters Fried\u2019s argument and maintains that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>police dispatcher qualifies as a public official\u201d and that \u201c[a]s [she] was exercising discretion within the scope of her employment, she enjoyed public official immunity as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">For the following reasons, we agree with Petitioner Fried and Appellant Muthukumarana and conclude that 911 operators and dispatchers, on these facts, are not entitled to public official immunity. At common law, a government actor will enjoy a qualified immunity from liability for his or her \u201cnon-malicious acts where: (1) he \u2018is a public official rather than a mere government employee or agent; and (2) his tortious conduct occurred while he was performing discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, acts in furtherance of his official duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 622, 510 A.2d at 1081 (quoting <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 323, 418 A.2d 1173, 1178 (1980)) (emphasis omitted). <em>See also Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 704, 785 A.2d 726, 734 (2001) (quoting <em>James). </em>\u201c \u2018Once it is established that the individual is a public official <em>and </em>the tort was committed while performing a duty which involves the exercise of discretion, a qualified immunity attaches; namely, in the absence of malice, the individual involved is free from liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lovelace, </em>366 Md. at 705, 785 A.2d at 734 (quoting James).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In <em>James, </em>we enumerated guidelines to be used in determining whether an individual is a public official, including whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">(i) The position was created by law and involves continuing and not occasional duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">(ii) The holder performs an important public duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">(iii) The position calls for the exercise of some portion of the sovereign power of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">(iv) The position has a definite term for which a commission is issued and a bond and an oath are required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-10\"><em>James, </em>288 Md. at 324, 418 A.2d at 1178 (citing <em>Duncan v. Koustenis, </em>260 Md. 98, 105, 271 A.2d 547, 550 (1970)). Additionally, there are at least two exceptions to the guidelines, \u201cwhere an individual fails to meet most of the above tests, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>yet is nevertheless considered to be a public official,\u201d which include \u201cthose individuals who exercise \u2018a large portion of the sovereign power of government,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthose individuals who can be called on to exercise police powers as conservators of the peace.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 106, 271 A.2d at 551 (citation omitted) (emphasis omitted). <em>See also James, </em>288 Md. at 324-25, 418 A.2d at 1178-79 (quoting Duncan).</p>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">Pursuant to our standards for determining whether an individual is a public official entitled to immunity, it is apparent that 911 operators and dispatchers do not qualify for that protection. Although we agree that 911 operators and dispatchers perform an important public duty, they fail to satisfy most of the requirements for classification as a \u201cpublic official.\u201d Specifically, their positions are not \u201ccreated by law,\u201d do not \u201ccall for the exercise of ... the sovereign power of the State,\u201d do not \u201chave a definite term for which a commission is issued,\u201d and do not \u201crequire\u201d a \u201cbond and an oath.\u201d <em>James, </em>288 Md. at 324, 418 A.2d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In addition, 911 operators and dispatchers do not fall within either of the two exceptions to the guidelines, where an individual is \u201cnevertheless considered to be a public official.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 106, 271 A.2d at 551. The first exception, which requires that an individual \u201cexercise \u2018a large portion of the sovereign power of government,\u2019 \u201d contemplates someone serving \u201cin a legislative or policymaking capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In <em>Duncan, </em>we held that a public school teacher did not meet the terms of that exception because he \u201cd[id] not make rules and regulations or determine county educational policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the same rationale, 911 operators and dispatchers cannot invoke that exception because, by the nature of their duties, they execute, rather than determine and adopt, governmental policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The second exception, applicable to those who \u201ccan be called on to exercise police powers as conservators of the peace,\u201d also does not extend to 911 operators and dispatchers. <em>Id. </em>Again in <em>Duncan, </em>we compared a public school teacher, who did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>meet the second exception, to a sheriff, who did meet the exception, and noted a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\">subtle distinction between authority in the nature of police power and the authority used by a teacher. The former is exercised in opposition to those subject to it for the public good whereas the latter is exercised as a service to benefit those immediately subject to it while also directed to the ultimate public welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 107, 271 A.2d at 551. Any \u201cauthority a teacher might be considered to exercise in his own right,\u201d we explained, \u201cwould not be in the nature of police power.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 106, 271 A.2d at 551. Similarly, the acts of a 911 operator or dispatcher providing a service to benefit an individual caller and the public welfare also do not satisfy the exception. The handling of an emergency call is not an exercise of power \u201cin opposition to those subject to it for the public good.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 107, 271 A.2d at 551. Rather, it is an exercise of power for the benefit of those in need of 911 services.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Because we find 911 operators and dispatchers are not \u201cpublic officials,\u201d as contemplated in <em>Duncan </em>and <em>James, </em>it is not necessary for us to examine the particular acts in question to determine whether they were discretionary and performed within the scope of official duties. The initial failure of 911 operators and dispatchers to qualify as public officials prevents them from enjoying a public official immunity at common law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\n<em>B. Good Samaritan Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ASM\">Petitioner Fried and Appellant Muthukumarana contend that the Good Samaritan doctrine, which subjects an individual to liability for his or her failure to exercise reasonable care in rendering protective services to another, is applicable to the actions of 911 operators and dispatchers taken in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>performing their employment duties. According to Fried, Respondent Archer \u201cwas paid to perform her functions as an emergency dispatch operator,\u201d \u201cfailed to exercise reasonable care in performing\u201d her duties, and, as a result of her failure to exercise reasonable care, should be liable for the \u201cincreased the risk of harm\u201d she caused to Tiffany \u201cby beginning to assist her, but failing to follow through.... \u201d Similarly, Muthukumarana alleges that Appellee Woodward \u201cundertook, for consideration ..., to render services to\u201d Appellant and should be \u201csubject to liability for her failure to exercise reasonable care where\u201d her \u201cfailure to follow the Standard] Operating] P[rocedure]\u201d increased the risk of harm to Appellant, and where she \u201csuffered harm by relying on 911 and Woodward\u2019s questioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In response, Archer argues that a different tort principle, specifically the special relationship test, is controlling in her case. Woodward also argues that \u201cthe Good Samaritan doctrine is not the appropriate standard to apply to determine the liability of 911 operators\u201d and cites the \u201cchilling effect\u201d it would have \u201con a government\u2019s ability to hire and retain 911 operators.\u201d Additionally, Woodward maintains that she \u201cdid not undertake to assist Appellant [Muthukumarana],\u201d as required by the Good Samaritan doctrine, by taking \u201cbasic information from\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The Good Samaritan doctrine, as argued by Fried and Muthukumarana from the Restatement (Second) of Torts, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u00a7 323 Negligent Performance of Undertaking to Render Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of the other\u2019s person or things, is subject to liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">(a) his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of such harm, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>(b) the harm is suffered because of the other\u2019s reliance upon the undertaking.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Restatement (Second) Of Torts \u00a7 323 (1965). Even assuming, for purposes of this analysis, that Maryland recognizes a common law Good Samaritan doctrine as framed in the Restatement, it would not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 323, an individual who undertakes, \u201cgratuitously or for consideration,\u201d to render protective services to another may be subject to liability for his or her failure to exercise reasonable care in doing so. Petitioner Fried and Appellant Muthukumarana would have us interpret the clause \u201cfor consideration\u201d as including the salary paid to 911 operators and dispatchers by their employers, thereby imposing liability on those 911 employees for actions taken in the course of performing their employment duties. Drawing on our prior interpretation of the meaning of an analogous term in the context of Maryland\u2019s Good Samaritan immunity statutes,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Under Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5-603, certain emergency medical care providers are \u201cnot civilly liable for any act or omission in giving any assistance or medical care, if,\u201d in part, \u201c[t]he assistance or medical care is provided <em>without fee or compensation </em>.... \u201d (Emphasis added.). In <em>Tatum v. Gigliotti, </em>321 Md. 623, 583 A.2d 1062 (1991), we interpreted the language of an earlier version of the Good Samaritan Act, specifically Md.Code (1981), Art. 43, \u00a7 132(a) (recodified as Md.Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-603), which provided immunity to certain individuals rendering \u201cmedical aid, care, or assistance for which he charges no fee or compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In so doing, we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, <em>Tatum v. Gigliotti, </em>80 Md.App. 559, 565 A.2d 354 (1989), <em>aff'd, </em>321 Md. 623, 583 A.2d 1062 (1991), and held that a <em>salaried </em>emergency medical technician operating within the scope of his duties was entitled to the immunity provided in the statute. As the Court of Special Appeals explained, \u201csalaried personnel do not receive \u2018compensation\u2019 within the meaning of this section.\u201d <em>Tatum, </em>80 Md.App. at 568, 565 A.2d at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Although \u201cconsideration,\u201d as used in \u00a7 323 of the Restatement, and \u201ccompensation,\u201d as used in \u00a7 5-603, are not identical terms, they are recognized generally as synonyms of each other.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is appropriate for us to extend our holding that a salary does not constitute a \u201cfee or compensation\u201d under \u00a7 5-603 to an interpretation of \u201cfor consideration\u201d under \u00a7 323 of the Restatement. Specifically, under \u00a7 323, the imposition of liability on an individual for his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>negligent undertaking to render services to another does not include the non-voluntary actions taken by a 911 operator or dispatcher in the course of his or her employment. A 911 operator or dispatcher generally receives a salary from his or her employer, not from the person in need of assistance. That payment would not qualify as \u201cconsideration\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 823. Therefore, the common law Good Samaritan doctrine, at least as argued in this case, would not be applicable to the actions of 911 operators and dispatchers taken in the course of performing their employment duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\n<em>C. Special Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Finally, Petitioner Fried and Appellant Muthukumarana argue that the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, respectively, erred in applying the special relationship test to 911 employees or, in the alternative, erred in determining that the employees in question had no special relationship with or duty owed to the individual victims. Specifically, Fried maintains that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cerroneously determined that a tort duty owed from an emergency dispatch telephone operator to a victim is governed by the \u2018special relationship\u2019 rule.\u201d According to Fried, a \u201cspecial relationship is applicable only to a public official under the public duty doctrine ...,\u201d and Respondents Archer and Terrell are mere employees. Likewise, Muthukumarana contends that the Good Samaritan doctrine, not the special relationship test, should be applied to 911 operators and that \u201cthe Good Samaritan doctrine imposed a duty on Woodward (separate from any duty that may lie under a special relationship) to act in a reasonable manner toward Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">For their parts, Woodward, Archer, and Terrell acknowledge that 911 employees generally owe a duty to the public at large. According to Appellee and Respondents, however, only if such an employee makes \u201cassurances that induce specific reliance by the citizen, [does he or she] create[ ] a special relationship with the citizen extending the general public duty owed to a specific private duty in tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>For the following reasons, we agree with Appellee and Respondents that, absent a special relationship between a 911 employee and an individual in need of emergency services, an employee does not owe such an individual a private duty in tort. To maintain an action in negligence, a plaintiff must assert the following elements: \u201c \u2018(1) that the defendant was under a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, (2) that the defendant breached that duty, (8) that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss, and (4) that the loss or injury proximately resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty.\u2019 <em>Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 549, 727 A.2d at 949 (quoting <em>BG &amp; E v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 43, 656 A.2d 307, 311 (1995) (citing <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, </em>335 Md. 58, 76, 642 A.2d 180, 188 (1994))). \u201cDuty\u201d in negligence \u201chas been defined as \u2018an obligation, to which the law will give recognition and effect, to conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 627, 510 A.2d at 1083 (citation omitted). The existence of \u201ca legally recognized duty owed by th[e] defendant to th[e] plaintiff or to a class of persons of which th[e] plaintiff is a member is vital to sustaining a cause of action in negligence.\u201d <em>Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 549, 727 A.2d at 949. <em>See also Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 627, 510 A.2d at 1083 (\u201c[Njegligence is a breach of a duty owed to' one, and absent that duty, there can be no negligence.\u201d). Our consideration, therefore, begins with a determination of whether 911 employees owe a legally recognized tort duty to individuals in need of their assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In previous cases, we have defined the scope of the tort duty owed by police officers to persons in need of assistance by applying the \u201cpublic duty doctrine.\u201d Generally, under the public duty doctrine, when a statute or common law \u201cimposes upon a public entity a duty to the public at large, and not a duty to a particular class of individuals, the duty is not one enforceable in tort.\u201d Dan B. Dobbs, The Law Of Torts \u00a7 271 (2000) (footnote omitted). As we explained in <em>Ashburn, </em>the \u201cduty owed by the police by virtue of their positions as officers is a duty to protect the public.\u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d at 1084. Pursuant to the doctrine, therefore, police officers ordinarily may not be held liable for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>protect specific persons because they owe no duty, as the first element of a negligence action requires, to those individuals.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The public duty doctrine, however, is not without its limitations. Specifically, it \u201chas no application when the court concludes that a statute or court order has created a <em>special duty </em>or specific obligation to a particular class of persons rather than to the public at large.\u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 271 (emphasis added). As we have explained, this is \u201cnothing more than a modified application of the principle that although generally there is no duty in negligence terms to act for the benefit of any particular person, when one does indeed act for the benefit of another, he must act in a reasonable manner.\u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085 (citing Scott <em>v. Watson, </em>278 Md. 160, 170-71, 359 A.2d 548, 555 (1976); <em>Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Yingling, </em>148 Md. 169, 129 A. 36 (1925)). Therefore, \u201c[a] proper plaintiff ... is not without recourse. If he alleges sufficient facts to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>defendant policeman created a \u2018special relationship\u2019 with him upon which he relied, he may maintain his action in negligence.\u201d Ashb<em>urn, </em>306 Md. at 630-31, 510 A.2d at 1085 (footnote and citation omitted). In order for a special relationship between police officer and an individual to be found, however, we required in <em>Ashbum </em>that it \u201cbe shown that the local government or the police officer affirmatively acted to protect the specific victim or specific group of individuals like the victim, thereby inducing the victim\u2019s specific reliance upon the police protection.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Although our opinion in <em>Ashburn </em>involves the application of the public duty doctrine to police officers, it does not limit the application of that principle to police officers alone or otherwise prevent our consideration of it in the context of 911 employees. A review of the duties of 911 personnel reveals that 911 personnel play a significant role in coordinating, facilitating, and effectuating adequate emergency service responses. As the amicus brief explained,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>[t]he job of 911 personnel is not to provide the emergency services that the caller needs, for himself or for someone else, but to facilitate the response of appropriate resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">Although 911 personnel are sometimes lumped together and referred to as 911 operators, as an operational matter, personnel in 911 centers and other emergency communications personnel perform specific tasks: some act as call takers, who speak directly to the callers; others, as fire and rescue dispatchers or police dispatchers, who relay the message to appropriate public safety personnel; and still others, as supervisors, who supervise center operations, train 911 personnel, and even perform call-taking or dispatch functions as staffing and call volume require.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">[T]he emergency communications call taker\u2019s primary job is to find out from the caller enough about the emergency to classify the call for appropriate public safety response, and to verify the name and address of the caller....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">But call takers are often asked to do more than classify calls and send help. Protocols applicable to emergency call takers in some jurisdictions encourage the operator to stay on the line, after emergency personnel have already been dispatched, to try to get additional information that may affect the level of response or that may assist the responder to understand and deal with the situation when they arrive. Other internal protocols are designed to determine whether there is anything the caller may need to do before police, fire or emergency medical personnel arrive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Amicus Brief, <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>at 8-11 (filed 14 January 2002). Based on the nature of his or her duties, we agree that \u201c[a] police dispatcher\u2019s work is necessarily an integral link in the chain of emergency services ultimately delivered by the responding police officers.\u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 257, 775 A.2d at 446. Therefore, while we do not suggest that 911 operators and dispatchers have duties or responsibilities commensurate with those of police officers, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cit is appropriate to measure\u201d their negligence liability, as well as the liability of their managers and supervisors, \u201cby the same standard applied to the police officers who respond to their dispatches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to that holding, the legal duty owed by 911 employees \u201cby virtue of their position, is [also] a <em>public </em>duty to aid.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">As with police officers, significant policy concerns motivate our application of the public duty doctrine to 911 personnel. As the Court of Special Appeals explained in <em>Fried, </em>\u201c \u2018[f]or the courts to proclaim a new and general duty of protection in the law of tort, even to those who may be the particular seekers of protection based on specific hazards, could and would inevitably determine how the limited police resources of the community should be allocated and without predictable limits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 258, 775 A.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Riss v. City of New York, </em>22 N.Y.2d 579, 293 N.Y.S.2d 897, 240 N.E.2d 860, 861 (1968)). By applying the public duty doctrine to 911 personnel, we are able to prevent \u201cthat new and general duty of protection\u201d from resulting \u201cin the reduction of public safety services, including emergency response programs and personnel, to the community.\u201d <em>Id.

Similar to our holding in <em>Ashburn </em>regarding police officers, we conclude here that \u201c \u2018where every decision to deploy law enforcement [or rescue] personnel is fraught with uncertainty,\u2019 \u201d 911 personnel \u201c \u2018must have broad discretion to proceed without fear of civil liability in the \u2018unflinching discharge of their duties.\u2019 \u2019 \u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 629, 510 A.2d at 1084 (citation omitted). As the New York Court of Appeals explained in <em>DeLong, </em>\u201c[a]llowance must be made for\u201d the demanding circumstances involved in emergency services, and \u201calthough any error, however slight, may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>dire consequences[,] it will not always justify an award for damages.\u201d <em>DeLong, </em>469 N.Y.S.2d 611, 457 N.E.2d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Pursuant to the public duty doctrine, therefore, a 911 employee generally owes no duty in tort for the negligent performance of his or her duties to an individual in need of emergency telephone services. As we explained at <em>supra </em>pages 486-88, however, the special duty rule limits the applicability of this doctrine. Specifically, if an individual plaintiff establishes that a 911 employee owed him or her a special duty, based on the existence of a special relationship between the two, the employee may be found liable to the individual in tort for the negligent performance of his or her duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In delineating the conditions required to establish a special relationship between a 911 employee and an individual, in order to give rise to possible tort liability sufficient to overcome the public duty doctrine, we have been urged not to apply the test used for police officers in <em>Ashburn, see supra </em>pages 487-88, and to adopt instead a more specific, categorical list of questions or factors to guide making such decisions. A number of other jurisdictions have developed such formulaic approaches to determining whether a special relationship exists between various public employees and private individuals. For instance, in New York, in order to establish a special relationship and defeat the protection of the public duty doctrine, a plaintiff must demonstrate four distinct factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">(1) an assumption by the municipality, through promises or actions, of an affirmative duty to act on behalf of the party who was injured; (2) knowledge on the part of the municipality\u2019s agents that inaction could lead to harm; (3) some form of direct contact between the municipality\u2019s agents and the injured party; and (4) that party\u2019s justifiable reliance on the municipality\u2019s affirmative undertaking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\"><em>Grieshaber v. City of Albany, </em>279 A.D.2d 232, 720 N.Y.S.2d 214, 215 (2001) (quoting <em>Cuffy v. City of New York, </em>69 N.Y.2d 255, 513 N.Y.S.2d 372, 505 N.E.2d 937, 940 (1987)), <em>appeal denied, </em>96 N.Y.2d 719, 733 N.Y.S.2d 371, 759 N.E.2d 370 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>(2001). <em>See also Kircher v.

This four factor approach has been explicitly adopted by a number of other jurisdictions, including Michigan <em>(White v. Beasley, </em>453 Mich.308, 552 N.W.2d 1, 4-5 (1996) (noting that the \u201conly special-relationship test adopted in more than one state is the test adopted by the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Cuffy </em>\u201d and adopting that test \u201cat least when applied to police officers\u201d)), Ohio <em>(Sawicki v. Ottawa Hills, </em>37 Ohio St.3d 222, 525 N.E.2d 468, 478 (1988) (adopting the <em>Cuffy </em>\u201cprinciples for application to cases in Ohio wherein a special duty is alleged\u201d)), and West Virginia <em>(Wolfe v. City of Wheeling, </em>182 W.Va.253, 387 S.E.2d 307, 311 (1989) (adopting the <em>Cuffy </em>test)). In addition, the Supreme Court of Georgia also embraces most of New York\u2019s test, but deletes the third requirement of direct contact between the municipality\u2019s agent and the injured party and calls for both justifiable and detrimental reliance in the fourth requirement. <em>See City of Rome v. Jordan, </em>263 Ga. 26, 426 S.E.2d 861, 863 (1993). Indiana, in turn, has adopted Georgia\u2019s approach. <em>See Benton v. City of Oakland City, </em>721 N.E.2d 224, 231 n. 12 (Ind.1999) (\u201c[W]e continue to believe that the <em>[Jordan </em>] test is appropriate for determining whether a government unit qualifies for immunity for failure to dispatch emergency services.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Other jurisdictions ostensibly formulated their own special relationship tests, instead of adopting New York\u2019s popular approach. Most, however, retain at least one, if not many, of the same characteristics as New York\u2019s test. For example, North Carolina draws heavily on the concept of reliance and requires that, to establish a special relationship, a plaintiff show (1) \u201can actual promise was made by the police to create a special duty,\u201d (2) \u201cthat this promise was reasonably relied [upon] by plaintiff,\u201d and (3) \u201cthat this reliance was causally related to the injury ultimately suffered by plaintiff.\u201d <em>Braswell v. Braswell, </em>330 N.C. 363, 410 S.E.2d 897, 902 (1991). Similarly, to invoke the special relationship exception in Washington, a plaintiff must show that (1) \u201cthere is some form of privity between the plaintiff and the public entity that differentiates the plaintiff from the general public,\u201d (2) \u201cthe public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>entity made an express assurance to the plaintiff,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe plaintiff justifiably relied on the assurance.\u201d <em>Bratton v. Welp, </em>145 Wash.2d 572, 577, 39 P.3d 959, 961 (2002). <em>See also Babcock v. Mason County Fire Dist. No. 6, </em>144 Wash.2d 774, 30 P.3d 1261, 1268 (2001). In Pennsylvania, the Superior Court elected to focus on the actions of the municipality, explaining that \u201cthe individual claiming a \u2018special relationship\u2019 must demonstrate that the police\u201d were (1) \u201caware of the individual\u2019s particular situation or unique status,\u201d (2) \u201chad knowledge of the potential for the particular harm which the individual suffered,\u201d and (3) \u201cvoluntarily assumed, in light of that knowledge, to protect the individual from the precise harm which was occasioned.\u201d <em>Melendez v. City of Phila., </em>320 Pa.Super. 59, 466 A.2d 1060, 1064 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The approach adopted by South Dakota and Minnesota places weight on the existence of a legislative mandate in deciding whether to recognize a special relationship. Specifically, they provide that there are \u201c \u2018at least four factors which should be considered\u2019 \u201d in determining whether \u201cgovernmental action creates a duty to individuals,\u201d including (1) \u201c \u2018the state\u2019s actual knowledge of the dangerous condition,\u2019 \u201d (2) \u201c \u2018reasonable reliance by person on the state\u2019s representations and conduct,\u2019 \u201d (3) \u201c \u2018an ordinance or statute that sets forth mandatory acts clearly for the protection of a particular class of persons rather than the public as a whole,\u2019 \u201d and (4) \u201c \u2018failure by the state to use due care to avoid increasing the risk of harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>E.P. v. Riley, </em>604 N.W.2d 7, 12-13 (S.D.1999) (quoting <em>Cracraft v. St. Louis Park, </em>279 N.W.2d 801, 806-07 (Minn.1979)). <em>See also Tipton v. Town of Tabor, </em>538 N.W.2d 783, 787 (S.D.1995) (adopting Minnesota\u2019s approach in <em>Cracraft). </em>As the Supreme Court of South Dakota explained, \u201c[sjtrong evidence concerning any combination of these factors may be sufficient to impose liability on a government entity.\u201d <em>Tipton, </em>538 N.W.2d at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Although many jurisdictions have adopted specific, step-by-step guidelines for determining whether a special relationship exists, there are some jurisdictions which continue to rely on more general considerations, as we did in <em>Ashburn. </em>In Cali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>fornia, \u201cwhen the state, through its agents, voluntarily assumes a protective duty toward a certain member of the public and undertakes action on behalf of that member, thereby inducing reliance, it is held to the same standard of care as a private person or organization.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>34 Cal.3d 18, 192 Cal.Rptr. 233, 664 P.2d 137, 140 (1983). Likewise, in the District of Columbia, \u201cin order to convert a duty owed to the general public into a special duty,\u201d a plaintiff must demonstrate \u201ca specific undertaking to protect a particular individual ... [and a] justifiable reliance by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Morgan v. District of Columbia, </em>468 A.2d 1306, 1314 (D.C.1983). <em>See also Johnson v. District of Columbia, </em>580 A.2d 140, 142 n. 2 (D.C.1990) (quoting Morgan); <em>Hines v. District of Columbia, </em>580 A.2d 133, 138 (D.C.1990). In Tennessee, there are a number of general alternative means of establishing a special relationship, including a test similar to our approach in <em>Ash-bum </em>and one requiring the existence of statutory provisions. Specifically, \u201ca special duty of care exists\u201d in Tennessee when (1) \u201cofficials, by their actions, affirmatively undertake to protect the plaintiff, and the plaintiff relies upon the undertaking,\u201d (2) \u201ca statute specifically provides for a cause of .action against an official or municipality for Injuries resulting to a particular class of individuals, of which the plaintiff is a member, from failure to enforce certain laws,\u201d or (3) \u201cthe plaintiff alleges a cause of action involving intent, malice, or reckless misconduct.\u201d <em>Ezell v. Cockrell, </em>902 S.W.2d 394, 402 (Tenn.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Although we acknowledge that a more formulaic special relationship test may facilitate greater predictability, our review of the many different special relationship requirements adopted by other jurisdictions reinforces our choice not to incorporate a more regimented approach into Maryland\u2019s special relationship test. We continue to believe that \u201cthe intent of the \u2018special relationship\u2019 doctrine is better addressed by our general standard outlined in <em>Ashburn </em>\u201d because it preserves our ability to determine \u201cwhether a special relationship exists\u201d on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>359 Md. at 150, 753 A.2d at 67-68. Therefore, after incorporating 911 personnel into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the purview of the public duty doctrine, we also find that the special relationship test in <em>Ashburn </em>is the appropriate analytical paradigm to be used in evaluating work-related negligence claims against 911 personnel. Under that test, in order for a special relationship between a 911 employee and a person in need of assistance to exist, it must be shown that the 911 employee affirmatively acted to protect or assist the specific individual, or a specific group of individuals like the individual, in need of assistance, thereby often inducing the specific reliance of the individual on the employee.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>See Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085. Absent the existence of those factors, a special relationship may not be found to exist between the employee and the individual, and a 911 employee may not be held liable in tort to an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Having completed our general analysis of the consolidated issues, we must now apply our conclusions to the specific cases before us. Our task, however, is limited to addressing the second part of the final issue presented. Specifically, because we have determined that the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Fried </em>and the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in <em>Muthukumarana </em>did not err in applying the special relationship test to 911 employees, <em>see supra </em>Part 1V.C., we are left only to determine whether those courts erred in holding that the employees in question had no special relationship with or duty to the individual victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>A. Fried</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Petitioner Fried\u2019s theory of Respondent Archer\u2019s negligence was that Archer breached her duty of care by failing to adequately question Donte W., erroneously reporting to Deputy Thomas that Tiffany was behind \u201cJ\u201d Court, instead of \u201cK\u201d Court, and failing to report that Tiffany was located near a \u201cforested area.\u201d Although Fried maintains in the first instance that the Court of Special Appeals erred in determining that the tort duty owed from emergency dispatch telephone personnel to individual callers or victims is governed by the special relationship rule, in the alternative she appears to argue that a special relationship existed between Respondent Archer and Tiffany. While she does not state explicitly that a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d (in those words) existed between Archer and Tiffany, she does assert that Donte W.\u2019s \u201creliance on Archer\u2019s affirmative statements\u201d to him was justifiable and that sufficient detrimental \u201creliance on behalf of the caller did take place, and should therefore be transferred to [Tiffany].\u201d As to Respondent Terrell, Fried alleges that he negligently employed improper procedures and/or failed to properly train Archer. According to Fried, Terrell had a special relationship with Tiffany based on the foreseeability that \u201cimproper procedures\u201d and inadequate training would cause \u201charm to those relying on the system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>In reply, both Respondents maintain that there is no \u201callegation of conduct\u201d which could have \u201cinduced Tiffany[\u2019]s specific reliance.\u201d Quoting from the Court of Special Appeals opinion, they contend that Tiffany \u201cdid not \u2018specifically rely\u2019 upon [Archer\u2019s] promise to send police assistance as \u2018Tiffany did not call for help, did not know that the callers had done so, did not know that Archer had promised to send someone out, and did not \u2018choose\u2019 to stay outside in reliance on that promise ....\u2019 \u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 267, 775 A.2d at 452. In addition, they also argue that Tiffany\u2019s \u201ccriminal assailants\u201d did not rely on \u201cArcher\u2019s promise to send police,\u201d and assert that we \u201cshould not apply the special relationship analysis to individuals who create the peril.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Pursuant to the standards set forth in <em>supra </em>Part IV.C., our analysis in this case begins with a determination of whether Archer acted to protect or assist Tiffany, or a specific group of individuals like Tiffany. Fried would have us interpret Archer\u2019s receipt of Donte W.\u2019s call, her conversation with him regarding the unnamed girl that was Tiffany, and her statement that the dispatch system would \u201csend someone out,\u201d as sufficient to constitute an affirmative act on her part to protect or assist Tiffany. We, however, agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cneither a dispatcher\u2019s receipt of a call for help nor the dispatch of emergency assistance alone creates a special duty to the person in need of such assistance.\u201d <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 260, 775 A.2d at 448. <em>See also Morgan, </em>468 A.2d at 1313 (finding that a special relationship is not created \u201cwhen the police gratuitously promise to provide protection---- Reassuring a citizen victimized by criminal conduct that help is on the way certainly does not mean that at all costs the action promised inexorably must follow....\u201d); <em>Hines, </em>580 A.2d at 136 (\u201c[T]he mere fact that an individual has emerged from the general public and become an object of the special attention of public employees does not create a relationship which imposes a special legal duty.\u201d); <em>Koher v. Dial, </em>653 N.E.2d 524, 526 (Ind.Ct.App.1995) (\u201cStanding alone, a governmental entity\u2019s dispatch of emergency services does not create a private duty.\u201d). In this case, therefore, where there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>is no indication that Archer\u2019s handling of Donte W.\u2019s call exceeded or was markedly different than her handling of other similar calls and situations, we shall not find an action on Archer\u2019s part to protect or assist Tiffany sufficient to impose a special duty in tort on Archer for her alleged negligent handling of the dispatch from the call. <em>See Wanzer, </em>580 A.2d at 132 (\u201cA one-time call to 911 for help is not enough to establish a special relationship.... To give rise to a special relationship, the agency\u2019s response to the private party must in some demonstrable way exceed the response generally made to other members of the public.\u201d). To hold otherwise would circumvent wholly our extending protection to 911 personnel in the \u201c \u2018unflinching discharge\u2019 of their duties\u2019 \u201d to the general public. <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 629, 510 A.2d at 1084 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Likewise, we also are unable to conclude that Archer\u2019s answering and handling of Donte W.\u2019s call constituted an act to protect or assist a specific group of individuals like Tiffany. Pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 18-101-18-102, \u201call counties\u201d must \u201chave in operation an enhanced 911 system,\u201d including \u201cpolice, fire fighting, and emergency ambulance services\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 18-102(a), (c)), to protect \u201cthe safety and well-being of the citizens of Maryland.\u201d \u00a7 18-101(a).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> By its terms, this statutory scheme does not create an emergency system to benefit a discrete group of persons. Rather, in providing for such broad services, it recognizes that, at different times, any and all citizens of, or visitors in, Maryland may find it necessary to utilize that system for innumerable purposes. In our view, acting to protect or assist a \u201cspecific group of individuals,\u201d sufficient to create a special relationship, involves more than general actions taken to serve members of the public at large in need of emergency telephone services. To find otherwise, by equating a duty to act with the provision of a general public service, might jeopardize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the availability of those services in the first instance. <em>See Wanzer, </em>580 A.2d at 132; <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 258, 775 A.2d at 447. Absent the existence of an affirmative action on Archer\u2019s part to protect Tiffany or a specific group of individuals like Tiffany, a special duty in tort may not be imposed on Archer for her handling of the dispatch from Donte W.\u2019s call. As a result, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether the facts of this case satisfy the second prong of the special relationship test.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Finally, we are unwilling to conclude that Terrell owed a special duty in tort to Tiffany. Accepting as true Fried\u2019s allegations, there is no indication that Terrell\u2019s alleged failure to establish proper policies and to train adequately Archer constituted an affirmative action to assist or protect Tiffany. Fried provides no evidence of any action taken by Terrell in this case in excess of or substantially different than his actions towards other individuals in need of 911 assistance. In addition, Terrell\u2019s general employment duties with the HCSO fail to create a duty to a \u201cspecific group of individuals\u201d like Tiffany. Pursuant to the Harford County Code, Terrell administers the Harford County Division of Emergency Operations, which is responsible, in part, for \u201c[r]eceiving and handling all 911 telephone calls in the county.\u201d Harford County Code, Ch. 9, Art. XXXVI, \u00a7\u00a7 9-200-9-201. As we earlier stated, acting to protect or assist a \u201cspecific group of individuals,\u201d requires more than general actions taken to serve all members of the public in need of emergency telephone services. Because Terrell\u2019s actions fail to satisfy the first prong of the special relationship test, Terrell owed no individual duty to Tiffany.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>B. Muthukumarana</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Appellant Muthukumarana alleged that Appellee Woodward negligently failed to advise her to leave her home and to call back from a safe location. Although Muthukumarana maintains, as her flagship issue, that the Good Samaritan doctrine should apply in this case, she also argues alternatively that the existence of a special relationship \u201cis at the least a question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>material fact.\u201d <em>But see supra </em>pages 471-73 (explaining that in summary judgment cases where there is no genuine dispute of material facts, the determination of whether a special relationship exists is a question of law). Muthukumarana contends that \u201c|.b]y asking the particular questions that she asked, Woodward affirmatively kept [Appellant] on the telephone ... when she should have been directed to flee pursuant to the Standard] Operating] Procedure],\u201d and also suggests that she \u201cis distinguished from most members of the public at large\u201d because she \u201creceived an Instruction Sheet from the County which directed her to call 911 if she had reason to fear for her immediate safety.\u201d According to Muthukumarana, her \u201cspecific reliance on the assistance of Woodward ... increased her peril by keeping her [and inferentially her children] in harm\u2019s way and by causing [them] to forgo other methods of assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">On the other hand, Woodward contends that Muthukumarana would have us \u201cinfer an affirmative act by Woodward and specific reliance by Muthukumarana merely because Woodward answered the phone and asked questions,\u201d and explains that a special relationship should not be formed based on \u201c \u2018a call for assistance\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018the dispatch of such assistance.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 254, 775 A.2d at 444). In addition, Woodward argues that a special relationship was not formed \u201cmerely because Appellant Muthukumarana [previously] received an instruction sheet ... directing her to call 911 ...\u201d and notes that \u201cMuthukumarana did not rely upon any affirmative assurances by Woodward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In this case, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether a special relationship existed between Woodward and, through Appellant, Emil and Budrani because, regardless of whether Woodward owed an individual duty in tort to Appellant, Emil and/or Budrani, the undisputed facts of this case (in the form of the tape recorded 911 call) fail to indicate any evidence of negligence on Woodward\u2019s part. According to Montgomery County\u2019s Standard Operating Procedure (\u201cSOP\u201d) for responding to a domestic violence call, Woodward\u2019s initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>duties were to determine if there were any injuries on the scene, whether weapons were present, whether the caller was the victim or a witness, where the assailant was located, and whether drugs or alcohol were involved. <em>See supra </em>note 11. If, after obtaining this information and sending it to dispatch, Woodward determined that the caller was in \u201cimmediate danger,\u201d she then was supposed to advise the caller to leave the scene. <em>Id. </em>A review of the transcript of the conversation between Woodward and Muthukumarana reveals that Woodward did not deviate from the terms of the SOP. Upon receipt of the call, she obtained the address of the home where the disturbance was located, immediately classified the call as \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d and sent it on to dispatch. She then attempted to determine, pursuant to the SOP, who was involved in the domestic incident, where Muthukumarana\u2019s husband was located, whether there were any weapons in the home, and whether her husband had a weapon in his possession. Unfortunately, while Woodward was in the process of obtaining the \u201cpertinent information\u201d and before she had the opportunity to determine if Muthukumarana should and could leave the scene, Mr. Muthukumarana shot his children and then himself. Although the sequence of events in this case are tragic, there is no indication that Woodward acted negligently in her handling of the relatively brief call.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Even if Woodward were deemed negligent in her handling of Muthukumarana\u2019s call, we nonetheless could not find in Appellant\u2019s favor because the circumstances of this case fail to meet the first prong of the special relationship test \u2014 an action taken to protect or assist Emil or Budrani or a specific group of individuals like Emil and Budrani.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The record and the tape recorded 911 call provide no indication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that Woodward took any action to protect or assist Emil and Budrani directly. And, as we explained at <em>supra </em>pages 499-501, Woodward\u2019s receipt of the call alone did not create a special duty to Emil and Budrani. <em>See Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 260, 775 A.2d at 448 (\u201c[Njeither a dispatcher\u2019s receipt of a call for help nor the dispatch of emergency assistance alone creates a special duty to the person in need of such assistance.\u201d). Likewise, Woodward\u2019s mere handling and answering of the 911 call from Muthukumarana, requesting assistance as a member of the general public, did not constitute an act to protect or assist a \u201cspecific group of individuals\u201d such as Emil and Budrani. <em>See supra </em>pages 500-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Finally, Muthukumarana\u2019s receipt of the information/instruction sheet suggesting that she call 911 if she feared for her safety did not create a special duty flowing from Woodward to Emil and Budrani. The information/instruction sheet was not designed or intended to increase the obligation of the Montgomery County Communication Center or set apart its duties to Appellant or other individuals receiving <em>ex-parte </em>orders for protection from domestic violence. Rather, the sheet\u2019s stated purpose was to inform individuals receiving <em>ex-parte </em>orders of the process involved in serving those orders and the nature of <em>ex-parte </em>orders in general. By its own terms, it was provided to \u201chelp [the recipient] better understand what role [the Montgomery County Sheriffs] Office and the Montgomery County Police may play in executing [the recipient\u2019s] order and how [the recipient] can assist.\u201d While the sheet explained that an individual should call 911 if he or she had reason to fear for his or her safety, that provision was simply a reminder of the services available to the public from the existing emergency telephone system in Montgomery County, not an exceptional or variant extension of service to a certain group of individuals. Because Muthukumarana\u2019s receipt of the information/instruction sheet is insufficient to establish a special relationship between herself and Woodward, it likewise does not create one, by extension, between Woodward and Emil and Budrani. Therefore, even if Wood<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ward had handled negligently Muthukumarana\u2019s call, she would owe no individual duty in tort to Emil and Budrani because her actions fail to satisfy the first prong of the special relationship test.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\n<em>MUTHUKUMARANA CASE NO. 83: JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>FRIED, CASE NO. 84: JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; PETITIONER TO PAY COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">BELL, Chief Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\">. Throughout this opinion, we shall utilize the reference \"911\u201d to refer to mandated emergency telephone systems and to describe the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>employees stalling those systems. Pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Article 41, \u00a7 18-101, \"the three digit number, 911,\u201d is \"the primary emergency telephone number for the State of Maryland.\u201d Every county in Maryland and Baltimore City has a dispatch center \"to receive 911 calls and route them to the proper public safety authorities.\" Amicus Brief, <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>at 3 (filed 14 January 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Additionally, although the cases before us present similar issues, the operation of the emergency telephone systems involved in the cases, along with the individual duties of the 911 employees involved, are not identical. For example, in the Harford County Sheriffs Office (\"ihe HCSO\u201d), the focus of <em>Fried, </em>a police communications officer, upon receipt of an emergency call, is responsible for dispatching the call to the police. In Montgomery County, situs of <em>Muthukumarana, </em>a public services aide receives emergency 911 calls and is responsible for gathering pertinent information, transferring the call to the appropriate dispatcher, and remaining on the line to gather more information to assist the dispatcher arid responding emergency personnel. For purposes of this opinion, however, these differences will not occupy further our attention. Therefore, our references to 911 \"systems,\u201d \"operators,\" \u201cdispatchers,\u201d and \"employees\u201d should be understood as encompassing all of the systems and relevanl parties involved in ihese cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Finally, our reference to persons \"in need of\u201d emergency telephone services is intended to include 1) individuals calling 911 on their own behalf for assistance, and 2) individuals in need of assistance for whom a third party contacts 911. In this opinion, we are concerned not with the relationship between a third party caller who is not personally in need of assistance and a 911 employee, but with the legal relationship, if any, between those persons actually in need of assistance and 911 employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">. At the time of the relevant events in this case, the two girls, Tiffany and Melanie, and the boys, Eric F., Donte W., Ricky W., and Louis D., were all minors.

After consulting with Ricky W. and Eric F., Donte W. called the HCSO directly, rather than dialing 911, to request assistance.

In our consideration of this appeal, however, it is irrelevant that Donte W. did not dial 911 directly.

The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Fried </em>defined \"specific reliance\u201d under this test as meaning \u201cdetrimental and justifiable reliance.\u201d Many other jurisdictions likewise have described the reliance necessary to create a special relationship as being justifiable and/or detrimental. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Johnson, </em>580 A.2d at 142 n. 2 (requiring \"justifiable reliance\u201d in the District of Columbia); <em>Hines, </em>580 A.2d at 138 (same); <em>Morgan, </em>468 A.2d at 1314 (same); <em>Jordan, </em>426 S.E.2d at 863 (requiring \"justifiable and detrimental reliance\u201d in Georgia); <em>Benton v.

Although reliance may be a factor under that test, there may be many cases in which reliance is irrelevant to the analysis, such as here. Therefore, adopting a limited definition of \"specific reliance\u201d is not warranted or necessary in the present cases. In spite of the fact that we do not find it necessary to limit our interpretation of \"specific reliance\u201d to detrimental and justifiable reliance, we do recognize that those principles, along with others, may provide useful tools for assessing reliance, where necessary in a particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b547-5\">.

Md Code (1999) \u00a7 15-126(c)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">\u201c(c) Insurer prohibited from engaging in competition with 911 emergency system.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201c(1) An entity subject to this section may not establish or promote an emergency medical response and transporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tion system that encourages or directs access by an insured or enrollee in competition with or in substitution of the Maryland Emergency Medical Services System (911) or other State, county, or local government emergency medical services system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The system is not free. The General assembly authorized a 911 fee, 10 cents per month payable at the time when the bills for telephone service are due, to be paid by the subscribers to 911-accessible service, including switched local exchange access service and wireless telephone service, \u00a7 18-105(b)(l), to be included in a 911 Trust Fund, out of which are to paid reimbursements to the counties for enhancements to a 911 system and expenditures to contractors in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 18-103(h)(11). <em>See </em>\u00a7 18-105(a). It also authorized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201c(c)(1) In addition to the 911 fee imposed by [\u00a7 18-105(b)(1) ], the governing body of each county [to] by ordinance or resolution after public hearing enact or adopt an additional charge not to exceed 50 cents per month to be applied to all current bills rendered for switched local exchange access service, wireless telephone service, or other 911-accessible service within that county. The amount of the additional charge may not exceed a level necessary to cover the total amount of eligible operation and maintenance costs of the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Section 18-105(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The 911 emergency system handles emergency calls for police, fire, and medical assistance and it is designed to do so in a more efficient and expedient manner. Thus, while not the police department or the emergency care provider, it provides a more limited, but nonetheless important, function, \u201cas a clearinghouse for all emergency calls for assistance.\u201d <em>Elvera Trezzi v. City of Detroit, </em>120 Mich.App. 506, 328 N.W.2d 70, 74 (1982)(Benson, J., dissenting). Because established for the purpose of ensuring the provision of emergency assistance to the public, it is logical, as one court has opined, to assume that \u201conce a municipality receives a call for help through the 911 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>system, it is obligated to perform in a proper and reasonable manner\u201d; \u201c \u2018that by accepting the call and agreeing to respond, the municipality had now narrowed a public duty to a special duty to that individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merced, Administratrix v.

Rev 103,121 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Like the Court of Special Appeals, noting the integral link between the 911 operator\u2019s duties and the delivery of emergency services, citing <em>Fried v. Archer, </em>139 Md.App. 229, 257, 775 A.2d 430, 446, <em>cert. granted, </em>366 Md. 246, 783 A.2d 221 (2001), the majority holds that \u201c \u2018it is appropriate to measure\u2019 [the 911 operators\u2019] negligence liability, as well as the liability of their managers and supervisors, \u2018by the same standard applied to the police officers who respond to their dispatches.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muthukumarana v.

That standard is embodied, it concludes, in the \u201cpublic duty doctrine.\u201d Under that doctrine, the majority explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201cwhen a statute or common law \u201cimposes upon a public entity a duty to the public at large, and not a duty to a particular class of individuals, the duty is not one enforceable in tort.\u201d Dan B. Dobbs, Tub Law Of Touts \u00a7 271 (2000) (footnote omitted). As we explained in <em>Ashburn [v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 510 A.2d 1078 (1986) ] the \u201cduty owed by the police by virtue of their positions as officers is a duty to protect the public.\u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d at 1084. Pursuant to the doctrine, therefore, police officers ordinarily may not be held liable for failure to protect specific persons because they owe no duty, as the first element of a negligence action requires, to those individuals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 805 A.2d at 395-96 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Accordingly, the majority also holds that \u201cabsent a special relationship between a 911 employee and an individual in need of the telephone services, an employee does not owe such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>individual a private duty in tort,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 486, 805 A.2d at 395, and, consistently with courts in other States,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that \u201cthe legal duty owed by 911 employees \u2018by virtue of their position, is [also] a <em>public </em>duty to aid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 805 A.2d at 397-98.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> More particularly, the majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">\u201cPursuant to the public duty doctrine, therefore, a 911 employee generally owes no duty in tort for the negligent performance of his or her duties to an individual in need of emergency telephone services.... [T]he special duty rule limits the applicability of this doctrine. Specifically, if an individual plaintiff establishes that a 911 employee owed him or her a special duty, based on the existence of a special relationship between the two, the employee may be found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>liable to the individual in tort for the negligent performance of his or her duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 491-92, 805 A.2d at 398-99. Critical to the majority\u2019s analysis is the absence of a duty owed by the 911 operators to the victims in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">I agree that the crucial inquiry is whether there was a duty owed in these cases, for it is true that absent a duty of care, there can be no liability in negligence. <em>See Walpert, Smullian &amp; Blumenthal, P.A. v.

Page Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on The Law of Torts, \u00a7 53, at 356 (5th ed.1984). Analyzing this element, Judge Cole, for the Court, pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201c \u2018Duty\u2019 in negligence has been defined as \u2018an obligation, to which the law will give recognition and effect, to conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>There is no set formula for this determination.

In broad terms, these policies include: \u2018convenience of administration, capacity of the parties to bear the loss, a policy of preventing future injuries, [and] the moral blame attached to the wrongdoer....\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting W.

On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 550, 727 A.2d 947, 949 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Among the variables to be considered in determining whether a duty to another exists, we have said, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201cthe foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered the injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\"><em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 627, 510 A.2d at 1083, quoting <em>Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California, </em>17 Cal.3d 425, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334, 342 (1976). Inherent also in the concept of duty is that there be a relationship between the parties, out of which the duty arises. <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, </em>335 Md. at 77, 642 A.2d at 189. As among these, we have stated that the factor deemed most important is foreseeability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>see id., </em>although we have cautioned that \u201cforeseeability\u201d must not be confused with \u201cduty,\u201d noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">\u201cThe fact that a result may be foreseeable does not itself impose a duty in negligence terms. This principle is apparent in the acceptance by most jurisdictions and by this Court of the general rule that there is no duty to control a third person\u2019s conduct so as to prevent personal harm to another, unless a \u2018special relationship\u2019 exists either between the actor and the third person or between the actor and the person injured. <em>See Lamb v. Hopkins, </em>303 Md. 236, 242-44, 492 A.2d 1297, 1300-01 (1985); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 315 (1965); <em>Scott v. Watson, </em>278 Md. 160, 166, 359 A.2d 548, 552 (1976) (\u2018a private person is under no special duty to protect another from criminal acts by a third person, in the absence of statutes, or of a special relationship.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><em>Ashburn </em>at 628, 510 A.2d at 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Thus, \u201c[i]n determining the existence of a duty owed to a plaintiff, we have applied a \u2018foreseeability of harm\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, </em>335 Md. at 77, 642 A.2d at 189. To be sure, that test, like the relationship between the parties, is based upon the recognition that a duty must be limited to avoid liability for unreasonably remote consequences. They also serve to more clearly define whether there is a duty and the boundaries of that duty. It is not surprising, therefore, that this Court has acknowledged that a legal duty arises from \u201cthe \u2018responsibility each of us bears to exercise due care to avoid unreasonable risks of harm to others.\u2019 \u201d <em>B.N. v. K.K., </em>312 Md. 135, 141, 538 A.2d 1175, 1178 (1988), quoting <em>Moran v. Faberg\u00e9, </em>273 Md. 538, 543, 332 A.2d 11, 15 (1975). After all, \u201c[t]he seriousness of potential harm, as well as its probability, contributes to a duty to prevent it.\u201d <em>Faya v. Almaraz, </em>329 Md. 435, 449, 620 A.2d 327, 333 (1993). <em>See Baltimore Gas and Elec. Co. v. Flippo, </em>348 Md. 680, 700, 705 A.2d 1144, 1154 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">I have not the slightest doubt that the 911 operators in these cases owed the victims in these cases a duty of care. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>we have seen, by statute, each of the state\u2019s twenty three counties and the City of Baltimore are required to have in place a 911 system, which automatically connects a person dialing 911 to an established public safety answering point, at which police, fire and emergency ambulance service may be accessed. The reason for the requirement, the General Assembly made clear, was to enhance the delivery of such services, to ensure that they were available more readily\u2014 accessed more easily \u2014 and that they be delivered more efficiently and expeditiously. In fact, in stating the purpose of the legislation, the Legislature pointedly expressed concern for the safety and well-being of the citizens of Maryland and that timely and appropriate assistance \u2014 it specifically and emphatically recognized the danger inherent in any delay \u2014 be available and provided when an emergency situation places the lives or property of those citizens in imminent danger. Moreover, the legislation provides that educational material regarding the system refer to 911 as the primary emergency number, thus further emphasizing its importance in the emergency response area.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The victims<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were citizens of Maryland faced with emergencies of the kind to which the 911 system is designed to respond. In each case, the victims\u2019 lives were imminently at peril. In each case, the 911 system was utilized in an attempt to obtain appropriate emergency assistance, in a timely manner. In each case, the call was answered, not refused, and the operator was told of the emergency, but in neither instance was there a timely response, consistent with the emergency presented and reported. In each case, the victims suffered damage; in each instance, they died or were killed. In each case, this result was not only foreseeable, but, without immediate intervention, predictable.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The State having established, mandated, funded and provided oversight for a 911 system expressly for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>preventing avoidable delays in the delivery of emergency services and to protect the lives and property of its citizens, neither it nor any of the counties or Baltimore City reasonably may contend that a 911 system does not owe a duty to a person who avails him or herself of that system, that something more than a call for assistance is necessary to create the special relationship required to permit recovery for damages incurred as a result of the 911 operator\u2019s negligence. In fact, such a position is, to be quite blunt, nonsensical.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">To be sure, perhaps neither the State nor any of the subdivisions were required to provide a 911 system; however, the State has chosen to do so and to impose the obligation on its subdivisions. Of course, when the choice was made to assume the 911 obligation, we have made clear, it carried with it the obligation to ensure that the obligation is discharged, or executed, in a reasonable manner. <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085. <em>See Scott v. Watson, </em>278 Md. 160, 170-71, 359 A.2d 548, 555 (1976); <em>Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Yingling, </em>148 Md. 169, 129 A. 36 (1925). Moreover, the system chosen invited, and, indeed, encouraged the citizens to utilize the system, holding out the promise that their calls for help would be promptly and efficiently handled, with the result that the potential losses precipitating the calls would be ameliorated or moderated. That invitation, encouragement and, most important, promise of an appropriate and timely response provide the predicate for a special relationship from which a duty flows. All that is required to finalize that relationship is a call from a citizen in need of, or on behalf of someone in need of, the assistance offered and promised. <em>Austin v. City of Scottsdale, </em>140 Ariz. 579, 684 P.2d 151, 154 (1984) (failure to act immediately on an emergency call, even though it was anonymous); <em>DeLong v.

And until the investigating officer is reasonably satisfied that no emergency exists, he is within his legal duty to investigate such calls in a manner consistent with their emergency nature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><em>DeLong </em>was a wrongful death action brought by the estate of a woman who was killed by a burglar after she had called 911 and received assurances that help was being dispatched. It alleged that the call was negligently processed and, so, negligently responded to. The Court held that by creating a special service, accepting the call for emergency assistance and assuring the caller that help was on the way established a special relationship with, and duty to, the caller. 469 N.Y.S.2d 611, 457 N.E.2d at 721. What the Court of Appeals of New York had to say about the predicate for liability in <em>DeLong </em>is particularly apropos this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u2018In this case the decision had been made by the municipalities to provide a special emergency service which was intended and proclaimed to be more efficient than normal police services. Those seeking emergency assistance were advised not to attempt to call the general number for the local police, which ironically might have avoided the tragedy encountered in this case, but were encouraged to dial the 911 number to obtain a quicker response. In addition, and most significantly, the victim\u2019s plea for assistance was not refused. Indeed she was affirmatively assured that help would be there \u2018right away\u2019. Considering the fact that she was merely a block and a half from the local police station, and was not yet at the mercy of the intruder, it cannot be said as a matter of law that this assurance played no part in her decision to remain in her home and not seek other assistance. Unfortunately, it only increased the risk to her life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>8</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In <em>Bratton, </em>reversing the judgment of the intermediate appellate court, the Supreme Court of Washington explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the application of the public duty rule in that State, with particular emphasis on the reliance element:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201cTo establish [public duty] exception, the plaintiff must show that there is some form of privity between the plaintiff and the public entity that differentiates the plaintiff from the general public, that the public entity made an express assurance to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff justifiably relied on the assurance. Privity should be construed broadly, and, in cases based on failure by the police to timely respond to requests for assistance, it refers to the relationship between the public entity and a reasonably foreseeable plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">39 P.3d at 961.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Similarly, with respect to incapacitated victims, it is the foreseeability of the harm and the victim that controls, not whether that victim specifically relied upon, or even knew of, the call to 911. <em>See Merced, v. New York, </em>142 Misc.2d 442, 445-46, 534 N.Y.S.2d 60, 62 (Sup.Ct.1987) (\u201cRealistically, an individual who is in dire need of assistance is often too incapacitated to call 911. It is therefore necessary to broaden the general rule so that any caller, who relies on the assurances of the municipality that they are on their way, created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the requisite \u2018special relationship\u2019 required to hold a municipality liable.\u201d); <em>Lewis v.

Indeed, there is no reason for there to be a 911 emergency system, and certainly no reason to publicize it, if it was not intended that the citizens use it and rely on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The majority maintains that \u201cin order for a special relationship between a 911 employee and a person in need of assistance to exist, it must be shown that the 911 employee affirmatively acted to protect or assist the specific individual, or a specific group of individuals like the individual, in need of assistance, thereby inducing the specific reliance of the individual on the employee.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For that proposition, it relies on <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Specifically, the majority concludes that \u201cneither a dispatcher\u2019s receipt of a call for help nor the dispatch of emergency assistance alone creates a special duty to the person in need of such assistance.\u201d 370 Md. at 498, 805 A.2d at 402-03 (quoting <em>Fried, </em>139 Md.App. at 260, 775 A.2d at 448).

The majority also rejects the argument that the answering and handling of 911 calls are acts for the protection or assistance of a specific group of individuals, i.e., foreseeable plaintiffs. It reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">\u201cBy its terms, this statutory scheme does not create an emergency system to benefit a discrete group of persons. Rather, in providing for such broad services, it recognizes that, at different times, any and all citizens of, or visitors in, Maryland may find it neeessary to utilize that system for innumerable purposes. In our view, acting to protect or assist a \u2018specific group of individuals,\u2019 sufficient to create a special relationship, involves more than general actions taken to serve members of the public at large in need of emergency telephone services. To find otherwise, by equating a duty to act with the provision of a general public service, might jeopardize the availability of those services in the first instance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 498-500, 805 A.2d at 403-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Finally, the majority points out that the victim in <em>Fried </em>did not rely on the assistance sought from 911, either directly or actually, having neither been informed of the call or aware of it and, in any event, she was not entitled to the transfer of reliance of the third party in that case because that third party was a perpetrator of the act, thus presenting a scenario that society is unwilling to accept \u201cas reasonable or justifiable.\u201d For these various propositions, it relies on <em>Wanzer v. District of Columbia, </em>580 A.2d 127, 132 (D.C.App.1990) (\u201cA one-time call to 911 for help is not enough to establish a special relationship.... To give rise to a special relationship, the agency\u2019s response to the private party must in some demonstrable way exceed the response generally made to other members of the public\u201d); <em>Hines v. District of Columbia, </em>580 A.2d 133, 136 (D.C.1990) (\u201c[T]he mere fact that an individual has emerged from the general public and become an object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of the special attention of public employees does not create a relationship which imposes a special legal duty\u201d); <em>Morgan v. District of Columbia </em>468 A.2d 1306, 1313 (D.C.1983) (no special relationship \u201cwhen the police gratuitously promise to provide protection....

Dial, </em>653 N.E.2d 524, 526 (Ind.Ct.App.1995) (\u201cStanding alone, a governmental entity\u2019s dispatch of emergency services does not create a private duty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><em>Ashburn </em>contributes little of real substance to this discussion because it is easily distinguishable. Significantly, it does not involve the 911 emergency system. There, a police officer came upon a man, who was intoxicated and sitting behind the wheel of a pickup truck, whose engine was running and lights were on, on the parking lot of a 7-11 store. Rather than arrest the man for drunk driving, as he could have done, the officer elected instead to tell the man to pull his truck to the side of the lot and to discontinue driving that evening. When the officer left, the man drove the truck away from the lot, proceeded a short distance and collided with a pedestrian, who sued, claiming the officer\u2019s negligence. 306 Md. at 619-20, 510 A.2d at 1079. The analogy would be closer had the officer received a report of a drunk driver in the neighborhood and chosen to do nothing. Another interesting issue would have been presented had the drunk sued the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Turning to the other cases on which the majority relies, <em>Morgan v. District of Columbia </em>468 A.2d 1306 (D.C.1983), itself, acknowledges its inappositeness to the case sub judiee: \u201cit is important to state first what this case is <em>not </em>about. It is not about a situation where the police do not respond to an urgent call from a citizen who is in immediate danger of being harmed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1310. Neither it, nor any of the others,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is persuasive, in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The reasoning of the cases on which the majority relies, fails completely to take account of the legislative purpose in enacting legislation similar to the Maryland 911 legislation and, thereby, undermines and potentially renders the 911 system meaningless and useless. Indeed, to suggest that the operators of a 911 call system, mandated, financed, governed and directed by the State, has no duty to those who deign to use it, taking the government at its word that it will respond to their emergency timely and appropriately, simply does not make sense. As we have seen, the purpose for establishing the 911 emergency system and requiring the subdivisions to implement it was to create a centralized clearinghouse for such calls, the expectation being that that would enhance efficiency and expedition. Increased efficiency and expedition was not desired simply for their own sake, but for the sake of the lives and the property of Maryland citizens. The General Assembly recognized \u201cthe paramount importance of the safety and well-being of the citizens of Maryland\u201d and \u201cthat when the lives or property of its citizens are in imminent danger, timely and appropriate assistance must be rendered,\u201d \u00a7 18-101(a), and expressed concern \u201cthat avoidable delays in reaching appropriate emergency aid are occurring to the jeopardy of life and property.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 18-101(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">An emergency system with the purpose of providing timely and appropriate response to calls reporting emergencies affecting the lives and property of citizens simply has no point if the purpose need not be fulfilled, if those charged with the responsibility of responding owe no duty to those who call or to those for whose benefit the system was established. I can see no reason to have a system with such high ideals as expressed in the legislation if there can be a failure to fulfill the purpose without consequence. The consequence of such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>scenario is a system with no rational basis and no incentive for those operating it to demand that it live up to, and achieve, its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">In <em>Wanzer, </em>the District of Columbia Court of Appeals tells us that it takes more than one call to 911 for help to establish a special relationship and that a special relationship requires that the agency\u2019s response to the caller in \u201csome demonstrable way exceed the response generally made to other members of the public.\u201d 580 A.2d at 132. It goes on to state: \u201cEven a series of contacts over a period of time between a public agency and an injured or endangered person is not enough to establish a special relationship, absent some showing that the agency assumed a greater duty to that person than the duty owed to the public at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This does not make sense. The only reason anyone calls 911 is for help and, in Maryland, at least, that is prompted by the invitation the public is given to use an effective system, along with the promise of a timely and appropriate response. When the system actually is used, it is the existence of the system, the invitation to use it by holding out that there are benefits that flow from it, i.e., the promise of results, timely and appropriate response, from which a duty flows. That is the special relationship; there need be no other. The more pertinent observation to me, therefore, is that the 911 operator did not negate, avoid, the special relationship, by not answering, or better yet, telling the caller what would be the truth if the majority is correct, that he or she did not owe the caller a duty and, consequently, help may, or may not, be forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Just as important, if the 911 system is to operate as intended, the response to each call will be generally the same \u2014 the caller will report the emergency, respond to whatever reasonable questions are required to allow for the dispatch of assistance and the operator will indicate what the response will be, indicate that help is coming. There neither should or ought to be a response that \u201cdemonstrably\u201d exceeds another. After all, only those members of the public needing the emergency assistance will call, thereby triggering the need for a response. If the comparison is to the public at large, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>it seems to be, then the response to a 911 caller will always be, it is hoped, greater than that to the public at large, to whom the operator simply does not, and has no occasion to, relate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The statement in <em>Morgan </em>that reassuring a crime victim that help is on the way does not mean that it must, at all costs, arrive, is true. The difficulty I have is the context. The Court suggests, if not explicitly holds, that the 911 operator\u2019s negligence is an acceptable excuse for the help not arriving. When help does not arrive despite the non negligent action of the 911 operator, that is one thing. It is quite another when the sole reason for help not arriving <em>is </em>the negligence of the 911 operator. The latter is unacceptable, given the statutory scheme and the holding out of the 911 system as being beneficial and efficient in an emergency. I repeat, I believe a special relationship is created when a caller calls 911 to report an emergency, responding to such calls being, in addition to the expressed legislative purpose, the only purpose. It seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>to me to follow that to avoid a duty to the caller the 911 operator must negate that special relationship by advising the caller that the system does not promise help or equivocate the promise of help.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><em>Hines </em>tells us that a member of the general public can become the object of special attention and yet still not be entitled to a special legal duty. If a member of the general public is not owed a duty and one who has emerged from the general public and become the object of special attention is not owed a duty, perhaps no one is owed a duty. That would be fine if the Legislature had exempted 911 operators from suits for simple negligence arising out of their employment, as it has done with regard to other emergency personnel. <em>See e.g. </em>Md Code (1974, 1998 Replacement Volume) \u00a7\u00a7 5-603 of the Courts &amp; Jud. Proc. Article (exempting those who offer emergency medical care at the scene of injury without a fee from liability unless the actions are grossly negligent); \u00a7 5-604 (exempting fire and rescue companies from liability unless willful or grossly negligent); \u00a7 5-605 (law enforcement officer acting outside jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">To be sure, the victim in <em>Fried </em>neither knew nor was informed that someone was calling 911 on her behalf. It is likewise true that she did not have a familial or other close relationship with those who called 911 on her behalf, who were themselves the perpetrators of the acts resulting in the victim being in peril. The majority finds no duty for those reasons. I do not agree. Many victims in need of 911 service will not be able, either physically or because not near a phone to call 911. Those who are incapacitated will not be aware that help has been sought. Some will be discovered by strangers, who nevertheless will seek the help of 911 and a few, as in the present case, may have the perpetrator make the call. Why there would be a duty in one case and not in the others is not at all clear to me. When the victim is foreseeable, it seems to me to be of less consequence how the 911 system became aware of the emergency than what it does, or is required to do, to respond. So what if the victim does not know that help has been summoned or that it is summoned by someone he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>she does not know or even by someone who is culpable? Focusing on how the system is informed of the emergency misses the point \u2014 the emergency exists whoever reports it and whoever knows of the reporting and whoever perpetrates the offense giving rise to the emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In my view, there is a duty owed by the 911 operator and the system to 911 callers and foreseeable plaintiffs when calls are placed to 911, consistent with the system\u2019s holding out of its merits and benefits, and the operators are informed of emergency situations requiring emergency assistance. Accordingly, I would reverse both of the judgments and remand for new trials.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\">.

The majority rejects the applicability of the good Samaritan rule in favor of, as we have seen, the public duty doctrine. I do not quarrel with that decision, the approach it adopts being the one followed by other courts that have faced the issue. <em>See </em>note 4, supra. In truth, however, the logic of the distinction that is being drawn between the two approaches escapes me. This Court commented in <em>Ashburn v. Anne Arundel Co., </em>306 Md. 617, 631, 510 A.2d 1078, 1085 (1986), that \"[tjhis 'special duty rule,\u2019 as it has been termed by ihe courts, is nothing more than a modified application of the principle that although generally there is no duty in negligence terms to act for the benefit of any particular person, when one does indeed act for the benefit of another, he must act in a reasonable manner. In order for a special relationship between police officer and victim to be found, it must be shown that the local government or the police officer affirmatively acted to protect the specific victim or a specific group of individuals like the victim, thereby inducing the victim\u2019s specific reliance upon the police protection.\u201d(cifations omitted).
