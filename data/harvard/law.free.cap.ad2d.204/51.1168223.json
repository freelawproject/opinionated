The Court of Appeals in a memorandum and order of February 17, 1994, reversed our order, finding that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to require such an agency charge <em>(People v Herring, </em>83 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 782; <em>but see, </em>Ciparick, J., joined by Kaye, Ch. J., dissenting, at 783-784). The case was remitted to us for consideration of other issues raised, which were not considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Initially, we note that defendant\u2019s guilt of the sale and possession of controlled substances was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Undercover officer Sheldon Dixon asked defendant if \"he had any nickels\u201d. The defendant immediately took the officer to a storefront, asked for and received 20 dollars in pre-recorded buy money after asking the undercover how many vials he wanted. He walked into the storefront and asked for and received four vials of crack in exchange for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>money, then returned and gave the officer the four vials. It has been finally determined by the Court of Appeals that there was no reasonable view of the evidence that defendant only served as an agent of the buyer. Therefore, viewing that evidence in the light most favorable to the People, any rational trier of the facts could have found defendant\u2019s guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(see, People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 494).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In failing to return to court during the voir dire of jurors, the defendant voluntarily absented himself and forfeited his right to be present during the trial. Before proceeding, the trial court held an in absentia hearing. At that hearing, the People\u2019s investigator, a police detective, testified he contacted all the hospitals in the Bronx, checked the New York City morgue and the files and records maintained by the Department of Correction. He also went to the defendant\u2019s last known address, the home of defendant\u2019s grandmother and knocked on the door with no one responding. Further he called a listed telephone number for that apartment, again with no response. The investigator canvassed the neighborhood around that address and using defendant\u2019s photograph, asked approximately seven people, tenants, security guards and the building manager, if they knew of defendant\u2019s whereabouts. He received only negative responses. After hearing this testimony, the court adjourned the hearing and directed the investigator to determine whether defendant was in a Manhattan hospital as well as to check the Federal and State correction systems, which the detective did unsuccessfully. Thus, the trial court made a reasonable inquiry to determine whether the defendant\u2019s absence was deliberate and placed on the record the facts and reasons relied upon in reaching its determination <em>(People v Brooks, </em>75 NY2d 898, 899).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Defendant\u2019s further contention that he was entitled to warnings pursuant to <em>People v Parker </em>(57 NY2d 136) is without merit since he absconded after his trial had begun <em>(see, People v Sanchez, </em>65 NY2d 436, 444).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Finally, defendant\u2019s claim that he received consecutive terms is erroneous. The terms imposed were concurrent. In addition, in view of defendant\u2019s criminal history, the seriousness and circumstances of the instant offense, and the fact that defendant absconded while on trial, we find that the sentence imposed was not harsh or excessive and we, therefore, decline to modify it in the interest of justice.
