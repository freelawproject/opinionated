A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AlbJ\">The State appeals from the order granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment made after the State\u2019s opening statement to the jury on the ground that the State failed to assert an essential element of the charge against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">Defendant was indicted as an accessory after the fact <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:85-2) for allegedly aiding and assisting one Carrie Speight in avoiding apprehension by the police by providing her with transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">In his opening statement to the jury at trial the prosecutor stated that the State would prove that after Speight\u2019s in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>dictment, defendant, who had been living with Carrie Speight and her husband, had been told by the Mercer County Prosecutor\u2019s office that Speight was wanted on a warrant for her arrest, and that she had been indicted for a high misdemeanor and warned defendant that he should not assist or aid her in avoiding apprehension. According to the prosecutor, the State also intended to prove that defendant knew Speight was a fugitive from justice when he and Speight were arrested together in an automobile in South Eiver, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the State had failed to state a case on opening in not asserting that defendant had actual knowledge that Speight was guilty of a high misdemeanor at the time he committed the acts described in the indictment. Although admitting that the State did not intend to prove defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of Speight\u2019s guilt of the crime charged against her, the prosecutor argued that such an allegation was unnecessary. The essential allegation, argues the State, is defendant\u2019s knowledge of an outstanding charge provided by law enforcement authorities and warrant for arrest on account of the commission of a high misdemeanor or any of the other offenses set forth in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :85-2 \u2014 not actual knowledge of guilt thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The judge deferred ruling on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss until after the luncheon recess. When court reconvened the prosecutor announced to the court that during the luncheon interval he learned of the availability of testimony that defendant was present on the date and in the vicinity of Speight\u2019s offense and hence had actual knowledge of her guilt of the crime charged to her. As explained by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">;&lt; * * her charge, the incident that she plead guilty to was an undercover buy, that officers from Mercer County were present when the buy was made and they are prepared to testify that immediately after the transaction was made with an undercover officer that Miss Speight went back to a car in which the defendant Lynch was seated and handed him the money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The trial judge declined, however, to permit the prosecutor to reopen using these additional facts to eliminate the objection upon which defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on the ground that to use such information at the last minute before trial and without affording defendant discovery with respect to such information would be unfair to the defense. Instead of continuing the trial to permit discovery, the judge opted to rule on the motion based upon the State\u2019s opening as it was originally given, excluding from its consideration the proffered testimony described after the luncheon recess. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment was granted, the judge holding that \u201cin order to prove guilt under <em>[N. J. S. </em>A.] 2A :85-2 one of the essential elements required of the State is to prove actual knowledge of [the] commission of the crime and that mere knowledge that a charge is outstanding against * * * the person aided is insufficient.\u201d The State appeals, alleging error in this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">During oral argument this court, on its own motion, questioned the State\u2019s right to appeal the order dismissing the indictment after the jury had been empaneled and sworn. Briefs on the matter were solicited and received. We conclude that the State cannot appeal this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The permissibility of State appeals from orders affecting the disposition of criminal cases depends, to a large extent, on whether such an appeal, if successful, would require defendant\u2019s retrial in violation of federal and state guarantees against twice being placed in jeopardy for the \u2022same offense. Hence, apart from court rules governing the matter, about which more later, inquiries concerning the State\u2019s power to appeal orders in criminal eases require consideration as to whether required proceedings subsequent to consideration of the appeal will offend that constitutional guarantee. <em>State v. Sims, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>359, 370 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We are not unmindful of the recent redefinition of the parameters of double jeopardy protection by a trilogy of federal cases, <em>United States v. </em>Wilson, 420 <em>U. S. </em>332, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>1013, 43 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 232 (1975); <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>420 <em>U. S. </em>358, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>1006, 43 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 250 (1975), and <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 <em>U. S. </em>377, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>1055, 43 L. <em>Ed. </em>2d 265 (1975), and the New Jersey cases which anticipated the foregoing or followed in their wake: <em>State v. Sims, supra; State v. Kleinwaks, </em>68 <em>N. J. </em>328 (1975); <em>State v. Kluber, </em>130 <em>N. J. Super. </em>336 (App. Div. 1974), certif. den. 67 <em>N. J. </em>72 (1975); <em>State v. Laganella, </em>144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>268, 286 (App. Div. 1976). Basic to the holdings in <em>Wilson-Jenkins-Serfass </em>was the view that double jeopardy considerations are not offended where a successful State\u2019s appeal would not result in a retrial of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">For example, in <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>a post-trial order of the trial court, which set aside the jury verdict of guilt and dismissed the indictment on the ground of delay between the offenses and indictment, was appealable by the State since appellate correction of the asserted error would not subject defendant to the harassment traditionally associated with multiple prosecutions. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>420 <em>U. S. </em>at 352, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>1026, 43 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 247. On the other hand, in <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>the trial court order dismissing defendant and discharging the indictment following a bench (a nonjury) trial was held not appealable by the State since a successful appeal would necessitate further proceedings resolving the factual issues pertinent to the elements of the offense charged. In <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>however, a pretrial order dismissing the indictment on the basis of affidavits submitted and oral stipulations of counsel was held appealable by the State since jeopardy had not attached at the time the challenged ruling was made. Nothing in any of these cases suggests that a trial error favoring a defendant could be corrected on the State\u2019s appeal if the successful result of the appeal would be defendant\u2019s retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">New Jersey cases followed suit. <em>State v. Kleinwaks, supra, </em>permitted a State\u2019s appeal from a judgment of acquittal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>following vacation of a jury verdict of guilt. Correction of the challenged trial court action of vacating the guilty verdict would not be attended by defendant\u2019s retrial; the appeal could either result in an affirmance or reinstatement of the jury verdict. <em>State v. Sims, supra, </em>which preceded the <em>Wilson-J enlcins-Serfa'ss </em>trilogy, is to the same effect. There, however, in issue was the appealability of a trial court order vacating a jury verdict of guilty with an accompanying order for a new trial. The ordered retrial, at defendant\u2019s request, would clearly not violate double jeopardy guarantees, and reinstatement of the jury\u2019s verdict with the attendant conviction thereon, at the request of the State on appeal, would not result in a retrial at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Again, the common ground of all of these pronouncements, state and federal, was that the permitted state appeal, if successful, would not result in a retrial. In <em>Sims </em>a retrial would be avoided by state success; the retrial which had been sought by defendant would result only from the State\u2019s failure. In <em>Kleinwalcs </em>an appeal, successful or not, would result in no subsequent trial. In <em>Serf ass </em>there was no first trial since jeopardy had not attached when the challenged order was made and hence any resulting trial would not constitute a second attempt by the State to secure conviction. The appeal in <em>Jenldns </em>was rejected because its success would necessitate further proceedings; <em>Wilson </em>is almost identical in its procedural underpinnings with our own <em>Kleinwalcs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Since that trilogy, however, issues concerning the state\u2019s right to appeal trial court orders in criminal eases have continued unabated. In <em>Lee v. United States, </em>432 <em>U. S. </em>23, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>2141, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 80 (1977), defense counsel moved, in the bench trial, after the State\u2019s opening, for a dismissal of the information charging theft on the ground that it failed to allege all of the requisite elements thereof under the state statute. Here, it should be noted that the motion was made before jeopardy attached. The motion was \u201cdenied at this time,\u201d with the judge indicating that on research <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>he -would \u201cgive consideration as appears * * * warranted.\u201d <em>Id., 432 U. S. </em>at 26, 97 <em>S. Ct. 2144, </em>53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 84. The two-hour trial proceeded to conclusion, after which defendant moved for an acquittal on the ground of insufficient government proofs. That motion was denied, with the judge noting that it bordered on the frivolous. \u201cTour client has been proven [sic] beyond any reasonable doubt in the world, there is no question about his guilt; none whatsoever.\u201d <em>Id., </em>432 <em>U. S. </em>at 26, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2144, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 85. Without presenting any evidence, the defense then renewed its motion, made earlier, concerning the sufficiency of the information. The trial judge reluctantly granted the motion and dismissed the charge. Thereafter, defendant was again charged with the same offense and, on substantially the same evidence as was adduced at the first trial, was convicted. His claim that the second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause was rejected by the Seventh Circuit, 539 <em>F. </em>2d 612 (1976), and again by the Supreme Court in <em>Lee v. United States, supra. </em>The court identified the critical inquiry as being \u201cwhether the order contemplates an end to all prosecution of the defendant for the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id., </em>432 <em>U. S. </em>at 30, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2146, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 87. Answering that inquiry from the record in that case, the court noted that \u201cthere can be little doubt that the court granted the motion to dismiss in this case in contemplation of just such a second prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. Lee </em>notes that the proceedings wore terminated at defendant\u2019s request and with his consent notwithstanding the trial judge\u2019s announcement of his views concerning defendant\u2019s guilt of the charge on the proofs adduced. The original motion, made at the eleventh hour before trial and without any warning to the court or the government, was made before jeopardy attached. Although originally denied, \u201cthe court\u2019s remarks left little doubt that the denial was subject to further consideration at an available opportunity in the proceedings * * <em>Id., </em>432 <em>U. S. </em>at 33, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2147, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 89. Hence, although the motion was made before jeopardy at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tached, it was decided after only because the lateness of the motion made a considered earlier ruling difficult. In these circumstances the court treated the dismissal as tantamount to a declaration of a mistrial and held the second trial not offensive to double jeopardy guarantees. Justice Brennan\u2019s concurring opinion stressed the element of lateness in the defense motion as virtually guaranteeing that the trial judge would delay a final ruling thereon until jeopardy had attached; had defense counsel afforded the trial judge opportunity to rule on the motion prior to trial, and had the judge failed to avail himself of this opportunity, the belated ruling, after attachment of jeopardy, would have foreclosed the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">And finally, in <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 <em>U. S. </em>564, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>1349, 51 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 642 (1977), the court held that a judgment of acquittal, being a disposition on the merits, entered after a jury had been discharged for failure to agree, barred defendant\u2019s retrial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Sanford, </em>429 <em>U. S. </em>14, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>20, 50 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 17 (1976), was distinguished on the ground that there the jury trial ended in a mistrial without a judgment of acquittal having been entered. The second trial was aborted by way of a pretrial order. Retrial, in <em>Sanford, </em>was not barred since an acquittal had not been granted after jeopardy attached and a jnry never resolved the meritorious issue of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"> With this background in mind, we note that in the present matter the trial judge dismissed the indictment, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>jeopardy attached,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the ground that the proofs the State announced it would produce during trial were, as a matter of law, insufficient for conviction. Nothing in the record suggests, even obliquely, that the trial judge contemplated a second trial of defendant, a consideration deemed critical in <em>Lee, supra. </em>Presentation of the proofs consistent with the State\u2019s representation, on opening and in colloquy of what they would be, was deemed a \u201ccharade\u201d; the judge ruled that \u201cthe indictment is dismissed, the defendant discharged, the case is over.\u201d He advised counsel that he intended to tell the jury \u201cmerely that the State lacked an essential element and so I had to get rid of the case * * The order of dismissal reflected that \u201cdefendants [sic] motion for judgment of acquittal be granted * * We have no doubt from this record that when the trial judge dismissed the indictment, and indeed entered a judgment of acquittal, he regarded his disposition as a final one, favoring defendant, and no further proceedings were being contemplated. The decision was one on the merits. The ruling did not concern a technical insufficiency in the indictment made in the face of overwhelming actual proofs of guilt as in <em>Jenkins. </em>The indictment in the present matter went without challenge; rather, it was the perceived insufficiency of the proffered proofs which underlay the challenged order. We have no doubt but that entry of the order granting defendant\u2019s motion for an acquittal precluded retrial, and hence the State\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"> Moreover, the dismissal of this indictment, occurring during trial, is nonappealable by reason of <em>B. </em>2:3-1 which permits an appeal by the State or, when appropriate, an application of leave to appeal, from a dismissal of an indictment only when such judgment is entered before or after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>trial; by its express terms, the State is prohibited from appealing the dismissal of an indictment during trial. Although we agree with the comment in <em>State v. Laganella, </em>144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>268, 283 (App. Div. 1976), that <em>B. </em>2:3-1 intended a limitation on the State\u2019s right to appeal no broader than the one imposed by the requirements of double jeopardy, we have no doubt that the reason for the broad language insulating dismissals of indictments during trial from appellate review stemmed from recognition that such dismissals almost invariably trigger double jeopardy concerns. The only exception to the rule proscribing second trials after a meritorious disposition of a first one on the merits can be found in <em>United States v. Lee, supra. </em>In <em>Lee </em>the judge dismissed the indictment for a technical insufficiency in circumstances where, it was found, he contemplated further proceedings. Because such was found to have been the trial judge\u2019s intentions, his dismissal was viewed as the functional equivalent of a mistrial declared at defendant\u2019s request and, at its best, touching only a technical matter despite proofs which established defendant\u2019s guilt to the satisfaction of the trial judge. In the present case, as we have noted, the trial judge clearly expressed the finality of his order which, on this record and in light of the meritorious nature of his ruling (right or wrong), cannot with any justification be regarded as the equivalent of a declaration of mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><em>Laganella, supra, </em>also involving a dismissal of an indictment during trial from which the State was permitted an appeal, is, in our view, clearly distinguishable therefrom even were we to agree with its essential holding. The trial judge in <em>Laganella </em>never intended to pass on the essential merits of the State\u2019s case; rather, the dismissal was based upon his perception of the impropriety of the State\u2019s trial strategy. Here, of course, no impropriety on the part of the State played any role in the dismissal; rather, the dismissal was based simply upon the trial judge\u2019s view that the announced State\u2019s proofs were insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number> We are not, however, unmindful of the procedural overlay to the trial court disposition which stemmed from the State\u2019s efforts, before the order dismissing the indictment, to overcome the perceived deficiency of the announced proofs. The refusal of the trial judge to permit the State to supplement its opening statement cannot, and for reasons already given, convert what was clearly intended to be a final disposition of the case on the merits as they were perceived to be, into a mistrial based upon procedural grounds of fairness. Indeed, even were we to view the failure of the trial judge, on his own motion, to mistry the case in order to permit defendant discovery of the State\u2019s newly discovered evidence as a mistaken exercise of his discretion, double jeopardy problems would nonetheless exist. Defendant did not seek a mistrial. Any such declaration would not have been wiih his consent. All defendant wanted was what he obtained \u2014dismissal of the charges and discharge from custody. In <em>Downum v. United States, </em>372 <em>U. S. </em>734, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1033, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 100 (1963), after a jury was selected and sworn, the trial judge granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion that the jury be discharged because a key witness essential to two of six counts was unavailable. <em>Downum, </em>in a 5-4 decision, held that the second trial, in which defendant was convicted of all counts, should not have been held because no \u201cimperious necessity\u201d had compelled the postponement and mistrial. 372 <em>U. S. </em>at 736, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1034, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 102. In this case defendant made no motion for a mistrial. If the judge\u2019s action in dismissing the indictment be viewed as a declaration of mistrial (which we submit it cannot be on the record), then it was done by the judge on his own motion, without defendant\u2019s request or consent, and, we would conclude, would not have been compelled by any \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 <em>U. S. </em>(9 Wheat.) 579, 6 <em>L. Ed. </em>165 (1824). Defendant was not consulted as to his wishes in the matter; he was not asked whether he would prefer to try the case to a conclusion on the State\u2019s supplemental proofs rather than being granted a mistrial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>He never expressed a preference for a mistrial without being asked. His only motion was for a dismissal, <em>i. e., </em>an acquittal, based upon his assertion that the State\u2019s proposed proofs were inadequate for a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u201cIt is basic that a defendant is entitled to have a trial proceed to its normal conclusion.\u201d <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, </em>70 <em>N. J. </em>at 404. This fundamental right cannot be abridged, without a defendant\u2019s consent, by a trial judge\u2019s solicitude for a perceived unfairness to a defendant which defendant may not share. In any event, the propriety of a mistrial, insofar as it may bear on the possibility of a retrial thereafter, should not depend on the \u201cmotivation underlying the trial judge\u2019s action.\u201d <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 <em>U. S. </em>470, 483, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>547, 556, 27 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 543, 555 (1971). Justice Harlan, speaking for the plurality in <em>Jorn, </em>stressed that \u201cthe <em>Perez </em>doctrine of manifest necessity stands as a command to trial judges not to foreclose the defendant\u2019s option until a scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion leads to the conclusion that the ends of public justice would not be served by a continuation of the proceedings.\u201d 400 <em>U. S. </em>at 485, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>557, 27 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The foregoing discussion is based upon the dissenter\u2019s view that the dismissal from which appeal is here being sought was tantamount to a mistrial. We stress our view that the record supports no such conclusion. We only point out that were we not correct in that view, nothing would be changed since manifest necessity for the aborting of the trial was not shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"><em>Laganella </em>points, in justification of its conclusion, to the \u201cpublic interest in seeing that there is a fair trial designed to end in a just and equitable judgment.\u201d <em>State v. Laganella, </em>144 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 290. This observation, indisputably true, however, begs the issue. The highest statement of where the public\u2019s interest lies in regard to retrials of defendants in criminal matters is found in the protection afforded them by the federal and state constitutional guarantees against twice being put in jeopardy for the same of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>fense. The honoring of such guarantees necessarily contemplates instances where a first trial may not have been a fair or equitable one and one in which the ultimate judgment does not fairly reflect the merits. The public\u2019s interest, as defined by these constitutional guarantees, is served by one trial of an accused\u2019s guilt on a charge \u2014 no more. Once a defendant has been placed in jeopardy and there follows a disposition on the merits, fair or unfair, right or wrong, double jeopardy precludes a retrial against a defendant\u2019s wishes. That is the essence of the rights, state and federal, being asserted here which fully reflect the public interest they were designed to serve; diluting them by fine distinctions dependent upon the subjective evaluation of a reviewing court as to the correctness of the ruling which resulted in the premature termination of a first trial, or a trial judge\u2019s alleged abuse of his discretion in mistrying a case, or the correctness of his conclusions, factual or legal, perhaps serves one interest of the public, but at utter sacrifice of the predominant one, that embedded in our organic law as a protection against twice being placed in jeopardy for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Since we conclude that the present appeal, if successful, would require defendant\u2019s retrial of a charge of which he was previously acquitted, it cannot be maintained. There exists, therefore, no necessity for considering the merits of the challenged trial court ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\"><em> United States v.

J. </em>256 (1976); (2) the policies of the protection are far more important than a partieluar label put upon its action by a court, <em>Lee v. United States, </em>432 <em>U. S. </em>23, 30, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>2141, 2146, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 80, 87 (1977) ; <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., supra, </em>430 <em>U. S. </em>at 571, 97 <em>S.

J. </em>531, 539 (1964); (3) the interests involved are not those alone of a defendant but also involve society\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments, <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 <em>U. S. </em>458, 469, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>1066, 35 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 425 (1973); <em>Wade v. Hunter, supra, </em>336 <em>U. S. </em>at 689, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>834; <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, supra, </em>70 <em>N. J. </em>at 406; (4) where there is an imperious necessity to do so defendant\u2019s interest must be subordinated to the public\u2019s interest. <em>Dotmum v. United States, </em>372 <em>U. S. </em>734, 736, <em>83 S. ct. </em>1033, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 100 (1963); <em>Wade v. Hunter, supra, </em>336 <em>U. S. </em>at 689, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>834; (5) defendants have never been held to haA^e an absolute right to be placed in jeopardy only once on any given criminal charge, see <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 <em>U. S. </em>470, 483-484, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>547, 27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>L. Ed. </em>2d 548 (1971), and the Double Jeopardy Clause does not operate mechanistically to mean that once an accused has been put on trial regularly the proceeding must run its ordinary course to judgment or acquittal, <em>State v. Farmer, supra, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>at 174, and (6) the fact that defendant was placed in jeopardy at a first trial \u201cbegins, rather than ends, the inquiry.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Somerville, supra, </em>410 <em>U. S. </em>at 467, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>1066<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">On the issue of double jeopardy, it is principally because I conceive that the majority has prescinded from those considerations and because of its misconception of the nature of the trial court\u2019s action here, <em>i. e., </em>whether or not it was really an \u201cacquittal\u201d of defendant, that I respectfully dissent. I also disagree with the majority on the application of <em>R. </em>2:3-1 (appeals by the State). On that issue I thoroughly agree with Judge Fritz\u2019 analysis of that rule in <em>State v. Laganella, supra, </em>144 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 283-284. The Supreme Court has held that 18 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 3731, which permits the Government to appeal in criminal eases, is meant to pose no greater harrier to such appeals than is posed by the Constitution itself. <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., supra, </em>430 <em>U. S. </em>at 568, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 1352, 51 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 649. Similar considerations apply in the construction of <em>R. </em>2:3 \u2014 1, our counterpart to the federal statute. See <em>Laganella, supra, </em>144 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 284. I do not disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that proof of \u201cknowledge\u201d on defendant\u2019s part is a necessary element of the offense with which he was here charged under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A.-85-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\n<em>The \u201ccircumstances\u201d of this case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The \u201ccircumstances\u201d peculiar to this case are found in the record below. The majority and I view that record dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ferently. That difference presents a fundamental reason why I depart from my colleagues. The majority opinion assumes that the only cognizable opening by the State consisted of what the prosecutor asserted before the luncheon recess\u2014 <em>i. </em>e., that he was unable to prove that defendant had actual knowledge of the commission of the crime by Speight. The majority dismisses out of hand the fact that, after the luncheon recess \u2014 but before any evidence was offered and before the judge ruled on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss \u2014 the prosecutor advised the judge that, at lunch, he had learned that defendant had knowledge of the commission of the crime by Speight and that the State was prepared to offer testimony to that effect. As the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">After lunch Mr. Graves [the assistant prosecutor] represents to us, and <em>I am sure truthfully, </em>that he has been advised that there is available testimony that the defendant Lynch was aware of the commission of the crime because he was present at it. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Defense counsel objected on the ground that he had not been afforded notice or discovery of the State\u2019s intention to prove knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">It would be the utmost technicality to dismiss merely because the State .did not allege it [knowledge] in its opening. I would, as I indicated before, permit the State to reopen all other things being satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">However, the judge further noted that the State, not being-prepared to prove knowledge until after the luncheon recess, \"naturally did not provide any discovery to the defendant of that fact. It would be unfair in the extreme to put the defendant to a trial <em>today </em>on the issue of his knowledge of the actual commission of the crime.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). In addition, the judge stated: \"I would not permit the State because of the lateness of the -notice of this information to proceed with proof\u201d that defendant had actual knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>of the crime. The judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the indictment after this ruling was rendered because, as he said, \u201cI see no point in going through the charade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">It is at once apparent that the trial judge undertook no considered evaluation of the facts. Thus, I view the dismissal of the indictment as nothing more than a ruling that the State could not proceed to prove its case because it failed to provide discovery under <em>B. </em>3:13-3. I consider the action of the trial judge to be a discretionary one, analogous to the grant or denial of a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>B. </em>3:13-3 reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">(f) <em>Continuing Duty to Disclose: Failure to Comply. </em>If * * * during trial a party discovers additional material or witnesses previously requested or ordered subject to discovery or inspection, he shall promptly notify the other party or his attorney of the existence thereof. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, it may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection of materials not previously disclosed, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it deems appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Pursuant to that rule, when the State, at the beginning of the trial and before any evidence was presented, advised the judge that it then had available witnesses to prove defendant\u2019s knowledge of Speight\u2019s commission of the crime, the judge was not limited to proceeding with the trial, as he said, \u201ctoday.\u201d He had the discretion to (1) prohibit the use of the newly available testimony; (2) order the State to advise the defense of the names of the new witnesses; (3) grant a continuance, or (4) declare a mistrial in order to give defendant an opportunity to examine the new evidence and adjourn the trial until defendant had sufficient time.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In my view, the situation confronting the trial judge was not unlike that on the record in <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 <em>U. S. </em>600, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>1075, 47 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 267 (1976), where the trial judge excluded one of defendant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>from the trial as a result of the attorney\u2019s conduct in delivering his opening statement. There the judge had three choices: (1) to stay the trial to allow an application to review the ouster of counsel, (2) continuation of the trial with existing counsel, or (3) a mistrial. See <em>State v. Rechtschafer, </em>supra&gt; 70 <em>N. J. </em>at 409. Here the trial judge had the discretion to adopt any of the choices offered by <em>B. </em>3: 13-3. In <em>Dinitz </em>the trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial and defendant then moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that a retrial would follow, thereby implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause. The motion was denied. The Court of Appeals reversed. Upon <em>certiorari </em>the Supreme Court reinstated the District Court order denying dismissal. Mr! Justice Stewart, writing for the majority,. distinguished between mistrials granted by the judge on his own motion and those granted at defendant\u2019s request. In the latter instance he said that when a defendant moves for the mistrial because of some judicial or prosecutorial error, it is his choice either to run the risk of conviction followed by appeal and reversal, or to obtain the mistrial and later undergo a new trial. He pointed out that if misconduct by the prosecutor or bad faith conduct by the judge brings on the motion for a mistrial, a retrial is barred. Since there was no such improper conduct by the prosecutor or the judge, the 'Supreme Court held that a retrial, ordered by the judge in exercise of his discretion, did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Here, too, when the trial judge was confronted with the choices set forth in <em>B. </em>3:13-3, a discretionary ruling was called for. He exercised that function by refusing to permit the use of the testimony \u2014 this although, as he found, the prosecutor had truthfully advised that the evidence had only been uncovered during the luncheon recess. Thus, as in <em>Dinitz, </em>there was no misconduct which would have prevented a retrial, for the judge found that the prosecutor had acted in entire good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>In his opinion for the court in <em>State v. Rechtschafer, supra, </em>Justice Sehreiber reduced the inquiry on a mistrial issue to the practicalities involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">The common threads that run through the Supreme Court cases are centered about the propriety of the trial court\u2019s granting sua sponte the mistrial and its cause. Did the trial court properly exercise its discretion so that a mistrial was justified? Did it have a viable alternative? If justified, what circumstances created the situation? Was it due to prosecutorial or defense misconduct? Will a second trial accord with the ends of public justice and with proper judicial administration? Will the defendant be prejudiced by a second trial, and if so, to what extent? <em>See State v. Hudson, </em>139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>360 (App. Div. 1976). [70 <em>N. J. </em>at 410-411]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Here, patently, the trial judge had a \"viable alternative\u201d to dismissing the indictment. He could have permitted the amendment of the opening, continued the trial or, if necessary, he could have adjourned it and ordered a new trial at a later date. I therefore consider the dismissal of the indictment to be an abuse of discretion. It was a dismissal only on a procedural ground, not on the merits, and double jeopardy considerations do not bar the State\u2019s appeal. <em>State v. Laganella, supra, </em>144 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 286-288.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The court in <em>Laganella, </em>in an opinion thoroughly discussing the relevant policy considerations, held that dismissal of an indictment on the ground of failure of the State to comply with discovery under <em>R. </em>3 .T3-3 (f) was a mistaken exercise of discretion and double jeopardy considerations did not bar appeal by the State. Compare <em>State v. Farmer, supra, </em>where it was held that declaration of a mistrial in order to afford defendant full discovery was not an abuse of discretion and retrial did not violate the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The majority distinguishes <em>Laganella </em>by noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">The trial judge in <em>Laganella </em>never intended to pass on the essential merits of the State\u2019s case; rather the dismissal was based upon its perception of the impropriety of the State\u2019s trial strategy. Here, of course, no impropriety on the part of the State played any role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>in the dismissal; rather the dismissal was based simply upon the court\u2019s view that the announced State\u2019s proofs were insufficient as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">I submit that the dismissal here was not on the merits any more than was the dismissal in <em>Laganella. </em>The decision of the trial judge here, stripped of its label of \u201cacquittal\u201d (see below), was not based on the ground that \u201cthe State\u2019s proofs were insufficient as a matter of law.\u201d Rather, the proofs of the State, as proffered by the prosecutor after the luncheon recess, were precluded by the judge\u2019s action, rather than considered insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The leading case of <em>United States v. Perez, supra, </em>holds that a court has the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict \u201cwhenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated,\u201d and a second trial is not barred by double jeopardy considerations. 22 <em>U. S. </em>(9 Wheat.) at 580. In my view, the circumstances of this case make it evident that a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for mistrial existed and the ends of \u201cpublic justice\u201d \u2014 <em>i. e., </em>the State\u2019s right to obtain a just judgment and to bring criminal defendants to trial \u2014 were frustrated by the precipitous dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\n<em>Was the judgment below a true \u201cacquittal\"?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The majority asserts that the dismissal of the indictment is \u201cthe exact equivalent of an acquittal\u201d and the \u201cdecision was one on the merits.\u201d Though the trial judge\u2019s decision on defendant\u2019s motion was merely a dismissal of the indictment, the judgment entered does call it an \u201cacquittal.\u201d But in this area we are not concerned with the label or the form of the court\u2019s action. <em>Lee v. United States, supra, </em>432 <em>U. S. </em>23, 30, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>2141, 2146, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>80, 87; <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., supra, </em>430 <em>U.

Currie, supra, </em>41 <em>N. J. </em>531, 539. In my view, the dismissal was neither an acquittal nor a judgment on the merits, for it was not a resolution of the factual elements of the offense charged. The majority cites <em>Martin Linen Supply Co. </em>for the principle that \u201ca judgment of acquittal being a disposition on the merits after a jury had been discharged for failure to agree, barred defendant\u2019s retrial.\u201d True. But the majority fails to state that Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion in <em>Martin Linen </em>clearly demonstrates what an acquittal is \u2014 a <em>resolution </em>of some or all of the <em>factual elements </em>of the offense charged. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">* * <em>* </em>we must determine whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents <em>a resolution, </em>correct or not, of some or all <em>of the factual elements </em>of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">There can be no question that the judgments of acquittal entered here by the District Court were \u201cacquittals\u201d in substance as well as form. The District Court plainly granted the Rule 29(c) motion on the view that the Government <em>had not proved facts </em>constituting criminal contempt. * * * In entering the judgments of acquittal, the Court also recorded its view that \u201cthe Government has failed to prove the material allegations beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and that \u201cdefendant should be found \u2018not guilty.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">Thus, it is plain that the District Court in this case evaluated the government\u2019s evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction. [430 U. S. at 571, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 1354, 51 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 651; emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">And, in his concurring opinion, Justice Stevens noted with reference to the Senate Report on the Criminal Appeals Act of 1970:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">* * * the Committee believed that the Constitution barred any appeal from an acquittal or from a dismissal amounting to an acquittal; \u201c[a] <em>true acquittal is based upon the insufficiency of the evidence to prove an element of the offense.\u201d </em>Id., at 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">The same understanding was demonstrated by the bill\u2019s sponsor when he presented the Senate Report on the floor. He summarized the bill as providing that \u201cthe Government has the right to appeal any ruling by a district court in a criminal ease which dismisses a prosecution in favor of a defendant except where the ruling is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>acquittal\u201d; he also presented a letter from the Solicitor General explaining that the bill would allow \u201can appeal from any dismissal except one amounting to a \u2018judgment of acquittal,\u2019 <em>i. e., a factual judgment that the defendant is mot guilty of the crime charged and is thereby entitled to protection against double jeopardy.\" </em>116 <em>Cong. </em>Rec. 35659 (1970).

In support of that position the cases of <em>United States v. Wilson, supra; United States v. Jenkins, supra, </em>and <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 <em>U. S. </em>377, 95 <em>S.

The reasoning is that, in the event of such successful appeal, there would be simply a reinstatement of the guilty verdict originally found against defendant and thus no second trial. But neither <em>Wilson </em>nor <em>Jenkins </em>reaches the question presented here because (a) they do not involve what I consider a discretionary action of the trial judge in dismissing an indictment; (b) in both cases the dismissal occurred after presentation of all the evidence, and (c) they do not reach the question whether, in such a context, where the successful appeal by the government may result in retrial \u2014 as in mistrial or analogous cases\u2014 double jeopardy policies would be offended. In this case there has been no trial, no evidence has been introduced against defendant and there has been no resolution of any of the factual issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In <em>Jenkins, </em>where the Supreme Court held that the government\u2019s appeal was barred by double jeopardy considerations, the court noted that the District Court had grounded its post-trial dismissal on findings of fact based on the evidence which resolved against defendant many (but not all) of the factual elements of the crime involved. 420 <em>U. S. </em>at 367, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>1006. It was in this context that the court held that defendant could not be put to trial for the second time to defend against those same facts. Defendant in the present case has not been subjected to any trial where evidence has been introduced against him or where any of the essential elements of the crime have been resolved either for or against him by the trier of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In <em>8 erf ass </em>the Supreme Court held that the government\u2019s appeal from a pretrial dismissal of the indictment against him was not barred. There the allowance of the appeal was permitted simply because, since the dismissal was in a pretrial order, and since defendant had not yet \u201cbeen put to trial before the trier of the facts,\u201d jeopardy had not attached. As Chief Justice Burger put it, \u201c[A]n accused must suffer jeopardy before he can suffer double jeopardy.\u201d 420 <em>U. S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>at 393, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 1065. I fail to see the relevance of the <em>8 erf ass </em>holding to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">With reference to the <em>Wilson-Jenhins-Serfass </em>trilogy, the majority opinion states: \u201cNothing in any of these cases suggests that a trial error favoring a defendant could be corrected on the State\u2019s appeal if the successful result of the appeal would be defendant\u2019s retrial.\u201d That is true, but neither do any of those cases suggest that where a trial judge takes discretionary action and invokes the signposts of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d and \u201cpublic justice\u201d \u2014 as I conceive the situation to be here \u2014 the government\u2019s appeal would be barred. To apply such a rigid rule that would bar any appeal by the State which may result in a retrial would be an \u201cunconscionable result.\u201d <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, supra, </em>70 <em>N. J. </em>at 405. Similarly, in <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">The double-jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment, however, does not mean that every time a defendant is put to trial before a competent tribunal he is entitled to go free if the trial fails to end in a final judgment. Such a rule would create an insuperable obstacle to the administration of justice in many eases in which there is no semblance of the type of oppressive practices at which the double-jeopardy prohibition is aimed. [336 <em>U. S. </em>at 688-689, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 837]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">See also, <em>United States v. Jorn, supra, </em>400 <em>U. S. </em>at 484, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>547, and <em>State v. Farmer, supra, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Further, I conceive that the majority attaches an inordinate conclusive significance to the time that \u201cjeopardy attaches,\u201d as though, that event having happened, the double jeopardy problem is solved and there can be no retrial after dismissal. But as said in <em>Serfass v. United States, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">It is true that we have disparaged \u201crigid, mechanical\u201d rules in the interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458, 467, 93 S. Ct. 1066, 35 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1973). However, we also observed in that case that \u201cthe conclusion that jeopardy has attached begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.\u201d Ibid. Cf. United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. at 303, 90 S. Ct. 2117, 26 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>608. Implicit in the latter statement is the premise that the \u201cconstitutional polices underpinning the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee\u201d are not implicated before that point in the proceedings at which \u201cjeopardy attaches.\u201d United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. at 480, 91 S. Ct. 547, 27 L. Ed. 2d 543. As we have noted above, the Court has consistently adhered to the view that jeopardy does not attach until a defendant is \u201cput to trial before the trier of the facts, whether the trier be a jury or a judge.\u201d Id., at 479, 27 L. Ed 2d 543.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">This is by no means a mere technicality, nor is it a \u201crigid, mer chanical\u201d rule. It is, of course, like most legal rules, an attempt to impart content to an abstraction. [420 <em>U. S. </em>at 390-391, 95 S. <em>Ct. </em>at 1064]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Defendant here has never been \u201cput to trial before the trier of the facts,\u201d for, as said above, there has been no resolution of any of the fact issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Further, I read <em>Lee v. United States, supra, 432 U. S. 23, </em>97 <em>S. Ct. </em>2141, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 80, as refuting the contention of the majority that, once jeopardy attaches with a dismissal following, a retrial is barred. <em>Lee </em>was a bench trial. Therefore jeopardy attached when the court began to hear evidence. <em>Serfass v. United States, supra, </em>420 <em>U. S. </em>at 488, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>1055. After the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement defense counsel moved to dismiss the information. The trial judge reserved decision and the government presented its case consisting of the testimony of two witnesses. The judge then recessed for 15 minutes. After the recess, defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the prosecution had failed to establish an essential element of the offense. Thereupon the judge granted defendant\u2019s initial motion to dismiss because of the failure of the information to charge knowledge or intent. Lee was later indicted for the same offense. On substantially the same evidence as was presented on the first trial he was convicted. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, rejecting Lee\u2019s claim that the second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. 539 <em>F. </em>2d 612 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">On <em>certiorari </em>the Supreme Court affirmed. One of the principal arguments by Lee was - that once the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>determined to hear evidence in the first trial, he was entitled to have it proceed to a formal finding of guilt or innocence. Therefore he argued that the conviction on the second trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Justice Powell, writing for the majority, cited <em>United States v. Dinitz, supra, </em>for the proposition that where circumstances develop not attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a motion by defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution. 432 <em>U. S. </em>at 32, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2147, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 89. The court emphasized that both in <em>Dinitz </em>and in <em>Lee </em>the proceedings were terminated at defendant\u2019s request. The court reiterated the <em>Dinitz </em>principle that there was no double jeopardy barrier to petitioner\u2019s retrial unless the judicial or prosecutorial error that prompted defendant\u2019s motion was \u201cintended to provoke\u201d the motion or was otherwise \u201cmotivated\u201d by bad faith or undertaken to \u201charass\u201d or \u201cprejudice\u201d defendant. <em>Id., </em>432 <em>U. S. </em>at 32, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2147, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 89. Since the errors in the first <em>Lee </em>trial were not the product of the kind of overreaching outlined in <em>Dinitz, </em>but were, at most, mere negligence, the court held that <em>Lee\u2019s </em>second trial did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">This case is strikingly similar to <em>Lee. </em>In both cases: (1) jeopardy had attached when the dismissal was entered; (2) the trial was peremptorily terminated at defendant\u2019s request by reason of his motion. I view <em>Lee </em>as refuting the majority\u2019s contention that a dismissal after jeopardy has attached bars a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>Balancing society\u2019s interests against those of defendant in the circumstances of this case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Further citation is not needed to restate the policy considerations in applying the Double Jeopardy Clause. Suffice to say that the competing interests of society and the defendant are to be weighed in striking a balance not offensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>to the Clause. <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, supra, </em>70 <em>N. J. </em>at 405. Defendant\u2019s \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.\u201d <em>Wade v. Hunter, supra, </em>336 <em>U. S. </em>at 689, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 837. As we have said above, balanced against the interests of defendant is the right of the State to bring criminals to trial in the interests of public justice. <em>Illinois v. Somerville, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Thus we ask: in reality, what harassment would reversal of the dismissal of the indictment here impose upon defendant? \u201cHarassment is not a synonym for inconvenience. All repeated prosecutions distress defendants. Harassment, at least in double jeopardy law, involves misconduct by the prosecutor as well as hardship to the defendant.\u201d Comment, \u201cTwice in Jeopardy,\u201d 75 <em>Yale Law J. </em>262, 286 (1975). It has been noted that reprosecution burdens and disadvantages defendant more after he has had a full trial than if it ends prematurely. Comment, \u201cTwice in Jeopardy,\u201d <em>supra </em>at 288. The brevity of the first trial is a factor in determining whether a retrial should be barred. <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 <em>U. S. </em>364, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>1523, 6 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 901 (1961); <em>State v. Farmer, supra, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>at 184. In the Circuit Court opinion in <em>Gori </em>the brevity of the trial was noted and the court said that \u201cfor the defendant to receive absolution for his crime, later proven quite completely, because the judge acted too hastily in his interest, would be an injustice to the public in the particular case and a dangerous precedent for the future.\u201d <em>United States v. Gori, </em>282 <em>F. </em>2d 43, 48 (2 Cir. 1960). Except for the fact that defendant\u2019s guilt in the present case has not yet been proven, the statement is relevant here. The State should not be deprived of the opportunity to prove it by barring retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">I would submit that Justice Clark\u2019s dissent in the 5-4 decision of <em>Downum v. United States, supra, </em>suggests the proper principle to be applied in measuring the ineon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>venience to which defendant would be put in the event of retrial: &lt;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">As I see the problem, the issue is whether the action of the prosecutor in failing to check on the presence of his witness before allowing a jury to be sworn was of such moment that it constituted a dcprival of the petitioner\u2019s rights and entitled him to a verdict of acquittal without any trial on the merits. Obviously under the facts here he suffered no such deprivation. Ever since Perez this Court has recognized that the \u201cends of public justice\u201d must be considered in determining such a question. 9 Wheat., at 580. In this light I cannot see how this Court finds that the trial judge abused his discretion in affording the Government a two-day period in which to bring forward its key witness who, to its surprise, was found to be temporarily absent. I believe that the \u201cends of public justice,\u201d to which Mr. Justice Story referred in Perez, require that the Government have a fair opportunity to present the people\u2019s case and obtain adjudication on the merits, rather than that the criminal be turned free because of the harmless oversight of the prosecutor. [372 <em>U. S. </em>at 743, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 1038]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Here the opening by the State had taken only a relatively short time. The degree of defendant\u2019s \u201charassment\u201d by a second trial would be minimal considering the relatively slight exposure he had at the first trial. In this case I consider that Ms right to have the trial completed was subordinate to the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in a just judgment. Since the questions of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d and \u201cpublic justice\u201d depend on the circumstances of each case, I feel that the circumstances here demonstrate that both factors required the trial judge to deny defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and to either permit amendment of the the State\u2019s opening, declare a mistrial, or grant a continuance or adjournment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">For the foregoing reasons I would reverse the dismissal and order a new trial to be scheduled after the State has fully complied with the discovery rule. <em>B. </em>3:13 \u2014 3.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> And also Justice Rehnquist\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Lee v.
