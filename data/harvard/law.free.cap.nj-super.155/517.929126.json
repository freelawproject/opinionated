Appellant, acting through its Commissioner of the Department of Public Works, contended that O\u2019Connor was not qualified for the position because he did not meet the requirements set forth in the Civil Service announcement. Both O\u2019Connor and appellant were permitted to argue the issue through submission of written facts to the Commission. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>requested a hearing, but respondent denied the request and after considering the material submitted found that O\u2019Con-nor was qualified for the position. The sole issue on appeal is whether appellant was entitled to a full, trial-type hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">While appellant contends that it is entitled to a hearing, it cites no case, statute, regulation or other authority in support of its position. It is respondent\u2019s position that at most appellant was entitled to consideration on the written record. As authority, respondent cites <em>N. J. S. A. </em>11:23-2, which provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">The chief examiner and secretary may refuse to examine an applicant, or after examination to certify an eligible who;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">a. Lacks any of the established preliminary requirements for examination or position or employment for which he applies * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">With respect to appeals, this statute states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">* * *' [w]hen the chief examiner and secretary refuses [sic] to examine an applicant or after examination to certify an eligible, the Civil Service Commission shall afford such person an opportunity to submit facts for consideration in a review of the refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Eespondent contends that since a candidate has no right to a hearing when he is not certified, then certainly the appointing authority has no right to a formal hearing when an applicant is certified. Eespondent particularly points out that this portion of the statute has been amended, and prior to amendment it required the Commission to grant a hearing to an applicant who had not been certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">We agree. Prior to 1966 <em>N. J. S. A. </em>11:23-2 provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-12\">When the commission refuses to examine an applicant or after examination to certify an eligible, it shall, upon request of such person, grant a hearing upon the cause of such refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">That the statute has been amended to allow only submission of facts indicates the Legislature\u2019s clear intent to not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>hearings when the issue consists of the qualifications of a candidate for a Civil Service position.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>11:23-2, as it now exists, had the Commission accepted appellant\u2019s objections and found O\u2019Connor not qualified for the position, O\u2019Connor would only have been entitled to \u201csubmit facts\u201d to contest that decision. It follows, therefore, that appellant also is only entitled to submit facts, as it did, since there is no reason why an appointing authority should have greater procedural rights than an applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We take time to comment on what counsel for appellant suggests is a brief. There is no separate \u201cprocedural history\u201d incorporated therein, contrary to <em>B. </em>2:6-2. The argument contained therein cites no law, ease or statutory, but merely states appellant\u2019s position, apparently leaving to us or to respondent the task of making the legal investigation which might possibly support appellant\u2019s asserted position. We have seriously considered suppressing the so-called brief, <em>State v. Hild, </em>148 <em>N. J. Super. </em>294 (App. Div. 1977), or imposing a fine upon appellant\u2019s counsel, <em>Miraph Ent., Inc. v. Paterson Bd. of Alco. Bev., </em>150 <em>N. J. Super. </em>504 (App. Div. 1977). However, we feel, in the final analysis, that these comments may constitute sufficient warning to said attorney for his benefit in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
