J. Super. </em>495 (Ch. Div. 1976). The defendants were enjoined \"from withholding in concert, the performance of their assigned extracurricular duties for the 1976-1977 academic year.\u201d The issue thereby resolved now being moot, the appeal from that part of the order under review is dismissed. <em>Hughes v. Eisner, </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>228 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Defendants also appeal from so much of the order below which denied relief on their counterclaim for declaratory judgment that teachers are not required to perform extracurricular and co-curricular functions .and that they may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>refuse to do so if they choose. The trial judge\u2019s action was based on the conclusions that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">* s- * extracurricular activities are an integral part of a child\u2019s education and are incorporated into the duty to properly teach; that local boards of education may assign said activities within reason, and may require their performance; and that such assignments may be made without additional compensation. <em>[Asbury Park Bd. of Ed. v. Asbury Park Ed. Assn, supra </em>145 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 506]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"> We sustain the trial court\u2019s denial of declaratory judgment, not for the reasons given, hut because the judge should not have undertaken to decide the underlying issue in this action. Although the original dispute was cognizable in the Superior Court, the question of extracurricular duties lay within the special competence of the Public Employees Relations Commission (PERC). <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34 :13A-5.2, 5.4(d). Its expertise was available, and under the doctrine of primai-y jurisdiction, which is concerned with \u201cpromoting the proper relationship between the courts and administrative agencies charg\u00e9d with particular regulatory\u2019duties,\u201d this important issue should have been -transferred, to that administrative body. <em>Patrolman\u2019s Benev.
