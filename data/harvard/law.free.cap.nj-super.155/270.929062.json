BRAYTON BUTLER, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b294-5\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b294-6\">Submitted January 3, 1978</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKm4\">Decided January 13, 1978.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Before Judges AlIjCOBn, Morgan and Horn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-6\"><em>Mr. Stanley C. Van Ness, </em>Public Defender, attorney for appellant <em>(Mr. Edward J. Dimon, </em>Assistant Deputy Public Defender, of counsel and on the brief).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-7\"><em>Mr. William F. Hyland, </em>Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney for respondent <em>(Mr. Philip B.

Neither contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitution of the jury came too late; it was not interposed until after the conclusion of defendant\u2019s ease. A challenge to the array must be made before any individual juror is examined. <em>R. </em>1:8-3 (b). See also, <em>R. </em>3:6-2. Relaxation of that rule should only be granted where a prima facie showing of actual prejudice to the right of a defendant to a fair and impartial jury has been made. <em>R. </em>1 :l-2. None has even been alleged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Moreover, even were we to consider the issue, we would hold it to be without merit. Students, if they can be considered a \u201cclass\u201d at all, are not, in our view, a \u201ccognizable group\u201d exclusion of which will rob a petit, or grand, jury of its cross-sectional quality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As vividly expounded in <em>State v. Porro, </em>152 <em>N. J. Super. </em>259 (Law Div. 1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Hence,' is not a student the embodiment of a cross-section of several identifiable- classes present in the community? A student may be 18 or 45. A student may be male or female; black or white. The definition of a student as one engaged in a course of study defies further definition. The possibilities raised by such a definition are many. This court sees no common bond existing between a student of nuclear physics and a student of the arts, a student of modern languages and a student of air-conditioning and refrigeration, and a student of theology and a student of the ballet \u2014 other than the pursuit of study. It is for these reasons that the court must find that students do not constitute a cognizable class of constitutional dimensions whereby their exclusion would deprive defendants of indictment by a grand jury of integrity, representative of a valid cross-section of the community. * * * [at 272]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Although defendant did not address any specific argument to the alleged exclusion of clergymen, the remarks pertaining to the excluded students apply as well to clergymen.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We also find defendant\u2019s assertion concerning the quantum of the sentence imposed to be without merit, warranting no interference by this court. Although only 20 years of age, defendant has a substantial juvenile record. When 16 years of age, he was tried, as an adult, for murder. It was only months after his release from -custody on that charge that he was arrested on the present charge of armed robbery. We respect the reasons given by the trial judge for the sentence imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">* <em>* </em>* Defendant previously involved in armed robbery during which a killing ensued; defendant manifests violent propensities and utter disregard of the rules of society; past rehabilitation efforts have failed; punishment is required for the safety of the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">We do not find the sentence excessive or unduly punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-11\"> Defendant did not allego tliat all students were automatically excluded from petit jury service, but only non-working students and those attending out-of-state schools.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
