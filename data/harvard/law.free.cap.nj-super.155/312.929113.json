A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AV1\">This is an appeal from the denial of unemployment compensation based upon appellant\u2019s status as an alien not authorized to be employed gainfully in this country. Appellant had worked for respondent Juliet Footwear Co., Inc. for almost three years until May 21, 1976 when she was laid off for lack of work. Because she did not provide an alien registration card or any proof that she could lawfully work in this country it was determined that she was unavailable for work within the meaning of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-4(e) and, therefore, ineligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">At the hearing before the Appeal Tribunal an interpreter was used because appellant did not speak English. The Appeals Examiner sought testimony from appellant as to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>country of origin, her citizenship and, if not a citizen of the United States, as to her right to work in this country. Upon advice of counsel appellant refused to answer these questions. Counsel asserted, as he does here, that the questions were irrelevant to appellant\u2019s availability to work and that the inquiry violated appellant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The agency below at three successive levels denied appellant\u2019s claim for her failure to demonstrate that she is available for work. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-4(c). We have this day held, in <em>Pinilla v. Board of Review, </em>155 <em>N. J. Super. 307, </em>that an alien who has a nonimmigrant status without authorization to become gainfully employed is disqualified from obtaining unemployment benefits based upon unauthorized employment. Appellant\u2019s failure to testify about her status permits the inference that she cannot successfully support her right to work. See <em>Alonso v. </em>California, 50 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 242, 123 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>536 (D. Ct. App. 1975) <em>cert. </em>den.. 425 <em>U. S. </em>903, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>1492, 47 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 752 (1976). This being a civil proceeding, the adverse inference is permissible without offending appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <em>Duratron Corp. v. Republic Stuyvesant Corp., </em>95 <em>N. J. Super. </em>527, 531 (App. Div.), certif. den. 50 <em>N. J. </em>404 (1967). Nor does this inference offend appellant\u2019s due process and equal protection rights. The. burden is on the claimant to establish the right to compensation. <em>Zielenski v. Board of Review, </em>85 <em>N. J. Super. </em>46, 51 (App. Div. 1964); <em>DiMicele v. General Motors </em>Corp., 53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>167, 171 (App. Div. 1958), aff\u2019d 29 <em>N. J. </em>427 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">As demonstrated in <em>Pinilla v. Board of Review, supra, </em>this result is consonant with and is not preempted by federal statutes and regulations. See <em>DeCanas v. Bica, </em>424 <em>U. S. </em>351, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>933, 47 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 43 (1976). We acknowledge that aliens have certain rights. But an illegal alien or an alien who is here as a temporary visitor for pleasure and without authority to become gainfully employed cannot lawfully work. <em>Londono v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>433 <em>F. </em>2d 635, 636 (2 Cir. 1970). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>There is no constitutional right to work illegally. <em>Pilapil v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>424 <em>F. </em>2d 6, 11 (10 Cir.), <em>cert. </em>den. 400 <em>U. S. </em>908, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>152, 27 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 147 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The denial of unemployment benefits is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
