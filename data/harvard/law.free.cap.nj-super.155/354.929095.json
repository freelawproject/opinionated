(Vornado), a New Jersey corporation, was convicted in the Brick Township Municipal Court and in a subsequent trial <em>de novo </em>in the Ocean County Court, of violating <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :170-90.1, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\"><em>Bmployer requiring lie detector test as a condition of employment. </em>Any person who as an employer shall <em>influence, </em>request or require an employee to take or submit to a lie detector test as a condition of employment or continued employment, is a disorderly person. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Specifically, the judge at the trial <em>de novo </em>found that defendant\u2019s supervisory employees had exerted \"psychological influence\u201d upon employee Doreen Layton to take a polygraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>(lie detector) test, and that, as -a result of Ms., Layton\u2019s refusal to take the test, defendant terminated her employment. Yornado was fined $250 for the violation, plus court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In November 1974 security employees at the Brick Township Two Guys store discovered a large, number of price tags, which had been removed from various articles of merchandise, hidden in the security personnel locker area of the store. Later the same day two employees approached the assistant store security manager, Tom Conklin, and offered to take polygraph tests. At a party given by the store security manager the following evening the theft was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Thereafter John Pontana, the Brick Township store supervisor, contacted James Smith, Yornado security supervisor, and explained to Mm that certain employees had requested that they be given polygraph tests. On November 26, 1974 Smith arrived at the store with a polygraph machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">On that date Smith, individually questioned various security employees, including employee Layton, about the theft. Shortly after leaving the security office Layton was confronted by her supervisor, Ms. Dosois, who asked her why she had balked at the request to take the test. Dosois told Layton she \u201cwished\u201d all security personnel - would take the test because the incident was causing unrest in the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">A few days later supervisors, Pontana, Conklin and Dosois summoned Layton to the security office. Store supervisor Pontana told Layton she was being transferred to a different store to remove the \u201ccloud\u201d from the department. Layton did not report to her new assignment and as a result was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Defendant Yornado challenges tMs conviction on two similar grounds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">I. There can be no conviction under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-90.1 if no lie detector test is taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">II. The essential element of \u201cinfluence\u201d under the statute requires a finding that the employer\u2019s action affect the employee in such a manner that he submits to the test under such \u201cinfluence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The statute on its face resists the construction argued by defendant. The essence of the offense is the influence, request or requirement flowing from the employer or its agents. There is no statutory requirement that a polygraph test actually be administered before a violation occurs. Clearly, the Legislature meant to prevent direct or indirect psychological pressures to submit to testing, not simply to punish administration of polygraph tests actually conducted. The employee does not have to succumb before the statute is violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Defendant Vornado\u2019s contention that the word \u201cinfluence\u201d requires an employee\u2019s submission to a polygraph is untenable. In <em>State v. Community Distributors, </em>123 <em>N. J. Super. </em>589 (Cty. Ct. 1973), aff\u2019d 64 <em>N. J. </em>479 (1974), Judge Aildns correctly described the term \u201cinfluence\u201d as the \u201cbroadest\u201d of the three terms and defined it by the generally accepted moaning. 123 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 595-597.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">INFLUENCE refers to power exerted over others, often through high position, strength of intellect, force of character, or degree of accomplishment, sometimes exercised unconsciously and felt insensibly, sometimes consciously or calculated brought to bear. . . . <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Also, it should be noted that the Supreme Court specifically distinguished New Jersey\u2019s statute from similar laws of other states because of its inclusiveness. <em>State v. Community Distributors, supra, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>at 485. See also, <em>State v. Berkey Photograph, Inc., </em>150 <em>N. J. Super. </em>56 (App. Div. 1977). In fact, New Jersey\u2019s statute is the most comprehensive ban of such activity in the nation. Note, \u201cThe Polygraph and Pre-Employment Screening,\u201d 13 <em>Houston L. Rev. </em>551, 557-558, 563-566 (1976); Note, \u201cLie Detectors in the Employment Context,\u201d 35 <em>La. L. Rev. </em>694, 701 (1975); Note, \u201cThe Working Man\u2019s Nemesis \u2014- The Polygraph,\u201d 6 <em>N. C. Central </em>94, 105 (1974). At least 17 jurisdictions now ban employment related polygraph examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The trial judge\u2019s finding that Vornado influenced employee Layton to take a polygraph test as a condition of continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>employment is fully supported by the evidence. We conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct falls squarely within the statutory prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
