The issue should be tried by a jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-26\"><em>Everett Day, </em>a free man of colour, was indicted in the Circuit Superior Court of <em>Chesterfield, </em>for an attempt to commit a rape upon <em>Mary Slade. </em>When brought to the bar he filed a plea in abatement, that <em>Ethrall Hancock, </em>one of the grand jurors, upon the panel which found the indictment against him \u201c a true bill,\u201d was a surveyor of a highway within the county of <em>Chesterfield, </em>at the time. the said true bill was found against him. The attorney for the Commonwealth took issue upon this plea; and the Court, without empaneling a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>jury to try the issue, overruled the plea, and thereupon the prisoner pleaded not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aluh\">Several exceptions were taken by the prisoner to opinions of the Court overruling his objections to persons called upon the jury, but as they were not considered by this Court it is unnecessary to notice them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Avt\">The result of the trial was a verdict of guilty, and the judgment of the Court that the prisoner should be hanged.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACP\">From this judgment, the prisoner obtained a writ of error to this Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-8\"><em>French, </em>for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-9\"><em>The Attorney General, </em>for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b583-10\">Smith, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A2qb\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">It appears from the record in this case, that the prisoner was permitted to file a plea in abatement, to which the attorney for the Commonwealth replied <em>generally; </em>and that the issue thus joined, was decided by the Court against the prisoner. This issue, so joined, not being an issue in law, but of fact, ought to have been submitted to a jury for trial; and it is the unanimous opinion of this Court, that for this error the judgment must be reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial. It has been deemed unnecessary to consider or decide any of the other points raised by the several bills of exceptions, as they cannot arise on the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Judgment reversed, and new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
