When in cases of this sort an appeal is prayed, all the facts are examined into <em>de novo </em>in the Superior Court; so that the statement of this fact upon the record, could not have availed the person petitioning, since he must still have proved it; neither can the omission of the Clerk in not stating the fact upon the record, render such proof unnecessary here. If it had been stated, it might have been disproved in this Court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b54-14\">The Court being equally divided,</p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">The judgment was affirmed\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
