In an action of <em>assumpsit </em>for the purchase money, the defendant, by way of estoppel, relies upon the acknowledgment in the deed; and the plaintiffs, believing that the estoppel will prevent their recovery at law, dismiss their action, and file a bill in equity against the purchaser. Held, they are entitled to the aid of a court of equity. <em>Accord.

The prayer of the bill was, that <em>High </em>should be decreed to pay the said purchase money with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\"><em>High </em>admitted in his answer, that he did defend himself in the action at law, as stated in the bill; but he did not pretend that the consideration money had in truth been paid, and it clearly appeared that no payment thereof had been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">Other grounds were taken in the answer against the claim of the plaintiffs, which, in the opinion of the circuit court, were sufficient; and that court accordingly decreed that the bill be dismissed, and that the complainants pay to the defendant his costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">From this decree an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-7\">The cause was submitted without argument, by <em>WiL liam A.

The court, without deciding whether this defence ought to have availed at law, is of opinion that in this case it is not for the appellee to say it ought not, while he enjoys the benefit of the successful use of it at law; and that the decree dismissing the bill is erroneous. Therefore the decree is reversed with costs. And this court proceeding-to render such decree as the court below ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>to have rendered, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed that the appellants recover of the appellee the sum of 91 dollars 50 cents with interest thereon from the 10th of March 1836 till paid, and the costs by them expended in the superior court in the prosecution of their suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
