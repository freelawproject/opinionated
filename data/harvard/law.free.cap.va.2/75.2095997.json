But in either case, notice of the taking of it ought to have been given to the defendant; and as none is stated in the record, the judgment is, for that reason, erroneous, and must be reversed, unless the appellee\u2019s counsel supposes he can shew that notice was given, and that the deposition was taken in chief, and prays a <em>certiorari </em>for the purpose, which, if asked for, will be ^granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">, The appellee\u2019s counsel declined taking a certiorari, and the judgment was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\"><em>Note. </em>\u2014 After the President had delivered the opinion of the Court, <em>Washington </em>moved to dismiss the appeal, no appearance having been entered for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">By the Court.-t-You might have dismissed the appeal before the record was opened, but it is now too late.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-12\">(1) <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Taliaferro, Stuart &amp; Co. </em>4 Munf. 80.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
