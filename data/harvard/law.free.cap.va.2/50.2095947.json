I. p. 92,) <em>Dundass </em>moved the County Court of <em>Fairfax </em>to quash the first execution and replevy bond, principally, because the former issued without his order, or permission, and was unfairly executed. The County Court quashed the execution and replevy bond, from which an appeal was entered by Taylor, after having stated the grounds of it in a bill of exceptions, made part of the record. The substantial parts of the bill are, that it appeared in evidence to the Court, that <em>Dundass </em>was in <em>Philadelphia </em>at the time the execution issued. That it was done at the request of Taylor, but in the presence of, and with the assent of Mr. Lee, (who had been attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>for <em>Dundass, </em>in a suit in Chancery brought to injom the judgment obtained at law by <em>Dundass, </em>but who was not his attorney in that cause,) and that of Mr. Hepburn, the partner and father in law of <em>Dundass: </em>but that the debt in question belonged exclusively to Dundass, having been due to him before either of the above connections took place with <em>Hepburn, </em>who had no authority from <em>Dundass </em>to transact this business. That after <em>Dundass </em>returned from <em>Philadelphia, </em>he gave notice to <em>Taylor, </em>and to the attorney of <em>Hendricks, </em>that he should appeal to the County Court of <em>Fairfax </em>from the opinion of the Commissioners who took the replevy bond, and should move the Court, to adjudge 'the security taken by them insufficient, and further to do whatever the law should authorise in that behalf, to the end, that the said debt and costs might be satisfied. But that no motion was made, or other proceedings had under that notice. That the agent of <em>Taylor, </em>who pursued <em>Hendricks </em>into the county of <em>Cumberland, </em>informed the Commissioners, that <em>James </em>and <em>John Hendricks </em>had left <em>Alexandria </em>greatly in debt, and were considered as bankrupts, but did not inform them that he was the agent of <em>Taylor.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-8\">The District Court of <em>Dumfries </em>affirmed the judgment of the County Court, after examining witnesses, whose testimony is also made part of the record. The amount of the evidence is, that the person who was sent into <em>Cumberland </em>County by <em>Taylor </em>with the execution, went with the permission of <em>Hepburn, </em>and that <em>Hepburn </em>and <em>Dundass </em>never intermeddled in the separate business of each other.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-9\"><em>Campbell, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-10\">I doubt the power of any Court to set aside a replevy bond, on account of the insufficiency of the security, unless the mode of proceeding, by an appeal from the opinion of the Commissioners, which is specially authorised by the Act of Assembly, be pursued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-11\">At all events I contend, that a bond taken under the direction, and with the approbation of those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>by the law are constituted Judges for this purpose, will be considered as valid until the contrary No presumption can lie against the acts of persons thus constituted, and if a Court undertake to annul them, the reasons ought plainly to appear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-5\">This record exhibits but a single ground, and therefore it will be supposed that none other was urged, or proved ; it is, that the execution issued without authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-6\">This is a mere dispute about a fact, and therefore the Court must decide according to the ordinary rules of evidence. The mind cannot, after a view of the testimony stated in the record, withhold its assent from this truth; that the execution was ordered by persons having special, or general authority from <em>Dundass </em>to act as they did. The attorney, and the father-in-law and partner, in the absence of the plaintiff, place themselves in his stead \u00a7 from the relative situation of the parties, such a power is fairly <em>to </em>be presumed. But that which confirms this presumption to the satisfaction of the most incredulous mind is, that after <em>Dundass </em>returned home, instead of disavowing the act as unauthorised, he recognises it, and takes steps, not to avoid the proceedings, but to affirm the execution, and to obtain better security under the Act of 1787.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Now if the original act was not his, he should not have taken it up where he found it, but should have protested against it from the beginning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-7\">This solemn recognition does completely conclude him now, from denying the authority of those whose act he has ratified.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A65\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Washington, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhT\">An inferior Court ought always to be considered as having decided right, unless the contrary appear upon recor(j to the appellate Court. This is a principle universally admitted. The County and District Courts have quashed the replevy bond; and the appellant complains that they have erred. It becomes him then to point out the error, and to prove it by the record. He attempts it, by <em>presuming </em>that Mr. <em>Lee </em>as the attorney, and Mr. <em>Hepburn </em>as the partner and father-in-law of the appellee, were cloathed with authority; he does not pretend that it is proved, nor does it follow as a necessary consequence from their connection with the appellee. Even if the attorney who obtains the judgment, may order the execution, (of which I much doubt) yet surely one not concerned in the action at law can have no authority to do it. Neither can a father-in-law, or partner, dispose of the property belonging exclusively to his son-in-law, or part,ner. It is contended that presumptions are inadmissible to defeat a forthcoming bond. This is very true, and with less reason ought they to be received against a judgment, \"-hich is a more sacred thing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL6\">But it is said, that <em>Dundass </em>has ratified the act. If by mistaking his right, if by misconceiving the law, he supposed that the remedy first contemplated was the best, or perhaps the only one, is he therefore to be concluded, though upon better advice he determined not to proceed in that, but in some other mode ? Unquestionably not. The Court of <em>Fairfax </em>was satisfied upon this point, or else they would not have given the judgment they did. It does not appear that all the evidence which was given, was spread upon the record. Presuming therefore in favor of the judgment, as is always done in favor of a general verdict, (which would not have been found unless the essential facts had been proved,) this Court must affirm the judgment, so far as it depends upon the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-7\">The Court were not bound to state the reasons of their judgment. The party objecting to it, was bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>to furnish an appellate Court with the same lights to decide by, as the inferior Court had, and therefore should have stated the whole evidence. The consequence of his not having done it is, that if this Court were to reverse the judgment, they would do it in the dark, because the inferior Court may have quashed the bond for fraud in taking it, and this Court might say they did right, if they had the same evidence before them that that Court hack</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-3\">Campbell, in reply.- \u2014 -I do not say that any one fact in this cause proves the authority by which this execution issued. . But as the whole question turns upon the weight of evidence, and the conviction it brings to the mind, it is fair to contend, as I have done, that the relative situation of <em>Lee </em>and <em>Hepburn </em>with Dundass, supported by his after recognition, is conclusive to prove that they acted by authority.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> Ch0 <em>7. </em>\u00a7 5\u00bb \u201cIn any case9 where the creditor, his-agent or attorney shall be dissatisfied with the insufficiency \u00a9f the security admitted fey such valuers, it shall be lawful for such creditor to appeal to the next Court to be held for the county or corporation, thereupon giving notice thereof to the debtor or his attorneys and if such Court shall be of opinion that the securitj so admitted was insufficient,, the execution upon which such security was admitted shall be deemed and taken as a lien upon the goods and chattels of such debtor, and shall not be discha\u00ed ged but upon payment of the debt and cosls9 or render of other sufficient security satisfactory to the Court, and moreover the bond and security given by such debtor shall remain valid until \u00e1uch counter security be given,5*</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-4\">Lyons J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXV\">It is unnecessary to decide, whether the execution in this case issued by sufficient authority or not, the opinion of the Court being with the appellee upon another point. It may suffice to observe, that the permission obtained from Mr. <em>Hepburn </em>and Mr. <em>Lee </em>was merely intended as a fa\\ or to Taylor, and ought not to have turned to the disadvantage of the person on whose account they acted. This though not expressed must have been understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The facts stated upon this record certainly exhibit as strong a case as can be imagined, to warrant the interposition of the Court, whose justice was so glaringly attempted to be eluded and abused. The execution is carried by the agent of <em>Taylor </em>into a distant county in pursuit of <em>Hendricks, </em>who, with his property, was removing from the reach of his creditors. It Is there levied upon his property, and the Commissioners are informed that both <em>James </em>and <em>John Hen</em>drickshad left <em>Alexandria </em>greatly in debt; were there considered as bankrupts, and were clandestinely removing from thence. Notwithstanding this caution, they restore the debtor his property upon his giving a tw elve-month\u2019s bond, and accept his brother as security, who was then absconding with his property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>and, as well as the principal, was considered as being insolvent. Such conduct in the Commissioners, if it deserve not the epithet of fraud, was certainly highly improper and unjustifiable. Though they might have been made liable, yet a shorter and more effectual method was, for the Court, whose process had been thus abused, to quash the execution, That such a right belonged to that Court cannot be questioned. Were it otherwise, it would be in vain for Courts of justice to render their judgments. If this charge against the Commissioners were unfounded, the appellant has had time enough to justify their conduct. The insolvency of the security was suggested by the appellee, yet no attempt has been made to disprove it. Upon the whole we are clearly of opinion, that every Court hath a perfect right to watch over the execution of its judgments, and where its process hath been irregularly or fraudulently executed, to quash it, as being the best and speediest mode of doing justice, and that in this case the Court had sufficient ground to afford this summary interposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Judgment affirmed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-11\">(1) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hewett, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 115.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
