The vendor then executes a bill of sale under seal for the slave, to the vendee, in which only the price given is stated; but there is no mention of the condition for repurchase. The vendee afterwards sells the slave, at a price even above the market value at the time of the first sale; and the vendor brings an action for a breach of the parol contract.

If the bill of sale is the contract between these parties, it is competent to prove additional considerations to those expressed in the written contract; and under this principle, the appellant may prove the agreement to give him the refusal of the slave at the price for which he sold him. 3 Stark. Evi. part 4, 1004, and the cases there cited; <em>Mildmay\u2019s </em>Case, 1 Coke\u2019s R. 176; <em>Bedell\u2019s </em>Case, 7 Id. 39 ; 2 Roll\u2019s Abr. 786 ; <em>The King </em>v. <em>The Inhabitants of Scammonden, </em>3 T. R. 474.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-9\">2d. The bill of sale is an expression of only a part of the contract; and the remainder thereof may be proved by parol. <em>Jeffery </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>2 Eng. C. L. R. 385.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALNF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>3d. The hill of sale was never intended to be the contract; but was a mere part execution of a parol contract previously made. By this paper, <em>Brent </em>conveyed the slave to Richards, and warranted the soundness of, anq title to the negro; but it was no more the contract than was the order to his brother to deliver the negro to <em>Richards. </em>The opinion of <em>Marshall, </em>C. J. in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousmanier, </em>8 Wheat. R. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-5\">4th. The contract entitles <em>Brent </em>to damages for the difference between 475 dollars, the price at which <em>Richards </em>purchased, and 1000 dollars, the price at which he sold.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-6\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7G\">We are in a Court of Law; which is not competent to administer the equities between these parties. This Court can only decide upon their legal rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-7\">We say that the bill of sale is the contract; and that where there is a deed expressing the contract between the parties, Courts of Law cannot go beyond the deed, though Courts of Equity may. This subject is fully considered in 3 Stark. Evi. part 4, p. 995; and the rule laid down is, that where a consideration is expressed in the deed, you may prove a consideration of the same nature, but not one of a different nature. 3 Stark. Evi. 1004, 1005. What is the case here ? The bill of sale expresses the consideration of the contract; and this cannot be varied. 3 Stark. Evi. 1006 ; <em>Lano </em>v. Neale, 3 Eng. C. L. R. 267.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-8\">The cases cited by the counsel for the appellant were not at law.. It is not denied that equity would have relieved the appellant, if he had resorted to that Court; but he has chosen to come into a Court of Law, and here he cannot get relief. The only case at law was the case of <em>Jeffery </em>v. <em>Walton; </em>and the writing there was not a deed, but a mere memorandum of an agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>As to the amount of damages, according to <em>Brents </em>own shewing, he lost hut 225 dollars.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aq5\">Stanard. <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AlH\">The binding force of such a contract as that on which this suit is brought, and which is admitted by the case agreed, is not contested. The objection to the appellant\u2019s recovery is not founded on the intrinsic invalidity of such a contract, but on the effect ascribed to the bill of sale under his hand and seal, on the legal remedy on the parol contract which formed a part, or was concomitant with the bill of sale. The effect of that deed, it is contended, is to intercept or defeat the remedy at law on the parol contract of the vendee with the vendor; and compel the vendor to seek relief in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">If the bill of sale intercepts or defeats the legal remedy on the parol contract intrinsically valid, it must so operate either by merging the parol contract, or by way of estoppel, excluding parol evidence of any matter except that which is expressed on the face of the bill of sale. It cannot operate by merging the parol contract, because the contract of the vendee cannot be merged by the deed of the vendor. It is not an estoppel in evidence of any matter not inconsistent with and contradictory of it; and here the deed is but an execution of the contract on the part of the vendor. This contract is neither inconsistent with nor contradictory of the bill of sale. At most it is but additional. The deed but put the property in the condition in which the contract sued on begins to operate. It was but the execution of this contract, on the part of the vendor: the necessary preliminary to make the case which is the subject of the vendee\u2019s contract, and on which his contract is to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">If the appellant is entitled to recover, the measure of damages is free from all reasonable doubt. The difference between the price at which the appellant was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>titled under the contract to repurchase the slave, and at which the appellee sold him, is the amount that the appellee made, and the appellant lost, by the violation of the contract; and that is the proper measure of \u00bfatnage.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">My opinion is, that the judgment of the Court below should be reversed, and judgment entered for the appellant for 525 dollars, with interest from the 31st of May 1836, till paid, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The other Judges concurred. Judgment of the Court below reversed and judgment entered for the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
