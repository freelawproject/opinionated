The declaration v. as for 120/. <em>sterling of the value of </em>160/. <em>current money of Virginia, </em>and <em>5s. 9d. </em>sterling money of the value of <em>7s. 8d. </em>current money the charges of protest, and interest at the rate of ten <em>per centum per annum </em>upon the said principal sum of 120/\u00bb sterling from the date of the bill. The damages are laid at <em>500h </em>sterling, <em>of the value </em>of666/. <em>Ss. 4d. current money. </em>Upon the plea of <em>nil debet, </em>the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and judgment was entered for 341/. 16s. sterling, being the principal, interest, and charges of protest in the declaration mentioned, with interest thereon after the rate of five <em>per centum per annum </em>from that day, -and the costs; but the said sterling money may be discharged in current money at the rate of 37f <em>per cent, </em>difference of exchange. To this judgment a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded by one of the Judges of this Court\u00bb</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AM5\"><em>Campbell, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-3\">This case is precisely like that of <em>Scott's executors </em>v. <em>Call, (ante, vol. </em>i. p. 115,) in which the Court decided, that it was error for the declaration to demand the <em>current money </em>value of a <em>sterling debt, </em>which was recoverable only in sterling money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-4\">Another objection to this judgment is, that the declaration is for 120/. sterling, of the value of 160/. <em>Virginia </em>currency, and interest after the rate of <em>ten per centum per annum, </em>with charges of protest | and the judgment, instead of being entered for the principal, damages, and charges, as demanded by the declaration, leaving the calculation of the interest to be made by the <em>Clerk </em>when he issued the execution, is for the whole added together in one aggregate sum, the <em>Court </em>undertaking the calculation. The Inconvenience resulting from this mode of entering up the judgment is, that if a mistake be made by the Court, it could only be corrected by a writ of error, &amp;c.; whereas, if the Clerk were to make it, the Court might upon motion order it to be amended.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Apk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>Stark, </em>for the defendant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apn1\">I do not recollect the case of <em>Scott\u2019s executor </em>v. <em>Call, </em>and therefore do not know how far it governs this. The last objection is in opposition to the com\u00bb mon practice of entering judgments upon protested bills of exchange.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b222-5\">Lyons J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAA\">delivered the opinion of the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">This was an action of debt upon a protested bill of exchange. The declaration, which is in the usual form, demands the principle, interest, and charges of protest, in <em>sterling </em>money, but lays the value of each in <em>current money. </em>Upon the plea of <em>nil debet, </em>the jury found that the defendant did owe the debt in the declaration mentioned <em>generally, </em>without saying that it was in sterling, or in current money. The Court gave judgment for the aggregate amount of principle, interest, and charges of protest, <em>in sterling money, </em>according to the Act of Assembly, and at another day they entered, as usual, a general rule settling the rate of exchange at which the sterling judgments of that term were to be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The first objection made to the judgment is, that the declaration having laid the value of the sterling money as if it had been <em>foreign money, </em>and the verdict being general, it should be considered as given for current money, and not for sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The answer to this is, that the <em>debt, </em>as well as the <em>damages, </em>are demanded in <em>sterling money, </em>and therefore the verdict and judgment must be for sterling money.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">But it was contended, that sterling debts could only be sued for and recovered in sterling, and that the laying of the value in current money is erroneous, and for this the case of <em>Scott\u2019s executors </em>v. <em>Call </em>is relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The value in current money has only been laid through abundant caution, under an idea perhaps, that since our separation from <em>Great Britain, </em>sterling money might be considered like other foreign money, and to be sued for as such. But since the laws made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>before the revolution respecting sterling money debts are still in force, they may still be sued for and reco\u00ab vered, without laying the value in current money, the Courts having the same power to settle the rate of ex- \u2018 change which they formerly had. But although there Is no necessity for laying the value of the sterling money, yet if it be laid, it is merely surplusage, and will not vitiate the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">The case of <em>Scott's executors, </em>v. <em>Call, </em>was not like the present. It is true that in both, the demand was of a sterling debt, with an averment of the value in current money; but in that case the <em>damages </em>were considered as being laid in <em>current money, </em>because they were laid <em>generally, </em>whereas, the demand being an entire one, and <em>the debt </em>being a <em>sterling debt, </em>the damages ought to have been in sterling money likewise, in order that the judgment for the debt and damages might be entered for the same sort of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The Court did not say, that an averment of the value of the sterling money was error, but the <em>demand </em>being in sterling money, it was considered to be improper to depart from that by laying the <em>damages </em>in current money only; and two of the Judges who sat in that cause have been pleased to give this explanation of the reasons which influenced their decision in that cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
