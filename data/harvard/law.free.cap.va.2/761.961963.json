Magruder </em>having purchased a tract of land in the county of <em>Albemarle, </em>on which his sister mrs. <em>Mary Boyd </em>resided during her life, the heirs of mrs. <em>Boyd, </em>after her death and the death of her brother, claimed that he intended the purchase for his sister, and had so declared, and that in fact the land was paid for by her, or by her brother out of funds of hers in his hands; and they insisted that there was a resulting trust for her in the land. To adjust the controversy growing out of this claim, the heirs of mrs. <em>Boyd </em>and some of the heirs of <em>Magruder </em>entered into an agreement under seal, submitting the matter to arbitrators ; the parties to the submission agreeing that all others interested, whether adults or infants, should, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>as themselves, submit to and perform whatever award should be made. The arbitrators awarded (amongst other things) that the heirs of mrs. <em>Boyd </em>were entitled to the land, and that <em>Magruder\u2019s </em>heirs should convey their interest therein to them. But <em>Magruder's </em>heirs refused to execute such conveyance. Whereupon a bill in equity was filed by <em>Boyd\u2019s </em>heirs, insisting, that though some of the heirs of <em>Magruder </em>were infants or <em>femes </em>covert, there should nevertheless be a decree for a conveyance by them, upon the ground of the original resulting trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b794-4\"><em>John B.

Magruder junior, </em>and praying a conveyance, according to the provisions of the award, of whatever legal title might be in the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b794-5\">Answers had been filed to the original bill; but this amended bill was taken for confessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b794-6\">The cause coming on to be heard before the circuit court of <em>Albemarle </em>the 17lh of May 1836, that court decreed that the bills be dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b794-7\">From which decree an appeal was allowed on the petition of <em>Boyd\u2019s </em>heirs, insisting, 1. that upon the proofs in the cause they were entitled to relief against all the defendants; and 2. if not against all, that they were clearly entitled to a decree against the parties to the submission, for a conveyance of the land with special warranty; for which was cited <em>Smith &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Smith &amp;c. </em>4 Rand. 95.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b794-8\">The cause was argued by <em>Lyons, Stanard </em>and <em>C.

Magruder </em>deceased ; and that although said <em>John B. Magruder </em>may have intended said purchase to be for the benefit of his sister the said <em>Mary, </em>and have so declared, such intention and declaration, in the absence of satisfactory proof of the payment of the purchase money, could create no resulting trust in her favour. The court is therefore of opinion that there was no error in the decree, so far as it determined that the heirs of said <em>Mary Boyd </em>deceased were not entitled to demand from such of the heirs of said <em>John B. Magruder </em>deceased, who were not parties to or bound by the said submission and award, a conveyance of the legal title descended to them from their father or ancestor the said <em>John B. Magruder </em>deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">The court is further of opinion, that it was competent for the adult heirs who were <em>sui juris </em>to enter into the submission in the proceedings mentioned, notwithstanding there were other heirs interested in the subject who were not parties; that the award made in pursuance of such submission is binding on the parties to the submission, according to the terms thereof; and that the plaintiffs are entitled, as against such parties to the submission who laboured under no disability of coverture, to a specific execution of the award, by a conveyance of any legal title to the lands aforesaid which has descended to them respectively, and also to their legal remedy for any breach of the award or agreement of submission in any other respect.</p>\n<p id=\"ANAk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>The court is further of opinion, that as it appears by amended bill, which has been taken for confessed, that <em>John B. Magruder </em>junior, one of the parties to the submission, has departed this life intestate and without issue, whereby his interest in said lands has descended to his mother, brothers and sisters and their deseendants, those who were not parties to or bound by the award, as well as those who were, are necessary parties in a suit by the plaintiffs to procure a conveyance of the legal title vested in said <em>John B. Magruder </em>junior; and therefore it was erroneous to dismiss the bill as to any of the defendants, as the plaintiffs, to this extent, were entitled to relief against all.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">The court is further of opinion, that as the parties bound by the award were made defendants by the amended bill, which was taken for confessed, under the allegations thereof the specific execution of the award, by a conveyance of the interest in the lands held by the parties bound by the award, was the only matter in issue, and the only relief which can properly be given is a decree for a conveyance to the plaintiffs, by the parties bound by the award and their representatives, of such interest in said lands as was vested in said parlies bound by the award, with covenants of special warranty; but such decree to be without prejudice to the right of the plaintiffs to proceed at law for any other matter embraced in the award, or to recover for any failure to comply with the terms of the award and the submission in any other respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">The court is therefore of opinion, that said decree dismissing the original and amended bills with costs was erroneous, and that the same be reversed with costs. And the cause is remanded to the circuit court, with leave to make any new parties, should that have been rendered necessary by death or otherwise, and to be finally proceeded in according to the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
