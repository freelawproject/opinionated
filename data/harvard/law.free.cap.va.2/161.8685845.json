After a <em>rule to plead, </em>which was continued from <em>November, 1795, </em>to <em>Mciy, 1796, </em>there are the following entries; <em>May, </em>\u201c <em>Usual plea and time to reply f July, </em>\u201c <em>Joinder </em>\u25a0 1 \u2019 ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-12\">The parties went to trial without any further pleadings; and there hating been a verdict and judgment for the defendant, the plaintiffs obtained a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>from one of the Judges of the General Court, by virtue of which the record was carried \u00fcp to the District Court of <em>Staunton, </em>where the judgment of the County Court was affirmed. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court* ; ' . 1 ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-13\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAO\">There is no issue joiried in the cause. The act of 1786<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> prescribes the form of the writ, <em>count, plea, </em>and <em>replication </em>in writs of right. The parties must pursue that mode and <em>no </em>other In this case the clerk has only said the \u201c <em>usual plea f </em>but does not say what that plea was.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-14\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abp\">Mr. <em>Itay </em>is right in saying, that If the demandant <em>counts </em>according to the act, the defendant can plead no other plea than that prescribed by it* He, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>has no election. If in <em>indebitatus assumpsit, </em>a pica of the \u201c <em>General issue\u201d </em>be put in, it is equivalent to \u201c <em>Non assumpsiu\u201d </em>So, in a writ of right, if the defendant plead the \u201c Usual plea,\u201d it must necessarily follow, that itis the plea prescribed by the act; for he could put in <em>no other.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-10\"><em>Nay, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avo\">Admitting the doctrine contended for by Mr. <em>Call </em>to be correct, it is manifest that no issue has been made up in this case; for the act says the demandant sir.AH. <em>reply </em>in the form of the replication prescribed by it. Here there was no <em>replication, </em>nor even an apology for one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABx\">In <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Tarpley,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was held that the omission of a <em>similiter </em>in a plea importing the general issue was a mere misprision of the clerk, (if it were a fault at all,) and therefore amendable. But, in <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Taliaferro,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the judgment was reversed for want of an issue, though it was said, \u201c <em>.thereupon an issue was joined by the </em>parties.\u201d In that case, too, there was a regular special plea, in bar, in the first instance, and the clerk afterwards said in the record that an issue was joined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFp\">In <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Dixon,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>ths defendant to a declaration in trespass put in as a plea the word \u201c Justification\u201d only ; and it was held that no issue was-joined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-13\">In the present case, the clerk, instead of putting in the usual plea in the <em>terms </em>of the plea itself, has merely put in the <em>words </em>\u201c <em>Usual plea f </em>which is no plea at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-14\"><em>Call. </em>There is a distinction between the duties of a County Court and a District Court clerk. The former only takes short minutes, and it is his duty afterwards to extend them in proper form; whereas, in tire District Courts, the records are drawn rip at full length, and sighed by the presiding Judge. Even in the District Courts, the records usually say, to a plea of <em>payment </em>to an action of debt, the plaintiff <em>replied generally.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-15\">In <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Taliaferro, </em>the plea was complicated, and it was necessary to specify on what point the issue was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>joined. But in this case there was but <em>one </em>point on which it <em>could </em>be joined; and the usual plea <em>could be but one.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b177-18\"> <em>Rev.Code, </em>vol. 1. c. <em>27. </em>p. 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\"><em> </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>363.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"><em> </em>Ibid. 155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> 2 <em>Call, </em>379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Monday, <em>March 28. </em>The Judges deliyered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b179-5\">Judge Tucker..</author>\n<p id=\"Atv\">The appellants brought a writ of right in the County Court, and filed their count. After several continuances for a plea, there is this entry, \u201c Usual plea, and time to reply,\u201d to which, at another, there is this entry, \u201c Joinder.\u201d The parties went to trial, and there was a verdict and judgment for the defendant. This judgment was affirmed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">By the County Court law,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> in all cases v/here the title or bounds of land is drawn in question, the pleadings must <em>be all in writing-, </em>and ar.e t\u00a9 be entered at large with the judgment thereupon, in particular books kept for that purpose. The act for reforming proceedings in writs of right,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> affords the defendant a proper form of which he may avail himself if he thinks proper. If he neglects so to do, and especially if he offer no <em>plea in writing at all, </em>he shall not have any advantage of his own neglect. Where there is no plea in <em>writing </em>in suits concerning lands, there can be no issue joined: the one is a preliminary to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In writs of right, which are conclusive, whichever way they may be determined, it appears to me to be absolutely necessary to hold the parties to regular pleadings. Otherwise, instead of deciding mere right, they may be the means of establishing extensive wrong. I therefore think the judgment must be reversed, and all the proceedings subsequent to the count set aside, and a repleader awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-8\">Judges Roane and Fleming being of opinion that the judgments ought to be reversed, and a repleader awarded, the following was entered as the opinion, of the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons.)</judges>\n<p id=\"b180-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Judgments of County and District Courts reversed, .and it is ordered, \u201c that the pleadings and all other pro- \u201c ceedings in the said County Court subsequent to the \u201c count be set aside, and that the parties do proceed and \u201c plead anew;\u201d.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b179-12\"> <em>Ed. </em>1794 c. 67. sect. 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b179-14\"> Ibid. c. 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
