Held. This is no ground for defeating the action on the trial of the cause.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-13\">This is the sequel of the case of <em>Downer 6p Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>reported immediately preceding. The cause having been sent back to the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery for the county of <em>Montgomery, </em>came on for trial in that Court at the May term of 1841. The object of the suit was to recover from the defendant the price of certain goods which the plaintiffs alleged had been purchased from them by <em>Morrison Sp Foster, </em>through their agent <em>Joseph Wilson. </em>There was no doubt that <em>Wilson </em>purchased the goods from the plaintiffs ; and there was no doubt that <em>Morrison Sp Foster </em>received the goods from <em>Wilson; </em>but the question in dispute was, whether they purchased directly of <em>Wilson, </em>or whether <em>Wilson </em>was their agent in the purchase from the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The plaintiffs to sustain the action, offered in evidence the deposition of <em>George W. Edwards, </em>a clerk of the plaintiffs, who deposed that an account, made a part of his deposition, and which was a duplicate of the account filed with the declaration in the cause, was a true and accurate copy from the books of the plaintiffs, of the original entries of the goods sold, and charged as sold to <em>Morrison fy Foster. </em>To the admission of this deposition the defendant objected, and the Court sustained the objection; and the plaintiffs excepted. This is the plaintiffs\u2019 first exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">The plaintiffs then offered in evidence the deposition of <em>John C. Hewitt, </em>who deposed: That at the time of the purchase of the goods, he was the clerk of <em>Wilson. </em>That <em>Wilson </em>was in the habit of purchasing goods in <em>New York </em>for <em>Morrison Sf Foster, </em>as their agent. That as such he purchased the goods in question. That in such cases the bills of the goods were made out in the name of <em>Morrison Sf </em>Foster, as purchased by them and on their account, and handed to <em>Wilson </em>as their agent; and he forwarded the goods to them accordingly. That such purchases were made by <em>Wilson </em>as the agent of <em>Morrison \u00f3f Foster, </em>and not on his own account. That the goods purchased of the plaintiffs were of the kind and description set forth in the account annexed to his deposition; and he had no doubt of the correctness of that account. To the reading of this deposition the defendant objected, but the Court overruled the objection ; and the defendant excepted. This is the defendant\u2019s first exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">The plaintiffs having read the deposition of <em>Hewitt, </em>offered to read the account referred to in the deposition, but the defendant objected, and the Court sustained the <em>objection; </em>and the plaintiffs excepted. This is the plaintiffs\u2019 second exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">The plaintiffs having read in evidence the deposition of <em>Hewitt, </em>also read a letter from <em>Morrison Sf Foster </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the plaintiffs, dated <em>Newbern, </em>Virginia, 30th October 1834, in which they refer t'o a draft drawn by <em>Wilson </em>on <em>Morrison if </em>Foster, in favour of <em>Downer if Co., </em>for the amount of their bill for the goods sold to <em>Wilson </em>as their agent; and say, that they have made an arrangement to send on to <em>Wilson </em>a check for 500 dollars; and had directed him to apply it to the debt of the plaintiffs, which, if it was done, would render it unnecessary to accept the draft; and in that case they intended to return it to <em>Wilson; </em>and if not, to accept it and return it to the plaintiffs. And they say, farther: <em>\u201c </em>If <em>Mr. Wilson </em>refuses to pay any part of said check to you, we will in that event accept the draft and forward it to you.\u201d And they conclude by asking whether, if it should be necessary for them to accept the draft, they could deposit the money when due in any bank in either <em>Lynch-burg </em>or <em>Richmond, </em>or pay it over to any house there. The plaintiffs then offered in evidence the draft drawn by <em>Wilson </em>on <em>Morrison if Foster, </em>and referred to in their letter. To the admission of the draft as evidence the defendant objected, but the Court overruled the objection ; and the defendant excepted. This is the defendant\u2019s second exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-11\">After the introduction of the foregoing testimony, the plaintiffs again offered in evidence the account referred to in <em>Hewitt's </em>testimony, it being a duplicate copy of the account filed with the <em>declaration; </em>but the defendant objected to the account as evidence, and the Court sustained the objection; and the plaintiffs excepted. This is the plaintiffs\u2019 third bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-12\">The plaintiffs having offered the forementioned testimony, then read a letter from the plaintiffs to <em>Morrison if Foster, </em>and which had been received by them, dated 12th of September 1834, in which they say: \u201c In accordance with the tenor of yours of the 18th ulto., we have applied to <em>Mr. Wilson, </em>who has arranged the acc\u2019t by drawing upon you at 90 days date from the 11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>current, and we now enclose the draft for your acceptance,\u201d &amp;c. They then offered in evidence another letter of the plaintiffs to <em>Morrison if Foster, </em>dated the 7th of November 1834, which letter had been received by <em>Morrison if Foster, </em>and was filed in the cause by the defendant; and read by him in evidence on the former trial of the cause. In this letter the plaintiffs inform <em>Morrison if Foster, </em>that they had not received any thing in payment of their debt from <em>Wilson; </em>and express their assent that the draft drawn on <em>Morrison if Foster </em>by <em>Wilson, </em>in favour of the plaintiffs, should be made payable in <em>Richmond. </em>The defendant objected to the reading of this letter as evidence, and the Court sustained the objection; and the plaintiffs excepted. This is plaintiffs\u2019 fourth bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">The plaintiffs having concluded their testimony, the defendant then read in evidence an account current rendered to <em>Morrison if Foster </em>by <em>Wilson, </em>dated the 1st of June 1834, which shewed a balance in favour of <em>Wilson </em>at that date of principal, 1137 dollars 67 cents, and of interest, 21 dollars 51 cents ; and then he offered in evidence the record of a cause decided at the same term of the Court at which this case was tried, in which <em>Stout if Ingolsby </em>were plaintiffs, and the defendant, as a partner in the firm of <em>Morrison if Foster </em>was defendant, in which the jury had found a verdict for the plaintiffs for 1144 dollars 2 cents, with interest on 545 dollars 73 cents from the 18th of April 1834, on 535 dollars 91 cents from the 13th of July 1834, and on 64 dollars 38 cents from the 1st of November 1834, for the purpose of proving that the whole fund in defendant\u2019s hands due to <em>Wilson </em>was exhausted by the recovery in that cause. To the introduction of this record the plaintiffs objected, but the Court overruled the objection, and the plaintiffs excepted. This is the plaintiffs\u2019 fifth exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">The defendant then offered a witness to prove that the recovery had in the case of <em>Stout if Ingolsby </em>against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the defendant, was for goods purchased by <em>Joseph Wilson&gt; </em>who represented himself as the agent of <em>Morrison Sp Foster, </em>at the time of his said purchase from <em>Stout Sp Ingolsby, </em>and which goods were forwarded by him to <em>Morrison Sp Foster. </em>The plaintiffs objected to this evidence, but the Court overruled the objection, and the plaintiffs excepted. This is the plaintiffs\u2019 sixth exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\">The defendant also offered in evidence a letter from the plaintiffs to <em>Morrison Sp Foster, </em>dated the 1st of September 1834. In this letter they say, \u201c we are as much surprised to learn that you are not aware of any transactions between yourselves and us, as you could have been at the contents of our letter. At the request of <em>Mr. Wilson </em>we opened an account with your house which has been continued from time to time, without the least suspicion on our part until the 1st of August last that the business was misunderstood by you,\u201d &amp;c. To the introduction of this testimony the plaintiffs objected, because the Court had refused to allow the letter from <em>Downer fy Co. </em>of the 7th of November 1834, referred to in plaintiffs\u2019'fourth exception,\" and which refers to the subject of the letter offered by the defendant, to be read in evidence, but the Court overruled the objection, and the plaintiffs excepted. This is the plaintiffs\u2019 seventh exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">The defendant having proved that the firm of <em>Downer Sp Co. </em>consisted of two persons named <em>Downer </em>and an individual named <em>Hall, </em>then moved the Court to enter a nonsuit, on the ground that all the persons constituting the firm were not made plaintiffs. But the Court overruled the motion, and the defendant excepted. This is the defendant\u2019s third exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">The Court having refused to nonsuit the plaintiffs, the defendant moved the Court to instruct the jury: That there was no evidence before them which would justify them in finding a verdict for the plaintiffs, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ground that all the parties composing said firm were not made parties plaintiffs. But the Court refused to give the instruction, and the defendant excepted. This is the defendant\u2019s fourth exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">The jury found a verdict for the defendant j and the plaintiffs moved the Court for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the evidence; but the Court overruled the motion, and entered up a judgment upon the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">To the refusal of the Court to grant them a new trial, the plaintiffs excepted, and spread the evidence upon the <em>record; </em>but as this Court did not pass upon that exception, a statement of the evidence is omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">From the judgment in the case, the plaintiffs obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-13\"><em>John T. Anderson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A9K\"><em>Beverly Johnston, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b275-14\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ATL\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">The Court is of opinion, that the Court below erred in its decision, stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>first </em>bill of exceptions, to wit, in rejecting the account referred to in the deposition of the witness <em>Edwards, </em>and which he deposes to be a true and accurate copy from the books of the firm of <em>Downer &amp; Co. </em>of the original entries of the goods therein charged as sold to <em>Morrison &amp; Foster; </em>that account, so verified, being proper evidence for the consideration of the jury, so far as it tended to repel any intendment or inference from the purchase of said goods by <em>Wilson, </em>and the delivery thereof to him, that he, the said <em>Wilson, </em>had been debited therewith in the books of said <em>Downer &amp; Co., </em>and so far as the debiting of said goods to said <em>Morrison &amp; Foster </em>as aforesaid, might, in the opinion of the jury, from other evidence in the cause, have been expressly or impliedly recognized by the said <em>Morrison &amp; Foster. </em>And the Court is fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ther of opinion, that the Court below erred in' its decisions stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>second </em>arid <em>third </em>bills of exception, to wit, in rejecting the account appended to the deposition of the witness <em>Hewitt, </em>and therein referred to by him, inasmuch as his evidence touching said account, tended to prove the justice of the charges therein made,- and the weight of that evidence was proper for the consideration of the jury. And the Court is further of opinion, that the Court below erred in its decision stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>fourth </em>bill of exceptions, to wit, in rejecting the letter from <em>Downer &amp; Co. </em>to <em>Morrison Foster, </em>of the 7th of November 1834, therein mentioned ; which letter, under the circumstances, and for the purposes stated in that bill of exceptions, was proper evidence for the consideration of the jury. And the Court is further of opinion, that the Court below erred in its decision stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>fifth </em>bill of exceptions, to wit, in admitting as evidence to the jury the record of the suit of <em>Stout &amp; Ingolsby </em>v. <em>Morrison &amp; Foster, </em>in that bill of exceptions mentioned, inasmuch as the said <em>Downer &amp; Co. </em>were neither parties nor privies to that controversy, and the fact of the judgment recovered therein had no legitimate bearing upon the merits of the controversy in the present suit. And consequently, if for no other reason, that said Court erred in admitting evidence of the grounds of said recovery, as stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>sixth </em>bill of exceptions. And the Court is further of opinion, that there is no error in the decision of the Court below, stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>seventh </em>bill of exceptions; nor in any of its decisions, stated in the defendant\u2019s four several bills of exception. And in regard to the decision of the Court below, overruling the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial, mentioned in the plaintiffs\u2019 eighth bill of exceptions, this Court deems it proper to decline expressing an opinion, inasmuch as a new trial must be directed, because of the errors aforesaid, and by reason of those errors, the merits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>cause were not properly and fully developed on the trial before the jury. It is therefore considered by the Court that the said judgment of the said Circuit Court be reversed and annulled, with costs to the plaintiffs in error, and that the verdict of the jury be set aside, and the cause remanded to the said Circuit Court, for a new trial to be had there of the issue joined between the parties, upon which new trial that Court is to govern itself in relation to the admission and rejection of the evidence above mentioned, by the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
