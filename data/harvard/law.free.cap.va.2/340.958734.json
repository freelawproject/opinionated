Another interest is held by infants. Held. That a Court of Equity will decree a partition of the land, at the suit of the tenant by the curtesy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\"><em>Otley's </em>wife died, seized of land in <em>Princess Anne, </em>leaving three children, her heirs at law, <em>James Hancock, Anne Green, </em>and <em>Thomas Calvert; </em>so that <em>Otley </em>was tenant by curtesy, and subject to his curtesy, the land descended to the three children. <em>Otley </em>purchased <em>James Hancock's </em>share of the reversion, and thus was tenant for life by curtesy of the <em>whole, </em>and tenant in fee of <em>one third. Thomas Calvert </em>sold his share of the reversion to <em>James M'Alpine, </em>who died, leaving children his heirs at law, who were infants. A bill in chancery was filed by <em>Otley, </em>to have partition between himself, as purchaser of <em>James Hancock's </em>share, and <em>Anne . Green </em>and <em>M'Alpine's </em>heirs, and so to ascertain the third which belonged to him in fee. And the Circuit Court dismissed the bill, on the ground, that the plaintiff was not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>titled to demand partition of a reversion at law; and as equity in making partition follows the law, neither, therefore, was he entitled to partition in equity.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b360-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>1845. <em>October Term.</em></decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7ku\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>From this decree <em>Otley </em>obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-7\"><em>Leigh,, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOv\">At common law, the writ <em>de partitione faciendo </em>lay only for parceners, and where both parties held <em>insimul et pro indiviso; </em>Co. Litt. 167 a. And it lay only against the tenant of the freehold. It was given to joint tenants, and tenants in common, by statutes 31 Hen. 8, ch. 1, and 32 Hen. 8, ch. 32; 16 Vin. Abr. Partition, S. pl. 11, 12, p. 234-5. And whenever it lay, it lay against an <em>infant; </em>Co. Litt. 171 a. b. As between tenants in common, the remedy is regulated in <em>Virginia </em>by statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 98, \u00a7 1, which provides that all tenants in common of estates of inheritance, or of estates for life, or years, with others who have estates of inheritance, <em>or </em>freehold, may be compelled to make partition by writ <em>de partitione faciendo; </em>but such partition between tenants in common for life, or years, with others holding equal or greater estates, shall not be prejudicial to reversioners, or remaindermen, after expiration of the life, or years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-10\">By the purchase made by <em>Otley </em>of the interest of one of the three parceners, his estate for life by curtesy in the third part so purchased, merged in the fee; and he became tenant in fee of one third part, <em>in common </em>with himself, as tenant by curtesy of the other two thirds, and the other two parceners as tenants in reversion. If a stranger had bought the reversionary right of one parcener, and then bought <em>Otley's </em>curtesy in that part, and so become tenant in common of the fee in that part with <em>Otley </em>as tenant by curtesy, and the reversioners, a writ of partition would have lain for such stranger, against <em>Otley </em>and the other parceners, or for <em>Otley </em>against him. Our statute gives it in such case, and at the same time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>protects the interests of <em>the </em>reversioners. And see Co. Litt. 175, a. and b.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-10\">The circumstance of <em>Otley, </em>the tenant by curtesy of two thirds, being himself tenant in fee of one third, does not vary the <em>right </em>to have partition ; but it affects the <em>remedy at </em>law, because he cannot sue himself. <em>This </em>is the very foundation for the jurisdiction of a Court of Equity; I mean on general principles; for it presents a case in which there is a <em>right, </em>for which there is no remedy at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-11\">It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to ascertain the origin of equitable jurisdiction in cases of partition, or the grounds on which it was assumed, <em>Mitford </em>and <em>Fonblanque, </em>(1 Fonb. 18, in notes; Mitf. Plead. 110,) both place it on the ground, <em>\u201c </em>that in the case of the partition of an estate, if the titles of the parties are <em>in any degree complicated, </em>it is extremely difficult to proceed in Courts of Common Law; and where the tenants in possession are <em>seized </em>of <em>particular estates only, </em>the persons in remainder cannot be bound by the judgment on the writ of partition.\u201d The principle embraces the case before the Court. The titles are so complicated, that it is not only difficult, but impossible to proceed at law; for <em>Otley </em>cannot, as tenant in fee of one third, sue himself as tenant by curtesy of two thirds, or <em>vice versa; </em>and yet, if the tenant in fee of the one third were a stranger, the writ of partition would lie for or against him; and the remaindermen, who could not be bound by judgment at law, (16 Yin. Abr. Partition, S. pi. 16, p. 236,) may be bound by decree in equity. As to those of the reversioners who are <em>infants, </em>no injustice can be done them, since the Court will, of course, give them a day after their full age; which is more than the law would have given them. Co. Litt. 171, a. and b.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-12\">I do not understand, that a Court of Equity decrees partition only in such cases where the writ <em>de partitione facienda </em>would lie at law; I see it no where so stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>but only that, in analogy to the proceeding at law, equity does not give costs. (See 1 Madd. Ch. Prac. 244; 16 Vin. Abr. Partition, Z. p. 241; 5 Supp. Vin. Abr. Partition, R. and Z. 336; <em>Calmady </em>v. Calmady, 2 Ves. jr. R. 568.) <em>Agar </em>v. <em>Fairfax, </em>17 Yes. R. 533, is a case of partition decreed in equity, where plainly no writ of partition could have been maintained at law. In all partitions at law, or in equity, it is the law, of course, that ascertains the rights of the parties; but it does not follow, that the equitable remedy only lies where the legal remedy lies; the contrary, it seems to me, results from the very fundamental principles of equity jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-9\">No counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b363-10\">Cabell, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aqbl\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">The Court is of opinion, that the Court below erred in dismissing the bill of the appellant. Instead of dismissing the bill, it ought to have allotted to the appellant, in severalty, one third part of the land, of which partition was claimed. The decree is therefore reversed with costs; and the cause is remanded, to be proceeded in to a final decree, according to the principle now declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
