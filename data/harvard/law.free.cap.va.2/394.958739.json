Rust, </em>and the plaintiff <em>Catharine. </em>This tract consisted of between five and six hundred acres of valuable land. He also owned a tract of land on <em>Kanawha </em>river, which he valued <em>highly; </em>and his plan was, to give the <em>Kanawha </em>land to his other <em>children; </em>and that all his children should be made equal, by payments by those who received most to those who received least. His first plan for dividing his property seems to have been by <em>will; </em>but he afterwards changed it, and determined to do it, at least so far as the <em>Fauquier </em>lands were concerned, by deeds to the three children for whom he intended these lands, reserving a life estate to himself. The persons with whom he consulted upon the mode of dividing his lands by deed, advised him that it would be necessary, that those receiving the conveyances, should execute bonds binding them to pay what should be found necessary to equalize the portions of the children ; and one of the persons with whom <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>consulted, <em>Josiah Titball, </em>who was examined as a witness, states that he understood that said <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>was to keep possession of the deeds until the children therein named should execute some obligation binding themselves to make up to his other children any difference that might exist between the property conveyed by those deeds, and the property that might be allotted to his other children in western lands. But this understanding of the witness was derived from con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>versations had with <em>Rust </em>previous to the day on which the deeds were executed by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlWx\">On the 13th of June 1826, <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>had three deeds prepared, by one of which he conveyed to <em>Benjamin Rust, jr. </em>208 acres of his <em>Fauquier </em>lands, reserving a life estate therein to himself; by another, he conveyed about the same quantity of these lands to <em>Catharine Hutchison, </em>with a like reservation; and by the third, he conveyed one hundred and fifty acres of his land to <em>John S. Rust, </em>with a like reservation. He then sent for two justices of the peace, <em>Thomas Shearman, </em>and <em>Josiah Titball, </em>the same person before mentioned, and acknowledged said deeds before them; whereupon they certified the said acknowledgments, by endorsements on the deeds, in the form prescribed by the act of assembly. The acknowledgment of <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>was made in the usual manner; and nothing seems to have been said on the occasion which indicated that the acknowledgment was not to be a complete and final execution of the deeds, though he then remarked, he wished to make his children equal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">At the time of the acknowledgment of the deeds, there was no person present but the justices and <em>Benjamin Rust, sen.; </em>and after the certificates of the justices were written, the deeds were returned to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">It appears that <em>Benjamin Rust, jr. </em>had lived with his father for many years, as his manager, upon the terms of receiving one sixth of the crops; and that he claimed to be due him, under that contract, about 4000 dollars. About the time of the acknowledgment of the deeds, there was an attempt at a settlement between <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>and his son; but the old man objected to the account, alleging that his son had sold the crops, and he, the father, did not know what had become of the money. He, however, told his son, he would make him a title to the two hundred acres of land, because he had intended to do so, but not for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>claim to the account. He accordingly delivered to <em>Benjamin Rust, jr. </em>the deed hy which was conveyed to him two hundred and eight acres of his <em>land; </em>and this deed was afterwards admitted to record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-4\">The deeds to <em>Mrs. </em>Hutchison, and <em>John S. Rust </em>were retained by <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>until they were taken from his desk by his daughter <em>Emma Hicks, </em>as she states in her <em>answer; </em>and that to <em>Mrs. Hutchison </em>was subsequently destroyed, as <em>Mrs. Hicks </em>says, by the direction of <em>Benjamin Rust, sen.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">Soon after the delivery of the deed to <em>Benjamin Rust, jr., </em>the plaintiff, <em>Lemuel Hutchison, </em>at the request of <em>Benjamin Rust, sen., </em>purchased <em>B. Rust, jr.\u2019s </em>land, and went to live with <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. ; </em>but they soon quarrelled, and then <em>John E. Rust </em>purchased the land from <em>Hutchison. </em>It was subsequent to this quarrel that <em>Mrs. Hicks </em>says she destroyed the deed to <em>Mrs. Hutchison, </em>by the direction of her father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">There was much testimony taken upon the question of fact, whether <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>intended, when he acknowledged the deeds before the justices, that they should be completed intruments; or whether he intended to hold them subject to be revoked, until the grantees executed the equalizing bonds spoken of by the witness <em>Tilball. </em>The Court below and this Court were of opinion that he intended the last.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">Since the death of <em>Benjamin Rust, sen., </em>his land on the <em>Kanawha </em>river has been sold for 5000 dollars. The land in <em>Fauquier </em>was valued as at the time of his death, at 30 dollars per acre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-8\">The cause came on to be finally heard in May 1838, when the Court below dismissed the bill; and thereupon the plaintiffs applied for and obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-15\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApG\">There is no dispute in this case about the contents of the deeds which we ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the Court to set up. The three deeds to the three children were counterparts of each other, except as to the names of the grantees, and the land conveyed ; and that t0 <em>Benjamin Rust, jr. </em>is in the record. These three deeds were acknowledged at the same time, before the same justices. The certificates of the acknowledgment were in the same form. They were all left in the possession of the grantor. And, without any other certificate, or proof of execution, the deed to <em>Benjamin Rust, jr. </em>was admitted to record; and he was put into possession of, and held the land embraced by his deed. The other two deeds are not now in existence, and we have no information as to what became of them, except from the answer of one of the defendants, which, as it is not responsive to the bill, is not evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-4\">I shall in the first place, consider the case as the simple case of a voluntary conveyance by the grantor in the presence of witnesses, of which the grantor never parted with the possession; but which was subsequently destroyed by him. In such a case, could a Court of Equity refuse to set up the deed ? The following cases seem to be conclusive on that question. <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Heneage, </em>Prec. in Ch. 211; <em>Clavering </em>v. <em>Clavering, </em>2 Vern. R. 473; <em>Lady Hudson's </em>Case, cited in <em>Clavering </em>v. <em>Clavering; Boughton v. Boughton, </em>1 Atk. R. 625; <em>Worrall </em>v. <em>Jacob, </em>3 Meriv. R. 256; <em>Garnons </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>12 Eng. C. L. R. 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-5\">In the case of <em>Garnons v. Knight, </em>the grantor said, in the presence of witnesses, <em>\u201c </em>I acknowledge and deliver this as my act and deed;\u201d but he did not deliver it, but retained it in his possession. If the justices were simply witnesses, <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>said to them, \u00a3!I acknowledge this as my act and deed.\u201d Unless, then, the addition of the word deliver, when no delivery was made, can distinguish the cases, <em>Garnons </em>v. <em>Knight </em>is an authority in point to sustain the validity of the deed in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Upon the evidence, we insist it was clearly the intention of <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>that his acknowledgment of these deeds should operate to give them validity, though he retained them in his possession. The signing, sealing, and acknowledgment, are sufficient evidences of a perfect execution of the instruments, unless the legal effect of these acts be prevented by proofs of a contrary intent on the part of the grantor; and the <em>onus </em>is, therefore, upon the parties relying upon such contrary intent, to establish it. And we insist, it is not the impressions of a witness as to the intent of the grantor, which can set aside his most solemn acts; and convert that which, to all appearance, was, and was intended to be a valid and operative act, into an idle ceremony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-4\">But is this a case in which we are to be put upon proof of the delivery of the deed ? The deed was signed and sealed, and acknowledged before the officers of the law authorized to take the acknowledgment; and, therefore, we contend, that no farther proof of execution is necessary on our part; and no proof is admissible to avoid the consequences of that acknowledgment. At common law, it is well settled, that a party is not allowed to plead <em>non est factum </em>to an enrolled bond. <em>Baker, treasurer, </em>v. <em>Preston &amp; als. </em>Gil. R. 254; 14 Viner\u2019s Abr. 444. And the reason given for it, is, that the enrolment is proof of execution. Under our statute authorizing justices to take the acknowledgment of deeds, their function is, not to aid in the making of a deed, but to certify the acknowledgment of it when it is made. They can only certify a complete deed, because on their certificate, the clerk is to admit the paper to record; and, certainly, no unexecuted deed should be, or can be, legally recorded. If, then, a party may be allowed to avoid his own acknowledgment of the deed, by the proof of the justice who took it, in opposition to the certificate of the justice, which it is not pretended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>was fraudulently or improperly made, the consequence must be, that not the records themselves can give any satisfactory assurance of the validity of any title to lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-9\">If the deed may be acknowledged before justices before it is executed, then, upon principle, an alteration subsequently made before delivery would not avoid it; and yet the contrary of this is held in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Bickham, </em>4 Binn. R. 1; and it is there decided, that the slightest change cannot be made in the deed after acknowledgment before justices.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-10\">Why should not the acknowledgment before the justices be held to be a perfect execution of the deed ? When the acknowledgment is made the deed is in possession of the justices. The grantor is no longer entitled to possession of it j and the justices must be considered as holding it for the grantee. If they deliver it again to the grantor, for his own use, without the assent of the grantee, it must be a violation of their duty, and of the rights of the grantee ; and when, therefore, they do deliver it to the grantor, in the absence of proof to the contrary, they must be presumed to have delivered it to him to be forwarded to the clerk to be recorded. Being so delivered, the possession of the grantor does not avoid his previous delivery of it to the justices, according to the principle of <em>Garnons </em>v. <em>Knight; </em>and that delivery to the justices is sufficient to constitute it a valid and operative deed. <em>Shelton\u2019s </em>Case, Croke Eliz. 7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-11\">Previous to the act of 1814, it was necessary that deeds should be acknowledged in Court in order to be recorded. It will hardly be denied that a deed thus acknowledged by the grantor, and the record of this acknowledgment being made by the clerk, would be a perfect and operative deed, though' the grantor retained possession of it. But the act of 1814 only substitutes the justices for the Court. The duty to be performed by both is the same. The certificate of the justices is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the place of the entry on the records of the Court by the clerk; and they perform the same function of authorizing the clerk to spread the deed upon the records of his office. But this question has been in fact decided in the case of <em>Harkins </em>v. Forsyth, 11 Leigh 294. In that case, it is true, the deed was recorded; but this Court has decided that the recording is a mere ministerial act. <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Ellis &amp; </em>Allan, 1 Rand. 102; <em>S. C. </em>10 Leigh 1.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-4\"><em>Morson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABN\">In this case we differ both about the law and the facts. The principal ground of difference as to the facts, is, whether when <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>acknowledged the deeds which are the subject of controversy, it was his intention to execute a perfect and concluded instrument. The appellants say such was his intention: we say it was not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-5\">The first point made by the appellants\u2019 counsel, is, that the acknowledgment of the papers before witnesses, or justices, estops the grantor from denying they are his deeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-6\">The acknowledgment of the deed is no part of the deed, and is not necessary to its validity. At common law such acknowledgment was in no case necessary; and under our statute, the deed is valid without acknowledgment, between the <em>parties; </em>and an acknowledgment is only necessary, in order to have it <em>recorded; </em>and thus make it valid against subsequent purchasers without notice, and creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-7\">We do not admit, that an acknowledgment of a deed before justices has any other or greater effect than an acknowledgment before witnesses. The object of the acknowledgment in either case, is to have the deed recorded j and the law gives no more force or effect to the one mode than the other. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 7, p. 363. An acknowledgment in Court is a record, and thus differs from an acknowledgment before justices.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3_e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The fact which the counsel on the other side must establish in order to give validity to these papers, is not the acknowledgment, but the delivery by the grantor. shall not contend that there must be a manutransmission of the deed. The delivery may be either actual or constructive; and when the constructive delivery is established, it is equally valid with the first. But when it is attempted to prove a constructive delivery of a deed, the intention of the grantor is of the very essence of the transaction; and no act which does not clearly indicate the intention to deliver the paper as his deed, can establish a constructive delivery. Now, an acknowledgment is only a fact from which a delivery may be inferred ; and this being from its nature merely presumptive, that presumption may be rebutted by countervailing testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-5\">I might rely upon the case of <em>Garnons </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>12 Eng. C. L. R. 351, cited on the other side, to shew that the question whether there has been a delivery, turns upon the intention of the grantor. In that case the authorities cited by <em>Mr. Stanard, </em>are collated and considered; and it will be found on examination, that in all of them there was a clear intention, at the time of the acknowledgment, to perfect the deed; and the doubt whether there was a delivery, arose, only from the grantor\u2019s retaining possession of the paper. <em>Garnons </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>establishes only the proposition, that where there is an acknowledgment, unless the intention was not to deliver, the simple fact of retaining possession of the paper, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. But where it affirmatively appears that the grantor did not intend by the acknowledgment to perfect the deed, but intended to retain the power of revocation, though this intention does not appear on the face of the deed, a Court of Equity will not set it up. Such was the case of <em>Nalred </em>v. <em>Gilham, </em>1 P. Wms. R. <em>577; Ward </em>v. <em>Lant, </em>Prec. in Ch. <em>573; Cecil </em>v. <em>Butcher, </em>2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Jac. &amp; Walk. 565; <em>Platimone </em>v. <em>Staple, </em>Cooper\u2019s Ch. Gas. 250; <em>Uniacke </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>12 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 440.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-1\">There are also cases in this Court, which shew that <em>-, </em>i_ , , ail acknowledgment cannot operate as an estoppel upon the grantor. <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>2 Call 103; <em>Roanes </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>4 Leigh 550. In these cases, if the first acknowledgment was conclusive of the perfection of the deed, the second could have had no effect in passing the estate. So, in our sister States, it has been decided in many cases, that an acknowledgment is not conclusive, though it is cogent evidence of delivery, whether the acknowledgment be before witnesses, or justices, or even before the Court. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phipp, </em>12 Johns. R. 418; <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>10 Mass. R. 456; <em>M'Connell </em>v. <em>Broem, </em>4 Litt. Select Cas. 466 ; <em>Sicard\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>6 Peters\u2019 R. 124; <em>Scrugham </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>15 Wend. R. 545; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>13 Pick. R. 69; <em>Barns </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>3 New Hamp. R. 304; <em>Frisbee </em>v. <em>M\u2019Corty, </em>1 Stuart &amp; Port. 61; <em>Daniel v. Bratton, </em>1 Dana\u2019s R. 209; <em>Chess </em>v. <em>Chess, </em>1 Penn. R. 32.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-12\">The case of <em>Harkins </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>11 Leigh 294, cited by the counsel for the appellants, was a case where the interests of third persons were involved; and there, as to them, and for their protection, it was held the certificate of the privy examination of the wife was conclusive. This is a case between the parties to the instrument, and no consideration for the interests of third persons can have place.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-14\"><em>Bouldin, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_sZ\">The acknowledgment before the justices implies the complete execution of the instrument ; and their certificate is conclusive evidence of the acknowledgment. This is upon the principle that where the law1- directs its officers to make an enquiry and certify the result, their certificate is conclusive on the subject. Every case relied on by the counsel for the appellees, only shews that an acknowledgment <em>in pais, </em>is not conclusive ; but not one of these cases was upon an acknow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ledgment before the Court or justices authorized to take it. These cases, too, all go on the principle that assent by the grantee is necessary to the completeness of the deed; a principie which has been overruled in this <em>Court. </em>The cases cited from the English decisions were all of them cases of an acknowledgment before witnesses; and such were the cases of <em>Eppes </em>v. Randolph, 2 Call 103, and <em>Roanes </em>v. Archer, 4 Leigh 550. The second acknowledgment was treated' by the Court as a re-execution of the deed; and it was held that it might be re-executed, in order that it might be recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-4\">We do not differ with the counsel of the appellees as to what is a delivery, or as to the necessity of an intention to deliver the paper as a deed; but the question is, what is evidence of a delivery ? And we say the acknowledgment before justices is conclusive evidence both of the fact and the intention. The duty and authority of the justices is not to take acknowledgments of unfinished, inchoate papers, but of deeds; not to aid in consummating the deed, or in giving it validity between the parties, but to give information to another officer that the deed has been made; that the paper is the act and deed of the grantor; and at his request to certify his acknowledgment to the clerk in order that it may be recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-5\">If a deed is acknowledged in Court, the grantor is not afterwards entitled to the possession of it, but it must go to the clerk or the grantee. So when acknowledged before justices, the deed is necessarily delivered to the justices when the acknowledgment is taken; and then the paper is no longer the property of the grantor, but of the grantee; and the justices can have no authority to deliver it to the grantor as such, but it should pass to the grantee or his agent, or the clerk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-6\">These views are sustained by the case of <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Bickham, </em>4 Binn. R. 1; by Philips on Evi. 1285; and the case of <em>Scrugham </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>15 Wend. R. 545, cited by the counsel for the appellees. That was the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of a deed acknowledged before a commissioner, which was held to be a perfect deed, though it was found among the papers of the grantor after his death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-4\">I have already said that the cases cited on the other side go upon the ground that the deed must be assented to by the grantee. Such was the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phipp, </em>12 Johns. R. 418. But this doctrine is not law in <em>Virginia. </em>Here the assent of the grantee will be presumed until his dissent is expressed, where the deed is for his benefit. <em>Skipwith\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>8 Leigh 271: <em>Roanes </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>4 Leigh 550.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-5\">If the deed which we seek to set up in this case had come to the hands of the clerk with the justices\u2019 certificate upon it, it would have been his duty to record it. Suppose it was upon the record, would it have been competent then for the grantor to deny that he had delivered it ? A party is estopped from pleading <em>non est factum to </em>an enrolled deed, not because it is enrolled, but because it was enrolled upon his acknowledgment. 14 Viner\u2019s Abr. 444; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>Gil. 447 ; <em>Ben </em>v. <em>Peete, </em>2 Rand. 539. And the law is the same, whether the acknowledgment is in Court, or before a master in chancery in <em>England, </em>or justices in <em>Virginia.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-6\">In <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>1 Rand. 219, this Court decided, that when a deed is recorded, its date is conclusive of the time of its execution. It is said by the counsel for the appellees, that the deed being retained by the grantor after being acknowledged before justices passes nothing. Suppose that three months after the acknowledgment the grantor executes another deed conveying the same land, which deed is immediately recorded, and then three months afterwards the first deed is admitted to record; according to the argument on the other side, the deed made when the grantor had the whole estate passes nothing; and the deed made when he had nothing passes the whole estate; for certainly the estate passes by the deed last recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-Yr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>This Court has decided, too, that a paper acknowledged in Court is a paper signed, sealed and delivered <em>\u00a1 </em>and that the deed is valid though the grantee is absent at the time of the acknowledgment, and had no <em>know</em>ledge of it, if he afterwards claims under it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selden, </em>5 Munf. 160; <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>2 Call 103; <em>Roanes </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>4 Leigh 550. But there is no difference between the act of the grantor before the Court and his act before the justices. He goes before the Court to acknowledge the deed that it may be recorded by the clerk; and he goes before the justices to acknowledge the deed that it may be certified to the clerk for record. Upon principle, then, the acknowledgment before the justices is equally effective and conclusive as the acknowledgment before the <em>Court; </em>and the reasoning of the Court in the case of <em>Harkins </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>11 Leigh 294, fully sustains the principle for which we contend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-4\">If the certificate of the justices is to be considered, not as an estoppel, but simply as evidence, the facts thereby certified are conclusive of the completeness of the deed. There is no difference of opinion between the counsel of the appellees and myself as to what is necessary to the completeness of the instrument ,\u2022 our difference is as to the proof: and my proposition is, that the facts' occurring at the time when the instrument was acknowledged can alone be looked to, to ascertain whether the execution of the deed was completed: and that nothing which occurred either before or after that time can be permitted to influence the determination of that question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-5\">The case of <em>Garnons </em>v. <em>Knight </em>sustains the proposition that the signing, sealing, and saying it is his act and deed, is a good execution of the deed by the grantor, though he keeps possession of it. If then it is insisted that these acts do not in any particular case amount to a complete execution of the instrument, the evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>shew it, must be reservations made, or acts done at the time of the acknowledgment, or evidence of an agreement or understanding with the grantee, or with the justices, having a direct reference to the act done by the grantor. <em>Souverbye </em>v. <em>Arden &amp; als., </em>1 Johns. Ch. R. 240. All the cases relied on by the counsel for the appellees were cases where the acts and reservations relied on to disprove the completeness of the deed, were done and made at the time of the execution of the instrument; except perhaps the case of <em>Nalred </em>v. <em>Gilham, </em>which was decided on its own peculiar circumstances, and <em>Uniacke </em>v. <em>Giles.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-4\">The case of <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Heneage, </em>Prec. in Ch. 211, and the other cases cited by <em>Mr. Slanard </em>in the opening argument, to which may be added <em>Souverbye </em>v. <em>Arden &amp; als., </em>1 John. Ch. R. 240; <em>Shelton\u2019s </em>Case, Croke Eliz. 7; <em>Bunn </em>v. <em>Winthrop, </em>1 John. Ch. R. 329; and <em>Skipwith\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>8 Leigh 271, all shew that where a party executes a deed without any thing more to qualify his act than keeping possession, the deed is complete ; and. upon proof of the fact, by intendment of law, the deed is delivered to the grantee. If then the act is complete, no previous act or declaration of the grantor in the absence of the grantee can qualify the act done when the deed is executed. This is the common and settled principle that a party shall not make averments against his own deed. The giving the deed to the justices, and the acknowledgment of it as his act and deed, and the request to them to certify it to the clerk, is surely stronger evidence of the completeness of the deed than are the facts stated in the cases above referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">Whatever difference of opinion there may be upon all the evidence in the record as to the intention of <em>Benjamin Rust, sen. </em>in acknowledging these deeds, there is no dispute about the fact, that at the time he acknowledged them before the justices, he made no reservations, and did or said nothing from which it can be in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ferred that he did not intend them then to be complete deeds. The only proofs on which the appellees rely, are conversations and supposed understandings with the wit- . ... . . . \u201e nesses, occurring and existing previous to the time or ^1&lt;3 acknowledgment, and therefore not admissible to shew what was his intention at that time.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-16\">He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b428-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A4WD\">Affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
