Under these circumstances, the widow was driven to the alternative, either to take the dower, so irregularly assigned; or to hold on to the property in her possession. She preferred the latter; and was fully justified in her choice by the act of Assembly. 1 <em>R. C.

The only objection is' to the <em>mode </em>in which the dower was assigned. This question is to be decided upon common law principles; for, the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Assembly has made no change, as to the manner_ of assigning dower. At common law, the heir may assign dower by his own act. Even a <em>disseisor, abator, </em>or <em>in-\u00bfruder, </em>may assign dower. <em>Co. Litl. </em>35, <em>a. </em>It follows that <em>one </em>heir may make a valid assignment, although his co-heirs do not join in it; for, he has unquestionably more right than a mere <em>disseisor. </em>An assignment, even if inadequate, will be good <em>pro tanto. Fitzherbert\u2019s </em>N. <em>B. </em>17, \u00a7 <em>6. </em>In the case of <em>Foote </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh, </em>3 Call, 13, it was decided, that an assignment made upon mere motion, ought not to be set aside <em>in tolo, </em>but the error, if there was one, corrected.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJ5v\"><em>March </em>30.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">The bill of <em>John Crafford </em>is no evidence against him, as it is always considered as the mere act of counsel. But, if it could be attributed to him, he was clearly mistaken.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AA1\">Judge Cabell,</author>\n<p id=\"A9o\">delivered the opinion of the Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The act of Assembly which declares, that until dower shall be assigned to a widow, \u201cit shall be lawful for her to remain and continue in the mansion-house, and the messuage or plantation thereto belonging, without being chargeable to pay the heir any rent for the same,\u201d is highly beneficial to her; but, it was not intended to operate injuriously to the heir. It was intended not to restrain, but to stimulate, the heir; not to diminish any of his powers, but to urge him to their just and speedy exercise. He had the power, at common law, to assign dower without resorting to any Court whatever; and that power is not impaired by the act of Assembly aforesaid. The widow is bound to accept the assignment made by him, provided it be <em>a, full </em>and <em>just </em>assignment; and, in that event, if she persist in holding any more of the lands than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>those thus assigned, she ought to be chargeable therefor. 'pjjg assignment of dower by an adult heir, in behalf of himself and his co-heirs, who are infants, is as binding on them as it is on him, provided the assignment be not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">It is no objection, that the assignment in this case was made by commissioners under an order of the County Court. That, order was made at the instance of the heir, and the assignment by them was his assignment. Even the widow herself has never objected to it as not being full and fair; and, as to her misapprehension of the law, in sup- \u2022 posing it not to be obligatory, it would be unreasonable in the extreme, that she should avail herself of it, to hold the. whole estate rent free.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The decree is <em>affirmed,.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\"> Judge Carr, who had been appointed on the death of Judge Fleming, sat in this cause.
