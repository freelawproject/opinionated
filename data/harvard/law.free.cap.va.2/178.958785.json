S. M </em>\u2019 <em>Culloch, </em>for 145 dollars 75 cents, payable in eighteen months, with interest from the date. On this bill suit was brought in the County Court of <em>Jackson, </em>and a judgment was rendered against all the obligors, in November 1832. An execution issued on this judgment, which was levied on the property of <em>D&amp;ioitt, </em>who gave a forthcoming bond with <em>John Robinson </em>and <em>David Harden </em>as his sureties. This bond having been forfeited, execution was awarded thereon in 1833, which was again levied on the property of <em>Dewitt, </em>from the sale of which the sheriif returned he had made the sum of 36 dollars 57 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Whilst the last execution was in the hands of the deputy sheriff, it was assigned to him by <em>A. fy S. M \u2019 Culloch, </em>without recourse, and was by the deputy sheriff assigned to <em>William Bonnell.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\">On the return of this execution, a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>was issued against <em>Dewitt, Robinson </em>and <em>Harden, </em>and being served upon them, <em>Deiuiti </em>was discharged under the act for the relief of insolvent debtors, and <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Rarden </em>were committed to prison, and executed bonds td keep within the prison rules.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">Whilst thus in custody, <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Rarden </em>applied for and obtained injunctions to the execution upon the forthcoming bond, from one of the Judges of the General Court. In their bills they alleged that they had been induced by the deputy sheriff to sign the forthcoming bond, and that they signed it upon the express agreement that <em>Sherman </em>as well as <em>Dewitt </em>were to sign it as <em>principals; </em>that <em>Sherman </em>did not sign it; and that after it was forfeited an award of execution was obtained upon it, without any notice to them; and although it appeared by the record that they appeared by counsel and opposed the motion, that in fact, the counsel who appeared in the case, was only the counsel of <em>Dewitt, </em>and had no authority from them to act in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">The bill farther stated the execution of the original note by the three obligors, and the judgment thereon against all of <em>them; </em>and that they were all interested in the contract out of which it arose <em>; </em>and insisted that if <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Rarden </em>were liable as obligors in the forthcoming bond, they were entitled to be substituted to the rights of the creditors against <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Sherman. </em>They, therefore, made the <em>M\u2019Cullochs, Richardson, Sherman, </em>the high sheriff, and the deputy, parties to the bill, and asked that all parties might be enjoined from proceeding on the forthcoming bond against them : or if they are to be held responsible on the forthcoming bond, that they may have relief against <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Sherman.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"At\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The <em>M\u2019Cullochs, Sherman </em>and the deputy sheriff answered the bill, and it was taken for confessed as to the others. The first stated that they had assigned their judgment to the deputy sheriff without recourse, anc^ they, therefore, had no interest in the subject. <em>Sherman </em>denied that he was a principal in the single bill executed to <em>A. Sf S. M \u2019 Culloch, </em>but said he was the surety of <em>Dewitt; </em>but the proofs sustained the bill in this respect. He denied, too, that he had ever agreed to sign the forthcoming bond; and said that he was opposed to its being given, as the execution was then levied on the property of <em>Dewitt, </em>and he desired it should be sold to satisfy the judgment. The deputy sheriff denied the allegations of the bills, that there was an agreement between himself and the plaintiffs, that <em>Sherman </em>should execute the forthcoming bond; and there was no proof of the fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-4\">In April 1841, the injunctions were dissolved, and the plaintiffs had leave to carry on the causes as original suits. In April 1842, the death of <em>John Robinson </em>was suggested, and the suit was revived in the name of <em>Lydia Robinson, </em>his administratrix, and then the causes coming on together to be finally heard, the bills were dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">From the decrees dismissing the bills, the plaintiffs obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-6\"><em>B.

R. 545, that the execution and forfeiture of the forthcoming bond in the bill and proceedings mentioned, did not discharge and extinguish the original debt, as against the other joint debtors. That notwithstanding the execution and forfeiture of the forthcoming bond, it would have been competent for the creditor, in case the forthcoming bond had proved unavailing, to have proceeded against the other joint debtors for satisfaction of his debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The Court is further of opinion, that the sureties of one of the joint debtors in the forthcoming bond, became, upon the forfeiture thereof, sureties for the debt ; and if they have subsequently discharged the same, they are entitled, upon the principles of a Court of Equity, as affirmed in <em>Powell v. White, </em>11 Leigh 309, to be substituted to all the rights of the creditor against the original debtors, subsisting at the time they became so bound for the debt: and that notwithstanding the subsequent payment of the debt, the sureties who have paid it, are entitled to treat the original security of the creditor as still subsisting for their benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The Court is further of opinion, that the sureties are entitled to charge the original debtors with the debt, interest, and the costs of the first judgment at law, but have no claim against them for the costs incurred by the execution and forfeiture of the forthcoming bond, or for the damages incurred by the injunction. That in ascertaining the amount for which they are entitled to a decree against the other joint debtors, or either of them, as each is liable to them for the whole debt, the amount made out of the property of the said <em>Dewitt, </em>should be applied first to the payment of the costs incurred by the execution of the forthcoming bond, and the residue so collected should be applied to reduce the amount of the original debt, interest, and the costs of the first judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ment at law, and that the sureties arp entitled to decrees against the said <em>Henry Sherman </em>alone, or the said <em>Sherman, Dewitt </em>and <em>Richardson </em>jointly, upon bringing the latter before the Court, for the balance of the original interest and costs, to be apportioned between the sureties according to the sums paid by them respectively, together with their costs in these suits. The Court is further of opinion, there was no error in the decree dissolving the injunction, and dismissing the bill as to all the parties except said <em>John Dewitt, George Richardson </em>and <em>Henry Sherman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Court is, therefore, of opinion, that so much of said decree as conflicts with the principles above declared is erroneous, and that the residue thereof should be affirmed. The decree is, therefore, reversed with costs, against <em>Sherman </em>and <em>Dewitt, </em>and affirmed as to the residue, with costs to the other appellees; and remanded to be finally proceeded in according to the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
