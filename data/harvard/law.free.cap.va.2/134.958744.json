From these memoranda, it appeared that in the year 1825 he received of these funds 10,644 dollars 16 cents; and in the year 1827 he received 2925 dollars, including dividends on the stocks and the proceeds of <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>note. And in the year 1825 he disbursed 3926 dollars, including 3376 dollars expended in the purchase of thirty-two shares of <em>Virginia Bank </em>stock ; in 1826 he disbursed 600 dollars ; in 1827 he disbursed 550 dollars; and in 1828 he disbursed 350 dollars; leaving unaccounted for, of the sums which came into his hands, 8043 dollars 76 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-12\">None of the moneys received by <em>Baker </em>were audited in the auditor\u2019s office, and no account thereof was raised on the books of the auditor; nor was the treasury or the treasurer charged with the same on the books of the auditor.

R. 412 ; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>9 Wheat. R. 680. That condition is, that <em>Baker </em>shall faithfully account for moneys coming into his hands in his official character. The question, therefore, is, did the funds of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>come into the hands of <em>Baker, </em>by virtue of his office? We say no; because, first, <em>Maj. Gibbon </em>had no authority to transfer them to the treasury of the Commonwealth; and second, <em>Baker </em>had no authority to receive them as treasurer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\"><em>Maj. Gibbon </em>was a special agent, of the strictest form as to the subject, the object, and the mode of executing his power. He was directed to transfer the funds of the <em>Cincinnati Society to </em>the trustees of <em>Washington College, </em>by an assignment executed and recorded in a manner specifically pointed out. These directions were authoritative, because the whole subject to be disposed of was the property of the <em>Cincinnati Society; </em>and although the resolutions of the 19th of December 1822, are the acts of the standing committee, yet they provide for the concurrence of the members of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>therein, before the act directed thereby is to be done: and that concurrence was obtained. These resolutions are, therefore, the foundation of <em>Maj. Gibbon\u2019s </em>authority, to transfer the funds of the society; and his acts are only so far valid, as they are authorized by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-10\">If <em>Maj. Gibbon </em>had no authority to transfer the funds of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>to the treasury of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>of necessity <em>Baker </em>had no right to receive them, as treasurer. <em>Baker's </em>authority to receive them as treasurer, could only be derived from the <em>Commonwealth; </em>and this authority must be shewn before these appellants can be held responsible for their loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-4\">The authority of <em>Baker </em>to receive these funds into the treasury, is attempted to be derived from the act of February the 5th, 1814. This is a provisional law to carry into effect the resolutions of 1807. These resolutions never authorized such an act as this is construed to be ; but if they did, the law was never acted on by the <em>Cincinnati Society. </em>The funds were not transferred under the resolutions of 1807, but under those of 1822 ; and unless these resolutions authorized the transfer upon the terms prescribed by the act of 1814, this act could give no authority to <em>Baker </em>to receive them into the treasury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\">But if <em>May. Gibbon </em>had authority to transfer these funds into the treasury, and the treasurer had authority to receive them, they have not been so transferred or received, as to constitute them a part of the funds of the <em>Commonwealth </em>in the treasury, for which <em>Baker's </em>sureties can be held responsible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">The act of 1792, 1 New Series St. at Large, p. 61, \u00a7 13, was in force when the act of 1814 was passed; and the act of 1819, 2 Rev. Code, ch. 174, \u00a7 14, p. 4, was in force when the funds of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>were received by <em>Baker; </em>and both are in the same terms. These acts prescribe that no money shall be received into, or paid out of the treasury, except on the warrant or certificate of the auditor of public accounts. This has always been the policy of the <em>government; </em>that she may not be made chargeable but by the joint acts of the auditor and treasurer ; and that she may keep a check upon the treasurer, by requiring the concurrent action of the auditor. 9 St. at Large 539, act of 1778.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Sureties contract on the faith of this law. They bind themselves for all moneys that come into the public treasury; and they know that no money can legally come there, but by the warrant of the proper officer, of wkich a P^lic record is kept; and these moneys are therefore under the supervision of the other authorities of the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-4\">That these funds were not received in the manner prescribed by the statute is admitted. That moneys can only be received into the treasury in the manner prescribed by the statute, I submit, is clearly established by its terms; and the conclusion is therefore inevitable that the funds of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>were not received into the public treasury; and the sureties of the treasurer cannot be held responsible for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\">If <em>Baker\u2019s </em>sureties are responsible at all, their responsibility is upon the bond of 1827. Although he received the funds in 1825 and \u201926, there is no evidence that any part of the money was wasted before 1827. But if the Court shall be of opinion that the money received in 1825, was appropriated in that year, all the payments made by <em>Baker </em>should have been credited on the deficit of that year. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>9 Wheat. R. 720; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>11 Leigh 512; <em>Postmaster General </em>v. Furbur, 4 Mason\u2019s R. 333.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-6\">The <em>Attorney General </em>and <em>C. &amp; G. N. Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\">It is objected that the funds of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>never were in the hands of the treasurer by virtue of his office; and that, therefore, his dilapidation of them was no breach of official duty; and no breach of the condition of his official bond. To sustain this objection, two grounds are relied on : 1st. That the funds received by <em>Jei'man Baker </em>were never audited by the auditor, or treated on the books of the auditor, or treasurer, as the law requires the public funds to be treated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>2d. That <em>Maj. Gibbon, </em>who transferred the funds to <em>Baker, </em>had no authority to make the transfer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJk\">As to the first. If upon the true construction of the act of 1814, it was the duty of the treasurer to receive these funds, it was his duty to receive them regularly, and treat them regularly; and if he has received them and treated them in an improper manner, this is a breach of official duty, for which the sureties would be responsible. It cannot be denied that the treasurer did, by co-lour at least of the act of 1814, receive these funds; and having so received them, whether regularly or irregularly, it was his official duty to preserve them for the purposes of that act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">But it is not conceded that, by the laws of the land, these funds ought to have been audited. The act concerning the auditor and treasurer, 2 Rev. Code, ch. 174, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 14, p. 4, declares: \u201c It shall not be lawful for the treasurer to pay or <em>receive any money </em>on account of the public, but on warrant or certificate from the auditor, unless\u201d in certain particular cases. We admit the case before us is not among the excepted <em>cases; </em>but we say it does not come within the terms of the law. The fund transferred to the treasurer was not <em>money; </em>but consisted of stocks and notes of hand. This does not seem to be a subject which properly addressed itself to the cognizance of the auditor. There was no public law by which it was to be regulated, either as to quantity or quality. The auditor could not have measured it, or ascertained its value, by any standard furnished him by the law: how, then, could he have certified to the treasurer what was due, and what it was his duty to receive ? This fund was to be paid into the treasury under a special act of the Legislature, for a particular <em>purpose; </em>and its quantity and kind depended wholly upon the will of the society of <em>Cincinnati, </em>and their agents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>We submit, then, that it was not a fund which was required by law to be audited; and that the laws enacted by the Legislature to check the treasurer by means of the auditor, and of executive committees, (2 Rev. Code, ch. 174, and Sup. Rev. Code, ch. 251, p. 313,) are inapplicable to this particular fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-10\">The second ground of the objection, is, the want of authority in <em>Maj. Gibbon </em>to make the transfer. The letter and the spirit of the act of 1814, authorize and require the treasurer to receive the funds of the <em>Cincinnati Society, </em>without reference to the form in which they shall be transferred ; and that with express intent that the funds so received should be held by the <em>Commonwealth, </em>upon the terms and conditions, and under the limitations set forth in the resolutions of the society, and in the 12th article of their constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-11\">Under this act, any agent of the society holding these funds, whether qualified to make a legal assignment of them or not, was justified in delivering them to the treasurer for the time being ; and the treasurer was not only authorized, but required to receive them. <em>Maj. Gibbon </em>was the lawful holder of the funds of the society, as their secretary and acting treasurer. He transferred them in pursuance of the resolutions of 1807; and neither the society, or any member of it, has been heard to complain that it was improperly done. If the <em>form of the </em>transfer was not the proper one, that might have been a good objection in the mouth of the debtors of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>when they came to pay off their certificates of debt; but they made no such objection ; so that in fact the mode of transfer adopted has been effectual to put the <em>Commonwealth </em>in full possession of the funds of the society, without objection or complaint by any party entitled to speak upon the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-12\">But it is objected that <em>Maj. Gibbon, </em>so far from being authorized to transfer these funds to the treasurer by delivery or otherwise, was authorized by the resolutions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the standing committee, approved hy the members of the <em>Cincinnati Society, </em>to transfer them only to the <em>Washington College.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF9\">We submit, that <em>May. Gibbon </em>never was authorized to transfer these funds directly to the <em>Washington College. </em>The resolutions of 1807 directed how they were to be disposed of. On the 14th December 1813, the society adopted a resolution, that upon any proposition to change the final appropriation of these funds, each member residing in the State should have notice thereof, and be requested to give his vote thereon, in person or by proxy <em>; </em>and that notice of such proposition should be given by the president, in one or more of the public papers, and by circular letters to each member. This destination of the funds has never been altered by the society. On the contrary, in 1813, the standing committee applied to the Legislature for the passage of a law in conformity to the resolutions of 1807. And in December 1818, at a meeting of the society, it was unanimously resolved, \u201c that the meeting was opposed to any alteration in the former disposition of its funds.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-8\">This was the last meeting ever held by the <em>Cincinnati Society. </em>The law of 1814 was then in full force ; and this, their final act, must be regarded as a full confirmation of that law, and all its provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-9\">At the meeting of the society in 1818, a standing committee was appointed, to continue to act until the next general meeting. Beside some special powers, it was authorized to do \u201c all other business not exclusively appertaining to the general meetings.\u201d This authority certainly does not embrace the power to change the destination given to the funds of the society by the resolutions of 1807, and the law of 1814. Nor is there any thing in their resolutions of the 19th of December 1822, which indicates such an intention. On the contrary, these resolutions evince, that the resolutions of 1807 was the basis of the action of the standing committee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>They make the declaration required by these resolutions; and they direct them, with Judge <em>Brooke\u2019s </em>letter proposing some farther conditions to their gift, to be printed ; and then direct the assignment to be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-10\">Under these resolutions, <em>Maj. Gibbon, </em>who was a member of the standing committee which adopted them, transferred the funds of the society to the treasurer of the <em>Commonwealth. </em>We insist that he properly construed these resolutions, in thus acting; and that he could not have been justified under them, in transferring and delivering the funds directly to the trustees of the college. This would have been a plain violation of the spirit of the resolutions of 1807, the law of 1814, and the resolutions of 1818. And it would have been wantonly throwing away that security for the appropriation of the fund to the purposes destined by the society, which was contemplated in placing them under the safekeeping of the Legislature. On the other hand, the transfer and delivery to the treasurer, whatever was its form, was a substantial compliance with the resolutions of the society, and with the law. Thereby, according to the letter, and within the true spirit of the law, the treasurer of the <em>Commonwealth </em>for the time being did receive into the public treasury the funds of the <em>society; </em>and when so received, it became his official duty, acting for the <em>Commonwealth, </em>to hold them upon the terms, conditions, and under the limitations set forth in the resolutions.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-11\"><em>Leigh, </em>and <em>Stanard, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJV\">The treasurer\u2019s sureties are not liable but by the bond ; they are not liable beyond the letter, and plain meaning of the bond.

The treasurer may have made himself personally liable for the funds in question, without making the treasury, or the <em>Commonwealth </em>liable for the same. This distinction between the treasurer and the treasury may seem nice and refined, and yet it is very obvious. The treasurer has a personal as well as an official capacity, whereas the treasury is a legal being, having no capacities but those with which the law endows it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">If the funds of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>were received into the treasury, they were not so received by <em>Baker, </em>as to make him officially, and his official sureties liable for his default in respect thereof. The funds were not audited. There was no warrant of the auditor to authorize <em>Baker </em>to receive the funds into the treasury; nor was any account of the transaction raised in the books of the auditor\u2019s or treasurer\u2019s office. The law of <em>Virginia </em>at the time of the transaction was explicit, in forbidding the treasurer to pay, or receive any money on account of the public, but on warrant or certificate of the auditor. 2 Rev. Code, ch. 174, \u00a7 14, p. 4. The purpose and policy of the provision was, that two officers should concur in every payment, and every receipt of public moneys; and that the auditor\u2019s office should be a chock upon the treasurer\u2019s office. This appears by the same statute, \u00a7 18, 21, 22. The statute of 1820 is yet more explicit. Sup. Rev. Code, ch. 248, p. 311.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">It is said the statute only forbids the receipt of money, without the certificate of the auditor; and that these funds were not money. The argument requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the most literal adherence to the words of the statute; and supposes that the sense and purposes of the law shall be wholly disregarded; and nothing but a literal compliance with its words required. Sensible of this, it ^as keen farther argued that these funds were not within the meaning and spirit of the statute requiring the audit. But it is, surely, important that stocks belonging to the <em>Commonwealth, </em>and committed to the safe keeping of the treasurer, should be protected by the safeguards thrown around the public treasure ; and the difficulty in auditing them vanishes, when, instead of requiring the auditor to fix a value, you direct him to describe <em>them; so </em>that they will appear both upon the books of the auditor\u2019s and treasurer\u2019s office, as stocks of a particular description, belonging to the <em>Commonwealth. </em>So when the stocks were redeemed or sold, the proceeds thereof should again have been <em>audited; </em>the treasurer charged on the auditor\u2019s books with those moneys; and the <em>Commonwealth </em>credited on the treasurer\u2019s books with the same moneys. But nothing of this kind was done. The funds themselves, or the moneys received by the treasurer on account of them, were in no wise <em>audited; </em>but on the contrary, <em>Baker </em>received the moneys, in a character with which the law did not endow him, as <em>\u201c </em>trustee of the <em>Cincinnati Society.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-4\">If <em>Baker, </em>under <em>colour </em>of the act of 1814, received the funds in question, that is, if he received them under a pretence that the act gave him authority to receive them, when it gave him no such authority, we utterly deny, that his receipt, under mere colour of legal authority, charged his official sureties with the duty of seeing that the funds were faithfully preserved and accounted for. Surely, the receipt of money or any other thing into the treasury, without legal authority, and the treasurer\u2019s receipt therefor, could not charge the <em>Commonwealth </em>with the funds received; or subject his official sureties for that for which the <em>Commonwealth </em>is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>responsible. Otherwise it would be in the treasurer\u2019s power, by giving a receipt in his official name, to charge his sureties for any money he could borrow on the eredit of his official bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6_\"><em>Maj. Gibbon </em>had not in October 1824, any legal authority to pay, and therefore the treasurer had no legal authority to receive into the treasury the funds of the <em>Cincinnati Society.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-5\">From the circular letter of the general society to the State societies in 1788, and from the amended constitution of the general society, it is obvious that the plan proposed to the State societies for the conduct of their affairs, was that these last should apply to the respective State Legislatures for charters of incorporation; and should at once loan their funds to the State by the permission of the Legislature ; which was by the charter to provide in case of \u201c difficulties that might occur in process of time\u201d for \u201cequitable dispositions of the funds.\u201d But in <em>Yirginia </em>no charter was ever asked or granted; no loan to the State was ever proposed; and the State society continued to manage and dispose of their own funds, until the adoption of the resolutions of December 16th, 1807, and the passage of the act of February 1814.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-7\">Obviously, this act permitted the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>to deposit its funds in the treasury, and did not require the society to deposit them <em>there; </em>and, therefore, notwithstanding the act, the society continued to manage its own funds, and to make dispositions thereof. It seems that in December 1817 there was a proposition to change the disposition which had been made of the funds by the resolutions of 1807, which in December 1818 was considered and rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-8\">Nothing can be more certain than that the society considered itself, notwithstanding the act of 1814, authorized to change the disposition of the funds; but that it determined to give them all to the <em>YYashington </em>College; as it had before resolved to do by its resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>tion of December 1807. And the society was clearly light in this opinion of its powers. More than three years had elapsed from the 4th of July 1808, without any declaration of the dissolution of the society by the ia\u00fcure general meetings within that time. No difficulties had occurred within the meaning of <em>the 12th </em>section of the constitution as understood by the society ; and as no such difficulties as those which the law intended to provide for had occurred, the law was in effect, inoperative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">In January 1822, Judge <em>Brooke </em>wrote his letter to <em>Col. Bowyer ; </em>and in December 1822, the standing committee adopted the resolutions under which <em>Maj. Gibbon </em>acted. In these resolutions, there is no reference, or allusion to the act of February 1814; no profession of intention to deposit the funds in the treasury for the benefit of the <em>Washington College; </em>but a plain donation directly to the college ; and a direction to <em>Maj. Gibbon to </em>assign the funds, records, and papers, to the trustees of the college, in a certain prescribed mode. The act of February 1814, had never been executed, and had become inoperative; and it was not the intention of the committee in 1822 to execute it, but to dispose of the property of the institution, according to the will of the society, without the intervention of the Legislature: a disposition which the society had a perfect undoubted right to make.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-8\">All the members of the society declare their assent to the resolutions of December 1822, some immediately, some shortly afterwards, all in 1823 and 1824. Thus <em>Maj. Gibbon </em>had full authority to assign the funds to the <em>Washington College, </em>and no authority to transfer them to the treasury. And if he had no authority to transfer them to the treasury, then the treasurer could have no authority to receive them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\"><em>Baker </em>was the trustee of these funds for the <em>Washington College, </em>not for the <em>Commomoealth. </em>It appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>by his own receipts, that he so considered himself, and by the acts of the college that it so considered him. 13y their resolution of November 1825, the trustees of the college directed the treasurer of the <em>Commonwealth </em>to invest the money of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>in his hands in <em>James river </em>stock, or any other profitable stock he could procure. Now, if these funds, and the moneys received on account of them, were part of the treasure of the <em>Commonwealth, </em>the trustees of <em>Washington College </em>had no right thus to direct the disposition thereof: the Legislature alone had such right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-4\">But supposing the judgments right in holding <em>Baker's </em>official sureties liable for this default, it seems to us they are still wrong in the dates from which interest is adjudged. The sureties are not responsible for interest from the end of the year when <em>Baker </em>received the moneys, but only from the date when he committed the defaults. His defaults were only ascertained at his death. Had he held them till the day of his death, his sureties would have been exempt from all responsibility for interest. Therefore they can only be held liable for interest from the date of his death, for till then there was no default.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b154-13\"> Judge <em>Brooke </em>was a <em>member of </em>the <em>Cincinnati Society. </em>Judge <em>Stanard </em>had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> By consent of the parties in the Court below, the records of the <em>Cincinnati Society </em>were made a part of the special verdict, but, they have not come into the possession of the reporter.

The circular further directed, that the Legislatures should be solicited to grant charters; and the 6th section of the amended constitution contains a similar provision. The whole scheme, as contained in the amended constitution, embraced the loan or deposit of the money with the States; the management, control, and disposition of the funds by charter; a restriction that interest only should be annually disbursed; and a provision for the present security, and ultimate destination of the funds, when difficulties should occur by the death of members, in executing the intentions of the society. No charter was applied for or granted in <em>Virginia. </em>The society, as such, continued to manage its funds; and they were not loaned to the State. In this condition of affairs, the society adopted the resolutions of the 16th December 1807. By these resolutions, the standing committee was required to declare, when from death or removals, the society should be so reduced as to prevent a general meeting for the space of three years, that the difficulties contemplated by the 12th section of the constitution had occurred. The resolutions then proceed to make an ultimate disposition of the funds, when that fact shall have been declared; provide that when such transfer of the funds shall be made, existing pensions charged thereon shall continue charged and <em>paid; </em>and that'the General Assembly should be solicited to pass a provisional law for carrying into effect the preceding resolutions. The first question that arises upon these provisions of the constitution, and the resolutions of the society, is as to the mode they contemplated and provided for the ultimate disposition of their funds. Was an immediate and direct transfer of the funds to the college intended ? or did they look to the mode pointed out in the 12th section of the constitution, by a loan to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>State, and an appropriation of the funds for the purposes contemplated, through the instrumentality of legislative provisions ? The cotemporaneous expositions, both by the society, and its agents, and the Legislature, evince the understanding of all, at that time, that the latter mode was the one contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The funds were not given to the college absolutely, but upon the express condition that there should be established and continued a military <em>school; </em>and on failure of this condition, the funds were to be vested in the <em>Commonwealth, </em>to be applied by the Legislature, on like conditions, to some other seminary. This condition, upon which the endowment depended, was precedent so far as respected the establishment of the military school; it was subsequent as to its continuance. Whether under the charter, the college could have established such a professorship or not, is not, as it seems to me, material to the enquiry. The resolution looked to some legislative provision regulating the endowment; and securing the continued, appropriation of the funds either there or in some other seminary, to the object in view'. And to secure such appropriation, and the payment of the pensions charged on the interest, in the interval, the funds, according to the 12th section of the constitution, were to be paid to the State. If this was not the intention of the society, why was the Legislature to be solicited to pass any provisional law on the subject ? The college was incorporated, capable of receiving the donation, liable for the charges on it, and if, as has been argued, it was not precluded by the amended charter from adding another professorship to the four thereby provided for, there would seem to have been no necessity for the intervention of the Legislature, if the sole object had been to transfer the funds to the college. The fact that such law was to be applied for, proves that the society contemplated the transfer in the mode pointed out by the 12th section of the constitution, by a loan to the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>and a legislative sanction to the ultimate destination of the funds. So understanding their resolutions of 1807, application was made for the passage of the provisional law thereby contemplated; and the act of February 5th, 1814, was passed. It recites the resolutions, the 12th section of the constitution, and the application for the law; and then directs and requires the treasurer to receive into the public treasury the funds of the society; and enacts that the funds shall be held by the <em>Commonwealth </em>upon the terms set forth in the resolutions of the society, and 12th section of the constitution, subject to the future resolutions of the society; and furthermore directs the treasurer to pay the pensions charged on the fund, and any other charge of said society; <em>frovided </em>the same shall not exceed the annual interest on the fund; according to the 12th section of the constitution. The act, by referring in the preamble to the 12th article of the constitution, in connection with the resolutions, and in the second section, by limiting the payments on account of pensions or other charges, to the annual interest, clearly indicates the meaning and intention of the Legislature to receive the funds, and hold them for the purposes of the society, according to the provisions of the 12th section of the constitution. When they should be received into the treasury, the State assumed the obligation to preserve them, to pay the pensions and demands of the society, to hold them subject to the future resolutions of the society, and to dispose of them in pursuance of such resolutions, or if none should be made, then according to the resolutions of the 5th February 1807.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Whether the <em>Commonwealth </em>had such an interest in the ultimate destination of the funds as to entitle her to receive them into the public treasury, is not a subject for our enquiry. She has agreed to receive them for those purposes. She has assumed the responsibility of seeing that they shall be so disposed of, and this obligation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>sufficient to entitle her to recover the money, and preserve the funds for the ultimate objects of the trust. Reference has been made to subsequent proceedings of the standing committee and the society, to shew that by some subsequent acts of the society, or the committee, the destination of the funds was changed, so far as to require a direct transfer to the college. The standing committee would seem to have had no authority to change the disposition of the funds. That could only be done by the society; and the acts of the society at their meetings in December 1813, and December 1818, the first directing application to be made for the law; and the last, after its passage, refusing to alter the disposition of the funds, evince a determination to carry out the resolutions of 1807; and shew that the law which had been enacted, was regarded as conforming with the resolutions as understood by the society.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The standing committee, in their resolutions of the 19th December 1822, did not contemplate a different disposition of the funds from that previously prescribed. Their action was grounded upon the resolutions of 1807; and their proceedings must be construed with reference to those resolutions and the subsequent law. They speak of the time having arrived when according to those resolutions the funds should be transferred; and as the college had announced its willingness to receive the funds on the conditions stated in the resolution, they direct a transfer to the college not only of the funds, but of the books and records of the society by a deed, and that a copy of the assignment, with the resolutions of 1807, should be recorded in the county of <em>Rockbridge. </em>The reference here again to the resolutions of 1807, shews that no change in the disposition of the funds was contemplated. If a literal compliance with the last resolution would have involved a violation of the resolutions of 1807, it would have been the duty of the agent to conform to the provisions of the previous resolutions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>and the law, by delivering the funds to the treasurer. But it would be doing violence to the resolution' of the standing committee to give it a construction which would defeat the resolutions of 1807, when upon the face of the resolution, they declare they are acting in accordance with the spirit of these resolutions. The college was, by the standing committee, constituted the final depositary of the books, records and papers of the society. The transfer and assignment directed by their resolution, extended to these articles, as well as the funds ; and the assignment they directed, was merely intended to preserve record evidence of all the resolutions, orders and proceedings, which resulted in making the college the beneficiary of the society, and depositary of all its records. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">It seems to me, therefore, that the society looked to a transfer of its funds to the treasury, by the resolutions of 1807, in conformity with the 12th article of the constitution, provided the Legislature would authorize it. That to effect this object, the resolution of 1813, directed an application to be made for the law. That after the law passed, the resolution against any alteration in the former disposition of their funds was a confirmation of the law; and that the subsequent proceedings of the standing committee were intended to carry out those resolutions of the society, and not to change them. I therefore think the agent who had the funds under his control was authorized by the acts of his principals, in making the transfer to the <em>Commonwealth. </em>And further, that as the <em>Commonwealth </em>agreed to receive the funds; and came under an obligation to apply them according to the dispositions of the society, she has an interest in the subject which authorizes a proceeding at her instance for their recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">It is objected that the agent did not pursue the mode of transfer prescribed by the standing committee. It was not done by deed. This, it seems to me, is a ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tion not arising as between these parties. The law authorized the receipt of these funds. The agent having them under his control has transferred them. His principals raise no objection to the mode. If the treasurer was bound to receive and has received the specific funds, he becomes accountable. But the resolutions of 1807, and the law authorizing the receipt into the treasury, are silent as to the form to be pursued by the agent in paying or transferring them. Whenever they reach the treasury, by the transfer of one having control of them, they are there under the resolutions of 1807, and the law ; and are to be held by the <em>Commonwealth </em>upon the terms set forth in the resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">If then the resolutions authorized a transfer of these funds to the Commonwealth, and it was the duty of the treasurer, under the law of 1814, to receive them into the public treasury, it becomes necessary to enquire whether they were ever received into the treasury. The first acts of <em>Baker </em>are evidenced by his two receipts, the first dated \u201c Treasury office, 13th October 1824,\u201d and the second dated <em>11 Richmond, </em>26th July 1826.\u201d The first and principal receipt, was endorsed on a copy of the act of 1814; sets out that in conformity with its provisions, he received of <em>Maj. Gibbon, </em>the following certificates of stock belonging to the <em>Cincinnati Society; </em>and is signed by him in his official character as treasurer. The second receipt is signed by him as treasurer and trustee of the <em>Cincinnati Society. </em>In executing these receipts, did he act officially, and receive these funds by virtue of his office, having legal authority to receive, them; or was it a receipt under colour of his office, under a pretence of legal authority when he had none ? The condition of the treasurer\u2019s bond requires that he shall faithfully account for all moneys or other things which shall come to his hands by virtue of his office, and perform all other duties thereof according to law. The law contemplates that the treasurer may have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>custody of <em>other things, </em>the property of the <em>Commonwealth, </em>than money. For these, as well as moneys in the treasury, he is made accountable. The act of 1814 authorized and required the treasurer for the time being to rece^7e into the public treasury the funds of this society. These funds did not consist of money, but certificates of stock, evidences of debt. The receipt of the funds then was legal. He was required by law to receive them into the treasury; and when, as treasurer, he receives them, says he receives them in conformity with the act, and that act requires the receipt to be into the treasury, is it not clear that he regarded it as a receipt into the treasury ? The addition of the words, \u201c that he as treasurer received the funds into the treasury,\u201d would not more clearly express the intention with which the agent transferred, and he received, than is imported by the words used. Was it essential to charge <em>Baker </em>officially, and consequently his official sureties, that these funds should have been audited. The law declares that it shall not be lawful for the treasurer to pay or receive any money on account of the public, but on warrant or certificate of the auditor. These funds were received by <em>Baker </em>without any warrant of the auditor to receive them into the treasury, nor was any account of the transaction raised in the books of the auditor\u2019s or treasurer\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">It seems to me the provisions of law touching the auditing of accounts, and prohibiting the payment or receipt of any money except on warrant of the auditor, cannot be made to reach a case where no money is received or paid-. The value of the subject was uncertain. It might have consisted of plate, jewels or other articles. How could such a subject be audited and the amount certified to the treasurer ? The auditor might have given a warrant specifying the articles of property, whatever they were, and a receipt could have been given for them. But the law made this no part of the audi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tor\u2019s duty. It speaks of money alone. If, therefore, the auditor was not bound to audit, the receipt without a warrant was regular. But if this was not so: If the funds shouldffiave been audited, and this has not been done, how does that affect the case ? If the law required an audit to justify the receipt into the treasury, the treasurer violated his duty and was guilty of a breach of his official bond; for that binds him to perform all other duties of his office. He was bound to receive these funds into the treasury. If the law required an audit, it was a violation of duty to have received them without the audit. 1 do not perceive how he can be permitted to object that though the funds are in the treasury, are funds belonging to, or for which the <em>Commonwealth </em>is responsible, and as such, under his control as treasurer ; still they are not funds for which he is officially responsible, because they were irregularly received. The argument that the treasurer could not bind his sureties by giving his receipt as treasurer for money borrowed by him, or effects deposited in his hands, is certainly true; but has but little if any bearing on this question. In the case supposed, the <em>Commonwealth </em>has no interest in the subject. But if a public debtor, or collector, or agent, has in his hands a sum of money; the property of the Commonwealth, receivable into the public treasury, and through mistake or ignorance, he pays it over to the treasurer, who receives it into the treasury without audit, would not the treasurer be responsible ? The debtor might not be discharged; the money being irregularly paid he could not obtain a <em>quietus ; </em>but would the <em>Commonwealth </em>be compelled to resort to him for payment ? Would not good faith require her to pursue her own officer, who had thus irregularly received the fund ? And would it be competent for him to rely on a breach of his duty in receiving, to relieve him from his obligation to account: to discharge a latter official delinquency, by setting off against it a prior one? And where would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>such enquiries lead us ? Suppose in this case the treasurer who received, and the treasurer who converted were different individuals, and officially the officers may be so considered here. A treasurer then, in pursuance of this act of 1814, received into the treasury without audit, and therefore, let it be conceded irregularly, these funds of the society. When received they were to be held by the <em>Commonwealth. </em>They are so held by the treasurer who received, and he passes them over unchanged to his successor. Is he not responsible, and responsible officially, for them ? Could he be permitted to allege the irregularity of his predecessor as relieving him from his official liability ? It would not be pretended in such case that he was not responsible on his bond. But is not that the case before us ? <em>Baker </em>received these funds, except the note for 60 dollars for which the second receipt was executed, on the 13th October 1824. So far as the record discloses, the funds remained in the treasury unchanged during the residue of his then term of office. They passed into his hands the succeeding year, and though, in the first instance, they may have been irregularly received into the treasury, when they reached the treasury, they were held by the <em>Commonwealth </em>precisely in the same condition as if they had been transferred to her in absolute property. As part of the funds of the <em>Commonwealth </em>they went into <em>Baker's </em>hands under his new appointment. Being in the treasury, they came to his hands, by virtue of his office, and he was bound by the condition of his bond to account for them. Instead of holding and accounting for them, he, during the year 1825, converted the greater part into cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">It has been argued, the law requiring the audit is for the benefit of the sureties; they contract with reference to it, and have a right to require the evidence furnished by audit before they can be charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">The law, it seems to me, is a fiscal regulation, for the convenience and safety of the <em>Commonwealth. </em>If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>argument were sound, the provisions of the law would constitute part of the terms of the <em>contract; </em>and would be unalterable during the treasurer\u2019s term of office. The law now requires the payment of money to be made in bank on the certificate of the treasurer. It might with as much propriety be contended the sureties contract with reference to this law, and therefore a change could not be made. The contract of the sureties is that the treasurer shall faithfully account for all moneys and other things which shall come to his hands by virtue of his office, and perform all other duties thereof. The audit is one mode of shewing what money has come to his hands by virtue of his <em>office; but it is </em>competent for the Legislature to dispense with it entirely, and then other evidence must be offered. The law requiring the audit does not, therefore, enter into the contract of the surety. If, by other evidence, it is shewn that money has come to his hands by virtue of his office, it is covered by the condition of his bond. A different construction would be holding out inducements to a faithless officer to get possession of the funds of the <em>Commonwealth </em>irregularly, so as to relieve his sureties. I therefore do not think the failure to audit these funds can be relied on by the defendants in either of the bonds as protecting them from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The agreement of facts submitted to the Court below to decide whether the respective sureties of <em>Jerman Baker, </em>bound in his official bonds for the years 1825, and 1827, wmre liable for the sums of 5778 dollars 16 cents, and 2265 dollars 60 cents, with interest from the first days of January 1826 and 1828, or for either of those sums, or for any part thereof,- and if so liable, for how much respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The Court gave judgment against the sureties of 1825 for the larger sum, and against those of 1827 for the other sum, with interest as aforesaid; and it is insisted the Court has distributed the liability and applied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>credits improperly. As this branch of the case was merely adverted to in the argument, I have had some difficulty in satisfying myself from the agreement of facts, as to the scheme of the account. It appears from the memoranda left by <em>Baker </em>in the office, and admitted to be correct, that in the year 1825, he received from the certificates of stock, the funds of the society, the sum of 10,544 dollars 16 cents. This was a conversion during that year, for which the sureties in the official bond of 1825 were liable, except so far as it can be reduced by disbursements applicable thereto. In 1826, there was no conversion, but in 1827 he seems to have converted, and received as dividends sums amounting to 2925 dollars 60 cents; for which, so far as unaccounted for, the sureties of that year were responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">There were disbursements in payment of pensions, and for the purchase of bank stock, in each of the years from 1825 to 1828, inclusive. The disbursements of the year 1825, amounting to 3926 dollars, were properly applied to the liability of that year, reducing it from 10,544 dollars 16 cents to 6618 dollars 16 cents; and if I understand the mode by which the sum for which judgment was given was arrived at, this sum of 6618 dollars 16 cents, was further credited by the disbursements of 1827 and \u201928, deducting therefrom the 60 dollars, the amount of <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>note. The disbursements of those two years amounted to 900 dollars. Deducting therefrom the 60 dollars, there remained 840 dollars to be credited, which left 5778 dollars 16 cents, the sum for which the judgment was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">So stating the account, the 60 dollars, the amount of <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>note, must have been deducted from the conversion of 1827, and charged to the year 1825, or which is the same thing, deducted from the credits applied to that year. The sum converted in 1827, including the 60 dollars, amounted to 2925 dollars 60 cents; deducting the 60 dollars, and the disbursements of 1826, for which credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>seems to have been given to that year, and there remains 2265 dollars 60 cents, for which the sureties of that year were held responsible. If this was not the mode by which the several sums were arrived at, I have not been able to discover it: and I infer it was the mode be-<em>1 </em>cause the result arrived at agrees. But I am not satisfied with its correctness upon principle. The sureties of 1825 were properly held liable for the sums converted during that year, 10,544 dollars 16 cents; and properly credited with the disbursements during the same year, amounting to 3926 dollars, reducing their liability to 6618 dollars 16 cents. There was no conversion in 1826.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The treasurer held stocks upon which interest was accruing, and received by him. There were pensions chargeable on the annual income. The sureties of 1826, if there had been any conversion during that year, as they could only have been responsible for the funds in his hands, would have had a right to insist upon the application of the income from the fund to the disbursements chargeable for that year on that income. And so the sureties of 1827 would have the same right to consider so much of the income accounted for. It was therefore proper to apply the disbursements of 1826 to the liability of 1827, as seems to have been done; that liability being in part made up of 1265 dollars 60 cents, dividends on stocks, besides <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>note for 60 dollars. But I can see no reason for throwing the 60 dollars, <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>note, on the year 1825, as was done by charging it to that year, or deducting it from credits applicable to that year. The note was delivered to <em>Baker </em>in July 1826, and is charged to him in the memoranda as received in February 1827; and was therefore chargeable to that year. As to the credits, for the same reason that the sureties of 1827 were entitled to a credit for the disbursements of 1826, they are equally entitled to a credit for the disbursements of 1827. They are credited with the disbursements of 1826, because those disbursements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>were a charge on the income of the fund unconverted. That income from dividends in 1827, is charged at 1265 dollars 60 cents, more than enough to cover the disbursements of both years. I think, therefore, they should have been credited with the disbursements of 1827, equal to 550 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">As there were no receipts in 1828, the disbursements of that year must be applied to 1825, that being the first liability, and no application of the credit having been made by the debtor.
