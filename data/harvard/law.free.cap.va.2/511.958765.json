The warrant was issued, but not executed, ar1^ uPon ^ aPplica.tion of the company to the County Court of <em>Hampshire, </em>another warrant was issued to the sheriff of the county, who, in obedience thereto, went upon the land with a jury, and returned an inquisition to the Court, with a plat which shewed the location of the land condemned, and of the adjoining lands of the proprietors; and also shewed the location of the canal on the <em>Maryland </em>side of the river, and of a dam proposed to be built across the river. From the inquisition it appears that the jury laid off by metes and bounds, three acres, three roods, and fourteen square perches of the land of the appellees, to be held by the company in perpetuity; and they laid off in the same way, seven acres, two roods, and fourteen square perches, to be held for five years. And the inquisition then proceeds : \u201cAnd the jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, being met upon the said land, and having carefully examined the same, do say that they value the said land, and all the damages the said owners will sustain as owners thereof, by cutting the said canal through the same, and by the use and occupation thereof by the said canal company in perpetuity, and for temporary use for five years, at the sum of 5769 <em>dollars; </em>which is therefore hereby awarded the said owners.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-4\">The inquisition being returned to the County Court of <em>Hampshire, </em>the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, </em>at the November term 1838, of that Court, filed various objections to the affirmation and recording thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">When the case came on to be heard before the Court, it appeared either by the admissions of the parties or the proofs, that the land condemned lay along the west bank of the <em>Potomac </em>river, opposite the town of <em>Cumberland </em>in <em>Maryland; </em>that which was condemned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>perpetuity lying highest up the river; that the canal of the company was located on the <em>Maryland </em>side of the river, and partly in the bed of the river; and that the soil of the land condemned for temporary purposes was being removed to the depth of the bottom of the river, and carried to the <em>Maryland </em>shore for the purpose of forming the bank of the canal; and the appellees ad-milted that the jury took into their estimate of the damages the cost of protecting one acre and a quarter of ground lying at the lower end of the seven acres condemned from abrasion by the waters of the river, to which it would be subjected by the removal of the earth immediately above it. It appeared farther, that the appellees owned two other tracts of land adjoining that of which the land condemned was a part; and lying higher up the river; and that the jury took into their estimate the damages which might be occasioned to these two tracts by the making the canal in Maryland, and the building a dam across the river; though there was then no such dam built. And the bill of exceptions leaves it doubtful whether a part of one of the adjoining tracts was not considered as extending into <em>Maryland ; </em>and whether the jury did not estimate the damages which would accrue from the passage of the canal through that part of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\">After hearing the evidence, the County Court affirmed and recorded the inquisition; and the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company </em>having excepted to the opinion of the Court, obtained an appeal to the Superior Court for the county, where the judgment of the County Court was affirmed; and then the canal company applied for and obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-5\"><em>G. N. Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaC\">This is a proceeding under the 15th section of the charier of the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company. </em>The act chartering the company prescribes the duties of the jury; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and by their inquisition when affirmed, the title to the land condemned is vested in the company. The inquisition is intended to fix the price which is to be given for the land they acquire, whether in perpetuity or for temPoraiT purposes; and the assessment of the damages by the jury, is not only to give to the owner of the laud compensation for the injury he sustains, but to protect the company from any farther demands for injuries which have been already compensated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-4\">In these particulars, we submit that this inquisition fails. It states, it is true, the quantity of land which the company is to have ; but it does not state the quality of the estate which it is to hold in that part condemned for temporary purposes. The act directs that the jury shall ascertain the quality and quantity of the estate in the land condemned. The quantity is the duration, the quality is the, nature, terms, and conditions, upon which the estate is held. 1 Preston on Est. 622. If the land is condemned for years, but to be held on condition of removing the soil, as this was, then it should have been so stated in the inquisition, that it might at once be seen that the damages were assessed accordingly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOl\">The admission of the appellees, and the proofs in the cause, shew conclusively that damages, other than the value of the land condemned, are assessed by the jury; and yet the inquisition gives no intimation of the fact. The expense of protecting the acre and a quarter of land adjoining that condemned from abrasion by the water of the river it is admitted was included in the jury\u2019s estimate of the damages. The proofs shew that the jury also estimated the damages to two adjoining tracts owned by the same parties, which might arise from the building of a dam across the river; and it is even a matter of doubt whether they have not included in their estimate of damages, injuries which may arise to lands lying in <em>Maryland </em>by the passage of the canal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>through them. The damages to these adjoining tracts were not a proper subject for consideration by the jury, Their authority did not extend to them; and for that reason the inquisition should have been quashed. <em>James River &amp; Kanawha Co. </em>v. Turner, 9 Leigh 313. Hut ' t ' \u00b0 if the jury was authorized to take these damages into consideration, the inquisition should have shewn upon its face, that this had been done, that the canal company might have been protected from any future demands on account of them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-11\">Griswold, and <em>Cooke, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGt\">The first question to be considered is, whether either the Superior Court of <em>Hampshire </em>or this Court has jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-12\">Appeals and writs of <em>supersedeas </em>are not known to the common law; but are creatures of the statute. <em>Coopers </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 413. The enquiry, therefore, is, whether there is any statute which authorizes an appeal in this case. The act under which this proceeding is had, certainly, does not in express terms, authorize an appeal. The 19th section directs that the cases arising under the statute shall have precedence over all other causes in \u201c every court\u201d in which they may be depending. At most, the right of appeal is a mere inference from this provision of the law; and this Court will not rest its jurisdiction upon an inference. If the Legislature used the words \u201cevery court,\u201d supposing that there was a right of appeal, the erroneous opinion of the Legislature cannot confer the right. But the inference does not arise. The canal being ex_ peeled to extend from the <em>Potomac </em>to the <em>Ohio </em>river, it was to be expected that many controversies would arise, which would be brought in the Courts of the different counties along the line of the improvement; and therefore the phrase was proper, and has its full meaning in being referred to these Courts, without inferring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the Legislature had in its contemplation any appellate \u2022 \u00b6 <em>\u25a0, </em>tribunals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6EG\">The terms of the act authorizing appeals (Sup. Rev. Code, ch. 109, \u00a7 30, p. 145,) are, indeed, broad enough to cover every case which can occur in our Courts; but <em>J </em>' there are numerous cases which it has been held, though within the letter, are not within the meaning of the statute. Among these are orders for binding out apprentices, or in reference to them; <em>Coopers </em>v. <em>Saun</em>ders, 1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 413; the registry of deeds, <em>Mann </em>v. Givens, 2 Leigh 762; the granting ordinary licenses; the authorizing gates to be erected across public roads; tobacco inspections; county levies; and appeals from the judgment of a justice of the peace.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-9\">In the cases of mills, roads, wills, administrators and guardians, the act authorizes appeals as of right; and yet this Court has decided that no appeal lies from an order of the County Court affirming the report of viewers assessing damages under the law in relation to roads. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Salem &amp; Pepper's Ferry Turnpike Co., </em>1 Rob. R. 263.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-10\">There are, then, limits to the right of appeal under our statute; and. that limit can only be fixed upon any general principle by limiting the right of appeal to cases in which the County Court acts under its common law powers, or a general statute. 2 Bac. Abr., title Error, letter A, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 3; <em>Groenvelt </em>v. <em>Burwell, </em>1 Salk. R. 263, pi. 5. In this case the jurisdiction is given to the County Courts by a special statute; and they act, not according to the course of the common law, but in the mode specially directed by the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-11\">This question, though new here, has been decided in <em>Maryland, </em>in the case of the <em>Wilmington &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>8 Gill &amp; Johns. 443. That case arose upon this 15th section of our act; the act of <em>Maryland </em>incorporating the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal </em>Company, being simply the adoption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the act passed by the Legislature of <em>Virginia. </em>In that case, the Supreme Court of <em>Maryland </em>decided against the appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbYL\">The 15th section of the act provides that the inquisition shall be returned to the Court of the county, and \u201cconfirmed unless good cause be shewn against the inquisition.\u201d This good cause cannot be technical or captious objections; but must be an error of substance in the proceedings of the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-5\">In considering this inquisition, it must be taken in connection with the plat of the ground which is a part of the record. A reference to the plat makes the inquisition certain. It shews the ground condemned; the acre and a quarter to be protected; the canal in <em>Maryland, </em>with its bank running in the river; and it also shews the bridge and dam which were to be built.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-6\">There is, therefore, no difficulty in ascertaining the sources of the jury\u2019s estimate of <em>damages; </em>and, consequently, there can be no difficulty on the part of the canal company, in defending itself against a second charge for the same injury. The plat, as well as the proofs, also shew that the tracts of land were in fact one; and the damages to all of the land was therefore properly assessed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-7\"><em>C. Johnson, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARA\">This is an appeal from a judgment <em>inter partes ; </em>by which the appellant is adjudged to pay to the appellees upwards of 5000 dollars. If there is no appeal in the case, then the owners of land through the whole line of the improvement are subject to have their land taken from them at the will of the juries and the County Courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-8\">It is admitted by the other side that the language of our statute allowing appeals, is broad enough to embrace this case <em>; </em>and the right to appeal is not objected to on any grounds of public <em>policy; </em>but it is insisted that in some special cases the right of appeal does not exist, and that this is one of the cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>A party claiming exemption from a general law, should shew a good reason for it. He should shew that his case is not <em>within the spirit </em>of the act, though within its words; and it is not enough to shew that there are \u00b0^er cases not within the spirit of the act. It is not pretended that the act of 1824 forbids an appeal; and the counsel on the other side must, therefore, give good reasons why the general law does not apply to the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-4\">The cases'referred to by the counsel for the appellees, have no resemblance to this case. The case from 1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 413, in relation to apprentices, was decided under our former statute in relation to appeals, which only allowed an appeal where the damages or debt were for a certain amount. The case of <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Givens, </em>upon the registry of deeds, was probably founded upon the fact that the recording of a deed is a mere <em>ministerial </em>act. And in <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Givens, 7 </em>Leigh 689, this Court held a <em>mandamus </em>was the proper remedy. The case of <em>Hill </em>v. <em>The Salem and Pepper\u2019s Ferry Turnpike Co., </em>merely decides that in that particular case the appeal was not the proper remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-5\">It is said that the act creating the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company </em>is a special act, creating a special jurisdiction, the proceedings of which are not according to the course of the common, law; and, therefore, an appeal will not lie. This act is a public act. The corporation is not a private, but a public corporation, created for great public purposes. The jurisdiction of the County Court over <em>the </em>subject is not <em>new; </em>and the mode of proceeding by inquisition, and also upon the return of it to the Court, is an old and familiar practice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-6\">The case from. <em>Maryland </em>can have no influence upon the decision of this cause, unless counsel can shew that the statute regulating appeals in that State is similar to ours. Here, this Court has been reviewing judgments of the County Courts in cases of mills, roads, and the like, ever since the foundation of the government. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>cases are precisely like the present; and it would be monstrous to suppose that the Legislature would commit the great public interest involved in the work of this canal company, to a jury and the County Court, without any control or supervision. The case of <em>The James River and Kanawha Company </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>9 Leigh 313, is a case of the same nature, where this Court took jurisdiction, and decided the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-5\">The act under which this proceeding is had, contemplates the acquisition of land by the company for a temporary, or permanent purpose ; and also the acquisition of stone, earth, timber, <em>&amp;c.; </em>and the same mode of proceeding is provided in each case. Land is to be acquired for various purposes. When it is acquired in fee, nothing farther is necessary to be said; but when for temporary purposes, the enquiry must be made, for what is it wanted ? If it is said it is wanted for the purpose of digging and carrying off the earth, that is not a purpose consistent with a temporary use of the land. So in the case of an application to build a dam, it must be stated in the inquisition. So in every application for any thing under this law, the inquisition must state specifically, what it is that is wanted; and what damages the jury allow for it. And in every such application it must distinctly appear that every thing has been done which ought to have been done. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Smith, 5 </em>Leigh 611. In these respects the inquisition is clearly defective. No application is made to be permitted to remove the earth, yet damages are given for it. No application is made to be permitted to build a dam, and yet damages are given for it. And whilst these damages are in fact given, the inquisition says not a word about either building the dam, or the removal of the earth. Damages are given for a probable injury to other land than that condemned, for which the canal company would be responsible in another action; they are also given for probable injuries to other tracts of land; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>as it seems probable, for injury to land lying in <em>Mary- </em>and yet not one word of all this appears in the inquisition. To say nothing of other errors apparent on this record, for these causes the judgment of the Courts below must be reversed.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\"> The provisions of this section of the act are fully stated by Judge <em>Allen </em>in his opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b540-5\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AJqe\">This was a proceeding commenced under the 15th section of the act incorporating the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, </em>passed January 27, 1824, to condemn certain lands of the defendants in error, absolutely, and other lands for the temporary use and occupation of the company, for a period of five years. The law, after reciting that it is necessary for the making of the said canal, locks, dams, ponds, feeders, and other works, that provision should be made for condemning a quantity of land for the purpose, provides, if the company cannot agree with the proprietors for the purchase, use and occupation thereof, that a warrant shall be issued by a justice of the peace, to the sheriff, to summon a jury. The sheriff is to administer an oath to the jury to value the land, and all damages the owner shall sustain by cutting the canal through such land, or the partial or temporary use or occupation of such land. And the inquisition is to be returned to the Court of the county; and unless good cause be shewn to the contrary, is to be affirmed by the Court, and recorded. If set aside, the Court may direct another inquisition. The jury is directed to describe, and ascertain the bounds of the land by them valued, and the quality and duration of the interest and estate in the same required by the company for its use. And their valuation shall be conclusive on all persons; and shall be paid by the company to the owner of the land. And upon such payment, the company shall be seized of such land as of an absolute estate, or with the less quantity and duration of interest, or subject to such partial appropriation, use and occupation as shall be required and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>scribed as aforesaid, as if conveyed by the owner to the company. The same section furthermore provides for similar proceedings to procure earth, stone, gravel, or timber, necessary to be used in the construction of their works.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Under this act, an inquisition taken and returned to the County Court of <em>Hampshire </em>was affirmed, and ordered to be recorded. The company obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>from the Circuit Superior Court; and the judgment being affirmed, the case has been brought by <em>supersedeas </em>into this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">It is objected, that the Circuit Court of <em>Hampshire </em>had no jurisdiction to award a <em>supersedeas </em>to the order and judgment of the County Court, when proceeding under this act. No such authority, it is true, is conferred by express terms in the <em>act; </em>but the Legislature seems to have contemplated that controversies would arise, and might be depending in the different Courts of the Commonwealth under the law. The 19th section makes it the duty of every Court in which such controversies are pending, to give them precedence, and determine them in preference to all other causes. In authorizing this proceeding, no new or extraordinary jurisdiction was created ; nor was a new mode of procedure unknown to our laws, introduced. The County Court to which the inquest was to be returned, is the oldest tribunal in the Commonwealth; and the mode by inquest is that prescribed by the general law to condemn lands for roads, mills, and other public improvements. The slight variations from the general law in the provisions of this act were such as the character of the improvement and the extent of the appropriation of private property seemed to require. There perhaps was no necessity to obtain leave to erect a dam, as in the case of a private individual. That permission is conferred by the charter, whenever such a work was deemed <em>necessary; </em>and therefore no enquiry is directed as to the health of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the neighbours, the passage of fish, the overflowing of the mansion house, &amp;c. of individuals. It was not intended that such 'inconveniences or private injuries should obstruct the execution of a great public work this. But when the Legislature adopted this accustomed mode of proceeding, modified to suit the nature of the particular case; but in all other respects provided for its execution in the regular manner fixed by the general law, under the supervision of the established Courts of the country, it would seem that all the ordinary incidents attaching to such a procedure, attended this. When, too, the magnitude of the interests involved are considered, it can scarcely be conceived that it was intended to commit them to the unlimited discretion of an inquest in the country and the County Court. For whilst on one hand they might inflict most serious injury on private individuals, on the other they might arrest the proceedings of the company, if there, is no supervising power. If such a restriction was intended to be imposed, it should have been expressed in clear terms. This has not been done ; on the contrary, it is conceded that, from the words in the 19th section, applying to all Courts, the Legislature probably believed the power of supervision existed. Such, I have no doubt, was their <em>understanding; </em>and I do not think they were mistaken. The value of the subject in controversy, under the act of 1819, 1 B.. C. \u00a7 56, 57, furnished the measure of jurisdiction, and would have authorized the <em>supersedeas; </em>and the 30th section of the act concerning Circuit Superior Courts, Sup. Rev. Code, p. 145, removes all doubt on this head, if any could exist under previous laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The case of <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Salem and Pepper\u2019s Ferry Turnpike Co., </em>1 Rob. R. 263, is supposed to have disaffirmed the jurisdiction. The Court did not mean to establish any such proposition in that case. It merely decides, that in the particular case an appeal was not demandable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>as of right. It was not a case arising out of a controversy for the establishment of a road. The road, when located, was established by the law incorporating the company. Where a company is incorporated to construct a road, or other public improvement, there is no necessity to procure the leave of the County Courts, as in ordinary cases; provision for a just compensation to the proprietor for the exercise of this right of eminent domain on the part of the State, is all that is required. The controversy in the case in 1 Rob. R. 263, was not about the establishment of the road; that was not a subject of controversy; but about the compensation for the injury: a matter collateral to the establishment of the road. The party was entitled not to an appeal as of right, transferring the questions of fact as well as law to the Circuit Court: but to a <em>supersedeas </em>to correct any errors apparent on the record: and this was the extent of the decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">I think, therefore, the Circuit Superior Court had jurisdiction to award the supersedeas, and revise the judgment of the County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">It is further objected, that as the valuation of the jury is to be conclusive on all persons, and when paid the company shall be seized of the property absolutely, or for a less estate, or subject to a partial appropriation, as if conveyed by the owner to them, it is not competent to go into the enquiry whether the jury have erred in their valuation or not. When the valuation is properly made, it is to have that conclusive <em>effect; </em>but until affirmed by the Court, it cannot be said to be properly made. This confirmation is necessary to give it the conclusive effect. The Court cannot substitute itself for the inquest and make the valuation; but until its sanction to the valuation made is given, the whole subject is open for investigation. As much injustice may be done where the jury proceeds upon erroneous principles, as where corruption or partiality is shewn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The question raised by the objections taken to the inquest, is, whether it should be confirmed, so as to con-elude all parties thereafter. And on that question it was competent for the Court to enquire whether the valuation and damages were excessive ; whether subjects were embraced not properly within the scope of the enquiry; and whether the finding has been such as to confer on the company the title to the property, and to protect it from future actions for the damages assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">On the merits, without going into formal defects, it seems to me the inquest is fatally defective on its face; and that if we look to the evidence offered in opposition to it, it is shewn to be defective in several other respects. The law requires the jury to value the land taken in perpetuity; to value or ascertain the damages the owner shall sustain by cutting the canal through the land; and the damages for the partial and temporary use and occupation of such land. These requisitions are specific, and the inquest should respond to each, according to the principles of <em>Kownslar </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>Gilm. R. 127. The company desired to acquire land in perpetuity, apparently for the abutment of a dam ; though this is not distinctly stated; and also the temporary use and occupation, of a strip of ground on the margin of the river opposite the town of <em>Cumberland </em>in <em>Maryland. </em>The inquest assigned to the company three acres and upwards in perpetuity, but does not fix the value of it; and assigned upwards of seven acres for the temporary use of the company, but does not ascertain the damages the owner will sustain on account thereof; and then proceeds to ascertain the whole compensation to the owners for the value of the three acres and upwards, the use of the seven acres, and for cutting the said canal through the same, at 5769 <em>dollars; </em>without discriminating between the valuation and the damages. The canal, as it appears from the plat, passes on the opposite side of the river; and, therefore, no damage could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>been sustained by cutting the canal through this particular land. Whether the tract extended across the river or not, does not distinctly appear. If we look from the inquisition to the bill of exceptions, which purports to set out the proof offered, (though on this head it is obscure and almost unintelligible.) it is somewhat doubtful whether the jury did not improperly estimate damages done to lands of these defendants situate in <em>Mary</em>land, from cutting the canal through the same. It is probable the words \u201c for cutting the canal through the same\u201d were copied from the terms of the act; and that no damages were allowed for this reason ,\u2022 yet the evidence tends to raise a doubt as to what the jury really did mean. Their finding is uncertain: and the fact that a doubt exists on this head, shews the necessity of responding to the various requisitions of the law. It is, besides, of importance to the rights of the company that the inquest should shew the consideration paid for the land acquired in perpetuity; and to distinguish between that, and damages allowed for temporary use of the land assigned for a term of years: and the precise damages allowed for the use of the seven acres might be very material in any future controversy growing out of any alleged abuse of the privilege allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">When the evidence is examined, the uncertainty becomes still greater. The inquest should be so specific as to protect the company from any action for damages anticipated and assessed. The evidence proves that a portion of the aggregate sum allowed, and perhaps much the larger portion, was allowed for such anticipated injuries ; but the inquest discloses nothing from which it could bo inferred in any future controversy that such injuries were foreseen and provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Thus it appears, as well from the admission of the parties as the evidence, that the company desired the temporary use of the seven acres along the margin of the river for the purpose of removing the soil to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>depth of the river bottom, to be carried into <em>Maryland </em>for embankments, and thereby to widen the bed of the river. In effect to convert arable land into the bed of the stream. The inquest gave the company the use anc^ occupation of this land as if it had been conveyed. A conveyance for five years would have made them lessees f\u00b0r that term; and could not have justified waste, amounting to the destruction of the thing. If it was intended to allow for this destruction of the subject, as no doubt was the fact, the jury should have described not only the quantity of the estate, the duration of the interest, but the quality of it; the condition under which the company was to hold it; and the purposes to which'it was to be applied. The act in truth requires this to be done; and where it is to be used, not in the ordinary mode as a residence for hands employed, or a place for the deposite of materials, but in the mode here contemplated, it was essential the facts should be set out. As it is, the company would have no right to remove the soil or commit any waste; if they did, they would be liable to an action, and though in fact they may have paid the fee simple value of the land, the inquest would furnish no protection. It also appears from the admission of the parties, that the jury took into consideration damages necessary to protect the land from abrasions to which it would be exposed by the removal of the bank and land condemned for temporary uses. Nothing appears of this in the inquest, or could appear if a suit should be brought at some distant day for this injury. So it is proved the jury took into consideration injuries to this and adjoining tracts of the owners from the erection of the dam. The inquest is silent on this point. It should at least have ascertained the contemplated height of the dam, and the quantity of land that would be covered by the refluent water, and its value, or what was the injury or inconvenience for which damages were allowed. These matters the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>had a right to insist should be specified, as well to ena- . , ble the Court to arrive at a correct conclusion upon the question of excess, as to afford a protection against fux ... ture actions to recover for the same injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay9A\">I think the judgment of the County Court affirming the inquisition was erroneous. x</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">The other Judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">The judgment of the Court was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">It seems to the Court here, that said Circuit Superior Court erred in affirming the sentence and order of the County Court affirming said inquisition, and ordering the same to <em>be </em>recorded. Therefore it is considered that the judgment of said Circuit Superior Court be reversed and annulled, and that the plaintiffs in error recover of the defendants in error their costs, &amp;c. And this Court proceeding to render such judgment in the premises as said Circuit Superior Court should have rendered, it seems to the Court here, that said inquisition is defective in not distinguishing between the valuation of the land condemned for the use of the company in perpetuity, and the damages allowed for the temporary use and appropriation of other lands, and damages allowed for any other inconveniences which might be sustained by the owners. And furthermore, as it appears from the evidence, that the jury took into consideration the injuries which might be sustained by the owners from the erection of the contemplated dam; and also the damages which might be sustained in protecting other lands of the proprietors from abrasions and inundations to which it would be exposed by the removal of the bank and land condemned for temporary purposes; and also the damages which would be sustained by the removal of the soil from the land condemned for temporary purposes, and so converting the same into the bed of the river, the inquest was defective in not particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>specifying these various injuries, and the damages allowed for each, so as to protect the company from any future action for the same cause; and in not specifying th\u00ae quality of, or condition on which the company was t0 t^ie estat\u00ae 311 ^1 23\u00ae laud condemned for temporary purposes, as well as the duration of the estate; so as to protect the company from any other suit for using the land so condemned in a (manner inconsistent with the quantity of estate vested in them; if said estate was sought to be condemned and used for purposes, and subject to conditions not incident to a mere estate for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Therefore it is considered that the sentence and order of the County Court affirming said inquest and ordering the same to be recorded, he reversed and annulled; and that the plaintiffs in error recover of the defendants in error their costs in said Circuit Superior Court expended ; that said inquisition of the jury he set aside ; and the cause remanded to the County Court for another inquisition, and for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
