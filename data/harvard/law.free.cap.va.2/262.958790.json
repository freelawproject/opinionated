Johnson </em>five thousand four hundred and thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents without defalcation for value received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-14\">\n<em>Platoff Zane.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-15\">The defendant pleaded <em>nil </em>debet, upon which plea issue was made up; and upon the trial of the cause the jury found a special verdict, from which it appears, that the note was executed and delivered to the payee, at the date thereof, in <em>Philadelphia ; </em>that it was endorsed by the payee to one <em>John Stivers </em>in the City of <em>Louisville, Kentucky; </em>and by him delivered without his endorsement to the plaintiffs, before the maturity thereof. The consideration for the transfer of the note by <em>Stivers </em>to the plaintiffs is not stated in the special verdict, but the evidence on that point is given, from which it was agreed by the counsel, that the Court might draw such inferences as the jury might have done; and the Court below, as well as this Court, were of opinion, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>note was transferred to the plaintiffs as collateral security for moneys paid by the plaintiffs for <em>\u00a1Stivers, </em>and for liabilities they were under for him. It farther appears, that the consideration of the note was fraudulent on the part of the payee, and such that he could not recover upon it against the defendant !Zane; but that the plaintiffs had no notice at the time the note was transferred to them, of the fraudulent consideration thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">The special verdict also found a statute of <em>Pennsylvania </em>by which it was provided, that a note such as that sued on in this case \u201c should be held by the endorsee discharged from any claim of defalcation or setoff by the drawers or endorsers thereof; and the endorsee shall be entitled to recover against the drawer and endorser such sum as on the face of the said note, or by endorsements thereon shall appear to be due.\u201d And the parties agreed that the Court in deciding upon the special verdict, might look to and regard the decisions of the Courts of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>as found in the several books of reports of the same, upon the subject of the commercial law of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and the construction of the statutes thereof, to avail as much as if the decisions were found by the special verdict; and to have such weight as in the judgment of the Court they ought to have.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">Upon this special verdict the Court gave judgment for the defendant; and the plaintiffs obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-6\"><em>Goode, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHC\">after stating the proposition, \u201c That the holder of negotiable paper before it is due is not bound to prove that he is a <em>bona fide </em>holder for a valuable consideration without notice, for the law will presume that, in the absence of all rebutting proofs, and it is therefore incumbent on the defendant to establish the contrary by satisfactory proofs, and thus to overcome the <em>prima facie </em>title of the plaintiffs j\u201d for which he cited Bailey on Bills 499, 500, went into an examination of the evidence to shew that there was no satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>factory proof that the note sued on had been received by the plaintiffs from <em>Stivers </em>as a collateral security; and that it had been in fact received in satisfaction of debts due from <em>Stivers </em>to the plaintiffs, for moneys previously paid for him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASr\">But if the note had been taken as a collateral security, he insisted the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, under the authority of the case of <em>Swyft </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>16 Peters\u2019 R. 1; which he insisted should be followed rather than the decisions of some of the State Courts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ATV\"><em>C. &amp; G. N. Johnson, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYL\">insisted that the evidence established the fact, that the note sued on was received by the plaintiffs as a collateral security. Such being the fact, and this being a contract made in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and to be construed as influenced by the statute of that State, the construction which has been given to that statute by the <em>Pennsylvania </em>Courts, must be followed by this Court. And to shew that these Courts had held that the receipt of such paper as collateral security, was not considered as putting the holder on the footing of a holder for value, but that he takes subject to the equities existing between the original parties, they referred to <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Arrott, </em>1 Serg. &amp; Rawle 180; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>9 Id. <em>193; Harrisburg Bank </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>6 Id. 537; <em>Holme </em>v. <em>Karsper, </em>5 Binn. R. 469; <em>Betshoover </em>v. <em>Blackstock, 3 </em>Watts\u2019 R. <em>26; Petrie </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>11 Serg. &amp; Rawle <em>377; Jackson </em>v. <em>Pollock, </em>2 Miles\u2019 R. <em>362; Walker </em>v. <em>Geisse, </em>4 Whart. R. 252; <em>Depeau </em>v. <em>Waddington, </em>6 Whart. R. <em>220; Evans </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 Binn. R. 366.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">The decisions in <em>New York, </em>it was insisted, agreed with the decisions in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>as would be seen by the cases of <em>Bay </em>v. <em>Coddington, </em>5 Johns. Ch. R. 54; <em>S. C. </em>20 Johns. R. 637; <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>9 Wend. R. 170; <em>Rosa </em>v. <em>Brotherson, </em>10 Id. 85; <em>Bank of Salina </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>21 Id. 499; <em>Bank of Sandusky </em>v. <em>Scoville, </em>24 Id. 115. And the English cases from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Hinton's </em>Case, 2 Showers\u2019 R. 235; and <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Race, </em>1 Burr. R. 452: hold the same doctrine. <em>De La Chaumette </em>v. <em>The Bank of England, 17 </em>Eng. C. L. R. 356.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArG\">It was farther insisted that though there was a vainable consideration for the endorsement by <em>Johnson </em>to <em>StiJ vers, </em>of which the special verdict said nothing, that did not authorize the plaintiffs to recover, if they had not given value for the note; and for this principle, was cited <em>Hinton's </em>Case, 2 Showers\u2019 R. 235; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>3 Burr. R. 1516 ; <em>Holme </em>v. <em>Karsper, </em>5 Binn. R. 469; <em>Betshoover </em>v. <em>Blackstock, </em>3 Watts\u2019 R. 26 <em>; Knight </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>4 Watts &amp; Serg. 445; <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>5 Pick. R. 412; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 648.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b285-10\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Au5\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">The Court is of opinion, that the special verdict in this case is defective in this, that while it finds that the note of <em>Zane </em>was endorsed by the payee to <em>Stivers, </em>under whom the plaintiffs in error claim, it does not find whether or no such endorsement by the payee to <em>Stivers </em>was for value, and if for value, whether or no, at the time of such endorsement, <em>Stivers </em>had notice of any matter that rendered the said note invalid as between <em>Zane </em>th^*maker, and <em>Johnson </em>the payee and endorser thereof; and that the said judgment is erroneous for the defect aforesaid in the special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"ADxk\">Therefore it is considered that the judgment be reversed and annulled, and the special verdict set aside ; and that the defendant in error pay to the plaintiffs in error the costs by them expended in the prosecution of their writ of <em>supersedeas </em>in this Court. And the cause is remanded to the said Circuit Superior Court for a new trial to be had therein, on which should the jury find a special verdict, they shall therein respond to the enquiries indicated by the above specification of defect in that heretofore found.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
