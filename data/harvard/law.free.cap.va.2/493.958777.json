A party cannot claim under a will and against it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-10\">This was a suit instituted <em>by Part\u00edaw </em>administrator of <em>Henry H. Dickinson, </em>who was one of the legatees of <em>Thomas Dickinson </em>of <em>Caroline </em>county, and others, against <em>William W. Dickinson </em>the surviving executor of <em>Thomas </em>Dickinson, for a settlement of his administration account, and a division of the estate. It appeared, however, that the account had been settled before the Court of Probat, and nearly the whole of the estate had been distributed; and the principal matter of dispute in the cause, was one slave, which the plaintiffs insisted belonged to the estate of <em>Thomas Dickinson, </em>but which the executor alleged belonged to the estate of <em>Thomas T. Dickinson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-11\">It appeared from the evidence of <em>Mrs. Dickinson, </em>the widow of <em>Thomas Dickinson </em>and others, that in 1822 or \u201923, she, at the request of her husband, took with her to <em>Richmond </em>the slave, then a small girl, to be loaned to his son <em>Thomas T. Dickinson, </em>who was then married and resided in <em>Richmond. </em>When she arrived in the city, she sent the girl to her son, and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>conversation passed between her and him upon the subject \u00b0f said loan. <em>Thomas T. </em>died in January 1825, having previously lost his wife, upon whose death he ^^.g Up housekeeping, and sent the girl to <em>Mr. James \u00a3\u00a1izer </em>who had married his sister. By his will he disposed of this slave as of his own property. The evidence is contradictory as to what was done with her after the death of <em>Thomas T. Dickinson. Mrs. Dickinson </em>states, and this Court considered her statement as most probably correct, that after the death of <em>Thomas T. Dickinson, Thomas Dickinson </em>hired the girl to <em>Mrs. Sizer. </em>She certainly remained with <em>Mrs. Sizer </em>for some time. It appears that <em>Thomas T. Dickinson </em>being indebted to <em>William W. Dickinson, </em>the administrator of <em>Thomas T., </em>agreed with the said <em>William W., </em>that he might take the girl at the appraised value, in payment of the debt due him.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b513-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>1846. <em>January Term.</em></decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>In 1826, <em>Thomas Dickinson </em>the elder died, having made his will, in which he directed that this girl should be distributed as a part of his estate. And after making a specific provision for his wife, he distributed the remainder of his estate among his children. On this will <em>William W. </em>and. <em>Henry H. Dickinson </em>qualified as executors ; and subsequently <em>William W. Dickinson </em>sold the girl as his own property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">When the cause came on to be heard, the Court held that <em>William W. Dickinson </em>should account for the slave, as the property of his testator <em>Thomas Dickinson; </em>and from this decree <em>William W. Dickinson </em>obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-6\"><em>Stanard &amp; Bouldin </em>for the appellant, and <em>Berry </em>for the appellees, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\"> He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b514-7\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AI\">The evidence of <em>Mrs. Dickinson </em>and <em>Mrs. Oliver </em>proves that the testator of the appellant was in possession of the slave which is the subject of this controversy, within five years before his death; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>and that the negro was sent hy the testator to his son shortly after his marriage, as a loan. <em>Mrs. Dickinson </em>brought the slave to <em>Richmond, </em>and sent her to her son; but did not, as it seems, communicate the terms on which she was sent: nor does it appear that the son ever made any enquiries on this point. The omission of <em>Mrs. Dickinson </em>to mention the terms on which the testator sent the slave, could not affect his title. <em>Mrs. Dickinson </em>acted in this transaction, as his agent, and could only transfer such interest to the son as she was authorized to do by the delivery to her. At the most, the title of the son could only have been effectual by an actual adverse possession of five years; and no act of ownership in the mean time, on his part, could divest the title of the father, unless there was something to shew acquiescence or assent on the father\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The son by his will did attempt to dispose of the slave : and it is said she remained after his death under the control of his executor until she was sold to the appellant; and that although the father survived his son for eighteen months, he never asserted any claim to the negro.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">There is some conflict in the evidence as to the condition of the slave after the death of the son. Some of the witnesses declaring she was placed at <em>Mr. Sizer\u2019s </em>by the executor of the son; and that he alone exercised any control over her. I think on this point, <em>Mrs. Dickinson\u2019s </em>evidence is entitled to the most respect. She declares the slave was returned to the testator, and hired by him to <em>Mrs. Sizer. </em>Her position with regard to these parties, and her connection with the transaction, makes it most probable that her recollection would be more distinct than that of the other witnesses, having but a very remote interest in the subject. Her testimony as to the subsequent hiring, is confirmed by the will of her husband, in which he speaks of the negro as being then hired to <em>Sizer. </em>There is no evidence that he was apprised of any act of ownership over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>slave by the executor of his son. On the contrary, as the executor, whilst he sold all the other property of the son, did not expose this slave to sale, it is but fair to infer that the testator was not apprised of any pretensjon t0 the slave adverse to his own. The loan being established, it was terminated, if not at the death of the son, at least by the testator\u2019s will, which was admitted to record within five years from the time he parted with possession. And the executor being apprised by the will when he qualified, of the title of his testator, cannot set up the possession subsequently held by him against those interested in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The claim of the appellant, even if the question of title were not clearly against him, is equally invalid on another ground. The testator disposed of this slave as part of his estate. After making a provision for his wife, by giving her property for life, he directs the residue of his estate, and that given to his wife for life, at her death, to be divided amongst his children, of whom the appellant was one. He has come in under the will, and his portion of the slaves has been allotted to him. \u201c Suppose,\u201d says the Chancellor, in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Lord </em>Townshend, 2 Ves. jr. 696, <em>\u201c </em>a legacy is given you by one clause; by another, an estate of which you are in possession is given to another; while you'hold that you shall not claim the legacy. You cannot dispute the ownership.\u201d And in <em>Kinnaird </em>V. <em>Williams, </em>8 Leigh 400, this doctrine was affirmed by this Court. No question arises here as to the extent of the interest surrendered, for it is apparent that the interest of the appellant under the will greatly exceeds the value of the slave.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Baldwin, <em>J. </em>concurred in <em>Allen\u2019s </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Cabell, P. and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred in affirming the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
