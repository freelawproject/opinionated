Christian died, and then his sons, Jno. Christian of Rockyrun, and Charles Christian, who had been his overseers, as above stated, claimed said land, but by what title the witness knew not; that he had understood that said John of Rockyrun and Charles, sold the land to a man who sold it <em>to the </em>ancestor of the present tenants, and that he never heard of any claim to said land, adverse to that of the said Christians, and those who claim under them, until the present demandant set up a claim thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">2. The testimony of John Christian, who, being examined in Court, swore, that he became acquainted with the land in controversy in 1760, when it was occupied as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>quarter by John Christian, the father, mentioned in James London\u2019s evidence; that in that year the quarter was broke up, and the land put into the possession of sundry tenants, claiming under said John Christian, who, he'believes, held it every year, till the year 1773; that m that year John Christian, the father, being dead, John Christian of Rocky-run, his son, told the witness he believed the land was lost, that he expected to get it, and for that purpose had filed a caveat or petition; that said John of Roekyrun then requested the witness to take possession of said land for him, the witness expecting to buy it of said John; that the witness in \u201973 went upon the land, and finding it out of repair, did not occupy it himself, but put another tenant on it for said John Christian of Roekyrun; that afterwards, said John Christian of Roekyrun told the witness, as he thinks, that he had obtained the land, and had got a grant, or patent, or some such thing therefor; that said land was afterwards occupied by the tenants of said John Christian of Roekyrun, till he sold the same to a man named Grissom, who took possession thereof under the purchase from him, and continued in possession until he sold it to Thomas Powell, the father of the tenants, who some time after-wards died; that he had understood that the land in controversy, with other land to a considerable amount, had been taken up some years before the witness knew it, by the said John Christian, the father, together with James Christian and William Brown, the latter of whom survived the other two; that when John Christian of Roekyrun told the witness he supposed the land was lost, the witness supposed he meant it had been lost by the non-payment of quit-rents; and that John Christian, the elder, at his death, had several children other than John of Roekyrun, one of whom, to wit: William, was the eldest son, died about the year 1808.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-4\">3.

The commissioner\u2019s books of the county of Amherst, shewing that from the year 1787, at least, up to the present day, the land in controversy has been regularly charged to the tenants, and those under whom they claim; and proof that the tenants, and those under whom they claim, have always been fully able to pay all public dues on said land, and that from the year 1787, there has always been property enough on said land to pay the taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">On the part of the demandant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">1'.

A judgment of the General Court, on the petition of John Christian and Charles Christian, declaring a grant-issued to James Christian, John Christian and William Brown, for 3,986 acres of land in the county of Amherst, formerly Albemarle, on the waters of Rockyrun and Porridge Creek, to be forfeited for non-payment of quit-rents, and the land re-vested in the Crown, and certifying John and Charles Christian to be the first petitioners, &amp;c. \"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-12\">5. A witness, John London, who stated, that he had been present at several surveys which had been made of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the lands in controvery; that he was well acquainted with the boundaries of the patents procured by the demandant, and that he believed that the said patents embraced all the land in controversy; and that the same were now in possession of the tenants; and that ho considered the annual value of the land was 250 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-4\">6. An entry for <em>990 </em>acres of land, in the name of John and Charles Christian, made October 14, 1794; and the fur - ther evidence of said London, who swore, that the entry might or might not embrace the land in controversy; but that he believed the whole of it was within the patent of James Christian, John Christian, and Brown. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">7. Another entry in the name of Charles Christian, for 1000 acres of land, made September 8, 1794; which entry appeared to have been transferred to John Christian, and surveyed for him; also, the evidence of the same John London, who swore that he believed the whole of this entry to lie within the patent to the Christians and Brown, above-mentioned, but that it might or might not cover the lands in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">8. A paper signed John Christian, and Charles Christian, and dated October 28, 1795, authorising the assignment of an entry within the bounds of Christians\u2019 and Brown\u2019s patent, to Charles Christian; and the testimony of a subscribing witness thereto, proving his hand-writing as witness, but knowing nothing of the execution of the paper, or who are the parties to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">The demurrer, containing this statement of the evidence, was offered; and the tenants\u2019 counsel refused to join in it, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">1. Because they did not admit, that the evidence of James London had been correctly taken down in the demurrer; it having been written on the second day of the trial, though the witness, who had been examined on the first, had been discharged from Court, by the consent of both parties, on account of his age and infirmity; no intimation then having been given by the demandant\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>sel, that they meant-to demur to the evidence; though the tenants had gone through the whole of their testimony, and the demandant had examined the greater part of his.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-9\">2. That as the tenants would contend, upon the evidence offered by them, that the jury might infer a patent, to some one of those under whom they claimed, the evidence ought not to be demurred to, unless the demandant, would admit the fact, which it was the tendency of that evidence to prove, to wit: that there was such patent; which fact the demandant refused to admit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-10\">3. Because the demandant has <em>offered </em>evidence to repel that offered by the tenants, the truth of which evidence, the tenants do not admit. And</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-11\">4. Because the tenants do not admit, that the demandant has proved any title whatever to the land in controversy; they contesting both the credit and sufficiency of the proof to show that his patents cover the land in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-12\">The demandants\u2019 counsel insisted on the tenants\u2019joining in the demurrer, alledging:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-13\">1. That they considered, that the demurrer contained the whole evidence on both sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-14\">2. That the discharge of the witness was assented to by them on his declaration that he could hardly get out of the Court-house, and tha^t the tenants\u2019 counsel had his deposition; and because, at the time of his discharge, the evidence not being finished, they had not then concluded to demur.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-15\">3. That the demandant then offered to send for the witness, James London, who lived about eight miles from the Court-house, if the cause could be continued until the next day; or to suffer the Court to make any <em>change they </em>thought proper in the statement of the evidence of said London, if they thought it not correctly stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-16\">4. That the other objections made by the tenants\u2019 counsel were of a legal nature, to be decided by the Court. And</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>5. That the only difference between the counsel as to the testimony of James London was, whether he spoke of the sale being made, and title claimed by John and Charles Christian, or by John only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-3\">The Judge not being able to decide the difference between the counsel as to the evidence of James London, his memory not serving him sufficiently therefor, and it being proved that the said John London is probably too unwell to attend the Court again, and deeming it improper to compel the tenants to join the demurrer, the Court refused to compel him to join : And to this opinion, the exception was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-4\">On the next day, the demandant moved for a new trial, upon an affidavit, that since the trial he had recollected a witness, who could prove some declarations of John and Charles Christian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">This motion was overruled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-6\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-7\">The decision of this very case in the Special Court of Appeals, 6 <em>Munf. </em>233, is to be regarded, not merely as a <em>precedent, </em>but as giving the <em>law </em>which is to govern this case. But the inferior Court, by refusing to compel the tenants to join in demurrer, and permitting the jury to render a general verdict, left them at liberty to impeach the patent of Norveil, by any <em>presumptions </em>and <em>inferences </em>that they might please to draw. Thus the consequence, which the Court intended to prevent, would be incurred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-8\">The circumstances, leading to the presumption of the existence of a patent, are proper for a <em>Court </em>and not a <em>jury. </em>It is like the case of evidence of declarations <em>in extremis, </em>where the <em>Court </em>and not the <em>jury </em>are first to decide whether the party was <em>in extremis </em>or not. So in the case of a <em>lost paper, </em>the <em>Court </em>must first be convinced that the paper once had an existence, before evidence can be given to the <em>jury </em>of its contents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>This doctrine is fully confirmed <em>by </em>a ease in Pennsylvania, 6 <em>Binney, </em>416.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai7\">But, if the judgment of the Special Coui't does not prec^u&lt;^e the tenants from going into this evidence, the decision of the Superior Court was wrong, upon principle. The evidence of the tenants, goes to prove a possession from the year 1755. This possession was not regular and uninterrupted, but broken by the judgment of the General Court in the year 1774, declaring the land to be forfeited for non-payment of <em>quit-rents; </em>and the possession of the tenants after that period, was founded on the <em>destruction of the first title'. </em>The evidence can only lead to the <em>patent </em>in 1755, as the source of the subsequent possession; and as that patent has been defeated by the judicial proceedings above-mentioned, and the decision in this very case, in the Special Court, the tenants cannot derive any support from that <em>evidence.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">The first reason, assigned by the appellees for not joining in demurrer, is, that they do not admit, that the testimony of James London was correctly taken down. But, if there were any error in it, the fault cannot he imputed to the appellant more than <em>the </em>appellees, as he was discharged by consent of <em>doth </em>parties, and'the want of recollection of the Judge ought not to prejudice the demandant. Besides, it is not shewn that the error complained of, would in any manner aifect the decision of the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-6\">Second objection. As the tenants would contend, upon the evidence offered by them, that the jury might infer a <em>patent to some </em>one of those under whom they claimed, the evidence ought not to be demurred to, unless the demandant would admit the fact, which it was the tendency of that evidence to prove, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">,The answer to this objection has been given already. It was the province of the <em>Court, </em>and not the <em>jury, </em>to infer the existence of a <em>patent. </em>As the question belonged to the <em>Court, </em>and <em>not the jury, </em>the rule can have no application, that every inference, which the <em>jury </em>might draw, should be admitted by the demurrant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Third objection. The evidence, offered by the demandant and the tenants, is conflicting. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-4\">This objection admits of the same answer as the preceding. The difference between the witnesses is unimportant; and there is no ground for impcaching the credit or sufficiency of the demandant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">Fourth objection. This relates to the credit and sufficiency of the demandant\u2019s evidence, to prove that his patents cover the land in controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-6\">As to the point stated in this objection, the parties are directly at issue, and it being a question for the <em>Court, </em>the tenants ought to have been compelled to join in demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-7\">The Court were right in admitting the record in ejectment in evidence, in this cause. It was a suit between the <em>same parties </em>and for the <em>same subject matter. </em>The rule is, that a record is proper evidence between those who are <em>parlies </em>or <em>privies. </em>The facts found in that action, prove incontestibly that the possession of the tenants, and those under whom they claim, was by virtue of the patent of 1755, and of the judgment of the General Court, and cannot raise the presumption of any other patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-8\">Lastly, if the Court was right in refusing to compel the tenants to join in demurrer, they erred in refusing to grant the demandant a new trial. The verdict was clearly against evidence; and the objection made to the testimony of James London, if good, would only prove the propriety of affording the demandant an opportunity, to have his testimony taken again, under more favorable circumstances.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-14\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-15\">The tenants have strictly obeyed the decision of the Special Court. They have not brought evidence to prove that the land was not waste and unappropriated, at the date of the patent in 1755, nor did they rely upon the instruction given by the Superior Court, on the first trial. They merely offered evidence of long possession in themselves, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>payments of quit-rents, &amp;c., to lead to the presumption of a pri0J&gt; patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0l\">It is said, that the Court erredjin refusing to compel the tenants to join in demurrer to evidence. But, this decision may be supported, on many grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-5\">1. Because the demurrer did not set forth <em>all </em>the evidence, which is decided to be necessary, in the case of <em>Hoyle </em>v. <em>Young, </em>1 Wash. 150, in this Court. A portion of the evidence of <em>James London </em>is not contained in the demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\">It is objected, that the Judge did <em>not </em>decide what that evidence was. To this it may be answered, that it was not the duty of the Judge. It was a <em>matter of fact. </em>The practice of the Judges in England at <em>nisi prius, </em>to take notes of the evidence, does not exist in this Country. It is a mere <em>practice </em>not required by the general principles of law. <em>Here, </em>the witness is always appealed to in a question about his evidence; and the demandant, having consented to the discharge of the witness, cannot take advantage of his absence. The very consent of the demandant to the discharge of the witness, is a waiver of his right to demur.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-7\">2. Because the evidence was <em>circumstantial, </em>conducing to a <em>presumption </em>of the existence of a patent, and therefore proper for the consideration of a <em>jury.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-8\">The proposition on the other side, that it was the province of the <em>Court, </em>is denied to be law. The case from Binney\u2019s Reports, 6 <em>Binney, </em>419, is an extra-judicial opinion, and at variance with the decisions in Virginia. <em>Hardaway </em>v. <em>Manson, 2 </em>Munf. 230, and <em>Hollingsworth </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>5 Munf. 199, prove, that a Court cannot <em>instruct </em>the jury as to the sufficiency of evidence. The true principle is, that the Court must decide, what evidence is proper to go to the jury to raise a presumption; but, when the evidence is admitted, the subject is under the entire control of the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-9\">A demurrer to evidence is never proper, where there is any doubt as to the <em>facts; </em>but the party demurring must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>admit all proper inferences from the facts. <em>Co. Lit. 72, a; </em>5 <em>Co.. Rep. 104, Baker\u2019s Case. </em>The case of <em>Cocksedge </em>v. <em>Fanshaw, </em>Doug. 119, decides, that the jury only can infer <em>facts </em>from <em>facts </em>or from <em>evidence. </em>To the same effect, are the cases of <em>Gibson &amp; Johnson </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>2 H. Black. 187, and <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Pindar, </em>Allen\u2019s Rep. 18. No case can be found, where any <em>fact </em>remains in doubt, and a party is compelled to join in demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-6\">This demurrer presents numerous questions of fact. I. As to the point of <em>possession, </em>and whether that possession was <em>uninterrupted. </em>2. Whether quit-rents were paid. 3. Und er what <em>right, </em>the tenants held ; whether their possession was to be referred to the patent of 1755, 1775, or to <em>some other patent. </em>This was a question of fact to be left to the jury. 4. Whether the <em>entries </em>proved by the demandant, were made on the <em>land in controversy. 5. </em>Whether the land spoken of in the special verdict, was the same with that demanded in the suit. 6. Whether the demandant is the same <em>Reuben Norvell </em>to whom the patent issued. <em>7. </em>Whether the demandant\u2019s patents covered the land in controversy. The <em>identity </em>of the land can only be proved by <em>admission, </em>or by an <em>actual survey. London\u2019s </em>evidence, stating his <em>belief, </em>was a question for the jury to weigh. 8. Whether the patent of 1755 was ever forfeited. 9. Whether a patent had ever issued to the tenants, or those under whom they claimed. This was a question for the jury ; because, if they had found a continuing possession under the patent of 1755, of more than fifty years, the title of the tenants would be undoubted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-10\">- It may be objected, that the maxim of <em>nullum tempus </em>would render the possession of the tenants ineffectual against the Commonwealth. But, the first case of <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, 3 </em>Munf. 257, decides, that a possession of twenty years would avail in ejectment against the rights of the Commonwealth; and if so, a possession of fifty years must equally bar those rights in a <em>writ of right. </em>The <em>principle </em>is the same in both cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>A tenth reason is, that a jury might have <em>presumed s. </em>patent to <em>John Christian </em>and those under whom he claimed. The principles of presumption are collated in <em>Phillips on </em>Evidence, p. 124; see, also, 11 East, 488, <em>Goodtitle, </em>lessee of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>and their application to this case is direct. Courts have never fixed the <em>shortest </em>time within which a patent shall be presumed. It depends upon circumstances, and therefore proper for a jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aknd\">This principle is fully decided in the case of <em>Archer &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Saddler, </em>in this Court, 2 <em>Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>370. This presumption ought to be favored in this country, where titles are not as clear as in England; and the inclination of the Legislature on this subject, is strongly indicated in the general land law, 1 <em>Rev. Code, </em>330.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-8\">The special verdict cannot be received in evidence; for, it is a well established rule, that no matter of <em>record </em>can be proved, except by the <em>record </em>itself, unless you lay a foundation for the evidence, by proving the <em>loss </em>of the record. But, here <em>the patent </em>is only proved by the verdict. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-9\">The judgment of the General Court gave the petitioners an exclusive right to take out a <em>patent, </em>to which right there was no limitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-10\">The portion of the demandant is uncertain, and therefore it would have been improper in the Court to compel the tenants to join in the demurrer to evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-11\">It is a rule, that the demurrant should admit all the <em>facts </em>on which the opposite party relies; and all disputed facts' relied on by the demurrant, should be waived by him. Otherwise, the Court cannot compel the party to join in demurrer; for, the Court cannot settle controverted <em>facts. </em>The case of <em>Hyers </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>2 Call, 574, decides, that the demurrant must admit every fact and conclusion which such evidence may conduce to prove.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-12\">It is not yet clearly settled, whether these admissions are to be made in the first instance, and stated in the demurrer itself, under the direction of the Court, or whether the Court are to draw the proper inferences on the trial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the demurrer. The first mode appears to be most correct. Judge <em>Roane, </em>in his opinion in the case of <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>1 Munf. <em>22, </em>leaves the subject in doubt; while the case of <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>White, 2 </em>Wash. 203, does not militate against the doctrine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">The motion for a new trial was properly over-ruled. The affidavit was insufficient; and, as <em>James London </em>had been dismissed by consent of parties, his absence was not a ground for a new trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-7\"><em>Stanard, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVsL\">The question is, whether all the evidence of the tenants is not referrable to the patent of 1755, and the judgment of the General Court. If it be, it cannot afford a presumption of any other patent. To ascertain this, the Court will look through the record, as was done in the case of <em>Tomlin v. How, </em>Gilm 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-8\"><em>Presumption </em>of acts of Parliament, patents, &amp;c. is admitted as a <em>deduction of law, </em>on principles of policy, to protect long possessions. <em>Mayor of Kingston </em>v. <em>Horner, </em>Cowp. 102; <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Saddler, 2 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. 379, <em>Roane\u2019s </em>opinion; <em>Eskridge </em>v. <em>Cowper, </em>Cowp. 214; 11 East, 488. The cases cited to prove the opposite doctrine, will be found, upon examination, to fall short of the object. If the Court shall be satisfied, upon examination of the record, that the evidence is only to be referred to the patent of 1755, they ought not to have left it to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-12\">As to the practice in eases of demurrer to evidence, that suggested on the other side has never prevailed in this Country. The inconveniences of such a practice are infinite, and no one advantage recommends it. The case of <em>Pawling </em>et al. v. <em>United States, </em>4 Cranch, 219, is an authority in my favor. As to the cases which say, that where evidence is <em>vague </em>and <em>contradictory, </em>a demurrer to evidence is not proper, the foundation fails in this case; because, I maintain, that the evidence is susceptible of a very clear construction. In the case of <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>White, 2 </em>Wash. 203, the evidence admitted of two constructions, and yet the demurrer was allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1o\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>That the <em>Court, </em>and not <em>the jury, </em>are to presume apatent, is proved by the case of <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Halsey, </em>2 Bos. &amp; Puller, 206; 2 Saund. 175, note, and many others. <em>Ricard </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>7 Wheaton, 59, is to the same effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-4\">But, <em>possession </em>never is received as a ground to-presume <em>&amp; patent, </em>unless such possession is accompanied with a <em>claim of title. </em>The right, which the tenants claim, cannot be traced further back than the year 1774. All prior right was extinguished by the judgment of the General Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-5\">As to the <em>identity </em>of the land, it appears, by the <em>admission of the tenants, </em>that <em>Norvell\u2019s </em>patent covers the land in question. The special verdict finds that it is the same land; and, as that verdict was between the <em>same parties, </em>and for the <em>same matter in controversy, </em>it is clearly evidence in this cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">There can be no presumption of a patent, founded on a possession of eighteen years. <em>Norvell\u2019s </em>patent was in 1797. The tenants\u2019 title commenced with the judgment of the General Court in 1774. Take out five years during the war, and it will reduce the possession of the tenants to eighteen years or less.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">The Judge ought to have compelled the tenants to join in demurrer, although the evidence of <em>James London </em>might have been uncertain, as to some points; unless the importance of those points were shewn to the Court. The tenants ought not to be prejudiced by <em>the forgetfulness </em>of the Judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-8\">. <em>London\u2019s </em>evidence proves, that the land in controversy was covered by the patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-9\">As <em>to the </em>motion for a <em>new trial, </em>the Court are at liberty to look at the evidence in the demurrer, to decide whether the verdict was contrary to evidence; according to the precedent in the case of <em>How </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>before referred to. ' This case is free from the objection made in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>6 Munf. 125, because the evidence here was taken down from the mouths of the witnesses, but in . that case it was reduced to writing, after the trial.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AOUG\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\n<em>December 5.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b80-12\"> Judge Brooke sat in this cause, in addition to the Judges in the last case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A2i\">Judge Brooke,</author>\n<p id=\"AkL\">delivered the opinion of the Court</p>\n<p id=\"AWY\">In deciding this case, the Court disclaims the power to change or limit the effect of the judgment of the Special Court of Appeals; nor would it countenance any evasion of it by the Court below, in permitting the evidence which is set out in the first bill of exceptions, to go to the jury. No attempt of the sort is perceived by the Court. That evidence is not exhibited to repel the patent of 1797, under which the demandant claims, as in the case before that Court; but, to sustain it against a new title attempted to be set up by the tenants, and was therefore rightfully permitted to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. Upon the second bill of exceptions, the Court is of opinion, that the evidence offered by the, tenants, in the first instance, and by the demandant to rebut it, made a proper case for a demurrer. The evidence of the demandant is consistent with that of the tenants, from the whole of which the conclusions of law would be more correctly drawn by the Court than the jury. The first objection by the tenants to joining in the demurrer, would deserve consideration, if the error complained of in taking the testimony of <em>James London, </em>the witness, had been stated, and it also appeared that it would affect any of the questions to be decided by the Court, on the demurrer; but, it not being so stated by the party taking the objection, though jt is stated by the counsel for the demandant, that the difference between them was, whether the witness spoke of the sale being made, and the title claimed, by <em>John </em>and <em>Charles Christian, </em>or by <em>John </em>only. The Court is of opinion, that there is nothing in the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">As to the uncertainty in regard to the identity of the land in controversy; if the demandant is entitled to recover as much of the 433 acres, described in the count, as his patent for 6694 acres will include; the Court is of opinion, that it sufficiently designates that quantity, by metes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>bounds, to enable the Court to identify it, upon the final \u00bfecisjorL 0f the cause. The remainder of the 433 acres described in the pleadings, and supposed to be covered by the Patent \u00b0f the demandant of 1813, the Court deems it unnecessary to notice in the present state of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings, in which the verdict is to be set aside, and the tenants compelled to join in demurrer, and, if necessary, a writ of enquiry of damages. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Judges Green and Summers, differed from the rest of the Court, as to the <em>form </em>in which the judgment was to be entered; and Judge Green, submitted the following, as conveying the ideas of himself and Judge Summers : That there is error in the judgment and proceedings, in this; that the Superior Court of Law should have compelled the tenants to join in the demurrer to evidence, tendered by the demandant, stating the evidence of <em>James London, </em>in the particular in which the counsel of the parties differed, as the counsel of the tenants insisted it was. Therefore, it is considered that the judgment be reversed and annulled, the verdict of the jury set aside, and the cause remanded to the said Superior Court, for a new trial to be had therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Judgment <em>reversed, </em>and the cause <em>remanded, </em>in pursuance of the foregoing opinion of the Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\"> Note.\u2014Judge Brooke, remarked, that on the question, whether that portion of the 669) aere patent which was supposed to be included as a part of the land described in the count, is sufficiently designated, to justify a judgment, under the act for reforming the method of proceeding in writs of right, (1 Rev. Code, p. 464,) he differed from the other Judges. He thought there was nothing in the pleadings to warrant it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
