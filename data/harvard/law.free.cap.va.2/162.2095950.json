The appellee, conceiving himself interested, prayed an appeal, which was refused, because it appeared to the Court that he was no party. He then applied to, and obtained from a Judge of the General Court, a <em>superse</em>deas, which removed the record before the District Court of <em>Northumberland, </em>where the order of the County Court was reversed, from which an appeal was prayed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-7\"><em>Lee. </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b217-8\">Before the Court goes into the testimony, which is about to be offered in support of the judgment of the District Court, I must object to the mode in which the cause was carried from the-County Court. I believe it will not be contended on the other side, that there is error in the proceedings of the County Court <em>apparent upon the face of the record, </em>and therefore the appellee must expect to sustain the judgment of the District Court, upon evidence <em>dehors </em>the record. If the appellee had <em>appealed </em>from the judgment of the County Court, I admit that he might have been let in to controvert the propriety of the order, in the District Court, upon the merits of the case,, and for this purpose, he might have gone into testimony, because in such a case, the .Court might have taken cognisance of the <em>faet.t </em>as well as of the <em>law* </em>The County Court having refused the appeal, the party ought to have applied for a mandamus, or for a <em>writ of </em>error. But a <em>supersedeas </em>could carry only <em>the law of the case </em>before the District Court, and consequently if there be not error upon the face of the record, this Court must reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AjG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Marshall, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At7i\">The District Court may grant a <em>supersedeas, </em>or writ of error, and may receive appeals when allowed by an Court. A <em>writ of error </em>will give jurisdiction to the Court to examine into facts in the same manner as an appeal would, and so it was determined in the old General Court. The reason given by the Court was, that as a writ of error would lie in fact, as well as in law, and the power given by the Act of Assembly to grant writs of error being <em>general, </em>the judgment of an Inferior Court in matters of fact, might properly be examined before a Superior Court upon a writ of error. But a <em>supersedeas </em>only brings up a transcript of the record, and the Court is confined to such errors in law as are apparent upon the face of it</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ApI\">Washington, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-6\">The reason upon which the decision in the General Court is said to have been founded, does not appear <em>to </em>be a sound one, in support of the distinction taken between a <em>supersedeas, </em>and a <em>writ of error. </em>In <em>Eng* </em>land, a writ of error which issues from a <em>Superior </em>to an <em>Inferior </em>Court, can authorise only an examination of errors <em>in law. </em>If the errors be <em>in </em>fact, they are examinable in the same, not before another Court. A <em>supersedeas </em>in <em>England </em>is an auxiliary process, and in certain cases it is the companion of a writ of error, and does not remove the record at all. It is considered by the laws of this State, as well as by the practice of the Courts, as being similar in every respect to a writ of error ; either of them have the effect of removing the record before a Superior Court. A writ of error from a <em>Superior </em>to an <em>Inferior Court </em>to correct errors <em>in </em>fact, (except in some particular cases,) is as great a novelty in this country, as in England, and therefore it cannot be preferable to a <em>supersedeas </em>in cases like the present, where the facts are to be re-examined before the Superior Court. They are precisely alike., when the process issues from a <em>Superior </em>to an <em>Inferior Court. </em>In no case (except such as respects <em>mills, </em>wills, <em>roads, </em>and the like) can errors be examined into and corrected, which do not appear upon the face of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>She record. In those cases the Superior Court takes up the cause <em>ah initio, </em>and inquires into the errors both in law and in fact. It is therefore of no consequence, whether the record is removed by appeal, writ of error, or supersedeas.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b219-3\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"ALN\">having suspended an opinion upon this point until the testimony was gone through, reversed the judgment of the District Court, and affirmed that of the County Court, <em>upon the evidence.(</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>)</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-4\">(1) <em>Hite's heirs v.
