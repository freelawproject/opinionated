The case was \u2014 The testator of the appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>having loaned to <em>William Claiborne </em>a sum of money, he, together with Minge, as his surety, executed a <em>joint bond </em>to the testator for payment thereof. The bill states, that the testator of the appellee did not discover, until after the death of Minge, (who was survived by <em>Claiborne) </em>that the bond was <em>joint, </em>instead <em>of joint and several. </em>That <em>Claiborne </em>was at that time, and is now, insolvent; that the loan was made entirely on the credit of Minge, and that the bond was executed at a time when <em>Field </em>was not present. The object of the bill was to recover the debt from the executor of <em>Minge.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-10\">The appellant demurred to the relief sought, and assigned as cause thereof, that by the appellee\u2019s own shewing, the bond was joint, and that <em>Minge </em>died in the life-time of the other obligor. He also answered, asserting that <em>Claiborne </em>was in good circumstances when the loan was made; and avers that he neither knows, nor believes, that the loan was made on the credit of Minge, or that the bond was made a joint one, by mistake, or fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">The demurrer coming on by consent to be argued, was over-ruled, and commissions for taking depositions were awarded. But the cause being brought on during the same term for a hearing upon the bill, answer, and bond, a decree was pronounced that the appellant, out of the estate of Minge, in his hands to be administ\u00e9red, should pay to the appellee the principal money due by the bond (reduced according to the scale of depreciation) with interest and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-12\">From this decree <em>Harrison </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-13\">Copland, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-14\">The appellee having lost her remedy'atLaw, a Court of Equity can upon.no principle revive the duty, unless the bond were made joint by fraud, mistake, or the like. If a Court of Equity can do this, it can supply the want of a seal, or bind heirs though not named in a deed; in short I know not what the omnipotence of that Court may not do. Except cases, in which trust, accident, or fraud, are mingled, a Court of Equity cannot change the settled principles of Law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>Starke, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-3\">The relief afforded by the <em>Chancellor </em>in this case, is founded upon well established principles which prevail in Courts of Equity. Though the <em>remedy </em>be gone,, the <em>duty </em>in conscience still exists, and a Court of Equity will look back to the contract which preceded the evidence of it, and give it validity. The moral obligation to pay cannot be done away by any accident destroying the evidence of that obligation, or which discharges the party from the <em>legal remedy </em>against him. The claim of a <em>surety </em>to be freed from this relief is not well founded, since in all cases the loan is made, or will be presumed to have been made, upon the faith and credit of the surety. Questions of this sort, in the Courts of <em>England, </em>seldom occur, since almost all bonds in that country are accompanied with letters of attorney to confess judgment, and disputes like the present are never heard of, but when applications are made to correct irregularities in entering up the judgments. The bill states that the bond was drawn by <em>Claiborne, </em>in the absence of Field, and this is not denied in the answer. The case of <em>Acton </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>2 Vern. 480, affords an instance where a Court of Equity will grant relief, though the remedy is gone at Law. In that case, it was even afforded against an heir, who was not bound at Law. The case of <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>2 <em>Atk. </em>32, seems to be in point, and it establishes the principle I contend for, namely, that the Court consider the <em>contract </em>as distinct from the <em>evidence of it. </em>In that case, a joint bond was given, which does not appear to have been so made by fraud, or accident, and yet the executor of the deceased obligor was bound. The <em>Chancellor </em>presumed the bond was drawn by an unskilful band ; in this country, it is notorious, that they are generally drawn by such persons. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Church, </em>2 <em>Vez. </em>101, though it differs from the present case in one circumstance, viz. that the obligatory part <em>\\s joint, </em>and the condition <em>joint and several, </em>yet it establishes the principle laid down in <em>Simpson v. Vaughan. Probart v. Clifford, </em>cited in 2 <em>Vez. </em>102, is also a strong case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>We know that equity w\u2019ll set up a lost bond eva? against a surety, though the remedy be gone at law\u2019\u00bb So if <em>A. </em>and <em>B. </em>were bound in a bond to CV who should make the wife of one of the obligors his executrix, this would at law be a release to both obligors, yet a Court of Equity would relieve. But if I am wrong upon this point, the Court will, if the decree be reversed, send back the cause, that the parties may have liberty to take depositions, as the case was heard at the same term when the demurrer was over-ruled, so that the plaintiff belo ^ had not an opportunity to prove such facts as might give a different complexion to his case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-10\"><em>Copland, </em>in reply. \u2014 It is not true that a Court of Equity will afford relief in cases where the remedy is gone at Law, merely because there exists a moral obligation on the party to pay. Thus, where there is a deficiency of personal estate, that Court, no more than a Court of Law, can subject the real estate to the payment of a debt, how ever justly due. The ease of <em>Action </em>v. <em>Peirce </em>is unlike the present, because in that, the intention of the parties, and the mistake in the deed, were apparent. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>is bottomed upon <em>the loan having been made to both </em>obligors, and consequently, the contract, which preceded the execution of the bond, was equally obligatory on both, and imposed on both a moral obligation to pay7. This is the very ground of the <em>Chancellor\u2019s </em>opinion. In that case, the survivor became a bankrupt; and though in this case, it is charged in the bill, that <em>Claiborne </em>was at the time insolvent, or afterwards became so, the fact is neither admitted in the answer, nor established by prouf. The case of <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Stamford, Forr. </em>174, is in principle very much like the present\u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-11\">As to Mr. <em>Stark\u2019s </em>expectation, that if this Court should reverse the decree, the cause will be sent back for depositions to be taken, it need only be remarked, that the hearing of the cause without depositions was by consent of parties.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-12\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJO\">In this case, there is no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u25a0the bond was made a joint bond by fraud or mistake, or if \u00ed'iiy such did exist, that <em>Minge </em>was privy to the same\u00bb The chance of surviv- rabip was equal, and <em>Minge </em>ivas willing to submit to the legal consequences of such a bond. There may possibly exist reasons with an obligor for preferring a joint, to a joint and several bond, and it is impossible for this (jourt to decide whether such reasons did, or did not prevail with Minge. The law is laid down in the case of <em>Towers </em>v. Moor, 2 <em>Vern. </em>99, that in a joint bond, the duty survives against the surviving obligor. The case of <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Vaughan </em>goes expressly upon <em>the lending being to both of the </em>obligors. Amoral obligation therefore was imposed upon both, by the contract, to pay the debt, and if by the form in which the bond was drawn, the remedy was gone at Law, the Court thought it equitable to relate back to the moral obligation, which was equally strong on both of the obligors. But in this case, the surety was under no moral obligation, not having been a borrower of the money; and was only bound <em>by the bond itself; </em>no antecedent contract therefore subsisted between him and <em>Field, </em>whereon to found an equity for the extraordinary interposition of the Court of Chancery. The case of <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Church </em>also goes upon the lending being to both of the obligors. I will not say that there may not be circumstances which would subject even a surety to the relief now\u2019 sought for, but I am clear that the present case is totally destitute of them, and therefore I am of opinion that the decree is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Fleming I. \u2014 In the cases of <em>Simpson </em>v. Vaughan, and <em>Bishop </em>v. Church, the obligors were partners in the busines ; both had the benefit of the money lent, and the survivor became bankrupt. A stronger case could not have occurred to warrant the equitable relief granted by the Court. In the latter case, the <em>Chancellor </em>postponed a decision of the cause, that inquiry-might be made into the neglect suggested against the obligee, and it is highly probable that, if it had been proved, he would have dismissed the bill. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>case, Field, if he could upon any ground have been entitled to the relief he now asks for, would come into a Court of Equity with a very bad grace, after lying by so long as he has done, until Claiborne, the principal, has been reduced in his circumstances, and, as the answer suggests, is now unable to pay. Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that <em>Minge </em>was a mere surety, not bound at all in conscience ; and his executor being exonerated at Law, ought not to be charged in Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The President. \u2014 The case of <em>Action </em>v. <em>Peirce </em>in principle has no application to the present. A husband upon his marriage agreed to leave his wife 1000/, if she survived him; a bond for this purpose was dr aun by an unskilful hand, and was made <em>payable to the </em>wife, with condition to leave her the 1000/, In that case, the husband was by his agreement, and for a consideration . deemed valuable in law, a debtor to the wife, and under a moral obligation to pay. Though the remedy was gone at law by the intermarriage, and that, in consequence of the unskilfulness of the drafts-man, yet the husband\u2019s conscience was bound, and therefore the Court very properly considered him as a trustee for the wife. The principle contended for by Mr. Stark, that a loan creates a moral obligation to pay, which being a duty antecedent to, and independent of the bond, cannot be discharged by the loss of the bond, or by other accident, is true, <em>as to the </em>borrower, and the cases of <em>Simpson </em>v. Vaughan, and <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Church </em>are decided upon this ground only.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The Chancellor, indeed, in <em>Simpson </em>v. Vaughan, is made to say, that no stress was laid upon the circumstance of the obligors being partners. But this is certainly a mistake of the reporter, for in the case of <em>Bishop </em>v. Church, the counsel, speaking of <em>Simpson </em>v. Vaughan, says, \u201c the consideration your lordship went upon, was, that it was a sum lent to both, of which both had the advantage, and a debt arose against both from the nature of the transaction\u00bb\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>tills assertion he is not contradicted by the Chancellor, which would seem to prove that the lending and rowing was the ground upon which the decision in that case was bottomed. The principle thee of these cases has no application to the present. The surety received no benefit from the loan ; he was bound by-no contract express or implied, antecedent to the bond; he was under no moral obligation to pay, and of course Equity would not bind him farther than he was bound at Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">It is a maxim, that where Equity is equal, he shall prevail who has the Law in his favour; and the cases cited in <em>Francis\u2019 Maxims of </em>Equity, p. 71, as an illustration of the principle, are very strong indeed, to shew that a surety has equal equity with the obligee, and being discharged at Law, Equity will not charge, him.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">It is true a Court of Equity will set up a lost bone! against a surety; \u2014 but the reason is, that the surety is not discharged by the loss of the bond, and the Court only relieves against the accident, by setting op the <em>evidence </em>of. the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">It was argued that it did not appear that <em>Jlinge </em>was a surety. This is a fact not to be disputed, since the bill itself so states it. Bonds are sometimes so drawn that it is impossible to distinguish the surety from the real debtor; but when distinguished by proof, the uncertainty arising from the face of the instrument can make no difference in the principle. Since the Act of Assembly which gives to sureties a summary remedy against their principals, it might be well to distinguish in the bond, the one from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">It was contended that the demurrer admitted the truth of the allegations in the bill. It is true that a demurrer, without an answer, does admit the facts charged on the other side; but if the defendant also answers, and denies the allegations of the bill, as the defendant has done in this case, it cannot be said that they are acknowledged. When the demurrer was overruled, general commissions for taking depositions were awarded, of which the plaintiff might have avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ed himself, if he had wished to establish any facts important to his cause. But instead of this, he appears to have consented to bring on the cause for a hearing without testimony, and therefore there is no ground for giving him an opportunity now of taking depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">The opinion of the <em>Court </em>is, \u201c that the testator \u2022 <em>David Minge </em>having been neither the borrower nor the user of the money lent to, and used by Claiborne, but a surety only, ought not in Equity to be further or otherwise bound than he was bound by the contract at Law; and no fraud or mistake appearing to have occurred in the writing of the bond, it is to be consider - ed as a joint obligation, and subject to the legal con - sequence of <em>Minge </em>and his representatives being discharged by the death of him in the life time of <em>Clai</em>borne, and that the said decree is erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Decree reversed with costs, and the bill dismissed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-14\">(1) <em>Chandler's ex. </em>v. <em>Neale's ex. </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
