The land is equally subject, in such case, to satisfy a creditor, who has issued a <em>ca. sa. </em>upon his judgment, upon the service of which, the grantor in the deed has been discharged as an insolvent debtor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-11\"><em>David Agnew, </em>being the owner of a lot of ground in the City of <em>Wheeling, </em>he and his wife, by deed bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>date the 23d of December 1835, conveyed the same to <em>John </em>M\u2019Clure, and put him in possession thereof. The privy examination of <em>Mrs. Agneio </em>was regularly taken, on the day the deed was executed, but it was not admitted to record until the 21st of May 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-9\">After the execution of the deed, and when <em>M\u2019Clure </em>was in possession of the lot, but before it was recorded, judgments were recovered against <em>Agnew </em>by several of his creditors, and among others by <em>Benjamin T. Thistle, </em>who sued out a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>against the body of <em>Agnew, </em>upon which he was arrested, and in August 1840, took the benefit of the act for the relief of insolvent debtors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-10\">In 1843, <em>Thistle </em>instituted this suit in the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery for the county of <em>Ohio, </em>against <em>M\u2019Clure, Agnew, </em>and the judgment creditors of <em>Agneio; </em>and in his bill claimed that, as the deed to <em>M\u2019Clure </em>had not been admitted to record until after his judgment, as well as those of the other creditors whom he named, had been obtained, and <em>Agnew </em>had been discharged as an insolvent debtor on his execution, they were entitled to have the lot then held by <em>M\u2019Clure, </em>applied to the satisfaction of their judgments. He therefore prayed that the Court would fix the priorities among the creditors, and that the lot might be sold, and the proceeds thereof applied to the satisfaction of their claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Anh\"><em>M\u2019Clure </em>answered, stating his purchase, and payment of the whole purchase money, and the execution of the deed, and his possession under it; and these facts were admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-13\">The cause coming on to be heard, the Court expressed the opinion, that the lot was subject to the liens of the judgments; and directed a commissioner to ascertain the judgments which were liens upon it, their amount and priority; and upon the coming in of the report, made a decree for the sale of the lot, and the distribution of the proceeds among the creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number><em>Thistle </em>having died during the pendency of the suit, it was revived in the name of his executors; and then the commissioner having reported a sale of the lot, that report was confirmed, and a final decree was made in the cause, upon the principles before declared. Prom this decree, <em>Clure </em>obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-4\"><em>Goode, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_m\">The plaintiff having resorted to a <em>ca. sa., </em>and his debtor having been discharged by taking the oath of insolvency, the lien of the judgment is lost, and that of the <em>ca. sa. </em>alone remains. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>4 Leigh 425; <em>Foreman </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>2 Leigh 284. This lien of the <em>ca. sa. </em>bound nothing more than the interest which <em>Agnew </em>had in the land, at <em>the </em>time of its service upon him. The act for the relief of insolvent debtors, provides that all the estate which shall be contained in the schedule of the prisoner, and any other which may be discovered to belong to him, for such interest therein as he hath, or <em>\u201cmay lawfully depart </em>withal,\u201d shall be vested in the sheriff, for the benefit of the execution creditor. But our statute requiring deeds to be recorded, declares they shall be good and valid between the parties, though unrecorded; and therefore, <em>Agnew </em>had no interest in the lot in controversy which he could \u201clawfully depart withal;\u201d and which could vest in the sheriff for the benefit of the execution creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-5\">Our statute, which avoids unrecorded deeds in favour of creditors, can only be made available by those creditors who have such liens as would bind the land if the deed had not been made; and when, therefore, the lien of the judgment is merged in the lien of the <em>ca. sa., </em>the creditor seeking to enforce that lien, must make out his title under the act for the relief of insolvent debtors <em>; </em>and shew that this statute passes to the sheriff the land which he seeks to <em>subject; </em>or, in other words, that his debtor has an interest therein <em>\u201c </em>which he may lawfully depart withal.\u201d This, I submit, cannot be done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>2. In this case, if no deed had been executed, <em>McClure </em>would have held a perfect equitable title. He had purchased the lot, had paid all the purchase money, and had been put in possession. Is it the true construction of the statute avoiding unrecorded deeds in favour of creditors, that equitable titles to real estate are of no avail against them ? Certainly it has not been so held. And can it then be held, that this perfect equitable title is defeated, because, in addition thereto, the purchaser has received a conveyance of the legal title ? Take it that the statute avoids the <em>deed; </em>the equitable title still remains ; and it will be giving to a statute, harsh in its operation, the very harshest possible construction, if it is to be held that this void deed, is to avoid an equitable title, which, independent of it, is entirely valid.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-8\"><em>William Smith, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Att\">The statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99, \u00a7 4, p. 362, says: <em>\u201c </em>All bargains, sales, and other conveyances whatsoever of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, whether they be made for passing any estate of freehold or inheritance, or for a term of years, and all deeds of settlement upon marriage, whether either lands, slaves, money, or other personal thing, shall be settled, or covenanted to be left, or paid at the death of the party or <em>otherwise: </em>and all deeds of trust and mortgages whatsoever, which shall hereafter be made and executed, shall be void as to all creditors, and subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless they shall be acknowledged and proved, and lodged with the clerk, to be recorded according to the directions of this act; but the same as between the parties and their heirs, and as to all subsequent purchasers with notice thereof, or without valuable consideration, shall nevertheless be valid and binding.\u201d The language of the statute is plain; and indeed it has received a judicial construction, by which it is established that creditors, whether with or without notice of the deed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>are embraced within its provisions. <em>Guerrant </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>4 Rand. 208. The simple enquiries, therefore, are: Are the claimants here creditors of <em>Agnew </em>? And was the deed to <em>M\u2019Clure </em>recorded? If the first enfiuiry *s aQswered in the affirmative, and the second in the negative, as they must be, then I submit, the question is settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-4\">But it is said that the lien of <em>Thistle\u2019s </em>judgment is merged in the lien of the <em>ca. sa.; </em>and that this last does not bind the property. The mode of argument adopted by the counsel for the appellant, has been attempted before, but without success. In the case of <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Long, </em>6 Rand. 735, it was insisted that a fraudulent deed was valid between the parties; and, therefore, that the grantor had no interest in the property thereby conveyed, which he might \u201clawfully depart withal,\u201d but the Court decided against the argument, and held that the sheriff was entitled to recover the property conveyed by the fraudulent deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">2. It is said, however, that although the deed is void, <em>M\u2019 Clure's </em>equitable title to the lot is good against creditors. I submit, that his equitable title was merged in his legal title on the execution of the deed to him; and that in no case decided under this statute, is any countenance given to the idea, that the legal and equitable title may be separated, and whilst the first is void, the latter may be valid against creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">It has been decided by the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, </em>in the case of <em>Bayley </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, 7 </em>Wheat. 46, and by this Court in <em>Moore &amp; als. </em>v. <em>Holcombe &amp; als., </em>3 Leigh 597, that the judgment lien has priority over the equitable lien of the vendor for the purchase money. The principle of these decisions is decisive of this question. The legal title of the grantee being void as to creditors, his equitable title must be void as against the legal lien of the judgment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b206-7\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Af6\">Affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
