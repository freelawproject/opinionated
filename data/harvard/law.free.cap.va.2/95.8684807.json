At the trial of the cause, in 1802, the plaintiff (now appellee) produced in evidence a mortgage bearing date the 2d of <em>July, 1792, </em>by which the defendant, (now appellant) conveyed the lot in question to secure the payment of three hundred pounds, <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency, on or before the 1st day of <em>January, </em>1802, with interest from the 1st day of <em>January, </em>1792, \u201c and that \u201c interest to be paid yearly and every year.\u201d Then follows a covenant on the part of the mortgagor, that he will pay the principal at the stipulated time, together with the legal interest yearly and every year, <em>if lawfully demanded; </em>which words, \u201c if lawfully demanded,\u201d interlined, were also covenants for the entry of the mortgagee on failure of payment; and the quiet enjoyment of the mortgagor, till such failure. Whereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel required of the plaintiff to shew further in evidence, that a demand had been made of the defendant for the interest mentioned in the said deed ; but the plaintiff not being able to prove such a demand, tbe plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved tbe Court to instruct the Jury that such a demand should have preceded the commencement of the suit by the lessor; of the plaintiff; and, therefore, that the law was for the defendant. But tbe Court instructed the Jury <em>that such a demand was not necessary. </em>To this opinion the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted ; and there having been a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Williams, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeW\">In this case the mortgaged had provided his own remedy ; that if the interest waS not paid <em>on </em>demand, he should have a right of entry. The case comes completely within the reason of the rule of law where a right of re-entry is given on the non-payment of rent. If a demand be not proved, there is no question but that the party cannot recover.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-8\">Hay, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdQ\"><em>There is </em>a distinction <em>between </em>a <em>debt </em>bearing interest, and <em>rent. </em>In the former case, it is the duty of the debtor to seek his creditor if within the four seas, as it is expressed by the <em>English </em>authorities : and make payment. This is expressly stated by Littleton, sect. 340. in reference to this very question between mortgagor and mortgagee. This being laid down as a general position applicable to debtors and creditors, the only inquiry is, whether the words, \u201c <em>if lawfully </em>demanded,\u201d make any difference. He contended that they did not. This was a covenant for the payment of a certain sum of money, with interest <em>annually. </em>Under the general rule just laid down, the debtor was bound to seek his creditor, and pay him the money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-9\">Though he had not been able to find any case directly in point, yet, from the reasons already given, as well as from a reference to good pleading, which is said by Lord <em>Coke </em>to be the best evidence of the law, the appellee was clearly entitled to recover. In an action of debt upon a bond, it is the constant practice to declare for a debt to be paid when lawfully demanded. Now it is well known that the plaintiff is not bound to prove a demand. So in an action upon a note, payable on demand, it is not necessary to prove a demand ; the bringing of the suit is sufficient.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-10\"><em>Page, </em>in reply, said, that if the words <em>\u201c if lawfully de- </em>\u201c <em>manded,\u201d </em>had not been inserted in the mortgage, he should still contend that a demand was necessary.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> With respect to the doctrine of re-entry on the non-payment of rent, it is expressly laid dcrwu in the authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>just cited, that a demand is necessary; and diere is a strong analogy between this case, and that of rent, upon the failure to pay which, the estate of the tenant is defeated. It will be observed, on inspecting the deed, that these words, \u201c <em>if lawfully demanded! </em>were interlined, and may be regarded as the final agreement of the parties. The eiFect of this suit was to divest the mortgagor of the land, which brings the case fully within the reason of the law which always requires a demand where there is a clause of re-entry on the non-payment of rent. The case of a simple debt is totally unlike the present.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b112-11\"> 1 <em>Esp. N.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b113-3\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"A0YB\">The sole question in this cause is, whether if a deed of mortgage contain a covenant to pay Interest annually, <em>if lawfully demanded ; </em>and that in case of failure, the mortgagee may at all times, <em>after default </em>shall be made in the performance of the proviso or condition, of the mortgage, enter into the premises ; and further, that <em>until </em>default, the mortgagor shall hold the premises ; it is incumbent on the mortgagee to <em>prove a demand </em>of interest in arrear, before he can maintain an ejectment ?</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">There can be no doubt, that the condition to pay interest annually, imposes upon the debtor in case of a mortgage, the duty and necessity of finding out his creditor, and paying or tendering him the money on the day it becomes due, if he would avoid the forfeiture of his estate, unless there be some further stipulation or agreement, between the parties, whereby this general rule of law may be waived. As if the agreement be to pay the interest at a certain place, and at a certain hour ; in that case the mortgagor is not bound to go to any other place, nor to stay beyond the hour agreed upon. Because here the mortgagee, or creditor has waived the privilege of being sought wherever he may be within the state.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> So may he waive by his own agreement, the privilege of being sought at any par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ticular time or place, by an agreement that no forfeiture shall be incurred, <em>until a demand be made. </em>In this case, if he would take an advantage of the condition to enter into the lands in default of payment of the interest, it is incumbent on him to prove a <em>demand of it. </em>I will not say whether the demand in such a case <em>ought to be made upon the mortgaged premises, </em>since the case does not require that question to be decided. But I am clearly of opinion, upon this bill of exceptions that the plaintiff ought to have proved a demand, or at least that he had sought the defendant upon the mortgaged premises, and could not find him to demand the money of him personally. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment be reversed, and a new trial awarded; with directions to the Court to instruct the Jury accordingly.</p>\n<author id=\"b114-3\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"ABd\">The principal money due by the mortgage, in this case, was payable on or before the first day of <em>January, </em>1802, with interest yearly and every year from the first of January, 1792. The lease declared upon is of the <em>first of January, </em>1801, and the entry made in pursuance thereof is stated to have been on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u2022At the time of the lease and entry, therefore, the principal money was not due, and tire forfeiture which is set up, is not predicated upon <em>its </em>non-payment with the interest: it is predicated upon the non-payment of some of the annual interest reserved by the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"A-x\">Admitting the general law to be as the appellee\u2019s counsel has stated it, the maxim <em>modus ei comoentio vincunt legem, </em>overrules it as applying to this case. It was covenanted that the interest should be paid yearly and every year until the principal became due: but inasmuch as this might be too rigorous and too troublesome in relation to the debtor, and no object with the creditor, it was <em>further </em>agreed, that the non-payment of the interest <em>annually </em>should be no cause of forfeiture, and give no right cf entry, unless such interest was <em>\" larwfully demanded\u201d </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>construction, which is sufficiently apparent on the face of the deed, is confirmed by the consideration, that the words \u201c if lawfully demanded\",\u201d were interlined after the agreement had been originally written, as if to exclude all doubt upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I am therefore of opinion, that the instruction of the District Court was erroneous, and that the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b115-6\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ6U\">This suit was brought for a forfeiture Incurred by the non-payment of interest before the principal debt, which the mortgage was intended to secure, became due, so that the forfeiture respected the interest only; and there being an express stipulation or proviso, that the annual interest should be lawfully demanded, before a forfeiture could be incurred, and no such demand having been proved at die trial, though required by the defendant, the Court erred in giving judgment for the plaintiff; I therefore concur in opinion, that the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The following was entered as the judgment of the Court t u That it was incumbent on the appellee to prove a demand \u201c of the appellant for payment of the interest in the bill of u exceptions mentioned prior to the commencement of his &lt;\u00a3 suit, and that the District Court erred in instructing the \u201c Jury, that proof of such demand was not necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Judgment of the District Court reversed, with instructions, &amp;c.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b113-10\"> Litt. sect. 340, 341.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
