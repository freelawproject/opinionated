Peyton </em>and <em>John P. </em>Harrison,) on a bond executed by them <em>to the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia and his </em>successors, on the <em>12th of September, </em>1803, in the penalty of 4,000 dollars, the condition of which recited the appointment of the said <em>Henry </em>Peyton, to continue in the office of inspector at <em>Aquia </em>warehouse, and the obligation to be void on his faithfully executing die duties of his office, as inspector at the said warehouse. The declaration is on the penalty, in the usual form : and the breaches assigned are, that the said <em>Henry </em>did not, as inspector of <em>Aquia </em>warehouse, faithfully execute the duties of his office, in this, that, while acting in his .said office as inspector, he refused to deliver to <em>John Goolrick </em>a quantity of Tobacco, for which the said <em>Goolrick </em>held notes, and which notes he presented to the said <em>Peyton </em>at <em>Aquia </em>warehouse, and tendered him in the current coin of this Commonwealth, all duties and charges on the said tobacco according to law\u00bb And further, because said <em>Peyton, </em>acting in his office afore- ' said, did re-mark and change, and cause to be re-marked and changed, the numbers and marks of certain hogsheads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>of tobacco, contrary to the act of Assembly in that case made and provided. The issue was made up on the plea of \u201c <em>conditions performed.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">The parties, by their counsel, on the 13 th of <em>August, </em>1805, <em>agreed a </em>case, in substance as follows: That, on the 8th of February, 1796, <em>Henry Peyton </em>and <em>Alexander Geddes </em>were duly appointed and qualified as inspectors of tobacco at <em>Aquia </em>warehouse, which is a public warehouse, established by law, and so continued on the 4th of Avgust, 1804, (when the malfeazance occurred, which is the subject of this action.) That they continued inspectors of tobacco at the said warehouse, till the 12th of September, 1803, when they were re-appointed, by the County Court of Stafford., and said <em>Henry Peyton </em>accordingly qualified, and together with <em>Samuel H. </em>Peyton, and <em>John Peyton </em>Harrison, entered into a bond, (which was set forth in <em>htec </em>verba, and was in conformity with the 14th sect, of the \u201c Act reducing into \u201c one, the several acts of Assembly for the inspection of to- \u201c bacco,\u201d)<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> which said bond was of record in the County Court of Stafford., not annulled or avoided. That on the said 4th day of <em>August, </em>1804, the said inspectors, in the due-discharge of the functions of their office, issued four notes for tobacco lodged in their warehouse, (as specifically described,) which notes came into the hands of <em>John Goolrick </em>in due course of trade, for whose benefit the above suit is instituted, who being possessed thereof as of his own pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>perty, did, on the 4th of <em>August, </em>1804, at the warehouse <em>of Aquia, </em>at which the said <em>Peyton </em>and <em>Geddes </em>were inspectors, present the said notes to them, and demand the tQbacco for which they were issued, informing them that he wished to export the same; and tendered all the charges which were of right demandable thereon. Yet the said <em>Peyton </em>and <em>Geddes, </em>though they admitted the notes which he presented to be genuine, and to have been duly issued by themselves, refused to deliver the said tobacco, alleging that there was none such in their warehouse. And, in truth, the said inspectors had disabled themselves from complying with said demand, by having delivered to other persons, not entitled thereto, the tobacco for which the said notes purported to have issued; and, moreover, having delivered to various claimants, all the tobacco which they had heretofore received into their warehouse. It was further agreed that, if the opinion of the Court should be for the plaintiff, on the above case, judgment should be entered for him against the defendants, for the debt in the declaration mentioned, to be discharged by the payment of 303 dols. 91 cts. with interest from that day, (the 13th of <em>August, </em>1805,) till paid, and the costs, for the benefit of <em>John </em>Goolrick, the real plaintiff; but, if for the defendant, then, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2c\">The County Court gave judgment for the plaintiff: from which an appeal was taken to the District Court: where the parties, by their counsel, entered of r\u00e9cord an agreement, that all errors in form and in pleading, should be waived and released, and that \u201c judgment should be given \u201c according to the very right of the case, upon the ques- \u201c tion of the liability of the defendants, <em>Samuel H.

That opinion went the full length of establishing the position for which he contended, that any person injured might institute a suit on the bond given by an inspector of tobacco, notwithstanding the law directed that it should be recorded in the County and transmitted to the treasurer, and did not, in express terms, authorise, an action upon it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-8\"><em>Williams, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEoa\">The single question for the consideration of the Court is, whether a party can, in the name of the Governor, recover in an action of debt upon an inspector\u2019s bond, for the non-delivery of tobacco.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-9\">The acts of Assembly in most cases, where they direct that bond shall be given for the performance of an office or duty, give an action, in express words, to the party in - lured. But in the case of inspectors of tobacco, the law merely directs that the bond shall be made payable to the Governor and his successors, shall be recorded in the County, and transmitted to the treasurer. It is not like other bonds which are to be lodged in the office ; but it is to be sent to the treasurer for the mere purpose of enabling him to recover the duties payable to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-10\">By the twenty-first section of the tobacco-law,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the remedy is given against inspectors, for the non-delivery of tobacco ; not by an action on the bond, but by an action on the statute, for double the value of the tobacco so refused tobe delivered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-11\">In the case of bonds given by executors and administrators, sheriffs, clerics, See. the law expressly gives an action to the party injured. If it had been the intention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Legislature that an action should be maintained on a bond, executed by an inspector of tobacco, the law would not have been silent on the subject; and some provision would have been made for giving a copy of the bond in evidence. The original cannot be had; for that is to be lodged with the treasurer. And it cannot be presumed that he would, be compellable to attend with it, in a remote part of the state, to the great injury and neglect of his official duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-8\">But suppose there had been twenty parties injured, and they had all recovered to the full amount of the penalty of the bond, what remedy would the Commonwealth have for her taxes and duties ? By giving an action to individuals, the Commonwealth is entirely defeated of her revenue; when it is apparent that the sole object of taking the bond, was to secure those revenues by directing that it should be lodged with the <em>treasurer, </em>and giving him a summary mode of redress against the inspectors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-10\">In England, indeed, a creditor, as well as the next of kin, may bring a suit in the name of the ox-dinary on the administration <em>bond.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Bat </em>this ax-ises from the principle that the ox-dinary is bound to make distribution, and any .party interested has a right, <em>ex debito </em>justifies, toan assignment. by him of the boixd. This is the only case in which the name of the obligee can be used by another, without the express authority of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-11\">Again, the penalty of all inspectors\u2019 bonds is the same, four thousand dollars ; although there is so great a difference in the quantity of tobacco received at the different warehouses. Can it be believed that the Legislature meant that this bond should cover all cases of non-delivexy of tobacco, when in many instances it would not be sufficient for one tenth part. In truth, the only remedy ever contemplated, was an action on the statute against the inspectors themselves, for the penalty of double the value of the tobacco, which they should fail or refuse to deliver. The law gives the party no remedy on the bond, while it expressly giyes him one on the statute. And no pase can be found. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>where such an action as this can be maintained on common law principles.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-3\">Botts, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar4W\">The bonds given by inspectors of tobacco must be considered, as the terms import, for the performance of <em>all the duties </em>of their office. The duty of delivering the tobacco on demand is one of the most important confided to them; and one in which they would feel a greater interest to be delinquent than in any other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-6\">It is said, however, that there are particular penalties imposed upon the inspectors for the non-delivery of tobacco, and the relator, in this case, ought to have gone for that penalty. True it is, he might have done so, or he might elect to pursue any other remedy which the law had given him; for it is sound doctrine, that where a party has more than one remedy, he may pursue which he pleases. The <em>relator </em>might have had sufficient reasons for preferring an action on the inspector\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-7\">It was impossible for the Legislature to foresee who would be injured by the conduct of inspectors; and it might well be supposed that the penalty on the inspectors individually would, in many instances, afford no redress from their inability to pay. They, therefore, prescribed this bond as an additional security, and fixed upon the Governor as a representative character, in whose name any citizen injured, might prosecute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-8\">If there be a right, and the Legislature has failed to provide a remedy, it devolves upon the Courts to devise one: as in the case of guardian\u2019s bonds, and those given by committees of lunatics, though the law does not direct to whom the bond shall be given, yet it has been the invariable practice to take them payable to the justices, and actions thereon have always been sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-9\">He was not prepared to say, that this point was solemnly decided in the case of <em>Colquhouns </em>and <em>The Commonwealth. </em>But he might take the liberty of saying that one Judge, at least, considered it the pivot on which that cause turned; that as bonds are given by the inspectors, which may be' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>put in suit by any patty injured, this circumstance, together with their personal responsibility, excluded the idea of the Commonwealth being liable as a bailee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-8\">With respect to the objection that the. <em>original </em>is to be lodged with the treasurer; that may readily be obviated, as a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>would easily reach that officer, if the <em>original </em>were, in fact, necessary, in order to maintain the action.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b585-12\"><em> Rev.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b588-10\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"Aic\">The only question made in this cause, was, whether any person who has sustained any <em>special </em>injury, from the neglect, or misconduct of an inspector of tobacco, is entitled to bring an action <em>upon the bond </em>given by the inspector for the faithful performance of the duties of his office, against such inspector and his securities, although there is no provision in the act of Assembly to that effect. A variety of <em>penalties </em>are imposed upon the <em>inspectors </em>themselves, in different parts of the law, for particular acts of neglect, or breach of duty; all which are recoverable, by action of debt or information, in any Court of record, where the penalty exceeds five dollars or two hundred pounds of tobacco ; but there is no provision that the bond may be put in suit, for the recovery of them. But, if the bond cannot be put in suit for the benefit of a party, grieved, we may well ask, why was it given, by each inspector separately, and why is <em>security </em>required? By allowing an <em>information </em>against an inspector for breach of his duty, whereby any private individual may sustain a particular injury, the Commonwealth .appears to me to have pledged itself to lend its aid, and name, if the party suspecting the sufficiency of the inspector himself, to make him an adequate recompense for the injury sustained, shall chuse to bring suit against him, and his securities, jointly, upon his official bond. Otherwise there is but little use in the bond, and manifest, and extensive injury may be sustained by the whole community. For these reasons I think thejudg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>ment of the District Court erroneous, and that that of the County Court ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b589-3\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayc\">In forming my opinion in the case of <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colquhouns </em>and others, I thought it necessary to consider the main point in this cause. In that case I gave it as my opinion, that an action would lie on an inspector\u2019s bond at the suit of a party injured, in such a case as has occurred in the present. I therefore think it sufficient to refer to that opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b589-4\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AjPV\">I never had much doubt of this action\u2019s being sustainable on the inspector\u2019s bond; but, as it is a matter of importance, that has never been solemnly decided in this Court, and the District Court of <em>Fredericksburgh </em>had adjudged otherwise, 1 wished to hear an argument on that subject, that the decision might be more satisfactory to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The principal arguments of the appellees\u2019 counsel were 1st. That by the 21st section of the act for inspection of tobacco, the inspectors who shall fail or refuse to deliver any hogshead of tobacco, when the same shall be demanded for exportation, shall forfeit and pay to the owner thereof, double the value of the tobacco, which they shall so fail or refuse to deliver: and, therefore, <em>Goolrick\u2019s </em>only remedy was by a suit against the inspectors for the penalty, under that clause of the act of Assembly. 2dly. That the only object of the inspectors\u2019 bonds was to secure the payment, into the treasury, of all the money arising to the public under the inspection law; and 3dly. That there is no direction in the act, in what manner suits shall be brought on those bonds as in the cases of <em>sheriffs\u2019 </em>and <em>executors\u2019 </em>bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">With respect to the first argument, it may be sufficient to observe that the party grieved by the non-delivery of the tobacco when demanded, has an option, either to take his remedy by suing for the penalty, under the 21st section of the act, or to institute a suit on the bond, in the name of the Governor, to whom it is payable. In the former case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>his remedy is against the inspector only: but in the latter case the inspector\u2019s <em>securities </em>are liable. As to the argument that the bonds are merely to secure the payment of the public money into the treasury, it may be observed, that an inspector\u2019s bond is for the true and faithful performance, of his duty, according to the directions of the act; which duty consists of a variety of trusts, and services to be performed, for breach of, or failure to perform either of which, the bond becomes forfeited. And it appears to me, that from the large penalty of the bond, that each individual inspector is required to give, for the due and faithful performance of his duty, it was intended by the Legislature to cover every delinquency, and malfeazance of an inspector, in the exercise of his office: And, although there be no specific direction in the act, as to the mode of bringing and prosecuting actions on those bonds, as in the cases of sheriffs\u2019, executors\u2019, and administration bonds, yet, it seems to me, that actions may well be maintained on those bonds, in the name of the Governor, on behalf and for the benefit, of any person or persons aggrieved by the misconduct of the inspectors ; and I am, therefore, of opinion that the judgment of the District Court be reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The judgment of the District Court was reversed and that of the County Court affirmed, <em>as to the merits. </em>But there being an error in the entry of the judgment of the County Court, in not attaching the recovery as to future injuries, as well to any other person or persons, as to the relator in this action, that judgment was reversed in terms, and a new judgment entered for the damages stated in the case agreed, &amp;c. in favour of Goolrick, \u201c <em>and </em>for <em>such other </em>\u201c <em>damages as may be hereafter assessed upon a </em>scire fa- \u201c c\u00edas <em>being sued out </em>thereon, <em>and new breaches assigned </em>\u201c <em>by the said </em>John Gooerick, <em>or any other person or per- </em>\u201c <em>sons injured.\u201d</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
