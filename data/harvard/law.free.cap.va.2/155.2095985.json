I contend, that though the heir is not bound unless he be particularly named, yet in all cases the executors are, whether the covenant respect real estate, or be purely personal. I consider this point to be so plain, that it is unnecesary to cite authorities to prove it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b209-5\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"AoM\">affirmed the judgment, without assigning reasons.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
