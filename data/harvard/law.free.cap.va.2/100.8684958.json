Scott </em>for the sum of 329/. 11s. <em>d </em>10 <em>3r4d. </em>including interest, costs and sheriff\u2019s commis- \u201c sions, which Writ hath been <em>duly executed </em>by <em>Nathaniel u </em>Carter, deputy, for <em>Walter Bennett, </em>sheriff of the County \u201c of Halifax, on the following property, to wit, five ne~ \u2018\u2018 groes [naming them]; and the said <em>William Thompson </em>u and <em>John B. Scott being desirous of beeping t(ie aforen </em>\u201c <em>said property in their possession </em>until the day of sale of \u201c the same, <em>hath </em>tendered the above bound <em>John Haskins, </em>\u201c as security for the forthcoming and delivery of the said M property at the place and on the day of sale agreeable to \u201c law. Now if the said <em>William Thompson, John B, Scott, </em>and <em>John Haskins, </em>or either of them, do and shall deliver &lt;c the aforesaid property to the said <em>Walter Bennett, </em>sheriff w as aforesaid, at <em>John M. Clay\u2019s </em>tavern, in the said County of Halifax, on the fifth day of <em>November </em>next, \u201c then and there to be disposed of according to law for \u201c the discharge of the said writ of <em>fieri facias, </em>then,\u201d &amp;c. concluding in the common form, and signed and sealed by the obligors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Notice having been duly proved, <em>Lewis </em>moved the Court for judgment on the foregoing bond, which motion being overruled, he took an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-8\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7v\">The District Court gave a <em>general </em>judgment overruling a motion on a forthcoming bond, without stating, as ought always to be done, the grounds of their decision. The objection is <em>said </em>to be, that in the condition of the bond, it is not stated <em>on xvhose property </em>the execution was levied. If such recital be necessary, it sufficiently appears, in the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-9\">The condition recites the execution against Thompson And Scott ; which writ had been <em>duly executed, </em>on certain property, without saying whose ; and that Thompson and Scott were desirous of <em>keeping the property </em>in theib. possession till the day of sale. It could not be <em>duly executed, </em>if not levied on their property. This proc\u00e9eding is entirely for the benefit of the defendant: <em>he </em>ought to give bond conformably to law; and according to the liberality of the Courts, a mere implication is sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-10\">In <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Taylor,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided to be necessary that the bond should state whose property was taken: but that case was never argued on either side, and probably passed <em>sub silentio. </em>It is contrary to the spirit of all the latter decisions. In that case also, it was not recited <em>against xvlwm </em>the execution issued, which is otherwise in this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-11\"><em>M'Rae, </em>for the appellees, relied on the case of <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>as conclusive. In the present case, it neither appears by the execution with the sheriff\u2019s return indorsed, (which he presumed was to be considered as part of the record,) nor by the forthcoming bond itself, that the execution was levied on the property of <em>Thompson and Scott, </em>or either of them. This is expressly required by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-12\">In <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>two points were decided: 1st. That it must appear <em>against xvhom </em>the execution issued; and, 2dly. On <em>xvhose property </em>it was executed. The second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>point directly applies to the cas\u00e9 now before the Court; <em>nor </em>could any decision be found in opposition to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-8\"><em>Call, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afa\">insisted that the execution was properly described. After reciting the <em>service, </em>it proceeds to state that <em>Thompson and Scott </em>were desirous of <em>keeping </em>the property in <em>their possession </em>till the day of sale. This implies that they were the owners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-9\">The case of <em>Hubbard </em>v. Taylor, he conceived, was not conclusive against him. Even if it <em>appeared </em>so by the report, it was not by the recoi'd of the decision. The record states that the bond was \u201c defective in not reciting \u201c against whom the execution issued, or to whom the pro- \u201c perty belonged.\u201d This plainly shews, that <em>either </em>would have been sufficient. The i-ecord also proves, that no counsel appeared for the appellee. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-10\"><em>M-Rae. </em>The execution law not only requires that the-forthcoming bond shall i-ecite the service of the execution, but that the sheriff shall x-etux-n on whose property it was levied. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-12\"><em>Call. </em>The law i-especting the returns of sheriffs on executions, makes no difference as to the forthcoming bond. Why should the Court hunt for <em>possibilities, </em>that die execution <em>might </em>have been levied on the property of some person other than the defendant, when no such person complains ; and when this would be done to defeat the justice of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-13\">[The record containing the forthcoming bond itself, in the case of <em>Hubbard v. Taylor, </em>was sent for at the instance of Judge Roane; and on inspection, it appeared that the <em>service </em>of the execution was not recited in any part of it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>After the penalty, which is in the usual form, and bears date the 23d of <em>May., 1792, </em>the condition proceeds: \u201c The \u201c condition of the above obligation is such, that if the above \u201c bound <em>William Hubbard </em>and <em>Mordecai Tompkies </em>shall de- \u201c liver to <em>Samuel White, </em>sheriff of the County aforesaid,\u201d &amp;c.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b119-9\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"Axi\">The appellant moved for a judgment on a forthcoming bond taken for the delivery of certain slaves taken on an <em>execution </em>issued by him against <em>Thompson and Scott. </em>An objection was taken to the bond as defective, in not stating to whom they belonged; and the District Court being of opinion that the bond was defective in that respect, overruled his motion; whereupon he appealed. Mr. <em>M'Rae, </em>for the appellees, relied on the case of <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Taylor,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as shewing this to be error ; the judgment in that case (as appears from the record) being that the bond was defective, in not reciting <em>against xvftom </em>the <em>execution </em>issued, or to whom the property belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The act concerning executions<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> provides, that if the <em>metier </em>of goods taken in execution shall give sufficient security to the sheriff to have the <em>same goods </em>forthcoming at the day of sale, it shall be lawful for the sheriff to take a bond from such debtor and securities, payable to the creditor, reciting the <em>service </em>of such execution, and the amount thereof, and with condition to have the goods forthcoming at the day of sale, and shall thereupon suffer the goods to <em>iremain </em>in the possession of the debtor, &amp;c. The service of the execution must be recited in the bond, which ought to shew the names of the parties, and the amount of the execution : and that the goods were permitted to remain in the possession of the owner, or debtor. This was not done in the case of <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Taylor; </em>but in the case before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>us the execution is sufficiently recited, and the service upon the slaves by name: it then proceeds to state that the defendants were desirous to <em>keep them in their possession </em>until the day of sale; which, to my apprehension, is sufficient to shew they were the <em>owners </em>of them. I therefore think the judgment should be reversed, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Judges Roane and Fleming being also of opinion that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed, the following was entered as the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u201c That the bond in the proceedings mentioned is neither u informal nor defective, but a good and legal bond; and \u201c that the judgment of the District Court is erroneous. \u201c Therefore it is considered that the same be reversed and \u201c annulled, and that the appellant recover against the ap- \u201c pellees his costs by him expended, in the prosecution of a his appeal aforesaid here. Whereupon the Court would \u201c have proceeded to give judgment for the appellant on the \u201c said bond as the District Court should have done, if the \u201c appellees had none other objection thereto than the one M stated; but as it is possible that the appellees may have \u201c made payments, or had other objections which were not \u201c brought forth because of the opinion of the District Court \u201c in their favour, the cause is remanded to the said Dis- \u201c trict Court for that Court to proceed to judgment on the \u201c said bond, when the appellees are to, be at liberty to op-u pose the same by proof of payment, or by other legal ob- \u201c jections than that of the legality or formality of the said \u25a0\u00ab bond.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\"> 1 <em>Wash. </em>259.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b119-12\"> <em>L.
