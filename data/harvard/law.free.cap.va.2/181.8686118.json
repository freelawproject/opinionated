Between the 7th of <em>February, </em>1793, and tbe 30tb of June, 1797, several executions had issued in behalf of the Commonwealth against the lands and tenements, goods and chattels, of Hewitt, which executions came into the hands of <em>William Philips, </em>a succeeding sheriff. <em>Philips </em>returned on one of them, that he had levied it on certain lands and slaves, which were not sold for ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>. want of bidders. Upon a <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued thereupon, accompanied by an order of the executive to remove the property, he returned, that he had made part of the debt by the sale of the <em>goods and chattels. </em>Other writs of <em>venditioni exponas </em>then issued, commanding him to make sale of the <em>lands; </em>but upon each of them, there was die same return, of \u201c <em>no sale for want of bidders A </em>Before a sale of any of the lands of <em>Hewitt </em>was effected, <em>Philips </em>died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-10\">On the 19th of January, 1802, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an act passed, pre- . scribing the mode in which property, taken in execution by a sheriff, and remaining unsold in his hands at the tims of his death, shall be disposed of by his successor. <em>After </em>the passage of this act, on the 27th of January, 1803, another writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued to the \u201c <em>sheriff of Staf- </em>\u201c <em>fordf </em>which came into the hands of <em>B.Ficklin, </em>the then sheriff, who returned, \u201c That by virtue of the writ he had \u201c advertised the lands and tenements therein mentioned \u201c for sale on the 4th of <em>June, </em>1803, at which time and place, \u201c <em>Elizabeth </em>Philips, executrix of <em>William Philips </em>deceased, \u201c met the sheriff, and delivered all the right she might &lt;\u00a3 have in and unto the said lands and tenements, which the said .sheriff offered for sale, but <em>no sale for want of </em>\u201c bidders.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-12\">A doubt having been suggested whether the act of the 19th of January, 1.802, had a retrospective operation so as to embrace cases happening <em>before </em>the passage of the law, and consequently whether the last writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>which came into the hands of Ficklin, with the proceedings thereon wfere warranted by law, the present motion was made. The General Court, instead of directing the clerk to issue another writ o.f <em>venditioni </em>exponas, overruled the motion, and quashed the former writ, which had issued the 27th of <em>January, </em>1803, with the return thereon. From this decision the Attorney-General prayed an appeal, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to this Court. Whereupon the several executions against <em>Hewitt </em>were ordered to be made a part of the record, and to be certified as the <em>only evidence </em>offered to the Court on the trial of the said motion,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>The </em>Attorney-General, for the Commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoNK\">contended that the act of the 19th of <em>lam\u00edan/, </em>1802, was intended , y \u2019 ic embrace ail cases of executions, as well <em>past </em>as <em>future, </em>The language of the law is sufficiently comprehensive, and the mischief to be remedied, exists, as fully in the one case as ill the other. The act, after reciting in the preamble, that <em>doubts </em>existed whether on the death of a sheriff who <em>may heve </em>taken property under execution, which may remain unsold at the time of his death, there was any mode to compel a sale of such property, goes on to declare, that <em>in all cases </em>in which a sheriff, or other officer, <em>taking </em>property under execution, shall die before he sells it, the clerk of the Court shall issue a <em>venditioni exponas </em>to the sheriff of the County, in which the property was taken under execution, &amp;c. In this case the sheriff <em>did </em>die, because it appears that his executrix attended on the premises and gave possession of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-9\">It is admitted that the original execution issued before the passing of this act. But the preamble of the act, and the mischiefs which the Legislature intended to remedy clearly point out its application to <em>all cases of </em>executions.

It is a-</em>question of no small importance, whether a person entitled to executions under former laws must take the steps authorised by the laws in being at the time, or whether he may avail himself of a statute subsequently passed. There never was a rule in construing statutes which says, that an. act intended to be <em>prospective </em>will enable a party to go back so many years in applying it to pre-existing cases. This aet, indeed, says \u201c <em>whereas doubts exist f </em>&amp;c. but if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the Court shall be of opinion that there was <em>no </em>doubt, and. that there was no remedy at common law, then there is an end of the question. Can it be believed that the Legislature supposed that-a <em>venditioni </em>exponas, which had issued more than nine years before the passing of the act, remained at that time unsatisfied? But it may well be doubted whether <em>Hewitt </em>was so far a party before the.General Court as to justify the appeal on behalf of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-6\"><em>The </em>Attorney-General, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY\">The principle, relating to retrospective laws, does not apply to the case before the Court.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b200-8\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">This was a motion made in the General Court, in behalf of the Commonwealth, to direct the clerk to issue a <em>venditioni exponas </em>to the present sheriff of Stafford; the object of which was to command him to expose to sale the lands of Hewitt, which had been taken in execution by <em>William </em>Philips, a former sheriff now deceased,- on which execution, <em>Philips </em>had made a return, \u201c no \u201c sale for want of bidders.\u201d After which, to wit, in <em>Janu</em>ary, 1803, another writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>had issued, directed to the sheriff, of Stafford, upon which <em>Fieldin', </em>the then high sheriff made a return,. \u201c that he advertised the \u201clands and tenements therein named for sale, and that <em>Eliza- </em>\u201c <em>beth </em>Philips, executrix of <em>William Philips </em>deceased, late \u201c sheriff, at the time and place met the sheriff and deliverpd \u201c all the right she might have Unto the said lands and tene- \u201c menta, which <em>he offered for sale, </em>and there was no sale for want of bidders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">This motion was founded upon the act of 1801, c. 12. directing the mode in which property under execution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>and <em>in </em>possession of a sheriff at the time of his death shall be sold. It was contended that this act did not apply to cases existing before the act; without deciding upon that point, I was inclined to think, that if lands be comprehended under the word <em>property, </em>the delivery thereof by the executrix of the late sheriff, to the succeeding sheriff, who <em>proceeded to offer it for </em>sale, removed all objections upon that ground; since the only controversy that could arise upon the operation of the law, must have been between those parties. I should therefore, probably, have thought the objection not sustainable <em>upon that ground only.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">But I doubt whether this case is brought properly before the Court; it was an <em>ex parte </em>motion, not, as I conceive^ against <em>Hewitt; </em>nor does he appear to have contested it; I doubt therefore, whether it was competent for the Attorney-General to appeal from the decision of the General Court upon that motion \u2014 or if he could, whether <em>Hewitt </em>can be considered as a party opposing it, and liable for costs.\u2014 And as I entertain these doubts, upon both points, I submit to the opinion of the other members of the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"b201-8\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AdW\">As to the objection suggested during \u00a1he argument, and now doubted upon, by the Judge who preceded me, that there are not proper parties to justify the appeal in the present case, I think there is nothing in it. There was a controversy depending between the Commonwealth and Hewitt; which must be considered as depending, until consummated by means of the execution. This principle is avowed in Hendricks, &amp;c. v. <em>Dundass </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and has been acted upon in various other cases. In that case an execution and replevy bond was quashed on the motion of the plaintiff, of which motion no notice is shewn to have been given to the defendant; and in the same case<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> another execution between the same parties had. been previously quashed on the motion of the defendant. It would seem to follow that an <em>equal </em>right exists to procure the ema? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>nation of an execution by the order of the Court, where the-Clerk refuses to issue it, (and that without notice,) as to set aside one already issued <em>; </em>and that an erroneous opinion of the Court in such case might be carried to a superior Court by appeal,</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">As t.q the merits of the case,\" it is said that the act of 1801, affects merely the <em>remedy </em>apd not the rights of the parties <em>; </em>and that it has often been decided here, that the, Legislature may act retrospectively in the case of <em>remedies. </em>If this be admitted it proves nothing in the present case, unless it be further shewn that the Legislature has in fact done so. It must be confessed, however, that the boundary line in relation to this subject cannot easily be drawn; and it is also well known, that this point has not been so far settled by this Court without considerable controversy, and encountering much strength of argument. We must consider that the Legislature were apprised of the just objections which exist in the <em>case; </em>and, in forming a con\u25a0struction in a doubtful case, this, circumstance will have its due weio-ht.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">It is argued in the present case, that an intention to embrace past cases is inferable from the <em>doubts </em>stated, in the preamble of the act, which are admitted to relate to cases of property, already taken in execution ; and it is said to be the. general construction that the remedy provided by an enacting clause, is to be co-extensiye with the evil it professes to. remedy. While this general position is admitted, it is believed that a preamble cannot extend or restrain the. operation of the enacting clause, when its meaning is expressed in clear and unambiguous terms,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This I take to be the case in the present instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">The act in question was passed the 19th of <em>January, </em>1802, and commenced in force, <em>from and after </em>the passing thereof. This circumstance alone (although it applies to most statutes, and is, in truth, only a reiteration of the general principle that laws, in their nature, are only prospective) Would go a good way to' repel a <em>retrospective </em>construction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>If the clause in the act relating to its commencement was izicorporated into the enacting clause in question, but little doubt could exist on the subject, and I will consider it as if it were so incorporated; that clause would then run thus : \u201c Be it enacted, that from and after the passing of \u201c this act, in all cases in which a sheriff, or other officer; \u201c <em>taking </em>property in execution <em>shall die, </em>it shall be lawful,\u201d &amp;c. It certainly can make no difference in what part of the statute the clause prescribing its commencement is to be, found; and this clause is to be considered as if it were set nut and repeated in every distinct section of the act. \u2014 \u25a0 Therefore, upon this foundation; upon that of the general nature of acts, in relation as well to <em>remedies </em>as rights,, which \u00e1te prospective only j and upon the very words of this enacting clause, which are more properly <em>future </em>than <em>past, </em>I am of opinion that it only extends to <em>future </em>cases. The language of the preamble is too weak to resist the effect of these combined considerations : The attention of the Legislature, it would seem, was called to this subject, by <em>doubts </em>respecting <em>past </em>cases; but when it came to enact upon the subject, it confined its provisions to <em>future </em>cases; It was probably sensible of the objections which exist against retrospective laws, and therefore was unwilling to depart from the general principle; even in relation to this remedy, as far as we can judge from the act itself. The words of the enacting clause do not admit of any doubt or ambiguity io justify an enlarged construction, by reason of the language of the preamble; It is here to be remarked, that in the cases in general, in which the elfeet of the enacting clause has been enlarged of restrained by the preamble, the construction related hot to this question of prospective, or retrospective operation: But, taking the prospective doctrine as <em>admitted, </em>those cases related merely to the questions upon the subject matter of which the Legislature were acting. In those cases, therefore, \u2022One part of a statute was merely construed by reference, to another, by taking a general flew of the whole act: but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>there was no 'great principle in those cases, as in'this, tumsca^e \u00edn favour of the enacting clause; the principie Ijnow mean results, (as is before said,) both, from the general nature of <em>laws, </em>and the pai'ticular time assumed by the act itself for the commencement of its operation. Even this principle may be overruled in relation to remedies, by the clear and expressed intention of the Legislature ; but in a case of doubt or ambiguity it must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">I am of opinion that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"AHn\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A7\">It appears to me that the act passed the 19th of January, 1802, under which the motion for a <em>Venditioni </em>exponas, now the subject of discussion, was made, had a prospective and not a retrospective operation; Construing it in the same manner as if the last clause, respecting the time of its commencement had stood in the forepart of the first enacting clause; as has been noticed by the Judge who last gave his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Under that act the <em>venditioni exponas </em>of <em>the 27th of January, </em>1803, also-issued: which was by the general Court quashed at the time the one now before us ivas moved for: on the ground, I suppose, (though the reason is not stated in the record,) that the act under which it issued, had no retrospective operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">That opinion appeai-s to me correct, and ought to be affirmed.-</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyo-ns,) the judg-' ment of the General Court affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b201-10\"> 3 <em>Wash. </em>54.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\"> 1 Wash. 93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\"> 6 Bac.
