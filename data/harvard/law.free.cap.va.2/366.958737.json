A new trial will not be granted because a party was surprised at the trial, where the surprise arises from a mistake of the counsel as to a question of law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-21\">This was an action on the case brought in the Circuit Superior Court of <em>Franklin </em>county, by <em>Henry Law, </em>against <em>Burwell Law. </em>The object of the suit was to recover damages from the defendant for having caused and procured a slave of the plaintiff to leave the <em>Commonwealth, </em>whereby the plaintiff had lost the said slave. The defence was that the slave was not the property of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>On the trial of the cause, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 1000 dollars; and the defendant moved for a new trial upon the ground of surprise at the trial; and also on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the evidence. The Court overruled the motion for a new trial, and gave judgment upon the verdict; whereupon the defendant excepted; and the facts being spread upon the record, he obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-4\">It appeared that in 1806, <em>John Allen </em>executed to <em>John Smith </em>a mortgage, which was duly recorded, by which <em>Allen </em>conveyed to <em>Smith </em>a negro woman named <em>Betty, </em>and her future increase, to secure to <em>Smith </em>a debt of ninety-five pounds ten shillings and two pence. After the execution of the mortgage, <em>Betty </em>had several children, among whom was a boy named <em>Charles, </em>another named <em>Armstead, </em>and a girl named <em>Betty.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">In 1822, <em>Smith </em>filed his bill in the County Court of <em>Pittsylvania, </em>to foreclose the mortgage; in which he charged that <em>Allen </em>was about to remove from the <em>Commonwealth, </em>and take all his property with him, without paying the plaintiff\u2019s debt; and he prayed for a writ of <em>ne exeat regno </em>to restrain <em>Allen </em>from leaving the State. The writ was granted, and served upon <em>Allen, </em>but he escaped, and removed from the State with all his property, except the woman <em>Betty, </em>and her child of the same name, and the boy <em>Charles, </em>whom he had sold to <em>Dudley Lumsden </em>of the county of <em>Franklin.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">The plaintiff then proceeded against <em>Allen </em>as an absent <em>defendant; </em>and amended his bill and made <em>Lumsden </em>a party defendant; claiming to subject the boy <em>Charles </em>to the satisfaction of the mortgage debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">In 1832, the cause was finally heard, when the Court made a decree subjecting the slave <em>Charles </em>to the satisfaction of the balance remaining due of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against <em>Allen, </em>after applying thereto the proceeds of the sale of <em>Betty </em>and her child <em>Betty ; </em>and <em>Lumsden </em>consenting to a personal decree for that balance, instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>of a decree for the sale of <em>the boy Charles, </em>the Court made a decree directing <em>Lumsden </em>to pay to the plaintiff the sum of 396 dollars 37 cents, with interest on 263 dollars 40 cents, a part thereof, from the date of the decree till paid j and made a decree over against <em>Allen </em>in favour of <em>Lumsden.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-9\">Soon after this decree was made, <em>Lumsden </em>procured a copy of the record, and delivered it to <em>Henry Law, </em>with an assignment to him of the decree endorsed on the record; though the object of the assignment was to enable <em>Law </em>to collect the debt as the agent of <em>Lumsden. Law, </em>having received this assignment, went in the winter of 1832, to the State of <em>Georgia ; </em>where he found the slave <em>Armstead </em>in the possession of <em>Frances Allen, </em>a daughter of <em>John Allen. </em>He there caused said slave to he taken under a legal process, by the bailiff of the county of <em>Jasper, </em>and brought to the house of <em>David Bostick, </em>where <em>Frances Allen </em>presently came ; and after consulting with her friends, executed to the plaintiff a bill of sale for the slave, purporting to be in consideration of 752 dollars 64 cents, <em>Georgia </em>currency. This bill of sale was executed under an agreement between said <em>Frances </em>and the plaintiff, that on a certain day then appointed, which was a few days after the date of the agreement, the plaintiff would go with her <em>to </em>the State of <em>Alabama, </em>where she proffered to shew him other property of her father <em>John Allen </em>sufficient to pay the debt; and the plaintiff was thereupon to surrender the slave <em>Armstead </em>to her, and deliver up the bill of sale. Before the time fixed for going to <em>Alabama </em>arrived, <em>Frances Allen </em>declined to go ; and thereupon the plaintiff, apprehending that she would institute a suit against him for the slave, fled from <em>Georgia, </em>and brought the slave with him to <em>Virginia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-10\">On the plaintiff\u2019s return to <em>Virginia, </em>he executed to <em>Lumsden </em>his bond for 200 dollars; and retained the slave. And said slave remained in the plaintiff\u2019s pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>session, until the fall of 1833, when he returned to <em>Georgia ; </em>and the defendant admitted in a conversation with the plaintiff that he had given said slave a pass, that he might get away from the plaintiff, and return to <em>Georgia ; </em>though he insisted at the same time, that the slave was the property of <em>Frances Allen.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-4\">The ground of surprise at the trial, was stated in the affidavits of the defendant, and his counsel; and was the exclusion of the deposition of <em>William Willing-ham, </em>who was a subscribing witness to the bill of sale executed by <em>Frances Allen </em>to the plaintiff; and was her adviser on that occasion. It appears that the deposition of <em>Willingham, </em>and those of <em>Charles Law </em>and others were taken and returned together, and filed among the papers in the cause in 1835. That in 1837, an objection was taken to <em>Law's </em>deposition, which was sustained by the Court; but no objection was then taken to <em>Willingham's; </em>but in J838, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel endorsed upon it an objection, on the ground that it did not shew it was taken at the place stated in the notice. The counsel for the defendant, not anticipating an objection to this deposition after the omission to make it in 1837, the senior counsel had not noticed the endorsement until after the jury were sworn, and the junior counsel had only observed it about half an hour before, and not considering the objection of any importance had not mentioned it to his associate; and therefore when the cause was called, they announced that the defendant was ready for trial. Both the counsel say, that they considered the deposition so material that they would not have consented to go into the trial if they had not thought that they would have been permitted to read it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-6\">Upon the motion for a new trial, <em>Willingham's </em>deposition was read. He stated, that he went to <em>Bostick's, </em>and found the slave <em>Armstead </em>there, a prisoner. That <em>Miss Allen </em>was sent for, and when she came she consulted the witness as to what she should do; and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>having learned from the plaintiff that he claimed the slave under a mortgage, and from the justice that a Court would he called to try the right of property, and if it should be found in favour of the plaintiff the slave would be delivered to him, and plaintiff could carry him where he pleased, he advised <em>Miss Allen </em>to execute a bill of sale to the plaintiff, upon his proposing that the bill of sale and the boy should be deposited in the hands of any person <em>Miss Allen </em>would name; and that he would go with her to hunt other property; and if other property could be found, the bill of sale and boy should be given up to her. Under this agreement the bill of sale was executed by <em>Miss Alim; </em>she receiving no consideration therefor; and as soon as the plaintiff got the boy, he made his escape with him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-4\"><em>C. &amp; </em>G. <em>N. </em>Johnson, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYn\">insisted, that in this action the plaintiff must prove property in himself; 1 Saund. on Pl. &amp; Evi. 346; 1 Leigh\u2019s Nisi Prius 684, title Action on the Case, \u00a7 12; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>8 T. R. 330; <em>Moores </em>v. <em>Hopper, </em>6 Bos. &amp; Pull. 411; and that an agent cannot maintain the action. And they insisted, that the facts of the case proved, that the plaintiff had fraudulently acquired the title to the slave; and it was therefore void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">They also insisted, that there was no proof that the defendant had inflicted any injury upon the plaintiff. There was no proof that the defendant had aided the slave to get away from the plaintiff, except the defendant\u2019s admission ; and that admission was coupled with the declaration, that the slave was the property of <em>Frances Allen. </em>This declaration must be taken with the admission, and therefore, the proofs did not establish the allegation, that the defendant knew the slave was the property of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">2. They insisted, that the damages were excessive. The evidence of value was the bill of sale from <em>Fran</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>ces Allen </em>to the plaintiff, which fixed the price at 752 dollars 64 cents <em>Georgia </em>currency; and the amount of the bond executed by the plaintiff to <em>Lumsden. </em>The first was proved to be merely nominal, and the last was therefore the only criterion of value ; and it was a criterion fixed by the plaintiff himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">3. They farther insisted, that a new trial should have been granted, on the ground of surprise. The deposition of <em>Willingham </em>shewed, that the plaintiff had given nothing for the slave ; but that he had fraudulently gotten possession of him, and brought him off to <em>Virginia.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\">And they attempted to distinguish between cases, where after verdict and judgment at law, an application is made to a Court of Equity for relief, and cases where an error of counsel is ascertained during the trial. In this last, they insisted, that if the error has occasioned a surprise at the trial the Court would set aside the verdict; though the error was an error in law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-7\">Leigh, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMX\">The first question is, has the plaintiff a title to the slave which will enable him to maintain this action ? Take it, that <em>Frances Allen </em>gave the bill of sale to the plaintiff as an escrow; and that he came off to <em>Virginia </em>with it. This Court has decided that the delivery of a deed, complete on its face, to the grantee, as an escrow, is an absolute delivery, and the condition nugatory. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>12 Leigh 479. The plaintiff, therefore, had a valid legal title; and the only remedy of <em>Frances Allen </em>was by bill in equity to redeem the slave, upon paying the amount for which he was bound. The legal title being in the plaintiff, and he having had the slave in possession from the early part of the year 1832 to 1833, the defendant, a stranger, interferes, and by his act, deprives this plaintiff of his property; and it is gravely contended, that he cannot maintain an action for the injury he has sustained. Sec <em>Keane </em>v. <em>Boycott, </em>2 Hen. Bl. 511; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Pitcher, </em>1 Eng. C. L. R. 355.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFDa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>2. The bill of exceptions makes no complaint that the damages are excessive; and therefore, it is submitted, the Court cannot enter into that question. But if h may be considered, then it is farther submitted, that }n cases guch as this, the jury are the proper and only judges of the injury sustained by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANP\">3. The surprise alleged, arose not out of a mistake of fact, but of the law. No exception was taken to the exclusion of the deposition; but having acquiesced in the correctness of that decision of the Court, the defendant, after he has lost his cause, comes to complain of the surprise.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b392-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Atdq\">Affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
