At the same time <em>Tribble </em>delivered to him a writing purporting to be a grant of the land, from the proper authority to a certain <em>Joseph </em>Brock, together with certificates as to its quality and the goodness of the title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-8\">On the 3d of <em>April, </em>1798, <em>McDonald, </em>in consideration of 400 dollars, assigned his interest in the aforesaid agreement to <em>Crawford, </em>in the following words indorsed thereon: \u201cI assign the within obligation, with the benefits \u201c arising therefrom, to the Rev. <em>Edward Crawford, </em>of \u201c <em>Washington </em>County and State of Virginia, being for \u201c value received, without recourse. Witness my hand and seal, this third day of <em>April, </em>one thousand seven \u201c hundred and ninety-eight. <em>John McDonald,T </em>(Seal.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-10\">Two penal bills, for 200 dollars each, were executed by' <em>Crawford </em>to <em>McDonald, </em>as the price agreed to be paid him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-11\">Judgment having been obtained on one of those bills, <em>Ctawford </em>filed his bill, praying an <em>injunction; </em>alleging that the grant for the land was forged, as well as the certificates jn relation thereto; stating that he had reason to suspect that <em>McDonald </em>was apprised of the fraud at the time of the agreement; and suggesting, though not very distinctly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>that he was bound beyond the <em>terms </em>of the writing betwedii them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Anl\">The def\u00e9ndant, <em>McDonald, </em>in his answer, denying all -fraud, or knowledge of fraud, on his part, at the time of the agreement, stated that the proposition to purchase Carrie from <em>Cratvford </em>himself, who, after having examined all .the papers, was perfectly satisfied as to the goodness o\u00ed the title, expressed a wish to take the bargain \u201c off his ^ hands,\u201d and manifested great solicitude to become the' owner of the land. He further stated, that it was expressly agreed between them, that he was not to be liable in any event; that <em>Cratvford </em>was to take the papers as he saw them, atid that the words \u201c without recourse\u201d were introduced into the assignment to exonerate him from all ret iponsibility.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-8\">Several depositions were taken on both sides. The grant with the certificates annexed were clearly proved to have been forgeries : but there was no evidence that <em>HD Donald </em>knew or suspected any fraud; nor did it appear that he was to be liable in any event. On the contrary, some of the witnesses proved it to have been the understanding of the parties that the words \u201c without recourse\u201d in the assignment, were sufficient to release <em>M'Donald </em>from any future claim in consequence of it, and prevented the necessity of a special agreement in writing to that effect, as was desired by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-9\">The Chancellor, on a hearing, dismissed the bill; and <em>Crawford </em>appealed to this Court. \u2018</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-10\">Call, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akqe\">The only question arising in this case, is, what is the effect of the words \u201c <em>without re\u201c</em>course,\u201d in the assignment on the title-papers ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-11\">The papers are proved to have been forgeries; and the inquiry is, whether those words are to be so understood, that <em>Crawford </em>was to take the land funning the risk of prior titles, \"or whether he' was to guarantee the validity of the, papers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Wickham, for the appellee. Admitting the case to rest on the sole question on which Mr. <em>Call </em>has placed it, the appellee is entitled to succeed. But if a doubt exist on that point, there is another clearly tor him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-7\">Under the agreement, <em>McDonald </em>was entitled to a conveyance for one half the land immediately, and to the other half, at his election, by paying a stipulated sum \\yithin a certain period. It turned out, however, that the grant was forged. If <em>Tribble </em>were a party to the fraud, he was clearly liable to <em>McDonald: if not, M'Donald </em>was entitled to an action, because <em>Tribble </em>had undertaken to convey land to which he had no title. <em>M'Donald </em>having this agreement, assigned it to <em>Cravjford. </em>Let us suppose that the words \u201c <em>-without </em>recourse,\u201d had not been inserted in the assignment; <em>ST Donald- </em>would not have been liable in the first instance. What would have been the extent of his liability ? Not to make good the <em>land; </em>but such damages as might have be'en recovered of Tribble, if he were unable to pay.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-8\">Call, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtU\">The difference is this: <em>Crawford </em>meant to buy <em>Kentucky </em>land, and not a bond for damages. All that he meant was to take upon himself the risk.of prior claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-9\">When a bond is assigned \u201c without recourse,\u201d all that is understood by it, is, that the assignor means to be exempt from all recourse, <em>if the obligor prove insufficient; </em>but if the bond be forged, he would be liable, because money had been paid by the assignee for a thing upon which <em>no recovery </em>could be had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-10\">It is fair to presume, that both <em>Crawford </em>and <em>M'Donald </em>treated as if those were genuine papers. If-so, what is the consequence ? According to a known rule of equity, where both parties treat relative to the quality ok a thing which does not exist, both are under a delusion, and neither are bound. From this view of the case, <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>bond might to be delivered up to be cancelled.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Saturday, March </em>26. The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"AT2\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"ATN\">One <em>Joseph Tribble, </em>by an instrument under his hand and seal, .acknowledged himself to have bargained and sold to <em>John McDonald, </em>the appellee, a tract of land containing 800 acres, lying on the head of <em>Buffalos </em>Creek, in <em>Logan </em>County, <em>Kentucky, for </em>which he acknowledged to have received two hundred dollars. There is no further description of the land. <em>McDonald </em>aftei'wards, by an indorsement, assigned that instrument, (which he calls an Obligation,) with the benefits arising therefrom to the appellant, <em>being for value received from him </em>without recourse. <em>Tribble, </em>at the time of the bargain with MiDo<em>nald, </em>delivered him a patent purporting, to be a grant to one <em>Joseph Brock </em>for the same quantity of land on the head of <em>Buffuloe Lick </em>Creek; but neither shewed nor delivered any conveyance from <em>Brock to Tribble, </em>or any agreement respecting it. This patent was delivered at the time of the assignment by <em>M1-Donald </em>to <em>Crawford, </em>who at the same time executed two notes to <em>MLDonald </em>for 200 dollars each, as the price of the land. On these, suits have been brought and judgments obtained at law. The appellant obtained an injunction to the judgments, on tbe ground that the patent was a forgery. <em>McDonald </em>denies his knowledge that it was so, as also all fraud; and insists that <em>Crawford </em>took the agreement without recourse to him in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">It is obvious, from this state of the case, that <em>McDonald </em>did not receive from <em>Tribble </em>or shew <em>Crawford </em>any title or claim whatsoever to the lands mentioned in the pretended patent; the forgery of the patent was therefore a remote question:' the taking <em>M\u00edDonaW s </em>assignment of <em>Tribble\u2019s </em>agreement <em>without recourse, </em>shews he was' to run all hazards as to the title to die lands. I therefore think the decree dismissing his bill ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>judges Roane and Fleming were also in favour of affirming the decree.</judges>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the decree of the Superior Court of Chancery aitiemek.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
