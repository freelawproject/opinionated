The responsibility of <em>Goodall </em>depending entirely upon the insolvency of the obligor, it was incumbent on <em>Stuart </em>or his assignee <em>to prove </em>that insolvency. The return of \u201c no effects\u201d upon an execution issued to the sheriff of the County in which <em>Beverley </em>resided, was not sufficient. He might have removed out of the County, or might have had property in another County, or even in the same County tvhich the sheriff could not find sufficient to satisfy the debt. In all those cases, it would be competent to the assignor to direct the execution accordingly, and to shew that the obligor was not insolvent. It was the duty of the plaintiff in the action against Beverley, to have done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>every thing which <em>Goodall might </em>have done. <em>Goodall would </em>have directed the execution so as to have given it effect; and was prepared to prove the very point in issue, the <em>solvency </em>of Beverley, but was prevented by the Court. That the return of the sheriff may be controverted, is proved by many cases. It is every day\u2019s practice to sue him for a false return,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-9\"><em>The Attorney </em>General,, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACn\">If the principle contended for by Mr. <em>ITay, </em>be once established, the policy of the law which authorises assignments of bonds and other instruments for the payment of money will be entirely frustrated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-10\">It is admitted, that the assignee of a bond ought to use due diligence ; but there can be no better criterion of such diligence than the regular and judicious prosecution of a suit, and the return of the sheriff. If the sheriff return <em>nulla </em>bona, it has been held to be sufficient to charge the assignor, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Nor ought any evidence to be admitted to contradict this return; because it would be to contradict a record. The executions are to be preserved among the papers of the Court, and are considered as-matter of record in all legal proceedings. Another objection to the admissibility of such testimony in this form, is, that the sheriff is a sworn officer, and the Court ought to presume that all acts done by him in the execution of the duties of his office are right till the contrary appear; and it would not be proper to try the validity of his return in this indirect way. Would it be proper in a case in which the sheriff is not a party to subject him to censure without an opportunity of answering for himself? It would be to punish him for a false return, unheard and undefended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB9\">But, it is said, the sheriff may be sued for a false return. This is admitted, but a very different inference drawn from it. If the sheriff make a false return, any person injured may have an action against him.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> This course ought to have been pursued by <em>Goodall; </em>and then the quea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>tion would have come fairly on, and the sheriff would have had an opportunity of justifying his conduct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-3\">If the doctrine contended for should prevail; if the assignor shall be permitted, at the trial, to go into evidence of the solvency of the obligor, in opposition to the return of the sheriff, there would be endless litigation. The assignee, even after the Jury should be sworn, might be surprised by proof of property, in some other place, supposed to belong to the obligor: and, after suffering a nonsuit, and suing'out another execution, it might appear that this property was under some incumbrance. Thus he might be kept in a perpetual round of bringing actions; the assignor might hold up his evidence till the trial, and then bring in a witness to contradict the sheriff, who is supposed to know <em>the </em>property in his County. Great mischiefs would result to assignees from the adoption of this rule; whereas no injury would arise in the other case,because the assignor might sue the sheriff for a false return; and this being an official act, the securities of the sheriff would be liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-4\">There is nothing in the assignment, in this case, to distinguish it from an ordinary one. But if any thing could be gathered from the terms of the assignment, it would present a case still stronger against <em>Goodall; </em>because it would seem that the effect of the execution was to be limited to <em>Goochland., </em>where it is stated the obligor resided. But it never can be contended, that the assignee is bound to send an execution into every County in the state. There was no suggestion that the obligor had property in any particular place; but only a general offer to prove that he had effects sufficient. <em>Goodall </em>might be presumed to be best acquainted with the circumstances of his debtor; and if he knew of property of his, he ought have shewn it to the sheriff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-6\">Hay, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9C\">Mr. <em>Nicholas's </em>first remark may be retorted upon himself. If his doctrine shall be established, there will be no security for assignors. It wijl encourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>negligence in assignees; who, knowing their ulterior security, will give themselves but little trouble in the collection of the money from the obligor. All that I contend for, is, that the assignee shall do that which he might or could do if he had no further security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-3\">It is to be taken for granted, that the party was prepared to prove the fact which he <em>offered </em>to prove. <em>Goodall </em>was sued in consequence of <em>Beverley\u2019s </em>being insolvent/ and offered to prove that he was <em>not </em>insolvent; and yet, according to the doctrine advanced bn the other side, he is not to be admitted to disprove the very position on the establishment of which, by his adversary, his liability depended. Suppose an attempt had been made to prove the insolvency of the obligor, in the first instance, without resorting to a <em>suit; </em>would it be contended, that the assignor could not be permitted to introduce evidence to shew that he was not insolvent, by proving that he had effects sufficient to satisfy the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-4\">The case of <em>Mackie's executor </em>v. Davis, turned upon the question of due <em>diligence; </em>and the Court did not undertake to say what would be sufficient to ground an action against the indorser. In England, it is considered the province of the <em>Courts </em>to decide on the question of diligence; but, in this country, it is always left to the <em>Jury. </em>The general doctrine of the liability of indorsers, however, does not apply to this case, because the parties have entered into a particular stipulation by the assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-5\">The return of the sheriff is not a record, but <em>only filed among the records. </em>Nor can the oath or integrity of the sheriff be impeached by going into evidence to prove the solvency of the obligor; because, although the defendant may have property, the sheriff may not know where to find it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-6\">Though an action <em>may </em>be brought against a sheriff for a false return, yet a case has already been stated in which it would avail nothing. Suppose the obligor has property in another County, which is known to the assignee; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the sheriff of the County in which the obligor resided, in returning <em>no effects </em>within his bailiwick, docs not make a false return. <em>Goodall </em>offered to prove <em>Beverley solvent; </em>and if he had done so to the satisfaction of the Jury, would they have given a verdict against him ?</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b121-11\"> The declaration, in this case, being\u2019very special, and one which may serve as a model to the young practitioner, it is presumed its insertion will be acceptable to many of our readers.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\"><em>\u201c Henrico </em>County, to wit.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">\u201c <em>A.

And this upon common law principles, because every assignment of a negotiable paper, (as a bond is in this country,) imports in itself a valuable consideration paid. In this case Mr. <em>Goodall </em>expressly acknowledges to have received such a valuable consideration. Upon common law principles, then, he is liable to make good the money, if not got of <em>Beverley. </em>The judgment and execution, with the return of the sheriff, shew that it was not to be had by the ordinary course of law. Was <em>Stuart </em>obliged to send a <em>fieri facias </em>into every County of the state, or an execution against his body, before he could resort to <em>Goodall? </em>I think not: for the execution and return of <em>nulla bona </em>thereupon must be considered as at least equal to a <em>protest </em>upon a bill of exchange or promissory note, as evidence of non-payment, or nonacceptance. The assignor may, by a <em>special </em>assignment, indeed, protect himself from a suit, until the assignees shall have done something more than the law requires in ordinary cases. And it is contended that he has done so, in this case, by declaring that he \u201c <em>makes himself responsible </em>\u201c <em>should Beverley prove </em>insolventBut this was the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>by </em>the mere operation of law, without any such express agreement on his part; of course these words do not vary the nature of the undertaking. If indeed he had stipulated that he should <em>not be responsible </em>until it should appear that <em>Beverley </em>was totally insolvent, and that his body could not be taken in execution to satisfy the debt, these negative words might perhaps have altered the case, or at least have imposed it as a duty upon the assignee to pursue every species of execution to obtain the money, before he could resort to the assignor. But as the undertaking contains nothing more than what the law itself would have implied, he cannot shelter himself by the addition of these words to his assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The question then is, whether in this action the Court ought to have admitted the evidence offered. If a sheriff make a false return upon a precept directed to him, any person aggrieved thereby may bring an action against him, and falsify his return by any evidence that he can produce for that purpose. But in a suit or contest between other persons, any fact, as between those persons, which is verified by the sheriff\u2019s return, cannot, I conceive, be controverted ; for he is a sworn officer, and shall be presumed to have done his duty, until the contrary be proved, by a recovery against him for his false return. I therefore am of opinion, that the evidence was properly rejected, and that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b128-5\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"A9P\">I cannot understand the assignment in this case as imposing upon the assignee any further or other terms or conditions than would have resulted by the construction of law from a <em>general </em>assignment. The <em>insolvency </em>intended by that assignment cannot reasonably be extended further in this case than in that; 1st. Because the analogy between this case and that is natural and apt; and Sdly. Because it is unreasonable to impose upon the assignee, who is generally a stranger to the affairs of the obligor, (whereas the obligee is supposed to be acquainted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>with them,) the responsibility of knowing, finding out and pursuing all the effects of the obligor, wheresoever existing. I shall therefore not vary this case from the case of a general assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">In the case of <em>Barksdale v. </em>Fenvick, I had occasion to review the case of <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Davis,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the general doctrine of the assignor\u2019s liability. As a <em>report </em>of that case has never been published, and as some of my reflections in that case appear to me to apply to this, I will beg leave to refer to a part of my opinion delivered in that case.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AI1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In the case before us, it does not appear tliat thebe Was any defect of diligence, or that an <em>injudicious </em>course of execution was adopted. It is not shewn that the assignee any reason to believe that any <em>other </em>execution would more probably have produced the money, or that tlie as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>signor gave any instructions on the subject. The appellee therefore has done all that was necessary, under the circumstances disclosed in this case, when he recovered judgment against the obligor, in the County in which he resided, and issued a <em>fieri facias </em>against his estate, upon which the return \u00a9f <em>nulla bona </em>has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">I am of opinion, therefore, to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b131-9\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayf\">In the case of <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Davis,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this general principle, that an assignor of a bond, where the obligor proves insolvent, is responsible to the assignee for the amount of the debt without any special undertaking to that effect, was settled by the unanimous opinion of the <em>Court; </em>and has not since been controverted. And it seems to me that when an assignee of a bond brings a suit against the obligor, and prosecutes it to a judgment, on which a <em>fieri facias </em>issues, he has done all that is incumbent on him to perform; and that, on a return of <em>nulla bona </em>on the <em>fieri facias, </em>he has recourse against the assignor, and may immediately institute his suit, and recover against him the amount of the bond and the costs of the former suit. As to the special assignment in this case, \u201c that <em>Goodall </em>should <em>\" be </em>responsible in case <em>Beverley </em>should prove insolvent,\u201d it seems to be mere surplusage, as the law would have made him so, unless there had been a special stipulation to the contrary. Mr. <em>Stuart, </em>the assignee, who was probably unacquainted with <em>Beverley\u2019s </em>circumstances, was not to presume that the sheriff had made a false return, and on that ground, to order a second <em>fieri facias, </em>nor does it appear, that it was a false return. <em>Beverley, </em>if he had property in the County might have had the address to secrete it from the sheriff? and, if so, <em>Goodall, </em>who, it is presumed, best knew the circumstances of his debtor, ought, in order to exonerate himself from his responsibility, to have shewn the property (if any) to the sheriff. I am therefore of opinion that the Court very properly rejected the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>offered by the appellant, at the trial; and that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the judgment of the District Court was affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\"><em> </em>2 <em>Wash. </em>219.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b129-11\"> Here Judge Roane repealed part of his opinion delivered in the case of <em>Barksdale v.

It \u201c is therefore unnecessary to go into that doctrine in the present case, \u201c further than (for myself) to explain one or two positions there stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">\u201c In that case we were much pressed to lay down the precise <em>line </em>at \u201c which the assignor\u2019s liability commenced; the criterion ascertaining \u201c wherein due diligence consisted : but the Court resisted the applica- ** tion, and left it upon the foot of due diligence, under all the circum- <em>\u201c </em>stances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">\u201c In the case of bills of exchange and negotiable notes, it is more \u2018\u2018 easy, and perhaps more necessary, to lay down a general rule upon \" this subject, than in the case of bonds : more easy, because the diligence required in respect of <em>them </em>by the <em>English </em>law is more <em>simple, \u201c </em>consisting only in making a demand and protest: whereas in the case of bonds, it is necessary to sue in a reasonable time and in a judicious \u2018\u2018 manner: more necessary, because bills and notes are more in the na- \u201c ture of currency than bonds ; circulate more rapidly and generally; \u201c and are more affected by the usage of merchants. The sanction of \u201c this Court has been given to a distinction in this respect, between the \u201c two securities, and particularly in the case of <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Rose.(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">(b) 2 <em>Wash. </em>233.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\"><em>\u201c </em>The time, however, may come, when a more general transfer of \u201c bonds added to the real utility of having a <em>certain </em>rule, will make it c&lt; necessary for the legislature, or for the Courts, if they have power, <em>\u201c </em>to fix a rule also in relation to the subject before us. I should find <em>\u201c </em>considerable difficulty in proposing such an one if it were now neces- \u201c sary; but perhaps one might be adopted by analogy to the act of \u201c 1794, enabling sureties in bonds <em>to call upon </em>the creditor to bring suit. <em>\u201c </em>Perhaps it would be a reasonable rule not to impute a want of dili- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>\u201c </em>gence in suing, until a refusal, after a request <em>by the </em>assignor; and \u201c further, that a return of <em>\u201c nulla bona,\u2019\u2019 </em>upon a <em>fieri facias, </em>should <em>be </em>\u00ab sufficient evidence of diligence, in <em>pursuing </em>the judgment, <em>unless the \u201c assignor should have requested the assignee to sue out another kind of exe- \u201c cation. </em>I throw out these hints, however, at present, merely for con- <em>\u201c </em>sideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u201c The uncertainty under which the assignee <em>now stands, </em>as to what \u201c may or may not, <em>in future, </em>he deemed due diligence, by throwing a \u201c risk upon him, tends to produce a rigour of proceeding against the <em>\u201c </em>obligor,, which is hostile to the distinction between bills of exchange \u201c and bonds, before alluded to, and will probably tend to throw the lat- \u201c ter, wh\u00e9n assigned, into as rapid a course of prosecution as the <em>\u201c </em>former.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\"><em>\u201c </em>In the case of <em>Mackie </em>v. Davis, it is said to be the duty of the as- <em>\u201c </em>signee to bring suit. This is true as a <em>general, </em>though I think not as \u201c an <em>universal </em>proposition. There may be strong cases, (such for in. \u00ab stance as an absolute insolvency in the obligor .under the statute of <em>\u201c bankruptcy, </em>recently after the assignment,) jin which a suit would be <em>\u201c </em>entirely fruitless as against him, and might even produce injury to the <em>\u201c </em>assignor; for example, by <em>postponing </em>his recourse to. (possibly) an ul- <em>\u201c </em>terior and collateral indemnity; the fund for which might in the mean <em>\u201c </em>time be jeopardized and lost. It was said hy one of the appellee\u2019s \u201c counsel, that it is not enough that a want of diligence be shewn to <em>\u201c </em>exist, but also that a loss ensued therefrom. The answer is, that it \u201c lies upon the plaintiff in the action after a neglect of duty is fixed \u201c upon him, to exculpate himself by shewing that due diligence would <em>\u201c </em>not have altered the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\"><em>\u201c Nor </em>is a <em>return </em>of <em>nulla bona </em>upon an execution <em>in all cases </em>sufficient. <em>\u201c </em>There may he cases in which a <em>fierifacias </em>would certainly be ineffectual, <em>\u201c </em>and another kind of execution certainly produce the money. A debtor, \u201c for instance, may not have an atom of-personal property, yet he may <em>\u201c </em>have a valuable estate in <em>lands, or </em>he may possess a place or office <em>\u201c </em>yielding him a considerable income, and which would be lost <em>by </em>his \u201c imprisonment. In these cases, the obligation to pursue due diligence, <em>\u201c </em>(which involves a <em>judicious </em>course of proceeding,) would point out to <em>\u201c </em>the assignee the propriety of deviating from the usual course of exe- <em>\u201c </em>cution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b131-10\"><em> </em>2 <em>Wash. </em>219.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
