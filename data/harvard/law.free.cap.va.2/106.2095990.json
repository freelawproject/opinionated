It. appears by the deposition of one witness, that the appellee applied at the office for the papers, (but at what time is not stated,) and that they could not be then found; but they were afterwards found in the year 1786\u00bb or in 1787\u00bb A grant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>land to <em>Crap </em>was made out and registered in the <em>Pro prietor\u2019s </em>office, but it was never executed by lord <em>Fairfax, </em>in <em>December </em>1788, the appellee applied for ancj obtained a grant for these lands from the Commonwealth\u2019s land office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AE_z\">In 1762, the father of the appellants obtained a warrant from the <em>Proprietor\u2019s office, </em>and surveyed 243 acres, part of the land surveyed by <em>Crap, </em>for which a grant was made by lord <em>Fairfax </em>to <em>Martin </em>Picket, one of the appellants, in the year 1780. In 1779, the other appellant <em>William Picket, </em>also procured a warrant, and surveyed 450 acres adjoining the above, which includes the balance of the land claimed by the appellee, for which he obtained a grant from lord <em>Fairfax </em>in the year 1780.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">The appellee charges in his bill, that the appellants and their father had notice of the title of <em>Crap, </em>before they surveyed the land in question, but this is denied by their answers, and no proof of it is made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ab-Q\">It appears that lord <em>Fairfax </em>established sundry rules in his office, respecting the terms on which lands might be acquired in the <em>Northern Neck. </em>Amongst others, the following was inserted in one of his entry books, which was begun in the year 1734, <em>viz. </em>\u201crules of the office. That the entries are not demandable after being made six months, or the warrants taken out to continue longer than six months in force, unless renewed, or consented to, by the <em>Proprietor </em>or agent.\u201d It is proved by sundry depositions, that at different periods from the year 1740, to the year 1764, notices were given by lord <em>Fairfax </em>in the public neus-papers, and else where, calling upon all persons entitled to entries and surveys, to come forward within a limited. time, and pay the composition and office fees, and receive their grants, or that their rights would be considered as forfeited, and revested in the <em>Proprietor. </em>There is also strong proof, in the record, of abandonment of the land in question both by old <em>Crap, </em>and by his son, after his death on account of the indifferent quality of the land, and the expense of obtaining a grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The_ HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY, being of opinion, \u201c that the grant to the plaintiff of the land to which he Is entitled ought to have relation to the <em>time </em>of the warrant, by authority of which the said land was surveyed, so as to be prior in effect to the iitle of the defendants, both of whom had notice of that warrant and survey before the grants under which they claim\u201d decreed, that the defendants should convey to the plaintiff, at his costs, with warranty against themselves and all persons claiming under them, their right and title in and to the land lying within certain bounds therein described, comprehended within the limits of <em>Crap\u2019s </em>survey, and deliver possession to the plaintiff of so much of the said land as they hold, and account with, and pay to him, the rents and profits thereof, from the 10th day of <em>August, </em>1789 $ from which decree, an appeal was prayed\u00bb</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-3\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellants\u00bb</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-4\">The rule of lord <em>Fairfax?s </em>office was, that those who did not, within six months, perfect their titles to lands for which entries had been made, could not afterwards demand a grant, unless the same was consented to by the Proprietor\u201e They were considered as having abandoned their right, and the estate revested in the Proprietor, who might grant the land to any other person\u00bb This rule is proved to have subsisted so early as the year 1734, of which the people in that District were constantly notified by advertisements Inserted in the gazettes, and publicly posted up in the different counties. This rule being entered in the front of one of the entry books in the <em>Proprietors </em>office, those who applied there to take up unappropriated lands, must be presumed to have had notice of it\u00bb The existence of the rule is further established by the depositions of many witnesses, and is further strengthened by a consideration of lord <em>Fairfax\u2019s </em>situation\u00bb Possessed of a very extensive territory, the value of which depended entirely upon its being par-celled out amongst those who, as a retribution therefor, were to pay him certain quit-rents, his revenue, as well as the means of supporting his office, depend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ed upon the receipt of his fees, and of the stipulated rents, neither of which could be demanded, <em>until after a grant had been made. </em>It would have been highly unreasonable, that after a warrant had issued, the person owning it should suffer it to lie dormant for many years, without going on to acquire the legal estate, and yet keeping off other applicants. I contend therefore, that Crap, by the rules of the office, forfeited all right to the land, and that the <em>Proprietor </em>might legally make any other appropriation of it. But independently of this point, I consider that the right of <em>Crap </em>was lost by abandonment, and rely for evidence of his intention to abandon, not only upon his declarations, as proved in the cause, but upon the unreasonable length of time which elapsed <em>between </em>the issuing of the warrant to him, and that to the appellants, during which period, he seems to have shewn no disposition to obtain a grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-6\">I should insist, if it were necessary, that th\u00e9 appellants were purchasers without notice ; for though it is proved that they had heard that <em>Crap </em>had taken up land, yet it does not appear that they knew it to be the land in dispute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-7\">But I do not wish to rely upon this, because I contend first, that the right of <em>Crap </em>was completely lost by forfeiture, and secondly, if not so lost, yet a Court of Equity will never set up this dormant right in favour of a man who has been guilty of such inexcusable neglect, and who has lain by and permitted the appellants to take up and enjoy the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-8\">Campbell, for the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-9\">I shall consider the title of <em>Dowdalh</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-10\">1st. As it stands under the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJJG\">2dly. As affected by the acts of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-12\">And first, as it stands under the law. The rule laid down by the <em>Chancellor </em>is, that the grant has relation back to the warrant, which is the inception of the title 5 gives authority to the public surveyor to lay off certain lands for a particular individual, and is in short the first and best evidence of a title, acquired, either with, or without consideration. The grant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>only evidence </em>of a pre-existing right. But the objection <em>to </em>this commencement of our title is, that a forfeiture had, in the mean time Incurred, and therefore, a relation to the warrant would be improper. The forfeiture was produced by a non-compliance with the rales of the office 5 but what were those rules ? One witness speaks of them as having been written in one of the entry books in lord <em>Fairfax\u2019s </em>office, requiring persons to complete their titles within six months. Another, speaks of an advertisement of the <em>Proprietor\u2019s </em>in 1765, requiring all persons having claims to grants, to come in before <em>September </em>1766, pay the fees and composition, and receive their grants. Another witness speaks of an advertisement between the years 1740 and 1746, to the like effect, but fixing no time within which the parties were required to complete their titles. Another witness says, that even if all these requisites had been complied with, it was in the election of lord <em>Fairfax </em>to make the grant, or not, as he pleased. Thus we see, that the rules and customs of the office are so vaguely stated, that no reliance can be placed in them. But the Legislature, by the Act of 1786, <em>ch. </em>3. has regulated all these surveys, and referring back to the warrants and surveys, confirm's the titles. But let me ask whether lord Fair= <em>Jax, </em>who in this respect is to be considered as a private individual, had any right to establish rules of property, oppressive in themselves, and not warranted by the municipal laws of the country. He was at liberty to sell upon what terms he pleased. But having sold, he was as much subject to those laws and \u00a1rules which prevail in contracts between other individuals, as any other citizen was. He could not set up rules of his own to produce forfeitures not sanctioned by the common or statute laws of the land, Neither could his particular situation warrant it. If a private individual should sell land, and stipulate for payment by a certain day, under any conditions whatever, he is as much injured by a non-compliance with the contract on the part of the vendee as the <em>Proprietor </em>was. Yet if the purchaser, within a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>nine, should offer to pay, a Court of Equity would relieve against the legal consequences of his breach of contract, and compel a conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-6\">Secondly. How is the title of <em>Dowdall </em>affected by the acts of the parties ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">The grants to the appellants, it is contended, destroys our right. But the loss of the papers which prevented <em>Dowdall </em>from <em>caveating </em>the appellants, was such an accident, as a Court of Equity ought to relieve against, and therefore the title of the appellants, as opposed to that of the appellee, will be considered as if no grant had been made. It is evident that lord <em>Fairfax </em>did not suppose he was granting to the appellants lands claimed by the appellee, because it was his custom always to recite the forfeiture, where one had taken place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-8\">But it is said that <em>Crap </em>abandoned his right. Suppose he did; did this give a right to the appellants <em>? </em>He once had a title, which he has neither given nor sold to them. He has in short done nothing to divest himself, or to vest an interest in any other person. If he chose not to occupy it, did the appellants thereby gain a right to it ? Surely not. As to notice to the appellants, I consider it to be clearly proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-9\">Marshall,, in reply. \u2014 It is not proved, (I conceive) that an application was made by the appellee for the papers before the transfer from <em>Crap </em>to Dowdall, and therefore, the argument of abandonment by <em>Crap </em>is not repelled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-10\">It is true, that the grant relates back to the warrant, in cases unattended by circumstances which would render the relation improper; as if the sale be conditional, or relinquished, and a grant is made in the mean time to another, this relation, to destroy the intermediate right, could never be admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-11\">As to the rule, it was entered in a book kept in the <em>Proprietor*'s </em>office, which was open to the inspection of all persons applying there to take up land. It is traced back to the year 1734, long before the date of <em>Crap\u2019s </em>warrant, and therefore, it was not, as Mr\u00bb <em>Campbell </em>supposes, an arbitrary rule, made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Proprietor </em>for the purpose of forfeiting rights acquired under prior agreements with himself. But I ask, was not the rule a reasonable one? If dormant rights were permitted at any time to be revived, and to relate back to the warrant, no person could with safety have ven\u00bb tured to take up lands within that district 5 which would not only have been injurious to the Proprietor, but would have produced a great public mischief. If a grant had been made to <em>Crap, </em>he would have forfeited the land by non-payment of the quitrents for three years. Can lie then be io a better situation by having violated his engagements 5 or ought he thus to gain a benefit to himself, and to impose an injury upon another by his own default ? If the forfeiture were out of the question, ye\u00ed I would rely upon these considerations as sufficient to deprive <em>Dowdall </em>of the equity he asks for, upon the supposition of an implied! contract. It is said, the rule appears by the evidence to be very uncertain. This is not the case. The rule itself, as taken literally from the book in which it was entered, is an exhibit in the cause. The advertisements of lord <em>Fairfax </em>were not intended to establish a rule. He had a right to avail himself of the forfeiture, without giving the parties an opportunity of preventing it. These advertisements were Intended as an indulgence to those who had not complied with the rules of office, by granting them a further time to come in and avoid the consequences of the forfeiture which had incurred. But they did not alter, or do away, the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-5\">The Act of 1786 might be objected to, upon the ground, that the Legislature could not grant away the property of lord <em>Fairfax </em>any more than it could that of any other individual. But it is unnecessary to stir that question. It is evident, that that law does not mean to authorise the Register to issue a patent for lands, which had before been granted by the Proprietor\u201e</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">The President.- \u2014 It is surely unnecessary to labour this point, as it is too plain to be argued. The Act of .1786 is not to be construed to extend to cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>where a grant had been previously made by lord <em>Fairfax.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-8\"><em>Marshall.- </em>\u2014 As to the forfeiture not being recited in the grant to the appellants, I am inclined to think that this was never done, but where prior grants had been made and forfeited, as for non-payment of quit-rents, not seating, and the like; and it was done in those cases, because, if the forfeiture were not recited, the former grant might prevail over the latter. But this was not done, I believe, where the forfeiture accrued in consequence of a non-compliance with the rules of office, in the earlier stages towards a title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-9\">But if an actual forfeiture had not taken place, yet I contend that the conduct of Crap, and of Dowdall, has deprived them of all claim upon the equity of this Court. This is not a contest between lord <em>Fairfax </em>and <em>Crap, </em>but between two purchasers under lord <em>Fairfax. </em>How is it, that a prior mortgagee, standing by, and permitting another to throw away his money upon the same security, without disclosing his mortgage, shall be postponed? The principle of that case applies to the present. For <em>Crap </em>having notice (as is to be presumed) of the rule, and that many others might apply for a warrant to survey the same land, without a possibility of knowing what former appropriations had been made of it, he takes no step to perfect his title, and to remove this difficulty out of the way of other applicants. Lord <em>Fairfax </em>could not have compelled those to receive grants who had obtained warrants; but they might have abandoned the property if they pleased, and their refusing to abide by the rules of the office, was all they could do t\u00a9 evince their intended dereliction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b152-10\">Fleming J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvG\">When lord <em>Fairfax </em>established an office, for the purpose of parcelling out the lands in that extensive territory, some rules were necessary; and, as he differed from other individuals in the extent and nature of his property, those rules would of course be general I think he had a right to establish such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>rules as he pleased, if they were reasonable. The one in question was established so long ago as the year 1734, long antecedent to <em>Crapes </em>warrant. It was, I think, considering lord <em>Fairfaxes </em>situation, a reasonable regulation; and it is to be presumed that it was known to all persons who took up land within that district of country. The revenue of the <em>Proprietor </em>depended upon his quit-rents, which not being demandable before a grant was made, it was proper that the party should, within a limited time, place himself in such a situation, as to render the contract as obligatory upon himself as it was upon lord <em>Fairfax, </em>or that he should leave the property open for subsequent appropriations. <em>Crap </em>made his entry in 1741, and died in 1773, so that thirty-two years elapsed, during which time he took no step towards perfecting his title. If in his life-time he had obtained a grant, he would have forfeited his estate by the non-payment of quit-rents for three years, and it is unreasonable that by his own neglect he should better his situation, and subject the other party to the contract to an inconvenience resulting from that neglect. More especially in this case, when that other party had notified his intention to avail himself of the forfeiture, unless the indulgence then held out was accepted, and the terms of it complied with, within a reasonable time. I am therefore of opinion, that the right of <em>Crap </em>was lost by his neglect, and that lord <em>Fairfax </em>might legally grant the land to the appellants, or to any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Carrington J. \u2014I consider this case to be so extremely clear, that it cannot be made more so by argument. The appellee having forfeited any right which he ever had to the land in question, by the most unreasonable negligence, has no ground upon which to establish an equity, that can entitle him to the relief afforded him by the decree. I think the decree ought to-be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The PREsiDENT.~=\u201cTheappellants have obtained titles to the land in question, prior in time to that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Doxvdall, </em>and consequently have the law in their favor. Has <em>Doxvdall </em>superior equity to them, which shall warrant this Court in depriving them of the ir legal estate? What is it he asks? That the posteri or title, which he acquired by his patent, should relate back to the warrant, which was the inception of that title, so as to destroy the intervening right of the appellants. There are such things as relations in law; but they are legal fictions, invented for the purposes of justice, and not to work an injury to innocent third persons, who in the mean time have fairly and legally acquired a title to the subject in controversy. But if the doctrine were applicab!e to this case, there can be no question, but that <em>Doxvdall </em>might have availed himself of it at Law, and could not require the interference of a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">This brings us to inquire into the conduct of the parties. Has <em>Crap </em>done all in his power to intitle himself to a grant, or has he so conducted himself as to have deprived himself of such a right? If he has done all that it was necessary for him to do; then, as to lord Fairfax, the Court would consider <em>Doxvdall </em>as standing in the same situation, as if a grant had actually been made to him. But so far from it, he has done nothing which, by the conditions under which he purchased, he ought to have performed, and therefore he has not even acquired an equitable right. It is objected, that the rules of the <em>Proprietor\u2019s </em>office were not only arbitrary and uncertain, but were locked up in secrecj'. The answer given to this was complete: they were made as public as they could be, and were reasonable in themselves. I have always been of opinion that lord <em>Fairfax </em>was to be considered precisely in the same situation as any other citizen- \u2014 that he held his lands under the grant made to him as other citizens did. But his situation in the inode of parcelling out his lands was very different. He was the <em>Proprietor </em>of an extensive country, and therefore he could not make particular agreements with the different individual;; uho desired to purchase portions of his lands. On this account he established an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>office. employed different officers to transact the business of itj and laid down certain general rules defining the terms upon which he would grant his lands5 and in forming those regulations, he appears to have assimilated them as nearly as possible to those established in the Crown Office with respect to lands lying in the other parts of Virginia. How can those rules be called secret, which were published in the entry books In the office, and which- were open to the inspection of all persons applying for land. It is not unreasonable to say, that <em>Crap </em>must have known of the rule. He knew that the land was not to be given | he made no special contract with lord <em>Fairfax </em>respecting it\u00a1 and it therefore became necessary for him to know upon what terms he did purchase ; and in procuring this Information, he must have got notice of the rule in question. Besides, he proceeded some steps in conformity with the rule. He obtained a warrant, and procured it to be surveyed, though not in time. As to the reasonableness of the rule, it is nothing to this Court. <em>Crap </em>was at liberty to purchase under it, or to let it alone if he did not like the terms. The parties were the proper, and the only judges of this. <em>Crap </em>having surveyed the land, went no farther. He paid neither fees nor composition, and consequently deprived lord <em>Fairfax </em>of such a portion of his revenue. How then can we consider him as standing in the same situation as if he had actually obtained a grant? It was objected, that lord <em>Fairfax </em>should have made an entry to complete the forfeiture, or should have done some act tantamount to an entry. This might have been necessary, if he had made a grant to the appellee, and the forfeiture had incurred afterwards, as for non-payment of quit-rents. It was not necessary where the legal estate had never been out of him. But If it were, I think he did an act tantamount to an entry, by granting warrants to the <em>twoPicketsto </em>survey the land for themselves\u00bb As to the custom of reciting in subsequent grants the prior forfeiture, <em>l </em>suppose It was similar to that which prevailed in the Crown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Office, and there it was never done but in cases where there had been <em>a prior grant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVjH\">Concerning the advertisements of lord <em>Fairfax, </em>I [\u00b60 not th!nk he was in any manner obliged to give the notice for which they were intended, it was <em>Crap's </em>duty to perform the conditions which the rules of the office imposed, by paying; the composition, and apph ing for his grant. This he was at least bound to do w ithin a reasonable time, and before the land was re-granted. The advertisements held out an indulgence, which not having been accepted, nor the terms of it complied with, diminishes still more the claim of <em>Dowdall </em>to the relief of a Court of Equity. It is true, that the appellants did not strictly comply with the rules of the office, and of course they were liable to the legal effect of such conduct, if a warrant had been granted to another. But this was not done; lord <em>Fairfax, </em>exercising a power which belonged to him, waved the forfeiture, and as a proof that he had done so, executed grants to them.</p>\n<p id=\"AxT\">I think the abandonment by <em>Crap </em>is fully proved. It is true that <em>legal </em>rights once vested, must be legally divested ; but <em>equitable </em>rights may be lost by dereliction.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">It is unnecessary to inquire if the <em>Pickets </em>had no tice of <em>Crap's </em>title; since if they had, it could not have affected them, unless <em>Dowdall </em>had been prevented by fraud from obtaining a legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that the appellants have superior equity on their side, especially against <em>Dowdall, </em>who seems to have come into the dispute as a volunteer, under an idea, that the Act of 1786 had given him a chance. But it is too clear, that that Act cannot apply to cases where grants had been made bv the <em>Proprietor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">THE OPINION of the COURT is, \u201cthat the appellee^ grant in the year 1788, ought not to have relation to the time of the w arrant, by authority of which the land wras surveyed, dated in 1741, so as to be prior in effect to the intervening title of the appellants; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>because relation being a legal fietions adopted for the furtherance of justice, is not to be admitted in any , case to produce wrong and injury to others, nor particularly in this case, where that relation comprehends a period of forty-seven years, and tends to establish a dormant claim in equity, never perfected by <em>James Crap </em>the elder, by paying the office fees and eomposition, so as to entitle himself-to a grant of the land, but on the contrary forfeited and abandoned by him, and by his heir after his death, as being not worth the pursuit, in consequence of which the <em>Proprietor </em>might lawfully grant the lands to another, and accordingly did grant them to the appellants, whose conduct in obtaining their said grants and legal preference appears to have been fair and irreproachable, so as to entitle them to more equity than the appellee, who became a volunteer for reviving this dormant and abandoned claim, some years after the date of the grants to the appellants, and that the said decree iserroneousN</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">Decree reversed with costs, and the bill dismissed with the costs of the Court of Chancery.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-4\">(1) <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Suddarth, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 350.
