The Court upon motion quashed these executions with costs, including an attorney\u2019s fee, assigning the following reason for their opinion: \u201c That the said writs were illegal, because <em>Langham </em>was a resident of <em>Fluvanna </em>county, and the said executions were levied upon him in the county of Henrico, whither he had gone at the time the said writs of execution were levied, and it not appearing, that he had removed his property out of the county of <em>FluvannaF</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-9\">The appellant excepted to the opinion of the Court, because the following evidence was determined to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>sufficient to prove that notice was given of this mo1 tion. A notice in writing was proved to have been delivered to the appellant, stating that a motion would be made on a certain day of the next Court, to quash four executions issued from the Clerk\u2019s office of <em>Fluvanna </em>Court, against him the said <em>Langham, </em>to satisfy <em>Alexander JBrydie, </em>assignee of <em>William Galt </em>\u00a35? <em>Co., </em>and one other execution issued from the same office, to satisfy <em>Alexander Brydie id Co., </em>which executions issued on the 6th of <em>August, </em>and were made returna ble to the succeeding <em>October </em>Term, all of which ex* ecutions were contrary to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">The appellee also proved by a witness, that he had heard a collector of the appellant\u2019s say, that he had understood that motions were to be made at this Court to quash the above executions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">The judgment of the County Court was affirmed in the District Court of <em>Charlottesville, </em>where it was carried by appeal. From this judgment, an appeal was granted to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-10\"><em>Copland, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-11\">Until the Act of 1748, c. 8, no writ of execution could issue from one County Court directed to the Sheriff of another county. By this law \u00a7 20, it is enacted, that where judgment is rendered in any County or inferior Court, for debt, or damages, and the defendant shall remove himself <em>and his effects, </em>or shall reside out of the limits of the jurisdiction of such Court, the Clerk is authorised to issue any writ of <em>scire facias </em>or <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>directed to the Sheriff of any county, where the defendant, or debtor, or his goods shall be found. Now it is evident, that the fair construction of this law, is, that if the defendant remove himself <em>or his effects, </em>execution may go into any county where his person or effects are to be found. If it were otherwise, the defendant might easily evade the provisions of the law, by removing himself, and leaving effects of small value behind him. Besides, it does not appear in this case, that the appellee had, any effects at all, in <em>Fluvanna, </em>and the Court cannot presume he had\u00bb The record \u2022 states. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>that it did not appear he had removed his effects\u00bb But it should have been proved that he had not removed them\u00bb If the law be taken literally, it would follow, that if the defendant has effects in any other county than that, in which he resides, a <em>scire facias </em>may issue to that county.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-3\">Marshall, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-4\">There can be little doubt about the true construction of this law. The removal contemplated by the Legislature was a permanent one <em>\\ </em>it must be a complete abandonment of the county, in which the defendant resided. The evidence of such a removal, is the carrying with him the bulk of his property. The leaving of a small part behind, would be considered as a mere evasion, and would not avail the party. The inquiry in such a case must always be, whether the removal was a substantial one, or a mere going out of the county with an intention of returning; and upon the evidence of the one, or of the other, the propriety, or impropriety of issuing the process to a different county, must always depend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">The record leaves no room for doubt in this case, that the defendant had not removed himself with a view to abandon the county of <em>Fluvanna.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The Court affirmed the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
