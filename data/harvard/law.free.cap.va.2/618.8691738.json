' '</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3rA\"><em>CRAIG </em>instituted a suit in the late High Court of Chancery against Coutts, to compel the specific execution of a contract whereby <em>Coutts </em>agreed to convey to <em>Craig </em>the tenement, in the city of Richmond., then in the occupation of <em>Hicks </em>and Campbell, thus described in the article of agreement: \u201c which tenement contains two stores, the \u201c small brick house which Dr. <em>Cringan </em>has his shop in, \u201c and a large lumber-house, and the lot of ground extending to <em>Crouch's </em>line.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2IV\">For the above property, <em>Craig </em>was to pay 1,800. viz. the houses and lot in Manchester-, called \u201c <em>Goode's </em>tene- \u201c ment,\u201d at the price of 900/. and the residue in bonds to be assigned by <em>Craig </em>on or before a stipulated period. The bill stated the purchase, and boundaries of the averment; that <em>Craig </em>had always been ready to comply with the contract on his part; had actually delivered the tenement in Manchester, and assigned bonds to Coutts, to nearly the .amount of the purchase-money; but that Coutts, under various frivolous pretexts, had refused to convey the tenement in Richmond-, positively denying that the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>embraced as much ground as was contended for by <em>Craig. </em>The answer of <em>Coutts </em>moreover alleged, that it was out of the power of <em>Craig </em>to make a good title to <em>Goode\u2019s </em>tenement, m consequence oi which, and or the delay which had occurred, he had been deprived of an opportunity of selling it, and thereby had been compelled to submit to great sacrifices of property; that he never contemplated, a sale to <em>Craig </em>of more ground than that on which the houses were erected ; and that even <em>Craig </em>himself, at the time of the contract, did not expect to receive a conveyance for the vacant ground, for which he now contends. Underthese cixxumstances, <em>Coutts </em>xxliedthat a Court of Equity would not decree him to convey the tenement in <em>Richmond </em>to <em>Craig; </em>but expressed a willingness to refund whatever he had received, in part execution of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-7\">The exhibits filed in the cause, shewed a small balance, due in bonds, from <em>Craig </em>to <em>Coutts ; </em>but it also appeared, that the tenement in Richmond, had previously to the sale to Craig, been incumbered by <em>Coutts </em>with a deed of trust, of which <em>Craig </em>had no notice at the <em>time; </em>the amount of which ^ added to the payments already made by Craig, greatly exceeded the original purchase-money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-8\">A great number of depositions were taken on both sides. On the part of Craig, the deposition of the person who drew the articles, together with sevei'al others who were present, or had previously been in treaty for the same prqr perty, proved the bcundaries of the tenement to be as contended for by <em>Craig; </em>and .that he was to have the whole lot without any reservation. It was further proved, that <em>Craig </em>was able, and had always .been willing, to com\u00bb ply with the contract on his part. On the other side, it was proved that <em>Coutts </em>had made great sacrifices to raise money, which he alleged' arose from his not being able to obtain a title for \u201c <em>Goode\u2019s </em>tenement,\u201d froxn <em>Craig; </em>and, moreover, an attempt was made to shew, that the tenement In Richmond, as occupied by <em>Hicks </em>and Campbell, did not Comprehend the ground in

It would be monstrous to say that beeause property on a street was sold <em>nominatim, </em>it should not extend back, to include the whole lot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-5\">The defendant having in his answer, attempted to raise an ambiguity, in the agreement, it was proper, according to a well known rule of law, to introduce parol evidence to explain it. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-6\">That <em>Craig </em>had more than complied with his contract was obvious from the report of the commissioner; and the only question was, how much <em>Coutts </em>would have to refund.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b637-15\"> <em>Roberts en Stat. of Frauds, </em>11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Friday, <em>October </em>14.

The defendant in his answer having positively denied that interpretation of the written agreement, between the plaintiff and himself, which appears obvious upon the face of it, I think the plaintiff was entitled to resort to parol testimony to explain it, according ta the intention of the parties, as declared and understood between them, and by the witnesses themselves at the time. That explanation barely confirms the obvious interpretation, and perfectly invalidates the -answer, which alone could create a doubt as to the true meaning of the agreement. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the decree be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"AJ1H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac9K\">There are only two grounds upo'\u00fc which the appellants\u2019 construction of the agreement can be maintained: 1st. That, in point of fact, there is <em>vacant </em>jan(j iying between the lumber-house and <em>Crouch\u2019s </em>line, which may satisfy this expression in the agreement, 44 a \u201c large lumber-house and the <em>lot </em>of ground extending to \u201c <em>Crouch\u2019s </em>lineor, 2dly. That, if that expression cannot <em>thus </em>be satisfied, the grant of the land in question, is nevertheless restrained, by the stipulation on the part of Coutts, therein contained, to make a deed \u201c for the lot and houses 44 before mentioned and now in the possession of <em>Hicks </em>41 and <em>Campbell\u2019\u2019 </em>In the first view, <em>testimony </em>must be resorted to, on the part of the appellants, if they would vary the (otherwise) clear construction of the agreement, carrying the land in controversy to the appellee. And, in the second view, the restriction contended for, on the part of the appellant, will be obviated by testimony shewing that, in truth, the land in controversy was at the time in possession of <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Campbell. </em>I am inclined to think that, in both cases, such testimony is proper; not as varying the agreement, as upon its own face, but supplying facts necessary for the understanding of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">As to the first view; it is clear, that <em>no land </em>is vacant between the lumber-house and <em>Crouch\u2019s </em>line; or at least, if any, it is so extremely minute a slip, as not to satisfy the expression 44 lot.\u201d I infer, that there is none; because by the deed of February, 1793, among the exhibits, <em>Coutts </em>leases to <em>Hicks </em>a piece or parcel of land 44 <em>adjoining </em>the 44 land of <em>Richard </em>Crouch, containing in front\u201d (on the street leading to the governor\u2019s house) 44 <em>forty </em>feet, and 44 running back <em>thirty\u2018two </em>feet,\u201d and on which <em>Hicks </em>covenants to build a lumber-house of 44 <em>forty </em>by <em>thirty </em>feet\u201d dimensions. If, therefore, the house was built according to the terms of the lease, <em>i. e. </em>forty feet long, not an inch of vacant ground could be left: but this is not all. <em>John Hicks </em>tells us, in his deposition, (referring tq this lease,) that he undertook to build a lumber-house of certain dimensions, 44 <em>which was erected.\u201d </em>I take it, therefore, to be-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>clearly established that no vacant land does exist in that , . , , , quarter, or at least, no piece large enough to be denominated a \u201c lot of ground,\u201d and thus falsify the terms of the r\u2122 . . agreement. The general expression m the agreement must, therefore, operate in favour of the appellees, unless (in the second view of the case) it be shewn that the land in question, was not in possession of <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Campbell; </em>thus restraining, by proof, the latitude of the expressions in the agreement: but, on the contrary, we are told by Hicks, that although he did not claim the land in question, <em>by virtue of his </em>lease, yet that he paid a \u201c yearly rent for the back \u201c ground and houses he made use ofwhich account is also corroborated by the testimony of <em>Campbell; </em>they, therefore, were in possession of the land in controversy. Both grounds of restriction, therefore, fail the appellants^ and the Chancellor\u2019s construction of the agreement is undoubtedly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">I am of opinion that the decree of the Superior Court of Chancery be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b639-11\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A8W\">The principal point in controversy is whether the whole lot of forty-two feet on the main street, and extending the same breadth up to <em>Crouch\u2019s </em>line, was contracted for? and it seems clearly to me that it was so, by the written contract itself: but had there been a doubt on the subject, I am of opinion, that, from precedents in this Court, particularly in the case of <em>Flemings </em>v. Willis, parol evidence was admissible to explain the intention of the parties. It is a very plain case; and I concur in opinion that the decree of the Chancellor be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the decree of the Superior Court of Chancery affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
