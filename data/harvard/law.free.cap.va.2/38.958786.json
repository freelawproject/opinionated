This report ascertained that the amount advanced by <em>Strider, </em>with the interest thereon, was fully satisfied by the hires of the boy; leaving <em>Strider </em>debtor on account of these hires in the sum of 32 dollars 92 cents; and that the value of the boy on the 1st of April 1834, was 600 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>In June 1837, the cause came on to he finally heard, when the Court being of opinion that the agreement between <em>Strider </em>and <em>William Reid </em>was a mortgage, made a decree directing the slave to be delivered to the plaintiff; and that <em>Strider </em>should pay to the plaintiff the sum of 32 dollars 92 cents, with interest from the 20th day of June 1837, the time to which the account of hires was brought down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-4\">From this decree the defendant applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-5\">Cooke, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH\">The contract between <em>Strider </em>and <em>Reid </em>contains all the distinguishing features of a conditional sale. First. Possession was delivered by <em>Reid </em>to <em>Strider </em>at the time of the transaction. The cases of <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell, </em>1 Wash. 14, and <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>Id. 125, illustrate the importance of this fact in determining the nature of the contract. Second. There was no pre-existing debt from <em>Reid </em>to <em>Strider. </em>On that point the Court is referred to <em>Comegys </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>7 Cranch 238. Third. There is no covenant by <em>Reid to </em>repay the money advanced by <em>Strider. </em>On that point see <em>Comegys </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>supra; and <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call 280. In fine, it is a sale with a right to repurchase at a fixed price, <em>(id cerium est quod certum reddi </em>potest) and at a specified time, which is the characteristic of a conditional sale. <em>Comegys v. Alexander, </em>supra; and <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>2 Call 421.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">If this is a mortgage to be redeemed, it is a mortgage to be foreclosed. The rights are correlative. But it is obvious on the face of the contract, that <em>Strider </em>could not have sustained a bill to foreclose. He is forbidden by the terms of the contract; and he is precluded by the fact, that <em>Reid </em>has not covenanted to pay any money. He has reserved a right to pay and take back the slave, but he has not bound himself to do so.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\n<em>C. &amp; G. N. Johnson,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amv\">for the appellee. The general rale upon the question, whether an agreement is a mortgage or conditional sale, is, that every case must be determined upon its own circumstances. There are, however, subordinate to this general rule, some more special rules applicable to the construction of these instruments. And first, where the transaction is a loan of money, and the contract is made to secure it, there it is a mortgage. Second, once a mortgage always a mortgage. Third, the intention of the parties will determine the nature of the instrument. These propositions are stated by Coote on Mortgages, 18 Law Lib. p. 9 to 13. Some of them are sustained by <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Alexander, 7 </em>Cranch 218; though there the Court held, that the instrument was a conditional sale. And the Court is referred to 2 Rob. Pr. 51, where some of the cases decided in this Court are cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-5\">If <em>Reid </em>only wanted the value of his slave, then a sale under the deed of trust to <em>Robert Reid </em>would have answered his purpose ; but the making this arrangement with <em>Strider, to </em>prevent that sale, is a strong evidence that this contract is a loan of money. The fact, too, that the hires of the boy are to go for interest; and that the sum advanced was to be returned at a specified time without interest, was held to be a strong feature of a loan in <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Alexander, supra. </em>And the fact, that before <em>Strider </em>advanced the money, <em>Reid </em>was to procure the assignment of the deed of trust, from the trustee, must have been intended to give to <em>Strider </em>the benefit of that security for the money he should advance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-6\">As the assignment of the trust deed enabled <em>Strider </em>to sell the slave for the payment of the money advanced by him to <em>William Reid, </em>a covenant by <em>Reid </em>to pay it was unnecessary; and the argument founded on the absence of such a covenant in the agreement, therefore fails. Indeed it is well said by <em>Tucker, </em>President, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>Moss </em>v. <em>Green, </em>10 Leigh 251, that the want of a covenant to repay the money, is by no means conclusive of the nature of the contract; and he expresses his surprise that so much importance has been attached to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-11\">It is said that <em>Strider </em>was estopped by his contract from selling. But though estopped to sell under his agreement, there was no restraint to his proceeding to sell under the trust; especially after the 1st January 1834. At that time, <em>Reid </em>might have made his election of the alternatives of the contract; or, he failing to do so, <em>Strider </em>might have elected to sell or to foreclose the mortgage; but neither having exercised their right at that time, the right of election reverted to <em>Reid, </em>and his administrator has exercised that right by asking to redeem the slave.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-12\">It is said again that the rights of redemption and foreclosure are correlative, and that as <em>Strider </em>could not foreclose, <em>Raid </em>could not redeem. It is not always true that the rights to redeem and to foreclose, are correlative. Goote on Mortgages, 18 Law Libr. 33. But why might not <em>Strider </em>have foreclosed the mortgage. The difficulty is raised by assuming that the agreement is a conditional sale. If it is a conditional sale, so as to preclude <em>Strider </em>from a foreclosure, of course we would be precluded from redeeming. But that is to assume the whole question in dispute. If it is a mortgage, then he might foreclose, and we may redeem it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AUA\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahz\">delivered the opinion of the Gourt.</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">The Court is of opinion, that the contract, as understood by both parties, and as appears from a true construc<em>tion of </em>the agreement between them, was a conditional sale of the slave, at a price to be fixed by a fair valuation at a future day; that the mode of ascertaining the price, was for the benefit of the <em>seller; </em>and in this aspect the case is free from the objection sometimes preferred, that such contracts are a device resorted to for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the purpose of obtaining property from a needy debtor at less than its fair value. In this case possession of the property was delivered to the purchaser, who was entitied to retain such possession until the time fixed for the payment of the money, without accounting for hires. That the seller reserved the right to abrogate the contract of sale, by returning the money advanced, without interest; and if not so abrogated, the contract of sale became executed, and <em>Strider </em>became liable for the balance of the price of the boy. The Court is therefore of opinion, that there was error in holding the contract to be a mortgage and not a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The Court is further of opinion, that as it appears the slave was worth 600 dollars on the 1st of April 1834, in the absence of any other proof as to his value on the 1st of January 1834, that sum should have been taken as the price of the slave on that day; and that a decree should have been given against <em>Stricter, </em>for 420 dollars, the balance, after deducting the 180 dollars advanced, with interest on said 420 dollars from 1st January 1834 until paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Decree reversed with costs; and a decree according to the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
