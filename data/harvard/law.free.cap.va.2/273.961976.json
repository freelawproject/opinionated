The circuit court, being of opinion that the conveyance by metes and bounds by one joint tenant, of a portion of the land held jointly, was void, refused to permit the same to go in evidence to the jury; and a verdict and judgment were rendered for the demandants. Held, the circuit court erred; and its judgment therefore reversed, the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial, on which the conveyance, if offered, is not to be rejected on the ground that it is void.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-9\">This was a writ of right in the circuit court of <em>Lee, </em>brought by certain persons as the heirs of <em>Walter Preston </em>against <em>Isaac Robinett. </em>At the trial of the mise, the demandants introduced a grant of the commonwealth of <em>Virginia, </em>dated the 30th of May 1800, to <em>Walter Preston </em>for 1000 acres of land lying partly within the disputed territory comprised within or between <em>Walker\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and <em>Henderson's </em>lines ; and the tenant admitted the demandants to be the heirs of the said <em>Walter Preston. </em>Whereupon the tenant introduced a copy of a grant of the commonwealth of <em>North Carolina, </em>dated the 12th 0p July 1794, to <em>Andrew </em>and <em>David Greer </em>for 640 acres of land beginning on <em>Henderson's </em>line and lying south thereof, within the said disputed territory :<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and the said tenant also introduced, as a link in his chain of title, and to connect himself with the grant to the said <em>Greers, </em>a deed dated the 26th of September 1797, from <em>Andrew Greer, </em>one of said grantees, to <em>Da-vid Archer, </em>conveying by metes and bounds 320 of the said 640 acres of land, being the northern half thereof. To the introduction of this deed as evidence the demandants objected, upon the ground that as no partition of this grant had been made by the grantees, it was not competent for one of them, a joint tenant of the granted land, to convey by metes and bounds such portion as he pleased, without the assent of his cotenant, and in prejudice of his <em>rights; </em>and that such conveyance is wholly void. The tenant contended, that from the great lapse of time, and other circumstances, the assent of <em>David Greer, </em>the other grantee, to this partition of <em>Andrew Greer </em>by his deed of conveyance aforesaid, was to be presumed ; and in support of such presumption offered two depositions of <em>William Wilson, </em>mentioning an old survey by one <em>Thompson </em>for the purpose of partition, and also offered the conveyance by said <em>Archer </em>of this 320 acres of land to <em>Lawrence Horn, </em>and shewed that the sheriff of <em>Hawhins </em>county, <em>Tennessee, </em>levied on this land and sold <em>and </em>conveyed the same to <em>John Hannah, </em>who conveyed the same on the 27th of November 1804 to <em>William Armstrong, </em>under whom, in 1816, possession was first taken ; which possession has been regularly transmitted, by various deeds of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>veyance, down to the tenant, and to the commencement of this suit on the 24th of July 1837, and to this time, The tenant also introduced the following witnesses. <em>Amos Grantham </em>proved, that wishing to purchase some of the land, he went in 1816 to <em>Knoxville, Tennessee, </em>where he found <em>George Wilson, </em>a son in law of one of the said <em>Greers, </em>who claimed half of said <em>Noj-th Carolina </em>grant, and shewed the witness the grant, and offered to sell to witness half of it for 800 dollars, which witness refused to give; and <em>Wilson </em>said at that time, that the land had never been divided, that he had never seen it, and that he knew nothing of it except by information. <em>Lincoln Amis </em>proved that the common report in the neighbourhood of the land was, and is, that one <em>Thompson </em>a surveyor, wishing to purchase some of the land, had divided the same; but how he divided it, or by what authority, the witness has not heard and does not know. <em>Stephen Wilborn </em>proved, that.more than 40 years ago he saw some one surveying this land for <em>William Armstrong, </em>as he understood ; but whether it was <em>Thompson, </em>or who it was, the witness does not know. It appeared at the trial, that there was less than 640 acres in the <em>North Carolina </em>grant; that the quantity claimed by the tenant under <em>Andrew Greer </em>is about 220 acres; and that the land so claimed by the tenant is within the grant to <em>Walter Preston. </em>There was no evidence to shew what had become of the other half of the <em>North Carolina </em>grant, or whether it is possessed or claimed by any person, except the evidence before stated ; nor did it appear which of the <em>Greers </em>was father in law to <em>Wilson, </em>or whether they are living or dead, or whether there be any descendants or heirs of them or either of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">The circuit court, upon the authority of certain cases decided by the supreme courts of <em>Massachusetts, Connecticut </em>and <em>Vermont, </em>(which it stated were to be found in 12 Mass.

Such conveyance severs the joint tenancy by destroying the unity of title, and also by destroying the unity of possession ; for the alienee and the remaining tenant have several freeholds. 2 Cruise\u2019s Dig. title 18. ch. 2. \u00a7 10. But though cases of severance by the conveyance of one joint tenant are of frequent occurrence, this happens, it is said, where such conveyance is of the joint tenant\u2019s estate in the land, but not where it is of <em>apart of the land. </em>As between the joint tenants; there may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>be good reason for holding that a conveyance by one, of a specific parcel of the land, should not affect his cotenant. They are seized per <em>mi et per tout, </em>and neither has a right at his election to convey a particular portion, so as to affect or prejudice his cotenant. The cases in Massachusetts Reports, cited in the argument, establish the proposition that one shall not convey so as to prejudice the cotenant. And this is the extent to which they have gone. As between the tenant conveying and his grantee, in one of the earliest cases <em>(Porter </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>9 Mass. R. 34.) it is intimated that such conveyance may operate by way of estoppel against the grantor; which could not be if the deed were to be considered as entirely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The earlier cases in that court arose in controversies where the tenants were parties. But in <em>Varnum </em>v. <em>Abbot &amp;c. </em>12 Mass. R. 480. the question directly arose, whether such a conveyance had any effect as against the grantor and those claiming under him ? After reviewing the cases in which it had been held that such a conveyance could have no legal effect to the prejudice of a cotenant, the court proceeded to consider its effect as against the grantor, and determined that it is effectual against him. If upon a partition the share assigned to the cotenant does not include the part conveyed, the cotenant has got all he has a right to, and the grantor cannot be permitted to deny his deed. So in the case of a release by the cotenant to the alienee, of his moiety in the part conveyed, the alienee would have a deed from each, and yet, if the first conveyance was merely void, it could not help the <em>second; </em>and so the party in possession, with deeds from each of the tenants who alone had any pretence of title to the land, would still be unable to maintain the possession. For these and other reasons given by the court, they determined that the deed is not absolutely void.</p>\n<p id=\"ArN6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>With us, there are still stronger reasons (if any were required) for holding such deeds not to be void. All grants are to be most strongly construed against the grantor; and by our statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99. \u00a7 20. pt 3gg_ alienations purporting to pass or assure a greater right or estate than the grantor may lawfully pass or assure, shall operate as alienations of so much of the right and estate as the grantor might lawfully convey. Under the covenants of such a deed as this, though it might be ineffectual to pass the particular tract as against the cotenant, yet as against the grantor and strangers it would be effectual to pass the interest of the grantor in the tract. Possession under it would support a release from the cotenant: and if the part conveyed were assigned to the alienee on partition, the title would be absolute at law. The deed being good against the grantor, the entry of the tenant under it would be lawful; and though it might be inoperative so far as the rights of the cotenant were thereby prejudiced, yet as it would invest the grantee with the estate of the grantor so far as he could lawfully convey, the grantee would be tenant in common with the co-tenant of his grantor, to the extent of the interest conveyed. His possession and seisin would be the possession and seisin of both, because such possession and seisin would not be adverse to the right of his companion, but in support of their common title.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">I think, therefore, that the court erred in deciding that the deed was merely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Even if the matter were more doubtful than I think it is, still the court erred in excluding the deed. Evidence was introduced tending to prove that a partition had been made between the tenants. The jury were the judges of the effect of that evidence. If a partition had in fact been made, though without deed, and the parties had held in severalty afterwards for a period sufficiently long to bar a writ of right, the jury might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>have presumed a deed. Whether the circumstances in evidence would have justified such presumption, it is not necessary t'o determine. The deed, in connexion with the other evidence, was admissible, as tending to prove facts from which such a presumption might arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">The deed, too, was proper evidence on other grounds. The tenant (as the bill of exceptions discloses) relied on the possession. Whether the evidence would have made out such a possession as of itself would have been sufficient to bar a recovery, was a question of fact for the jury. If the tenant claimed to hold by virtue of the deed, though it might not have furnished evidence of title, it would have shewn that he claimed under colour of title, and was not a mere naked trespasser. In that point of view, and for the purpose of defining and designating the extent of his possession, the deed was proper evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">I think the judgment should be reversed, the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial, upon which the deed, if offered, is not to be rejected upon the ground that it was merely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The other judges concurring, judgment entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
