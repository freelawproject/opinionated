After directing his debts to be paid by a sale of his perishable property, he desires all his lands, negroes, and money, to be equally divided among his seven children. In a subsequent clause of his will, he says : \u201c It is my will and desire that if any of my children should die before they attain to legal age, or without a lawful heir, in either case, that all such property as they may receive in the division of my property return to my surviving children or their lawful heirs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">After the death of <em>Thomas Crow, </em>two of his children died under the age of twenty-one years, and their shares of the estate were divided among the survivors. <em>Elizabeth, </em>another child, married <em>Benjamin Brooke, </em>and died in 1833, having attained the age of twenty-one years, but never having had a child. Immediately upon the death of <em>Mrs. Brooke, </em>this suit was instituted by <em>Croxton </em>and wife, and the other surviving children of <em>Thomas Crow, </em>to recover from <em>Brooke </em>the land, slaves, and money, which had come into his hands in right of his wife <em>Elizabeth, </em>from the estate of her father. <em>Brooke </em>answered, disclaiming all title to the land, but insisting that his wife having attained to twenty-one years of age, he was entitled to the personal property which she had received from her father\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\">The canse came on to be heard in 1839, when the Court expressed the opinion, that under the will of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Thomas Crow, </em>the personal estate derived by <em>Mrs. Brooke </em>from her father, belonged to the surviving children of <em>Thomas Crow ; </em>and made a decree in their favom, por (]ie siaves j and directed a commissioner to take an acc0lint any money or other property which had been received by <em>Brooke </em>in right of his wife <em>Elizabeth, </em>under the will of <em>Thomas Croio, </em>and of the hires and profits of the slaves during the time they were held by <em>Brooke, </em>after the death of his wife. Prom this.decree, <em>Brooke </em>obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-4\"><em>G. N. Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac0J\">insisted that the will of <em>Thomas Crow </em>was to be construed as if the word \u201cor\u201d had been \u201cand.\u201d And to shew that this might be done, he referred to Bridgman\u2019s Digest, 742-3, title \u201cWords;\u201d Powell on Devises, by Jarmin, 379-384; 21 Law Lib. 223; <em>Framlingham </em>v. <em>Brand, </em>3 Atk. R. 390; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>Id. 193; <em>Denn </em>on dem. <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Kerneys, </em>9 East\u2019s R. 366 ; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Holladay, </em>3 Munf. 510; <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Opie, </em>1 Call 212 ; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>1 Taunt. R. 174; <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>5 Bos. &amp; Pul. 38; <em>Read </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>2 Atk. R. 643. He then insisted, that the use of the word \u201c either\u201d had arisen out of the same error which had induced the use of the word \u201cor\u201d for \u201cand.\u201d Or the word \u201c either\u201d might be considered as referring not to the limitations, but to the children. But whether this last suggestion be correct or not, it was, obviously, against the whole scheme of the will, and the intention of the testator, that both events should occur before the estate became absolute in the first taker. And to effect the intention, the Court might reject the words entirely. Ramm on Wills, 98; Lomax\u2019s Dig. 122; <em>M\u2019Clintic </em>v. <em>Manns, </em>4 Munf. 328.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-5\">He farther insisted, that the personal estate derived by <em>Mrs. Brooke </em>from her brothers, who died after the father, did not pass by the limitation over, even if that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>which she received from him, did so pass. It was true, it passed on the death of these brothers to <em>Mrs. </em>Brooke, under the operation of the will of <em>Thomas Crow </em>; and was, therefore, embraced within the terms of the decree of the Court below; but the limitation having once ' operated to transfer the property, it was exhausted, and could not operate again to transfer it from <em>Mrs. Brooke </em>or her husband to the children of <em>Thomas Crow, </em>who survived her. 2 Roper on Leg. <em>286; Barnes </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>stated in <em>Pain v. Benson, </em>3 Atk. R. 79; 2 Powell on Devises, by Jarmin, 624-630; 22 Law Lib. 333-337.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-10\"><em>Berry, </em>and <em>Patton, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anz\">admitted, that <em>\u201c </em>or\u201d might be read \u201c and\u201d to effectuate the manifest intention of the testator, apparent from the will. But they insisted, that there was no case where this had been done when the testator had used other words to indicate his intention in the use of the word \u201cor.\u201d They insisted farther, that the word \u201c either,\u201d necessarily referred to two objects, and could not properly refer to more, and, therefore, both from its own nature, and its position in the sentence, must refer to the limitations and not to the children. And they insisted, that the language of the will was plain, and wholly free from all doubt as to its meaning; and the Court could not, upon any supposition of what were the natural promptings of a parent, or what was just and proper, undertake to say that the testator did not mean what he clearly said; or make a will for him, according to views of propriety which the Court might entertain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-12\">Upon the question whether the limitation would transfer the estate a second time, they suggested, it was doubtful if the question arose on the record ,\u2022 and that it would be still open, though the decree in this case should be affirmed. But if it was presented on the record, they took a distinction between the case of a separate legacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>limited over, which they admitted would not pass a second time under the limitation, and the case where the legacies are of an aggregate fund given to several, with directions that it shall survive. And for this distinction, they referred to 2 Roper on Leg. 290-291.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b530-4\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Apbv\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The Court is of opinion, that though according to a series of decisions, it would be competent to construe the word <em>\u201c </em>or\u201d conjunctively, instead of disjunctively, in the limitations of a will, where such a construction is necessary to carry out the intent of the testator as manifested on the face of the will, such construction could not be made in the present case without disregarding the other words, \u201cin either case,\u201d immediately following the word \u201c or\u201d in the preceding clause, referring to it as its next antecedent, and clearly manifesting the intent that the limitation over was to take effect upon the happening of either contingency, the dying before attaining 21 years of age, or without lawful heir: an intent equally manifested by the subsequent provision for the <em>return </em>of all such property which the first taker received, to his surviving children or their lawful heirs. The Court is therefore of opinion, there is no error in so much of said decree as decides that the property acquired by the said <em>Elizabeth </em>as her original share under the will of the testator, on the contingency which has happened of her dying without issue, passed under said will to the appellees. But the Court is further of opinion, that as to any accretions which may have accrued to her in her lifetime, by the death of other devisees or legatees under age, or without issue, they do not again survive, under the terms of the will. On the contrary, the remainder was given as an absolute estate, without any restriction. The Court is further of opinion, that as by the bill and proceedings, it appears that two of the children, <em>John </em>and George, had died without issue, in whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>shares the said <em>Elizabeth </em>was entitled to remainders under the will of the testator, the terms of the decree, which holds that the property acquired by said <em>Elizabeth, </em>and her husband in her right, under the will of the testator, passed under the said will to the appellees, are broad enough to embrace such remainders accruing to her by survivorship, as well as her original share. The Court is therefore of opinion, that in this respect, as to the property acquired by said <em>Elizabeth, </em>or her husband in her right, by survivorship, the said decree is erroneous; The same is, therefore, reversed with costs, as to so much thereof as is herein declared to be erroneous, and affirmed for the residue. And the cause is remanded for further proceedings, according to the principles of this decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
