Moffett </em>sued out a <em>capias </em>against <em>Turner </em>and <em>Chilton, </em>which was served upon <em>Turner. </em>The declaration was upon an <em>assumpsit </em>against <em>Chilton </em>only. <em>Turner </em>and <em>Moffet </em>by consent, refered the cause to arbitration, under a rule of Court, and agreed that the award should be made the judgment of the Court. An award was made in favour of the appellee for 132/. <em>5s. 9d., </em>for which judgment was entered, and also <em>for the costs.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-10\">Marshall, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-11\">Contended, that the judgment was erroneous for two reasons, first, because it is against <em>Turner, </em>when by the appellee\u2019s own shewing it appears, that <em>Chilton, </em>and not <em>Turner, </em>was the debtor. The declaration is against <em>Chilton </em>only, and there is no charge against <em>Turner. </em>In the case <em>o\u00ed .Picket v. </em>Clayborne, this Court determined, that a confession of judgment cured the want of a declaration ; but he knew of no case where the reference of a suit, and an award made thereupon, had been considered as sufficient to cure the want of a declaration, much less to cure a defective one as this is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-12\">Secondly, The judgment does not pursue the award, for the former gives costs, which the latter does not.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-13\"><em>Washington, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-14\">In answer to the first point, relied upon the case of <em>Leftwich </em>v. <em>Stoyal, (ante, </em>vol. I. p. 30,) which seemed to conclude all discussion upon the question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-15\">As to the second point, the judgment is for the very sum awarded by the arbitrators, and the cost are given by the Court, as the necessary consequence of the judgment,</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pAXu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>MarshalL^The </em>costs are not the necessary consev jiience of the judgment\u2019s being forthe appellee^ for suppose the arbitrators had awarded that the appellant should pay the costs : the judgment must in this respect have pursued the award although the judsrment +U_ J if . 1- <em>r </em>\u00b0 J \u00a33 tor the debt was m his favor.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b99-5\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"Aoc\">gave no opinion upon any of the above points, observing, that the award is stated to be made in pursuance of an order of reference, the date of which is misrecited, and that the judgment upon the award is therefore erroneous. Whereupon <em>Washington </em>moved for, and obtained, a certiorari, upon a suggestion of diminution.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The judgment was reversed at the succeeding term for this error,.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">(1) <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Overton, 3 </em>Call. 317.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
