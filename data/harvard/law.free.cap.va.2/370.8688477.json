finding the will, <em>inhere verba; </em>(in which the said land was directed to be sold for the pur-, poses mentioned in the <em>caveat;) </em>that the land in dispute was comprehended in a deed from <em>William Clayton </em>to <em>Branch Tanner </em>the elder, dated <em>Sept. </em>18th, 1773, which deed they found in like manner; that the said land was, among other lands, devised by <em>Branch Tanner </em>the elder, to his said son <em>Branch; </em>(finding also the will of <em>Branch Tanner </em>the elder;) and was part of the land devised by the said <em>Branch Tanner </em>the younger, to his administrator, for the purposes specified in the caveat 5 that <em>John </em>Soanes, about seventy years ago, that is to say, upwards of sixty years previous to the entry made by the defendant, ivas in possession of the land in dispute, claiming and using it as his own; that <em>Soanes </em>sold it for a valuable consideration to one <em>Eppes; </em>that <em>Eppes </em>sold it in like maimer to one <em>Win-free; </em>that <em>Winfree </em>sold it in like manner to one Clayton, who, as aforesaid, conveyed it to <em>Branch Tanner </em>the cider; but that no deed was produced from <em>Soanes </em>to Eppes, or from <em>Eppes </em>to Winfree, or from <em>Winfree </em>to Clayton, and no. evidence appeared that any deed ever was executed, except from <em>Clayton </em>to <em>Tanner </em>as aforesaid, unless the execution of deeds might be inferred from the sales before stated; that the said land had been, from the commencement of the said Soanes\u2019 possession as aforesaid, in the exclusive and successive possession of the said Soanes, Eppes, <em>Win-free., </em>Clayton, <em>Branch Tanner </em>the <em>eldei\\ </em>deceased, and <em>Branch Tanner </em>the younger, deceased, and of the plaintiff as administrator, &amp;c. as aforesaid, and at different periods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>in cultivation; that, at different periods, from 1769 to 1773, ^ie sa^ <em>Winfree, </em>while he held the said land, paid <em>quit-rents </em>thereon; and the said Clayton, while he held the said land, also paid <em>quit-rents </em>thereon; that the said <em>Branch Tanner </em>the elder, in his life-time, and, since his death, the said <em>Branch Tanner </em>the younger, and, since his death, the <em>plaintiff', </em>had regularly paid, ever since the year 1782, the <em>taxes </em>chargeable on the said land; that, during the late war, to wit, in 1781, the Court-house of <em>Chesterfield </em>County was burnt by the <em>British </em>forces, and many papers and deeds destroyed or lost; (but the clerk\u2019s office was kept at a distance from the Court-house;) and that a great number of the papers, deeds, and records of the office of <em>Henrico </em>County, were destroyed by the <em>British </em>troops during the same year, (1781.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASP\">Before the Jury retired from the bar, the plaintiff, by his counsel, contended, that they had a right to presume and find, that a patent had formerly issued for the land in question, if such fact was, in their opinion, a rational inference from the other facts which they should find; but the Court instructed the Jury that they had no such right, as there was no patent, <em>or copy of a </em>patent, produced, nor evidence of the patent\u2019s being lost or destroyed, and that the question, whether a patent was to be presumed or inferred from the facts found, was to be decided by the <em>Court; to </em>which opinion the plaintiff, by his counsel, filed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-4\">The Court pronounced the law, upon the facts found by the Jury, to be in favour of the defendant; from which judgment the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-5\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellant,,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3g\">said, that whether there had been a patent or not, was a question of <em>fact, </em>exclusively (and <em>especially under the caveat law) </em>proper for the consideration of the <em>Jury. </em>To shew that the <em>Court </em>had no jurisdiction as to questions of <em>fact, </em>he cited <em>Co. Litt. </em>155 <em>b. </em>226 <em>a. </em>12 <em>Vin. </em>125. 21 <em>Vin. </em>396. 1 <em>Wils. </em>55. <em>Witham </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>The Earl of </em>Derby, and 5 <em>Com. Dig. </em>158. Under the caveat-law,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the Fury are to find such jfizcto as are material in the cause, and not agreed by the parties. Now, the fact that a patent did issue was the most <em>material </em>of ail, and was <em>not agreed. </em>Yet the Court excluded the Jury from deciding that fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-4\">But, even if the <em>Court </em>ought to have decided this question, the existence of a patent ought to have been presumed from the circumstances.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The opinion of the Legislature upon the subject is clearly shewn by the act \u201c concerning \u201c the title of the Commonwealth to lands which have been \u201c settled more than thirty years.\u201d<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> That act, indeed, cannot govern this case ; hut the principle which gave birth to it is a good one, and oi gift to be followed by the Court. Here, there has been possession in the caveator, and those under whom he claims, for upwards of 60 years, and a regular payment of quit-rents and taxes. From the nature of things, in many cases, it is impossible to know who was the original patentee; and therefore the patent itself, though' it certainly once existed, cannot be produced.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-11\">Randolph, for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKFi\">contended, that the <em>caveat </em>could not be maintained by <em>Archer, </em>because <em>Tanner </em>had no legal estate. A patent could not be presumed without some evidence of its existence. Since patents were always recorded, originally, in the County Court, and, after-wards, in the secretary\u2019s office, there could be no room for <em>presumption; </em>but some memorandum at least, or proof of its having been destroyed, ought to be exhibited, <footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> Presumption must have some ground to stand upon. A copy, a memorandum, or evidence of loss, are each sufficient; but, without, some of these, the existence of a patent or deed, ought not to be presumed.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-12\">Before the revolution, no length of possession would bar the King; and the same doctrine has been recogniz\u00e9d as to the right of the Commonwealth\u2019.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>But, whether <em>Tanner </em>had a right to the land, or not, <em>Archer, </em>as his <em>administrator, </em>could not maintain the <em>caveat. </em>The testator appointed three executors, who refused to qualify. The act, respecting the sale and conveyance of lands devised to be sold,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> does not apply to this case; for the land is devised to nobody. The administrator may sell, but who shall convey ? If he make a conveyance, he must use the name of the heir.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-10\">Hay, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0Rx\">Mr. <em>Archer </em>was authorised by the will to sell the land. The Jury find he was <em>in possession. </em>They find also that he was a devisee, which appears an erroneous deduction by them from the will. I will, therefore, not insist on that. But it is not necessary for the plaintiff in a <em>caveat </em>to have such right as would maintain an <em>ejectment.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-11\"><em>Randolph. </em>Where the <em>c\u00e1ventee </em>has a <em>legal </em>right, no person not having a legal title can maintain a <em>caveat.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-12\"><em>Hay. </em>The case of <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Brown,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>proves the contrary. It was absolutely necessary in this case, that the <em>caveat </em>should have been prosecuted by the <em>administrator. </em>It was not to be expected, that the <em>heirs </em>would have Stepped forward for the sake of the <em>devisees </em>or creditors, in the protection of whose title they were not interested. It was the duty of the <em>administrator </em>with the will annexed, who was trustee of the lands for the payment of debts, and was himself in possession of the land, to defend the title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-13\">But, even if the <em>caveat </em>was instituted incorrectly, it ought to be dismissed without prejudice to the lights of <em>Tanner\u2019s </em>heirs and devisees.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-14\">So much as to the <em>form; </em>now, as to the <em>merits </em>of the present controversy. It is contended, that, in this country, a patent cannot be presumed at all: but is there any reason against applying the <em>English </em>authorities here ? The reason\u00bb assigned by Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in <em>Cowp. </em>106\u2014111. apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>equally <em>to this country. </em>That case confutes the argument,. that a patent, or a copy, or memorandum of it, must be produced. It is said, in <em>Bedle </em>v. <em>Beard,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that, if such a doctrine should prevail, an <em>ancient </em>grant would injure, instead of strengthening a title, because the length of time increases the difficulty of finding the patent, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-4\">According to the case of <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Knott,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an act of Parliament may be presumed, notwithstanding the maxim \u201c <em>nullum tempus occurrit regiB</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">In this state it is impossible for most people to shew a better title to their lands than is here shewn by the <em>caveator. </em>I doubt not but the very grant in question is now under this roof: but, unless we know the name of the patentee, we cannot find it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\"><em>Randolph. </em>2 <em>Wash. 281. Lee </em>v. <em>Tapscott, </em>is a contrary authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-13\"><em>Hay. </em>On what principle is the difference, there mentioned, to be admitted ? In <em>England, </em>the King\u2019s grants are, in themselves, matters of record :<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> they pass through several offices, and are, in each, transcribed and enrolled. The reason is stronger, then, for allowing the presumption in this country, than in <em>England. </em>It is true, there is no adjudication for allowing such presumption here: but not a case to the contrary can be found. In the case of <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Tapscott, </em>Judge Lyons, in his opinion, seems <em>incidentally </em>to admit that a Jury has a right to'presume a patent; and Judge Pendleton also <em>presumes </em>the patent to have been recorded. We do not pretend that possession <em>gives </em>a right; but that its <em>long continuance </em>is evidence to <em>presume a right.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-14\"><em>Randolph. </em>A deed of <em>bargain and sale </em>may be presumed, because it is not necessarily recorded, being good between the parties, though not recorded: but a chant cannot be presumed.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\"><em> Rev.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b392-7\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AO7\">The principal questions in this case are,</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">1. Whether upwards of sixty years peaceable and uninterrupted possession in the caveator, and those under whom he claims, together with payment of quit-rents antecedent to the revolution, and of taxes since that period, afford a, sufficient ground to presume a grant from the crown, for the lands in question ?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">2. Whether it was the province of the <em>Jury, </em>impanelled for the purpose of finding such facts as were material to this cause, \u00e1nd were not agreed by the parties, on the trial of this caveat, to presume such grant, or of the Court, before whom the trial was had ?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">3. Whether an administrator with the will annexed, directing the sale of the lands in question, the possession of which is also found to have been in the said administrator, and that, since the death of his testator, he had regularly paid the taxes thereof can maintain a <em>caveat </em>to prevent the emanation of a patent for the same in favour of a'person entering for, the same, as waste and unappropriated land?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">The first of these points depends upon the principles which were ably discussed and decided, by Lord <em>Mansfield </em>and the rest of the Judges of the Court of K. B. in the case of the <em>Mayor of Hull </em>v. <em>Horner,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>just before the <em>American </em>revolution. In that case it was said by the enlightened Judge, \u201c that if a foundation can be laid that a \u201c record or a deed existed, and was afterwards lost, it may u be supplied by the next best evidence to be had, <em>or, if it cannot be shewn that it ever existed, </em>yet, enjoyment, \u201c under a title <em>zuhich can only </em>be by record, is <em>strong' </em>\u201c <em>evidence to </em>be left to a Jury, that it <em>did once </em>exist.\u201d In Lord <em>PurbecPs </em>case, the letters patent, which were the onlv proper evidence of his title, could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>found ; and there was <em>no proof </em>of the record having been lost 5 but he had sat in Parliament, and done other acts, which were evidence of a title; and the House of Lords presumed <em>that a </em>patent had existed. And, so long ago as the case of <em>Beadle </em>v. <em>Beard, 12 Co. 5. </em>it was observed, with great force, that <em>ancient possession </em>would <em>injure </em>instead of <em>strengthening </em>a title, if after a succession of ages, and the decease of parties, objections should prevail, which might have been answered in the life-time of die parties, and, if well founded, would most probably have been sooner made, In the case of a supposed bye-law, we are told, that <em>usage </em>is allowed to support it, without <em>any proof </em>of the <em>existence </em>of such bye-law,-or of the <em>loss </em>of it; and that the principle upon which this is done is rjght; namely, in <em>favour of rights, </em>which parties have long been-in the peaceable aud quiet possession of. And therefore, \u2022that it may be taken to be established, in point of law, that, although a record be not produced, nor any proof adduced of its being lost, yet, under circumstances, it may be left to the consideration of a Jury, or of a Court of Equity, if the case comes properly before them, whether there be not sufficient ground to presume a grant. There is not one of these principles, which, under the circumstances of this case, does not operate in favour of the <em>caveator. </em>Sixty years quiet and peaceable enjoyment of lands in this country, are ten years over the period which is a perpetual bar, even in a writ of right. Such a period of uninterrupted possession strengthens every presumption in favour of a <em>perfect </em>title antecedent thereto ; for the commencement of this peaceable possession is not shewn. It is carried back \u2022 <em>seventy </em>years, which may be considered as the utmost, stretch of human memory, where a witness s.peaks of his own knowledge and recollection, This is not unlike the case of <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Alexander,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as to this point. The acceptance of <em>quit-rents </em>by the crown, is <em>a-strong presumption </em>of a grant from the crown, because <em>quit-rents </em>were 'reserved in alj grants made by the crown. The not pro-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>during the patent may have been owing to the g'enei-al Pract*ce ^ie couni-jy to take a conveyance oflands, without requiring all the previous title-deeds, and muniments 0f a tjtje not SUpp0scd to be disputable. And where large grants of land have been parcelled out among a number of purchasers, the original patent must have remained in the hands of <em>one </em>only, of those who claimed a title under it, and the omission to recite the seller\u2019s title, which the want of skill among those who prepared deeds has rendered almost universal in <em>Virginia, </em>furnishes a still further argument in favour of presumption founded upon long and <em>peaceable possession. </em>The regular pajmient of <em>taxes </em>since the revolution bars all presumption of a right accruing to the Commonwealth by forfeiture for non-payment of taxes, and leaves the presumption, arising from the long and peaceable possession, unrepelled. The destruction of the records of the Courts in which the conveyances for this land ought to have been recorded, and in which the <em>title </em>might <em>possibly </em>have been deduced from an ancient patent, is also a circumstance favourable to the presumption of a patent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Presumptions, in favor of long and peaceable possession, fhat there has been a grant, must, at no very longperiod hereafter, be absolutely necessary to be made, on almost all occasions, in consequence of the operation of our law of descents. If lands descend in parcenary for the space of sixty years, we may venture to pronounce that in -a country where there is no regular register of marriages, and births, the labour and ingenuity of the profession would in nineteen cases out of twenty be defeated, in the attempt to deduce a regular title, or to shew an original patent. And, if every speculator may enter upon lands which have been in the possession and occupation of any other, for such a period, Unless he, can shew a grant or patent for them, we may venture to pronounce, that not one man in twenty in <em>Virginia </em>will be ^ble to hold his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>In spe\u00e1king to the first point, I have necessarily touched upon the second, viz. that it is the province of the <em>Jury, </em>and not of the Court, to make the presumption. The act which directs a Jury to be impanelled for the purpose of finding such facts, as are material iri the cause, and are hot <em>agreed </em>by the parties, would be decisive in this case, were not the rule of the <em>common </em>laxo, in respect to it, as clear as it certainly is, in favour of the right of the J ury to make such presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The will of the testator being found, and the possession \u00a9f the caveator, under it, being also found, we ar\u00e9 bound to presume he entered with the assent of the heir, for the purpose of fulfilling the will of his testator. I therefore think he had such an interest as to enable him to maintain a <em>caveati \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Upon these grounds I think the judgment Ought to be reversed, and the cause sent back with directions ,to impanel a Jury for the finding of such <em>further </em>facts, material to the cause, and not agreed by the parties', a\u00e9 are not already found by the J ury formerly impanelled for that purpose <em>\u25a0} </em>on which occasion tlie Distri&amp;t Court ought to instruct the Jury that they have a right to presume and find that a patent hath formerly issued for the land in question, if such fact shall} in their opinion, be a rational inference from the evidence which shall then be offered to them.</p>\n<author id=\"b395-9\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AQHO\">I think it cleat that the Jury in this ca\u2018s\u00e9 had a right to presume a patent. In the case of the: <em>Mayor of Kingstonupon Hull </em>v. <em>Horner,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is considered as the established law that although the charter is not produced, nor any proof made of its being lost, yet, under circumstances, it maybe left to the consideration of a <em>Juty, </em>or of a <em>C\u00f3urt of </em>Equity, (in exclusion of a Court of Law,) if the case comes properly before them, to presume a charter. In Lord <em>PurbecPs </em>case, (stated in the opinion of the Court in that case,) it' is said that the letters patent could not be found, and that there was no proof of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>record being lost; but, inasmuch as he had sat in parliament, levied a fine of his honours, &amp;c. and enjoyed them till the time of his death, it was presumed that the letters patent had existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In the case of <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Knott,(a) </em>the Court of King\u2019s Bench adopted the same doctrine, and, referring to the case of the <em>Mayor of Kingston upon Hull </em>v. <em>Horner, </em>adds, \u201c that it is not, in such case, that the Court really thinks \u201c a grant has been made, because it is not probable a \u201c grant should have existed without its being upon record; \u201cbut they presume the fact, <em>for the purpose, and from the </em>\u201c <em>principle, of quieting the possession.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">These cases, (and, especially, this last ground of decision,) seem fully to answer the objection of the appellee\u2019s counsel, that, where the the grant is a matter of record, it ought to be produced, or at least some memorandum shewing that it once had existed. The circumstances, too, stated as the ground of decision in lord <em>PurbecEs case </em>arc s'upposed not to be stronger than those in the present case j I mean the long possession, the receipt of quit-rents and taxes for a great length of time by the Crown and the Commonwealth successively, and the improbability that, at this time of day, lands in that part of the country are vacant\u00bb\u2019 There is very great force too in the remark made on the part of th\u00e9 appellant, that, admitting patents to be in existence, and- of record, it may become difficult, if not impracticable, to <em>tface </em>them, after a great lapse of time, and various divisions and conveyances of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">I therefore concur in the opinion, that the judgment be reversed.-</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> <em>Comp. </em>102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"><em> 1 Wash. </em>34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b395-10\"> <em>Cowp. 111.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A2LG\">\n<em> Cowp.214.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-13\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b396-10\">Judge Fleming</author>\n<p id=\"Arc\">concurred.'</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">The opinion of the Court was' that the judgment was \u201c erroneous, in this, that the District Court refused to \u201c instruct the Jury, impanelled for the finding of such.\u2019 \u201c facts as were material to' the cause', and were not- agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u201c by the parties, that they had a right to <em>presume </em>and <em>find </em>\u201c that a patent had formerly issued for the land in question, \u201c if such fact was, in their opinion, a rational inference <em>xi </em>from the facts proved to them upon the trial, and found\u2019 \u201c in the verdict rendered by the Jury upon that occasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AaJT\">Judgment reversed, and the cause \u201c remanded to the <em>a </em>said District Co.urt, in order that such further facts <em>a </em>material to the cause, and not agreed by the parties, as are not already found by the Jury formerly impanelled, \u201c may be found by a Jury to be impanelled for that pur- \u201c pose; on Which occasion the said District Court ought to \u201c instruct the Jury that they have a right to presume and ic find that a patent hath formerly issued for the land in <em>u </em>question, if such fact shall, in their opinion, be a rational \u201c inference from the evidence which shall then be offered. \u201c to them.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
