The Court was right in directing the interest to be paid in moieties to the <em>feme, </em>and the trustee.

Austin, </em>then residing in <em>North Carolina, </em>having become entitled to a portion of the estate of <em>Mrs. Barry </em>of <em>Philadelphia, </em>executed a deed, conveying his portion thereof to <em>Robert N. Massey </em>and <em>Benjamin R. Morgan, </em>of <em>Philadelphia, </em>in trust, after paying certain specified debts, to pay to himself 1500 dollars, and to hold the residue of the property and effects therein assigned to them, and 'invest the same in productive stocks or securities, at their discretion ; and to pay over the interest or income thereof, from time to time, to his wife <em>Isabella Austin, </em>for her life, so that she might receive and enjoy the same in all respects as if she were a <em>feme sole, </em>free from the debts or control of her husband; and after her death to apply the said interest or income to the maintenance and education of any children she might leave, during their minority; and any surplus of such income, to the support of the said <em>William Austin, </em>during his life j and after the death of the said <em>William </em>and <em>Isabella, </em>to divide the principal sum among the children of the said <em>William Austin, </em>who should survive him. The deed farther provided, that if the trustees, or the survivor of them, should be desirous to relinquish the trust, they might, with the assent of the said <em>William </em>and <em>Isabella, </em>or the survivor of them, nominate two persons as successors, and assign to them the trust and all the rights and incidents thereto belonging <em>; </em>which successors might relieve themselves of the trust in the same way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">The trustees accepted the trust; and after <em>the </em>payment of the debts provided for, and of the 1500 dollars to <em>William Austin, </em>the trust fund consisted of fourteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>shares of the stock of the <em>Union Canal Company; </em>the par value of which was 100 dollars a share, or 1400 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\">In the year 1834, <em>Austin </em>and wife, with their family, removed to the town of Greensville, in <em>Augusta </em>county, <em>Virginia; </em>and being in narrow circumstances, and receiving the dividends upon their trust property in <em>Pennsylvania </em>very irregularly, or not at all, they applied to <em>Robert Steele </em>and <em>Benjamin P. Graham, </em>both of them merchants in <em>Greensville, </em>to undertake the trust, in lieu of <em>Messrs. Massey </em>and <em>Morgan, </em>who were willing to relinquish it. <em>Steele </em>and <em>Graham </em>consented to act as trustees, with the understanding with <em>Austin </em>and wife, that the stock of the <em>Union Canal Company </em>was to be sold, and that each of the trustees were to hold one moiety of the proceeds thereof, until an opportunity offered itself for a profitable investment ,\u2022 and in the mean time they were each to pay to <em>Mrs. Austin </em>interest on the amount in his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">In pursuance of this agreement a deed was executed in 1834, by <em>Massey </em>and <em>Morgan, </em>and <em>Austin </em>and wife, by which the trust fund was assigned to <em>Steele </em>and <em>Graham, </em>on the same trusts as it was held upon by the first trustees; and in September of the same year, <em>Graham </em>went to <em>Philadelphia, </em>and sold the fourteen shares of stock, and the dividends then due thereon, amounting to 105 dollars, for 1354 dollars 50 cents. At the time of the sale the stock was below par, and the sale was made at the full market value, and was recommended as judicious by one of the former trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\">Upon the return of <em>Graham </em>to <em>Greensville, </em>he with the knowledge and approbation of <em>Airs. Austin, </em>paid over to <em>Steele </em>one half of the proceeds of the trust fund ; and from that time they each held their moiety thereof, and settled for the interest thereon with <em>Mrs. Austin </em>separately, until some time in 1837 or \u201938, when <em>Steele </em>became insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuZy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In 1838, <em>Mrs. Austin </em>instituted this suit against <em>Steele </em>and <em>Graham </em>the trustees, <em>William Austin, </em>and her children, in the Superior Court of Law and Chancery for county 0f <em>Augusta; </em>and charged that the trustees imProPerly s\u00b0ld the stock, and held the proceeds in their own hands; and asked that an account of the trust fund might be taken, and the trustees be compelled to pay the amount into Court, that it might be properly and securely invested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-4\"><em>Graham </em>answered the bill, and alleged that the stock was sold by the authority of the plaintiff; and that by an express understanding with her, the trust fund was divided equally between <em>Steele </em>and himself, and a moiety thereof held by each of them. He denied that he was responsible for that portion of the fund held by <em>Steele ; </em>and said he had always been in advance to <em>Mrs. Austin </em>upon the interest of the moiety in his hands. He was willing to settle his accounts, and pay over the balance in his hands as the Court should direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\"><em>Steele </em>had removed from the Commonwealth before the institution of the suit; and the bill was taken for confessed as to him and the <em>cestuis que trust.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">The accounts having been referred to a commissioner, he made a report, presenting various statements, which was excepted to by both the plaintiff, and the defendant <em>Graham.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">In June 1840, a decree was made by consent, directing the defendant <em>Graham </em>to pay to the plaintiff 100 dollars. And in November an interlocutory decree was made settling the principles of the cause, holding <em>Graham </em>liable for the default of <em>Steele, </em>and recommitting the report to be reformed according to the principles of the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">The reformed report charged <em>Steele </em>and <em>Graham </em>jointly, with the amount of the fund received, 1354 dollars 50 cents, and then charged them with interest annually on that sum, and allowed them credit Tor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>sums they had advanced to her; and brought the account down to July 1840, when the trustees were in advanee to <em>Mrs. Austin </em>142 dollars 44 cents. The trustees were then credited on the trust fund by 100 dollars decreed by consent to be paid <em>Mrs. Austin, </em>leaving them debtor on the 1st of July 1840, to the trust fund 1254 dollars 50 cents, and <em>Mrs. Austin </em>debtor to them for advances, 142 dollars 4J cents. But though this was the state of the account when brought down to July 1840, the account properly stopped on the 29th of September 1839, when the amount due to the trustees for advances to <em>Mrs. Austin </em>was 134 dollars 4 cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-4\">The cause coming on to be finally heard, it was decreed that <em>Graham </em>and <em>Steele </em>do pay to the clerk of the Court, who was appointed a receiver for that purpose, 1254 dollars 50 cents, with interest on 1354 dollars 50 cents from the 29th of September 1839, till the 1st of July 1840, and on 1254 dollars 50 cents from the 1st of July 1840, till paid. And that the receiver should loan out the said sum of 1254 dollars 50 cents on the usual terms; and should collect the interest thereon annually, and pay over to the plaintiff one moiety thereof, in support of herself and her family, under the provisions of the deed of trust in the proceedings <em>mentioned; </em>and should pay over the other moiety of the interest, as long as it might be necessary, to the defendant <em>Graham, </em>in payment of the sum of 142 dollars 44 cents, with interest thereon from the 29th of September 1840, till paid. And after <em>Graham\u2019s </em>debt shall have been discharged, to apply the moiety of the interest of the said fund to the restoration of the principal to the original sum of 1400 dollars: provided, the same could be done in the lifetime of <em>Mrs. Austin. </em>And after the fund is raised to the sum of 1400 dollars, then to pay the whole of the interest on that amount annually, to the support of the plaintiff and her family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">From this decree <em>Graham </em>obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Afc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Michie, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aju\"><em>Stuart </em>and Baldwin, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\"> Judge <em>Baldwin </em>had been counsel in the cause in the Court below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b298-8\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_e\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The Court is of opinion, that there was error to the prejudice of the appellant, in decreeing that the appellant should pay interest on the sum of 1354 dollars 50 cents from the 29th September 1839, until the 1st of July 1840. The interest accruing during that period being properly applicable to the reduction of the balance of 134 dollars \u00bf cent, ascertained to be due said appellant on the 29th September 1839, with the interest accruing on said balance of 134 dollars \u00bf cent up to the 1st of July 1840. The residue of said sum of 134 dollars j} cent and interest, after deducting therefrom the interest accruing on 1354 dollars 50 cents from the 29th September 1839, until the 1st of July 1840, constituting the true balance due the appellant on the 1st of July 1840; .to be extinguished in the mode designated in the decree; and the decree should have been for the sum of 1254 dollars 50 cents, with interest thereon from the 1st of July 1840, till paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">The Court is further of opinion, that there was error to the prejudice of the appellee <em>Isabella Austin, </em>in requiring the interest of a moiety of the fund to be applied to the restoration of the principal to the original sum of 1400 dollars. The Court being of opinion, that there is nothing in the evidence to prove that the sale of the stocks was made at a sacrifice ; and a change in the investment being expedient to enable the said <em>Isabella </em>to'receive the provision for her support, intended by the deed of settlement. Under the circumstances, no person interested in the fund has a right to insist that the principal shall be increased beyond the sum of 1354 dollars 50 cents, the amount received by the trustee, and a moiety of the interest of the fund, after discharging the amount due the appellant for his advances, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>be applied to the restoration of the fund to the said sum of 1354 dollars 50 cents: provided the same can be done in the lifetime of said <em>Isabella Austin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ArQ\">The Court is further of opinion, that it was erroneous to direct the payment of interest to said <em>Isabella Austin </em>in support of herself and family, instead of directing the same to be paid to her for her separate use, in the terms of the deed of trust, to be applied by her either to the support of her family, or to any other purpose, at her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that so much of said decree as conflicts with the principles of this opinion is erroneous, and that there is no error in the residue thereof. Therefore, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed that the same, so far as it is herein decided to be erroneous, be reversed, with costs to the appellant; and that the residue thereof be affirmed; and the cause is remanded, to be further proceeded in according to the principles aforesaid.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b299-6\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AL4\">dissented from so much of the opinion of the Court as allowed interest on the moiety of the trust fund in the hands of Steele, during the life of <em>Mrs. Austin. </em>He concurred in all other respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
