Such titles were confirmed by the Act of 1786, c. 8. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tliis law does not authorise the Register to make grants iu cases where warrants had been previously issued by lord <em>Fairfax </em>to other persons.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Akx\">This was an appeal from the High Court of Chancery, affirming a decree of the County Court of <em>Hampshire, </em>wherein the appellee was plaintiff. The case was as follows : <em>Peter Peters,-m </em>the year 1753, obtained from the <em>Lord Proprietor </em>of the <em>Northern Neck, </em>a warrant to survey a tract of land within that District, which by his direction was surveyed for a certain <em>Frederick Unrod, </em>an indented servant of the said <em>Peter </em>s; but by the mistake of the said surveyor, (as the bill charges;) he was called <em>Vinegard </em>instead of <em>Unrod. </em>No patent was obtained from the <em>Proprietor </em>in the life-time of <em>Unrod, </em>who died many years ago, leaving a son Jacob, then an infant, who was by his mother sent into <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and there bound out an apprentice ; he resided in that State always after wards, and sold his right to <em>Buffington </em>in 1770.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\"><em>Johnson </em>made an entry with the surveyor, for 219 acres, part of this land, under the Act of 1783, and having obtained a patent from the Register\u2019s office in 1789, brought an ejectment against <em>Buffington, </em>and recovered a judgment. The prayer of the bill was for an injunction, and for a conveyance, both of which were decreed by the County Court, from which ao appeal was granted to the High Court of Chancery. That Court being of opinion, that the equitable right of the appellee to the land in controversy, derived to him from the heir at law of the person for whom the land had been surveyed, was preserved by the Acts of 1.786, 1788, and \u00bf790, and consequently was not subject to the entry and location of the appellant, which was posterior to the survey, affirmed the decree of the County Court from which an appeal was prayed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-7\"><em>Lee, for </em>the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-8\">Whether, in a case like the present, a Court of Equity will interfere, and take from <em>Johnson </em>his legal title is an important question. The decree seems bot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>tornee! upon an' opinion, that the equitable right of <em>Buffington </em>was revived and preserved by the Act of Assembly passed in 1786, Cfa. 3, and the subsequent Act continuing the operation of that law. Bui before I consider the operation of those laws, I will premise some objections against the interference of the Court of Chancery. In the first place, the warrant has not been so complied with as to entitle the party to claim a grant. The warrant was to survey 300 acres of land, instead of which, a plat for 450 acres was returned. Though this objection would have been done away, had lord <em>Fairfax made a </em>grant, it is now in full force where an application is made to this Court to compel a conveyance. The warrant was not pursued in another instance | the length and breadth of the tract as delineated in the plat, do not bear that proportion to each other, which the warrant required. Neither are the names of the chain carriers inserted in the survey. These objections, when considered together with the neglect of <em>Unrod </em>and <em>Buffington, </em>in not perfecting this dormant title, are sufficient to deprive the appellee of the aid of a Court of Equity. It may also be seriously questioned, whether Vinegard., in whose name the survey was made, is the same person as Unrod, and if so, there is an outstanding title in <em>Unrod, </em>which <em>Vinegard </em>could not transfer to Buffington.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">I come now to consider the Acts of Assembly. The first which passed upon this subject was in 1785, Ch. 47. The <em>fourth </em>section, after reciting, that since the death of the Proprietor of the <em>Northern </em>Neck, no mode had been adopted to enable persons, having made entries before or since his death, to obtain titles for the same, declares, \u201c that where any surveys have been heretofore made, or hereafter shall be made under entries made in the life of the said <em>Proprie</em>tor, or under entries made with the sun eyor of any county, under the Act of Assembly aforesaid,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and which have been returned to the said Proprietary office. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>or shall hereafter be returned to the Register\u2019s office, the Register shall make out giants therefor, to bear teste under the hand of the Governor, and the seal of Commonwealth, in the same manner as is by law directed in cases of other unappropriated lands ; and the surveyors with whom such entries have been made, are hereby directed and empowered, to proceed to survey and record the same, and to make return of such surveys to the Register\u2019s office, in the same manner, and within the same time as is, or shall be, directed in cases of warrants issued for other unappropriated lands within this Commonwealth, and thereupon grants shall issue in the manner herein before directed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjJ\">This law is to be construed either in a general or in a restrained sense. I contend for the latter, because of the inconvenience which would arise, if it were considered as intended to set up obsolete claims not carried into grant, and which were fortified by the rules of the <em>Proprietor*s </em>office ; but more especially, in cases, where such claims would by relation destroy posterior grants. The inconvenience which the preamble of that law states, is, that by the death of lord Fairfax, many persons who had made surveys upon warrants issued from the <em>Proprietor*s </em>office, could not obtain grants. The intention of the Legislature was to provide a remedy, not for those who had for-forfeited their titles by a non-compliance with the rules of the office, but for those who, by the death of lord Fairfax, had been prevented from obtaining grants upon entries made with the surveyors, under the Act of 1782, Ch. 33, \u00a7 3 , which enacts, \u201c that all entries made with the surveyors of the counties within the <em>Northern </em>Neck, and returned to the office, formerly kept by the said <em>Thomas Lord </em>Fairfax, shall be held, deemed and taken as good and valid in law, as those heretofore made under the direction of the said <em>Thomas Lord </em>Fairfax, until some mode shall be taken up and adopted by the General Assembly concerning the territory of the <em>Northern NeckP </em>The Act of 1786, Ch. 3, relates entirely to surveys thereafter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>be returned. The words of the law are, <em>a </em>that the owners of entries for lands within the District of the <em>Northern </em>Neck, regularly made before the 17th day of October, in the year of our Lord 1785, shall proceed to survey the same, which surveys, together with those already made upon like entries, shall be returned into the Registers office, on or before the 1st day of October, 178F, and on failure, such entries are hereby declared void, and the lands liable to be located in the same manner, as other unappropriated lands within the said District.^</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-3\">If the Legislature intended to give validity to claims which had been forfeited and entirely gone, so as to do away posterior rights fairly and legally acquired, I should question very much the validity of such a law. But the Legislature is not to be presumed to have intended an act so fraught with Iniquity, and therefore, to avoid such a conclusion, the Court will give to the law the limited0construction for which I contend.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-4\">Williams, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">Whatever exposition the Court may incline to give to the different Acts of Assembly, yet I contend that <em>Johnson </em>can derive no right under them. The question is between Johnson, whose title is acquired under the Legislature of Virginia, and <em>Buffington </em>claiming under the Proprietor. Though lord <em>Fairfax </em>should be admitted to have possessed a right of availing himself of the supposed forfeiture occasioned by <em>Buffing-ion\u2019s </em>not complying with the rales of the office^ yet as lie never did any act evincing such an intention, (as by making a grant to some other person,) the argument respecting the forfeiture cannot avail the appellant. The Legislature could not by any law dispose of the rights of lord Fairfax, any more than they could dispose of the rights of other individuals, and consequently, Johnson, not claiming under lord 'Fairfax, cannot set up a title to destroy one derived under him, and still subsisting. Again, admitting a right In the Legislature to dispose of the property of lord <em>Fairfax % </em>the Act of 1782, which is the\u2019source, from which the inceptive right 7&gt;f <em>Johnson </em>flows, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>warrant the title which he now sets up. The Ac\u00bb: provides a mode by which a right, to the <em>unappropri - ated </em>lands in the <em>Northern Neel </em>might be acquired. But the land in question had been previously appro - priated by lord <em>Fairfax, </em>who, had a right to wave the forfeiture if he pleased. Indeed I do not think he could have availed himself of it, since <em>Unrod </em>was an infant at the death of his father, and always afterwards resided out of this State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">I admit that where the equity is equal, and one of the parties has also the law in his favour, he shall prevail. But if the legal title has been obtained by fraud, or, as in this case, by taking an advantage of one labouring under a legal disability, he will not have the benefit of this advantage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\">As to the identity of <em>Unrod, </em>I consider it to be fully established by the evidence. The objection to the variance between the warrant and the survey could only be a question between lord <em>Fairfax </em>and Unrod\u00bb not between the appellant, who claims under the Commonwealth, and the appellee claiming under lord Fairfax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-10\">The construction given to the Act of <em>1785, by </em>Mr. <em>Lee, </em>seems to me to be a very unreasonable one. For if the Legislature considered <em>entries not surveyed </em>as worthy of being saved from forfeiture, <em>a fortiori, </em>they would save titles still nearer a state of perfection^ namely, entries <em>then actually surveyed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-11\"><em>Fee, </em>in reply. \u2014 If it be true, that the appellant could derive no title under the Legislature of <em>Firgi - via, </em>the application to a Court of F.quity was unnecessary, since he might have effectually defended himself at Law; and therefore the Court should have dismissed the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-12\">The possession of <em>Buffington </em>is by no means a continuation of <em>Unrod\u2019s </em>possession, fie was an unauthorised occupant of the land, and being there, he purchased up this obsolete claim of Unrod\u2019s, in order to bolster up a right founded merely in possession.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\"> October 1782.

But as lord <em>Fairfax </em>did no act manifesting an intention to avail himself of the forfeiture, the title of <em>Unrod </em>rested upon his survey until 1786, and was confirmed by that act, which limited no time for the payment of the composition and fees\u00bb The Act of 1786, relates, 1st, to entries, 2dly, to surveys not returned | and SdJy, to surveys returned, and eograntecl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The Act of 1783, Ch. \u00a30, continues that of 1786, aa to entries and surveys, and comprehends the three branches of the latter law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Mr. <em>Lee </em>contended that the construction of the Act, of 1786 might be either extended or narrowed, and supposed that the latter was most consistent with the justice of the case, and the intention of the Legislature. My opinion is directly otherwise; and in this particular case I should feel very little disposed to narrow the construction, when I consider that <em>Unrod </em>was an infant for many years after the death of his ancestor, and that he resided during that time and after wards out of this State. It is immaterial to decide whether the Commonwealth did, or did not, succeed to the rights of the proprietor, in cases of ungranted lands. If she did, yet no advantage has been taken of the forfeiture by her. If she did not succeed to them, then the land was legally appropriated by lord <em>Fair-fax, </em>and consequently could not under the Act of 1785 be granted to any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">Decree affirmed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-13\"> <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Greenup, </em>1 Munf. 134.142. <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>4 Munf <em>255. 172.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
