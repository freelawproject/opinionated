The Court, being of opinion that the negroes present were some of those included in <em>Carter's </em>deed of trust, and that <em>Daxvson </em>ought to be restrained from the exercise of any further power under the said deed, awarded the injunction. <em>Dawson </em>again renewed his motion, as before, which was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-10\"><em>Ir April, </em>1805, <em>Daxvson </em>applied to the District Court for a <em>mandamus </em>to be directed to the Justices of <em>Frederick </em>County to compel them to admit to record the said deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of emancipation, and to certify as to the health and ages of the negroes in the form prescribed by law. The District Court awarded a <em>conditional mandamus ; </em>upon the return of which, the Justices set forth at large the proceedings in the Court of <em>Frederick </em>County, in the year 1805, to the effect above stated. The return recites the deed of trust from <em>Carter </em>to <em>Dawson ; </em>which bears date the 8th of <em>November, 1797, </em>and is intended to provide for the gradual emancipation of the slaves therein conveyed. It vests in <em>Dawson </em>the right to sell a larger number of negroes for' a term of years to raise a sum of money for the benefit of <em>Carter, </em>part of which was to be retained' by <em>Dawson </em>for the use of the infirm negroes among those intended to be emancipated. The Justices made their return to the District Court in <em>October, 1805 </em>: whereupon <em>Dawson </em>moved for a <em>peremptory </em>mandamus, which motion being overruled, he appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-8\"><em>The.

That the deeds from <em>Carter </em>to <em>Dawson </em>authorised the latter to give deeds of emancipation to the negroes in the proceedings mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-10\">2. That the County Court erred in granting the injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-11\">3. That the County Court should have suffered the deed from <em>Dawson </em>to have been recorded ; and should have granted the certificate he asked for, it being a mere <em>ministerial </em>act, and not, conclusive as to the right of property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b149-12\">4. That the District Court ought to have awarded a <em>peremptory mandamus </em>to enforce a compliance with the motion of <em>Dawson.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-13\"><em>Page, </em>for the appellees. By the act of 1748,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> all persons were prohibited from emancipating their slaves, except for meritorious services to be adjudged and allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>by the Governor and Council. And by the act of 1782,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> slaves could only be emancipated in a particular manner. 1. It could only be done by deed or will proved and recorded. 2. Emancipation must be <em>immediate </em>and not <em>in futuro. </em>3. It must be by the master himself, and not through the intervention of another. 4. The instrument must be recorded in .the Court of the County where the master resides ; but this deed was recorded <em>in Northumberland District Court. </em>Again : The deeds from <em>Carter </em>to <em>Dawson </em>ought not to be considered as instruments of emancipation, but merely as <em>letters of attorney, authorising Dawson </em>to emancipate the slaves. If so, <em>Carter </em>having died before <em>Dawson </em>made his deed of emancipation, the letters of attorney were revoked; and <em>Dawson's </em>power to act under them ceased.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-10\">If <em>Dawson </em>is to be considered as a <em>trustee, </em>the County Court in Chancery had power to award the injunction; and this Court will not presume that they acted improperly. When a Court of Chancery has jurisdiction of a case, it cannot be transferred to a Court of common law, even though the case had originated in a Court of law.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> If the County Court had cognisance of the cause, before the application of <em>Dawson </em>for a mandamus, he ought not to be encouraged in a contempt of that Court where the question was properly depending: nor will this Court revise the case as it stood before the County Court in Chancery, without having it brought. before them through the Superior Court of Chancery. But, if this Court should reverse the judgment of the District Court, will not the County Court still have power to enjoin <em>Dawson </em>from proceeding <em>?</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-11\">The case will be revised <em>here, </em>as it should have been before the District Court. <em>That Court </em>had no power to dissolve the injunction of the County Cour<em>t; </em>nor will this Court do it. Such a proceeding would produce a clashing of jurisdictions, which would be productive of great mischief.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b149-14\"><em> Ed. </em>1769, ch. 32. sect. 26. p. 262.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\"><em> </em>1 <em>Bac.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b151-5\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"A-5\">Dawson, the appellant, as trustee of <em>Robert Carter </em>of Westmoreland, produced to the Court <em>Frederick </em>County, a deed of emancipation executed by him to certain negroes therein named, and prayed the Court <em>to admit the same to record, </em>and to certify on their record, that as many of the negroes (all of whom were then in presence of the Court) as appeared to their judgment to be so, were of sound mind and body ; the males above the age of 21, and the females above the age of 18, and all under <em>45 </em>years. This motion was objected to on the part of Mr. <em>Carter\u2019s </em>executor ; and his counsel <em>then and there </em>read to the Court a bill previously filed, and in which a subpesna had been executed on <em>Dawson, </em>and returned, and moved the Court, as a <em>Court of Chancery, </em>that it would, by an injunction, restrain <em>Dawson </em>from disposing of, or in any manner interfering with, the slaves referred to in <em>Robert Carter\u2019s </em>deed of trust to him, that were undisposed of at that time. The Court being satisfied that the negroes present were some of them included in <em>Carter\u2019s </em>deed, \u00e1nd that <em>Dawson </em>ought to be restrained, awarded the injunction, and after that <em>Dawson </em>again renewed his motion, as before, which the Court refused. <em>Dawson </em>then applied for and obtained a conditional <em>mandamus </em>from the District Court, upon the return of which the Justices made a return at large to the preceding effect: upon which <em>Dawson </em>moved for a peremptory <em>man~ </em>damns, which motion being overruled, he has appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The County Courts in <em>Virginia </em>act in a variety of capacities and characters. They are Judges of all suits and controversies arising within their Counties, either in actions at common law, or in suits in Chancery ; or in controversies concerning wills, letters of administrai ion, mills, roads, &amp;c. In causes at common law and in Chancery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>there must be both a complainant and a defendant before ^le Court can have jurisdiction, or do any act. <em>In </em>the cases of wills, letters of administration, mills, &amp;c. their ..... ... jurisdiction commences upon an <em>ex parte </em>motion, and the perSon meaning to controvert it makes himself a <em>voluntary </em>defendant; whereas, in suits at common law, and in Chancery, the defendant is in general an <em>involuntary </em>one. In all these cases, however, they act as a forensic Court, if there be a controversy instituted in either of the above modes. They act moreover as a board of police for the country; and, in this character, have not forensic jurisdiction ; as in laying the County levy, recommending sheriffs, coroners, militia officers, and justices of the peace ; in all which they act merely as ministerial persons : and though they act in all these several characters and capacities in the same day, the character in which they act is determined by the nature of the case. When a cause is begun as a suit at common law, they cannot make any order in it as a Court of Chancery, but must proceed according to the course of the common law until there is a final judgment therein. Nor can they when proceeding as a Court of Chancery take any step not warranted by the usual course df proceeding in Courts of Equity. If, for example, a suit be instituted at common law for the recovery of slaves by an action of detinue, and the defendant being unable, or unwilling to give special bail, should fail to enter his appearance, and suffer an office judgment to be confirmed against him, it wouldnotbe competent to him,atthe momentthat a jury was about to be sworn to execute awrit of inquiry, to produce to the Court a bill in equity against the plaintiff, and move the Court for an injunction to prevent the plaintiff from proceeding to execute his writ of inquiry, whatever equity his case might present. The plaintiff must be permitted to proceed according to the regular course of the common law; but, when he has obtained his judgment, he may be inhibited from issuing his execution until the matter shall be heard in equity ; as is every day\u2019s practice. So when a deed is offered to be proved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the Court <em>quoad hoc </em>sits as a Court of Registry, only. It is to examine the witnesses as to the <em>execution </em>of the deed, or to receive the acknowledgment, if presented and offered to be acknowledged by the maker of it, <em>as a matter of right and duty. </em>The contents of the deed, further than to know whether it ought to be proved by one, two, or three, or more witnesses, in order to be admitted to record, are not a subject for their inquiry ; much less the operation or effect of it. Nor can they when a deed is thus brought before them for <em>probate </em>and <em>recording </em>only, avail themselves of their character as a judicial Court, and refuse to admit the proof, because, by possibility, the maker of the deed may have no right as against other persons to make such a deed. This case is so nearly like that of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Justices of Derbyshire,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that it seems to me to determine the question. A motion was made for a <em>mandamus </em>to <em>register </em>a certain tenement, which was certified to the Quarter Sessions as a place set apart for the meeting of protestant dissenters : the justices shewed cause against the motion ; <em>\u201c </em>but the Court was of opinion that in <em>registering </em>and <em>re- </em>\u201c <em>cording </em>the certificate, the Justices were merely <em>minis te- </em>\u201c <em>rial, </em>and that, after a meeting-house had been duly <em>regisiered; </em>still, if the persons resorting to it did not bring \u201c themselves within the act of toleration, such <em>registry </em>\u201c <em>will not protect them </em>from the penalties of the law.\u201d So in the case before us, I consider the Justices as merely <em>ministerial </em>to the <em>proof </em>and <em>recording </em>the deed : still, if any of the persons therein named are not entitled to their emancipation under the deed from <em>Robert Carter </em>to the appellant <em>Dawson, </em>the acknowledgment and recording of <em>Dawson\u2019s </em>deed will not release them from slavery. I am, for these reasons, of opinion, that the District Court ought to have awarded a <em>peremptory mandamus, </em>and that the judgment be reversed, with directions accordingly.</p>\n<author id=\"b153-5\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"A3E\">Not knowing that the deed in question, hi this case, is not justified by the act of 1/82, respecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>.emancipation ; and if not, believing that the recording of it will give it no additional validity, I am of opinion that it ought to have been recorded <em>; </em>to avail <em>quantum valere potest. </em>I therefore think that the County Court erred in not permitting it to be proved and recorded, and that a <em>peremptory mandamus </em>ought to issue.</p>\n<author id=\"b154-9\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar9\">It appears to me both from the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>The Justices of Derbyshire,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and from the nature and reason of the case, that the Justices of <em>Frederick </em>County, when they refused to admit to record the deed presented by Dawson, were acting in their <em>ministerial </em>character, merely : and, as such, were bound to receive the deed, and to order it to be recorded ; without considering what was to be its effect or operation at a future day, I am, therefore, of opinion, that a <em>peremptory mandamus </em>ought to be awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-10\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons.)</judges>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">\u201c The judgment of the District Court reversed, and <em>\u00edl </em>a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>awarded, to be directed <em>c\u2018 to </em>the Justices of the County Court, of Frederick, com-. \u201c manding them to receive proof or acknowledgment of \u201c the deed of emancipation in the proceedings mentioned, \u201c and admit the same to record, and to certify on their \u201c record that as many of the persons named in the said \u201c deed as then appeared to their judgments to be so, were \u201c of sound mind and body on the 3d day of April, 1805, \u201c (when they were before the Court of the said Count)', \u201c and the appellant offered to acknowledge the said deed,) \u201c thr males then above the age of twenty-one years and \u201c under forty-five, and the females then above the age of eighteen years and under forty-five.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b153-11\"><em> </em>1 <em>W.
