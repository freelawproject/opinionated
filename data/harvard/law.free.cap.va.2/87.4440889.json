D. Carey, </em>at that time residing in the State of <em>Maryland, </em>a certain tract of land in <em>Frederick </em>county, <em>Virginia, </em>granted to the said <em>J. D. Carey, </em>by a patent from Lord <em>Fairfax, </em>dated February, 1762, according to the metes and bounds therein particularized, supposed to contain 406 acres, for which he contracted to pay 517h for the entire tract, whatever actual quantity there might be upon survey; as appears by an agreement in writing, annexed to the bill; that the same writing will shew, that the complainant has paid the purchase money: that the parties afterwards procured a survey to be made of the same land, to ascertain the actual quantity in the tract; upon which survey, by the mistake of the surveyor in running the lines, a considerable quantity of the land purchased as aforesaid, and embraced in the original grant, was not included in the said survey; and a deed executed to the complainant by the said <em>Carey, </em>according to the survey, omitted a part of the land included in the grant to <em>Carey, </em>and by him sold to the complainant: that this mistake was not discovered before the death of the said <em>Carey; </em>otherwise, the complainant has no doubt, that the said <em>Carey </em>would have corrected it, and conveyed to the complainant, all the lands according to the calls of the original grant: that a certain <em>Henry W. Baker, </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>his own right, and the same <em>Henry </em>and <em>John Baker, </em>executors 0f <em>Henry Baker </em>deceased, are in possession of the land in question, under a grant from the Commonwealth, subsequent to the grant to <em>Carey </em>before-mentioned, the said <em>Baker </em>having procured the said grant, by fraudulently setting forth that the said land was vacant and unappropriated, well knowing that the same was embraced by the grant to <em>Carey. </em>He therefore prays that <em>James </em>and <em>George Carey, </em>heirs and legatees of <em>R. I). Carey </em>deceased, <em>Henry Baker </em>in his own right, and the said <em>Henry </em>and <em>John Baker, </em>executors of <em>Henry Baker </em>deceased, may be made defendants in this suit: that they may be compelled to convey to the complainant, the tract of land according to the calls of the patent to the said <em>Carey; </em>and that the defendant <em>Baker, </em>may deliver up possession in the said land, and account for the rents and profits of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-4\">Annexed to the bill, is the receipt of <em>J. D. Carey </em>mentioned in the bill, dated <em>August </em>14, 1788, for <em>5171., </em>it being in full for a tract of land which he sold to the said <em>Richardson, </em>lying on the head of <em>Opecken </em>Creek, &amp;c. granted by Lord <em>Fairfax </em>to the said <em>J. I). Carey, for </em>406 acres, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">An order of survey was made,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\"><em>Henry W. Baker </em>states, in his answer, that he does not admit the terms of the alledged contract between <em>John D. Carey </em>and the complainant; and therefore, he requires strict proof, not only of the receipt aforesaid, but of his title in every other respect: that he is informed 'that the said receipt and deed bear date on the same day; and if so, it seems very singular that the description of the land should be so variant; and indeed it creates some doubt of, the correctness of the transaction. He contends that he is the owner of the land in dispute, and trusts that he shall be able to establish his right when the survey shall have been made in this cause, without which it would be very difficult, if not impossible, <em>to </em>explain his pretensions. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>further states, that he and those under whom he claims, have been in possession of the lands now claimed, at least 48 years; and he relies upon being able to prove a possession in those from whom his father claims, for moro than <em>SO </em>years before the issuing of the <em>subpoena </em>in this case, He, therefore, relies upon the act of limitations. He also submits the question, whether the Court has jurisdiction in this ease, which he contends is nothing more than a <em>writ of right </em>brought in a Court of Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\"><em>John Baker, </em>one of the executors of <em>Henry Baker </em>deceased, filed his answer, stating, that he does not, in his character of <em>executor, </em>hold or claim title to any part of the land claimed by the plaintiff; and as he is not charged in the bill, as claiming any part of the said land, in any other character, he is advised that he need not answer further to the allegations of the said bill, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\"><em>Henry W. Baker, </em>by an amended answer, denies the legality of the complainants\u2019 attempting to prove that the deed from <em>Carey </em>to him comprehends more land than it actually does convey; that in addition to the patent and deeds already produced, he relies upon a patent from Lord <em>Fairfax, </em>for 976 acres, and another from Lord <em>Fairfax\u2019s </em>office; the former having issued to <em>Isaac Perkins, </em>and the latter to <em>Charles Perkins-, </em>that since he filed his former answer, he has discovered the field-notes of <em>Thomas Rutherford, </em>formerly Lord <em>Fairfax\u2019s </em>surveyor, by whom <em>John D. Carey\u2019s </em>survey, under which tlie complainant claims, as also, the survey of <em>the 67 acre tract, </em>under which the respondent claims, and <em>Moorfield\u2019s </em>survey, adjoining <em>Carey, </em>were all made; that <em>Carey\u2019s </em>survey appears to have been made April 3rd, 1761, and the two others, the next day; that <em>Samuel MerifieM </em>and <em>John Lupton, </em>who owned an adjoining survey, were chain-men; and that the Rev. <em>John Hogg </em>and <em>Charles Perkins </em>were pilots on both days. These <em>field-notes </em>the respondent offered as evidence on his behalf, and prayed that copies of them might be received as evidence, when duly proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Acu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The deposition of Col. <em>Van Rutherford </em>states, that the <em>field-notes </em>were contained in a memorandum-book of his deceased father, <em>Thomas Rutherford; </em>and, he believes, were entirely in the hand-writing of the said <em>Thomas Rutherford, </em>(except some names written in and near the hack of the said book;) that he found the note-book in question, among his father\u2019s papers after his death, and it was among his other field-notes for many years before his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-4\">The depositions of <em>Hamilton, Lupton, Perkins, </em>and <em>Baker, </em>were taken to prove, that the lines and corners, by which the defendant claimed, were the true ones. The complainant objected to these depositions as incompetent; the two first, because they claim land by the same lines; the two last, because they were vendors, under whom the defendant claims. The defendant had released the witness <em>Baker.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\"><em>James Beatty </em>proves, that the boundaries, as asserted by the defendant, were those by which Richardson bought of <em>Carey; </em>and, that <em>Richardson </em>told him <em>he </em>bought of <em>Carey by </em>the acre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\"><em>Hodgson </em>and <em>Haymaker </em>prove the boundaries; and, that a line-fence was standing on the line claimed by <em>Baker, </em>before <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>purchase of <em>Carey, </em>viz: as early as 1786.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">The <em>field-notes, </em>authenticated by <em>Van Rutherford, </em>are in exact coincidence with the courses and distances of the patents, except in a single instance, where there is a small difference, evidently the effect of mistake in copying.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\"><em>John McPherson </em>proves, that he was present at the contract between <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Carey, </em>and he understood that <em>Richardson </em>was to have all the land' the said <em>Carey </em>held under a patent, which was then produced; but, he has no recollection of the contents of the patent, except, that it was said to contain that tract of land, in quantity about 400 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">The Chancellor dismissed the bill of the plaintiff, <em>from </em>which decree he appealed to this Court,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Au-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>for the, appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-4\"><em>Tucker </em>and <em>Leigh, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-7\">For the appellant, it was contended:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-9\">1. That <em>the field-notes </em>could not be received to contradict a survey. They are not, in fact, field-notes, but mere copies of the <em>surveys </em>made out by <em>Rutherford. Richardson bought </em>of <em>Carey </em>the whole tract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-10\"><em>2. .Perkins </em>and <em>Baker </em>wore incompetent witnesses, because they were vendors, under whom the defendant claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-11\">Por the appellees. The objections to Hamilton, <em>Lupton </em>and Perkins, as witnesses in this cause, are all answered by the case of <em>Baring </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 154, in which it is finally settled, that a witness is competent, unless <em>he is </em>interested in the event of the cause in which he is called <em>to </em>testify. As to the objection to <em>Baker, </em>his competency is restored by the release of all demand, by the vendee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-12\">As to <em>the field-notes, </em>they were admissible evidence, as will appear from <em>.Phillips\u2019s </em>E vidence, c. 7, \u00a77, p. 183\u20141,98, and the cases there cited. It is said, however, that they are not <em>field-notes, </em>but <em>copies of surveys. </em>But, a survey is always accompanied by a <em>plat, </em>which is not the case here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-13\">The evidence of <em>Barlges </em>ought not to have been, received, to prove <em>Carey\u2019s </em>signature to the receipt to <em>Richardson, </em>without proof of the hand-writing of the subscribing witness. <em>Peake\u2019s </em>Evidence, p. 97-100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-14\">Again. <em>Perkins, </em>and those under whom he claimed, were in possession; and, therefore, the act against buying pretensed titles, applies to the purchase by <em>Richardson </em>of <em>Carey.,</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-15\">There can be no doubt, upon all the evidence taken together, that the patent to <em>Carey </em>did not embrace the land in question, and that, therefore, it was open to location by Baker.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A8ul\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>December </em>8.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AYo\">Judge Brooke,</author>\n<p id=\"A32\">delivered the opinion of the Court:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ArB\">The Court is of opinion, that the field-notes objected to jn the argument, were proper evidence, under the circumstances of this case; and, that the evidence on the part of the appellees, excepted to by the appellant\u2019s ancestor, was competent evidence, under the authority of <em>Baring </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>1 Hen. &amp;Munf. 154, and other cases in this Court. On the merits, the Court is of opinion, that the land <em>in </em>controversy was not included in the patent to <em>Carey, </em>under whom the appellant\u2019s ancestor claimed; and, that as to the boundary, the decree of the Chancellor is correct. For these reasons, without deciding any other question in the cause, the Court is of opinion, that there is no error in the said decree; therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that the same be affirmed, and that the appellants do pay unto the appellees their costs, &amp;c.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\"> Judge Cabbed absent from indisposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
