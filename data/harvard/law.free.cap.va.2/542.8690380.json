An appeal can only be taken from the <em>judgment </em>or <em>decree </em>of a County Court. The District Courts can take no jurisdiction of causes decided in the County Courts, unless it be by appeals allowed by such County Courts from their own judgments, or by writs of error or <em>supersedeas </em>awarded by the District Courts. There having been no <em>judgment </em>entered in this case, till long after the appeal was allowed, the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>trict Court ought to have dismissed the appeal as improperly granted, and waited till a judgment had been entered in the County Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-4\">No argument can be drawn from the supposed consent of the parties, that this judgment should be made a part of the record, and that the cause should stand as if the appeal had been taken from that judgment; because an appellate Court can never take jurisdiction of an appeal unless it be regularly brought before them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-5\">This objection is not a mere matter of <em>form: </em>it goes to affect the <em>rights </em>of the appellee; because, by allowing an appeal before any judgment is entered, he is deprived of his security on the appeal bond. It is impossible to suppose, that a bond given to prosecute an appeal from the judgment of a Court can be binding, when no judgment was entered till years afterwards. There was no appeal from the judgment last entered, which was the only judgment rendered by the County Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-6\">Call, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM8\">The objection that there was no appeal from the judgment last entered by the County Court, furnishes a plausible argument, which at first sight may receive some sanction from the decision of the Court in <em>Freeland </em>and <em>Vaughan.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case the clerk had misstated the verdict in the minutes, and the Court, at a subsequent term, permitted him to enter it correctly in the order-book. The ground of the Court\u2019s decision was, that a <em>District Court </em>could not amend its judgments entered in the order-book, because in that the judgments were drawn up in full, and being signed by the presiding judge, became a record. But the same rule does not apply to a <em>County </em>Court, where nothing is entered during the sitting of the Court but <em>minutes of </em>their proceedings, which are not considered as records till they are drawn up afterwards by the clerk. In this case the clerk was guilty of an omission in not recording the judgment. The Court could not be mistaken as to the entry o\u00ed a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>meat, because the appeal bond, which is part of th\u00e9 record, recites a judgment. After the amendment in the County-Court, the District Court had a right to take up the record, and enter such judgment as the County Court ought to have rendered.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\"> <em>May, </em>1806, MS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\"><em>Friday, May 27. </em>The President jiro <em>tern, </em>delivered the opinion of the Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) that the District Court ought to have dismissed the appeal, on the ground that it had been allowed by the County Court of <em>Montgomery </em>before any judgment had been rendered in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Judgment of the District Court reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
