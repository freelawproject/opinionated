A deposition cannot be read to affect the interests of any party to whom no notice of the time and place of taking it had been given.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-11\">ON an appeal from a decree of the Superior Court of Chancery for the <em>Williamsburg </em>District, whereby an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>junction obtained by the appellee against the appellant was made perpetual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-4\"><em>Burwell </em>assigned the bond of one <em>Butler </em>to a certain <em>William Harwood,, </em>in these words : \u201c I assign the within \u201c bond to Mr. <em>William Harwood </em>which bond had been previously assigned by one <em>Chapman to Burwell, </em>in the same general terms, <em>no restrictive words having been used. Harwood </em>being dead, his executors <em>{Pendleton </em>and Courtney) instituted suit on the bond, recovered judgment, and made part of the money by execution, no property being found for the residue. They then brought suit against <em>Burwell </em>on the assignment, and, having obtained judgment, sued out execution, upon which he gave a twelve months\u2019 replevy bond. This bond was assigned by <em>Robert </em>Courtney, executor of <em>William </em>Courtney, who was surviving executor of Harwood, to the appellant Stubbs. Execution having been issued on the replevy bond, <em>Burwell </em>filed his bill in the late High Court of Chancery, stating that he had been induced, from the unfavourable representations which <em>Harwood </em>had given of the circumstances of <em>Butler </em>to sell him the bond at a great loss, having taken in payment merchandize at an advanced price, and a watch at <em>thirty guineas, </em>which <em>Harwood </em>afterwards acknowledged he had purchased in the <em>West-Indies </em>at <em>thirty-two dollars ; </em>and further that he had assigned it, merely to emole <em>Harwood </em>to sue in his own name, it being expressly agreed that he was not to be responsible in the event of the money not being recovered of <em>Butler. </em>He also stated that <em>Harwood\u2019s </em>executors had instituted suit on that bond without requiring bail, and then accepted a confession of judgment at <em>June, </em>with stay of execution till <em>November </em>following. The prayer of the bill was for an injunction, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">The deposition of a single witness <em>(Thomas </em>Buckner) was taken. He proved that <em>Ilarwoodiv-'A </em>informed him of his having sold to <em>Burwell </em>in part payment of <em>Bulleds </em>bond, a watch at the price of <em>thirty guineas, </em>which only cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>him <em>twenty-tzoo dollars </em>in the <em>West-Indies ; </em>and that he **ad obtained an assignment of the bond to enable him to bring suit in his own name, and that <em>Burwell </em>might not be charged with the costs ; and that if he never recovered of <em>Butler </em>he should not call on <em>Burwell </em>for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ab9\">All the answers state that the defendants know nothing pf the contract between <em>Burwell </em>and <em>Harwood. That </em>of Courtney, the representative of Harwood,\u00a1merely states that he has no interest in the subject, having, under a decree of the Court of Chancery, assigned the replevy bond of <em>Bur-well </em>to the appellant <em>Stubbs </em>without recourse. <em>Stubbs </em>states that he is an innocent assignee, and paid full value for the bond ; and that the defence of <em>Burwell </em>was purely of a legal nature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">An exhibit was filed shewing a full administration of the estate of Harwood, by his executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-7\">The Chancellor <em>(admitting Buckner\u2019s deposition to be read against Courtney </em>only,\u2022 <em>notice of the\u25a0 time and place of taking it not having been given to the other defendants') </em>made the injunction perpetual j from which decree <em>Stubbs </em>appealed to this Court,.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Air\">Randolph, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aky\">contended that the injunction ought to have been dissolved. Striking the testimony of <em>Buckner </em>out of the case, which was neither admissible in <em>law </em>nor in fact, admitted by the Chancellor against Stubbs, there was nothing to support the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-9\">In the assignment from <em>Chapman </em>to Burwell, there is no restriction as to the responsibility of the assignor ; nor is there any in the assignment from <em>Burwell </em>to <em>Harwood. </em>If then <em>Harwood\u2019s </em>representatives recover of Burwell, he can recover of <em>Chapman. </em>The assignment of <em>Burwell </em>was deceptions, if he reserved an agreement not to be responsible, which did not appear on the assignment itself. This negligent act gave the bond a currency, which it would not otherwise have possessed. It was holding out a false credit which induced <em>Stubbs </em>to become the proprietor of the bond ; and if a loss is sustained, it ought to fall on <em>Burwell </em>alone.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Williams, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az0\">1\u2019he answers of the defendants not denying the equity of the bill, but only stating that they know nothing of the contract between <em>Burwell </em>and Harwood, there was no ground upon which the Chancellor could have dissolved the injunction. But the deposition of <em>Buckner </em>is decisive of the question, and afforded evidence which justified its being made perpetual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-4\">Where a bond is assigned, and there is an agreement that the assignor shall not be liable, the contract is valid ; as was expressly decided in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>M'Donald.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And though it does not appear upon the assignment in this case, yet it is fully proven by the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-5\">At a subsequent day of the term, the Court desired that the following points might be spoken to : 1st. Whether it was agreeable to the practice in the High Court of Chancery to issue commissions without consent of parties, to take depositions in a cause after it was set for hearing : and, 2dly. Whether, where there are several parties, defendants to a suit, and notice be. given to <em>one </em>only, <em>another </em>can be affected by the deposition ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-6\">As to the first point, it was stated by <em>Williams </em>that an agreement among the members of the bar had authorised the awarding of commissions to take depositions at any time before the hearing, in order to save the trouble of an application to the Chancellor, who never refused a commission ; that the <em>practice </em>of the High Court of Chancery was the same as the <em>rule </em>of the present Superior Court of Chancery ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> that, as this commission issued after the cause was set for hearing, and no exception was taken on that ground, it must be presumed that it was done either by consent of parties, or by special order of the Court <em>; </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and that no exception <em>could </em>be taken in this Court to the reading of a deposition upon any gro\u00fand not taken in the Court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-7\">With respect to the second point, the act of Assembly only required notice to the <em>adverse party.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But if there be two or more plaintiffs or defendants, it is silent whether <em>all </em>must have notice or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Oil the other side, it was contended by <em>Randolph </em>that it would not only be contrary to all <em>principle </em>to conclude a party by a deposition who had no opportunity to cross-examine, but was in direct opposition to the settled <em>practice,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which expressly requires that notice shall be given, to <em>all the parties.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b555-12\"> <em>Ante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b555-13\"> See <em>Mute </em>12. prefixed to v. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b555-14\"> See <em>Rev.

From the matter contained in that de- \u201c position, if it had been regularly taken, so as to have \u201c been admissible as evidence against all the parties, this \u201c Court would have approved of the decree : but not being \u201c admissible, nor admitted against the defendant <em>Stubbs, </em>M this Court is of opinion that the Court of Chancery \u201c ought not to have proceeded to render a final decree \u201c in the cause : for if the Court were satisfied that the \u201c complainant was entitled to the relief sought, and that \u201c from the alleged insolvency of <em>William Harwood's </em>es- \u201c tate, the only relief which could be afforded him was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>14 by a perpetual injunction to the judgment obtained \u201c against him by the executors of the said <em>William Har</em>44 wood., the fact of the insolvency of <em>Harwood\u2019s </em>estate \u201c ought to have been inquired into <em>; </em>and an opportunity \u201c ought also to have been afforded the plaintiff to take the \u201c deposition of <em>Thomas Buckner de novo, </em>giving due no- \u201c tice thereof to the defendant <em>Stubbs, </em>that he might-not \u201c be concluded by the evidence of a witness whom he had \u201c no opportunity to cross-examine. Upon these grounds \u201c this Court doth decree and order that so much of the \u201c decree aforesaid as perpetuates the injunction awarded \u201c the complainant to stay all further proceedings on the \u201c replevy bond in the bill mentioned in behalf of the said \u201c <em>Harwood\u2019s </em>representatives, be affirmed ; and that the 44 said decree be reversed so far as it relates to the defend- \u201c ant <em>Stubbs, </em>and that the appellee pay to the appellant his 44 costs, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\">\u201c And the cause is remanded to the said Superior Court \u201c of Chancery for such further proceedings therein to be 44 had, in respect to the defendant <em>Stubbs, </em>as may enable \u201c that Court to render a final decree as to him, according 44 to the principles of equity. And with this further direc44 tion, that if, upon the coming in of that deposition, (or \u201c in the event of the want of it, by reason of the death of \u201c the witness or otherwise,) the said Court of Chancery 44 should be of opinion that the complainant\u2019s equity, as 44 against <em>Stubbs, </em>is not sustained according to the princi44 pies, which, under the opinion of this Court, go to sustain 44 it against the representatives of <em>Harwood ; </em>that then and 44 in that case the said Court shall institute and set 44 on foot such proceedings, tending to inquire into the 44 solvency of the said <em>Harwood, </em>as the said Court may think 44 conducive to justice, if desired by the complainant ; \u201c and also institute an inquiry as to the real value of the \u201c consideration paid by <em>Harwood, </em>for the bond aforesaid; 44 which sum, with interest, shall limit the amount of the 44 sum, for which the said complainant shall be, in that event, 44 considered liable.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
