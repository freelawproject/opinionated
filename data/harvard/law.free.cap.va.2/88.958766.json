In 1796, <em>H. </em>living in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>sold to <em>B. </em>his right and title to a tact of land in <em>Virginia; </em>and covenanted to convey that right when <em>B. </em>should pay the purchase money; for which <em>B. </em>executed his bonds to <em>II. </em>In 1797, JY. purchased <em>B.\u2019s bargain, </em>and agreed by parol with <em>H. to </em>take <em>B.\u2019s </em>place; and in the same year paid <em>H </em>300 dollars in part of the purchase money. JY. died in 1815, not having received a conveyance or paid the balance of the purchase money; and his executors, under a power in his will, sold the land. In 1839, a suit was brought by an assignee of one of the devisees of JY. to obtain his portion of the purchase money remaining unpaid on the last sale, to which <em>II. </em>was made a party defendant, and answered the bill; and then filed a cross bill, setting up his claim to a lien upon the land for the balance of the pinchase money.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tract of 166 acres was claimed by <em>Hopkins </em>for his sole use and benefit; but of the tract of 460 acres he was bound to account with <em>Michael Dougherty </em>for one half the proceeds of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\">Holding these claims to the two tracts of land aforesaid, <em>James Hopkins, </em>on the 2d of September 1796, entered into a contract with <em>John Burbridge </em>for the sale of his interest therein, at the price of 400 dollars for the larger, and 600 dollars for the smaller tract, payable one third on the 1st of December 1796, and the balance in two equal annual instalments thereafter. At the time when the first payment was to be made, and the other two secured, the said <em>Hopkins </em>was to convey to <em>Bur-bridge </em>his <em>right and title </em>in the said two tracts of land, without warranty. This contract was evidenced by two papers under seal, by which <em>Hopkins </em>bound himself to convey to <em>Burbridge, Hopkins's </em>right and title to the two tracts, without warranty. And at the same time <em>Burbridge </em>executed to <em>Hopkins </em>his obligations to pay the purchase money in <em>Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\">When this sale was made, <em>Dr. John Snyder </em>of <em>Hampshire </em>county was in possession of the tract of 166 acres: and a certain <em>Peter Harsell </em>claimed title to about 306 acres, part of the 460 acre tract. Soon afterwards, <em>Dr. Snyder </em>purchased of <em>Burbridge </em>his contract for the two tracts of land, and apprised <em>Hopkins </em>thereof; and informed him that the purchase money then due was ready to be paid; and on the 15th of February 1797, he paid to <em>Hopkins </em>through <em>Jeremiah Claypole </em>300 dollars, in part of the purchase money: though the receipt is dated by mistake the 15th of January.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">From the time of the purchase of the land by <em>Snyder, </em>a correspondence was carried on between him and <em>Hopkins </em>in relation to it; and on the 12th of November 1797, <em>Hopkins </em>enclosed to <em>Snyder </em>at his request, the papers evidencing his title to both tracts. The letter enclosing the papers not having been answered by <em>Dr. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Snyder, Hopkins </em>addressed to him two others, one on the 9th of February 1798, asking an acknowledgment of the receipt of the papers sent, the other on the 22d December 1798, complaining of <em>Dr. Snyder\u2019s </em>inatten^on t0 ^is engagements, and intimating that unless the claim was settled by the 1st of the next February he should institute a suit for its recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">On the 4th of July 1799, <em>Dr. Snyder </em>wrote to <em>Hopkins, </em>acknowledging the receipt of <em>Hopkins\u2019s </em>letter of the 22d December, and saying: \u201c I must again mention to you, that your money is at your service as soon as you secure me in the title, and put me in possession.\u201d And he concluded his letter with the remark : \u201cWith respect to a suit in the Federal Court, I can assure you I am no democrat, and do not suspect the Judges of corruption.\u201d To this letter <em>Hopkins </em>replied on the 24th of July 1799, and expressed his surprise that he should be required to secure the title, and reminded <em>Snyder </em>of his contract, by which he was to take the title such as <em>Hopkins </em>held it <em>\u2022, </em>afid as to the lawsuit he said: \u201c As I believe you have too much understanding to think there are any pretensions to withhold the money due by contract ; and as a loss is gained by a lawsuit attended with success, if the same object is attainable amicably, I shall not take any steps in the business before the beginning of September, to give an opportunity to you to put an end to the matter by complying with the contract.\u201d With the letter of the 24th of July 1799, the correspondence between <em>Dr. Snyder </em>and <em>Hopkins </em>ceased; and the threatened suit was never brought; but on the 22d of March 1800, <em>Dr. Snyder </em>instituted a suit in chancery in the County Court of <em>Hampshire, </em>in the name of <em>James Hopkins </em>against <em>Michael Dougherty, Peter Harsell </em>and others, for the purpose \u00a1of recovering possession from <em>Harsell, </em>of so much of the 460 acres as he held, and of perfecting <em>Hopkins\u2019s </em>title to the whole tract. This cause lingered on the docket of the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Court until 1832, when it was removed to the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery for the county of <em>Hampshire, </em>and coming on to be heard in that Court, the bill was dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-4\">No patent having issued to <em>Hopkins, </em>or those under whom he claimed, for the 166 acres of land, <em>Dr. Snyder </em>procured a patent to be issued to <em>Hopkins </em>therefor, dated the 30th of January 1811.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">In the spring of 1815, <em>Dr. Snyder </em>died, leaving a will dated in April, and recorded in <em>June; </em>in which he directed all his estate, real and personal, to be sold, and the proceeds to be divided among his six children. After authorizing his executors to convey the lands in <em>Virginia, </em>he says: \u201cIt is expected they will have due regard to completing the title to two tracts of said lands, for which I have <em>Hopkins's </em>title bonds, and a deed from the <em>Commonwealth </em>to <em>Hopkins </em>for one of said tracts.\u201d He appointed <em>William Fox </em>and <em>John Inskeep </em>his executors, who took probat of the will, and entered upon the duties of their office. They assumed the management of the suit in the County Court of <em>Hampshire, </em>against <em>Harsell </em>and others, and on the 23d of December 1816, their counsel in the cause, <em>William Naylor, </em>at their request, wrote a letter to <em>James Hopkins </em>informing him of the pendency of this suit; of the interest of <em>Dr. Snyder's </em>estate in <em>it; the </em>difficulties in the way of its prosecution ; and the desire of the executors to bring it to a close. Amongst other things, he says: \u201c They\u201d (the executors) \u201chave requested me to write to you upon the subject. They find receipts among his (the testator\u2019s) papers for moneys paid you on account of the <em>land; </em>but know not explicitly how much is yet to pay, or will be due to you on completing the title to said land.\u201d Again:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">\u201c It does not appear that there is any dispute about the tract of 166 acres; a conveyance of that tract from you to the executors of <em>Dr. Snyder, </em>who are directed to sell the land, is all that is necessary as to that. You will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>please to write particularly as to that. It is the wish of the executors that <em>that </em>may be done at any rate, immediately upon paying up the proportion of the purchase money, if it is not yet paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-M\">The letter of <em>Mr. Naylor </em>was answered by <em>Hopkins; </em>he preferring a claim for a considerable sum due him for the land; and alleging that he was not responsible for the title. (Jpon the receipt of this letter, the executors sent on to <em>Hopkins </em>the sum of 500 dollars; much less, however, than he claimed, but he refused to receive it, because he did not like the banks on which were the notes tendered to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-11\">Under the authority of the will of <em>Dr. Snyder, </em>his executors, in the fall of 1815, proceeded to sell his real estate ; and sold to <em>Okey Johnson </em>a large tract of land on <em>Patterson1 s </em>creek, in the county of <em>Hampshire, </em>embracing the 166 acre tract, which had been bought <em>by Snyder </em>from <em>Hopkins, </em>for 12,000 dollars. In 1819, <em>Johnson </em>having paid part of the purchase money, and there being yet unpaid upwards of 5000 dollars, which he was unwilling to pay until he received a title for the land, he came to an arrangement with the executors, received a conveyance for all the lands to which they had a good title, took from them a bond in the penalty of 1800 dollars, with condition to make him a good title to the tract of 166 acres on or before the 1st of April 1821, and executed a deed of trust to secure to them the balance of the purchase money, viz : 5544 dollars 93 cents, of which 1944 dollars 93 cents was then due, and the residue was to fall due in two equal instalments of 1800 dollars, on the 1st of April 1820, and the 1st of April 1821.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-12\"><em>Johnson </em>paid all <em>the </em>purchase money, except the last instalment of 1800 dollars; but not having received the title for the 166 acres of land according to the provisions of the executors\u2019 bond, he refused to pay the last instalment, and retained it to indemnify him for the title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The detention of the purchase money by <em>Johnson </em>led to a further correspondence between <em>Hopkins </em>and two of the sons of <em>Dr. Snyder. </em>This correspondence commenced in February 1827, and continued to April 1830. It was carried on in a friendly spirit; propositions of compromise were made, and acceded to with apparently slight modifications on the other part j but these propositions ultimately failed, apparently because <em>Johnson </em>refused to pay the purchase money : and it was found difficult to satisfy <em>Hopkins's </em>claim from other sources.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-4\">In the mean time, as early as July 1818, <em>Charles </em>and <em>William, </em>two of the sons of <em>Dr. John Snyder </em>deceased, had conveyed their interest in their father\u2019s estate to their brother <em>John Snyder; </em>and on the 29th of July 1818, <em>John Snyder, </em>for the purpose of indemnifying <em>Samuel Cockerell </em>as his surety in certain bonds, conveyed to <em>Samuel Kercheval, jr. </em>sundry property, real and personal, and amongst other things, his interest under his father\u2019s will, and under his purchase from his two brothers, in the purchase money due from <em>Okey Johnson </em>for the lands in <em>Hampshire; </em>an interest equal to two fifths of the whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\"><em>Cockerell </em>having been subjected to the payment of the bonds for which he was bound as surety, instituted a suit in the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery for the county of <em>Hampshire, </em>for the purpose of having two fifths of the money yet retained by <em>Johnson </em>applied towards his indemnity. The bill was filed in February 1832, to which <em>Okey Johnson, Jeremiah Inskeep, </em>surviving executor of <em>John Inskeep, </em>who was surviving executor of <em>John Snyder </em>deceased, and the children of said <em>John Snyder, </em>who were the devisees under his will, wore made parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\"><em>Jeremiah Inskeep </em>the executor, answered the bill, and after stating that <em>Johnson </em>had retained the last instalment of the purchase money on the ground of imperfection in the title of that part of the land purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of Hopkins, he said that he had no knowledge of any debts due from <em>Dr. Snyder\u2019s </em>estate, \u201c except such as might perhaps be due to the said <em>James Hopkins </em>on the said land.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-12\"><em>Okey Johnson </em>answered, setting forth his purchase ; alleging that all the purchase money had been paid <em>except </em>1800 dollars, withheld on account of the defect in \u25a0 the title of the tract of 166 acres bought of <em>James Hopkins, </em>in whom the legal title was outstanding; and insisted that as the title to that piece of land had not been made in pursuance of the title bond of the executors, he was entitled to relief from that part of the purchase; which he prayed accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-13\">In September 1833, the plaintiff amended his bill, making <em>James Hopkins </em>a party to the spit; who, in April 1834, filed his answer, setting forth his claims substantially, as they have been hereinbefore stated; and insisting that the whole of the purchase money, with the deduction only of 300 dollars, paid in February 1797, was yet due to him, with <em>interest; </em>upon the payment of which, he was willing to convey his right and title to the two tracts of land sold by him to <em>Burbridge, </em>and by <em>Burbridge </em>to <em>Dr. Snyder.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-14\"><em>Hopkins </em>afterwards died, and the suit was revived against <em>John B. White, </em>his administrator, and also against his heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-15\">In April 1834, after <em>Hopkins </em>had filed his answer, he filed a cross bill against the plaintiff and his codefendants, setting out his claim substantially, as stated in his answer; and asking a decree for the balance of the purchase money, with interest, to be paid out of the moneys in the hands of <em>Okey Johnson; </em>and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-16\"><em>Okey Johnson </em>answered, referring to his answer to the original bill. <em>Cockerell </em>answered, not admitting the plaintiff\u2019s claim; objecting that the proper remedy was at law; that the claim was stale; and relying on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>statute of limitations. <em>Jeremiah Inskeep, </em>the executor, also answered, referring to his former answer, and professing ignorance of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AdG\">On <em>Hopkins's </em>death the cross bill was revived in the name of his administrator <em>White, </em>who filed an amended bill, making the heirs of <em>Hopkins </em>parties; and then <em>Inskeep, </em>the executor, by leave of the Court, pleaded the statute of limitations; and it was agreed between the parties, that evidence to repel it might be given in like manner, as if the matter to be given in evidence had been relied upon by replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">Both causes, being prepared as to all the parties, came on to be heard together in September 1836, when the defendant, <em>Okey Johnson, </em>was directed to pay to <em>White, </em>the administrator of <em>Hopkins, </em>as receiver of the Court, 1800 dollars, with interest, the balance of the purchase money in his hands; and time was taken to consider of the merits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\">On the 24th of September 1837, the causes were again heard together, and the Court decreed that <em>Samuel Kercheval, jr., </em>as commissioner on behalf of the heirs of <em>James Hopkins </em>deceased, and on behalf of <em>Jeremiah Inskeep, </em>the executor, should convey to <em>Okey Johnson </em>the tract of 166 acres in the bill mentioned; that <em>Johnson </em>should be quieted in the possession thereof; that each party in the original cause should pay his own costs; and that the money in the hands of the receiver, paid by <em>Johnson, </em>should be applied first to the payment of the plaintiff <em>Cockerell's </em>costs; and the balance thereof should be distributed among the parties claiming under <em>Dr. Snyder, </em>according to their respective interests therein; and that the cross bill should be dismissed at the plaintiff\u2019s costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-10\">From this decree, the administrator of <em>Hopkins </em>applied for and obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-11\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Cooke, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-12\"><em>Morson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aqt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ay9\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"AMk\">The Court is of opinion that <em>Dr. John Snyder, </em>by his contract with <em>Burbridge, </em>and the consent of <em>Hopkins, </em>placed himself in the shoes of <em>Burbridge, </em>in re-\u00a7arc^to ^ie purchase by the latter from <em>Hopkins </em>of the two tracts of land, one of 460 acres, and the other of 166 acres, in the proceedings mentioned; and became entitled to conveyances thereof from <em>Hopkins, </em>and bound to him for payment of the purchase money therefor; that the only payment made on account of said purchase money was the sum of 300 dollars, paid through <em>Jeremiah Claypole, </em>on the 15th of February 1797, and evidenced by <em>Hopkins\u2019s </em>receipt to <em>Snyder, </em>dated by mistake the 15th of. January, instead of the 15th of February 1797; that for the balance of said purchase money, with interest thereon, <em>Hopkins </em>was entitled to equitable liens upon the said tracts of land; and that his demand is not barred by the statute of limitations; nor, under the circumstances of the case, and proofs in the cause, liable to the presumption of payment arising from lapse of time, nor to any other well founded objection. The Court is further of opinion that <em>Okey Johnson, </em>the purchaser from <em>Snyder\u2019s </em>executors of a tract of land embracing the said 166 acres, having, under the authority of the said Circuit Court, paid to its receiver the balance of purchase money in his hands, which he had retained, because of the failure of <em>Snyder\u2019s </em>executors to make him a good title for said tract of 166 acres, is exonerated from any further responsibility on account of his said purchase, and ought to receive a conveyance of the legal title to said tract of 166 acres. And said <em>Snyder\u2019s </em>estate being liable to <em>Hopkins\u2019s </em>administrator for the balance of principal money and interest due on account of the purchase money, which said <em>Snyder </em>contracted to pay for the said tracts of 460 and 166 acres, and the money paid by said <em>Okey Johnson </em>to the receiver as aforesaid being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>equitable assets, and more than sufficient to discharge that balance, so much of it as is necessary should be applied to that purpose, without regard to the circumstance that part of said balance embraces purchase money of the 460, as well as of the 166 acres. The Court is therefore of opinion that there is no error in so much of the decree of the said Circuit Court, as directs a conveyance to the said <em>Olcey Johnson </em>of the title to said tract of 166 acres, and as quiets him in the possession thereof: but that the same is erroneous in directing payment to Cockerell, the plaintiff in the original suit, of his costs out of the money paid to the receiver as aforesaid, and distribution of the residue thereof amongst the representatives of said <em>Snyder </em>and those claiming under them; instead of decreeing such payment and distribution only in regard to what should remain after satisfaction of the balance of principal money and interest due to the appellant as aforesaid; and in failing to decree such satisfaction to the appellant, and in dismissing his cross bill. It is therefore decreed and ordered, that so much of said decree of the said Circuit Court as conflicts with the principles above declared be reversed and annulled, and that the residue thereof be affirmed, with costs to the appellant against <em>Cockerell </em>and <em>Snyder\u2019s </em>representatives, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
