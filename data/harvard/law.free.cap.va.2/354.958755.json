The variance is immaterial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-12\">This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>brought in the Hustings Court of <em>the City </em>of <em>Richmond, </em>by <em>Knapp, Preston Sy Co. </em>against <em>Benjamin F. </em>and <em>George H. Dabney. </em>The writ was issued in the name of <em>F. W. Knapp, A. B. Preston, </em>and <em>Samuel P. Christian, </em>merchants and partners under the name and style of <em>Knapp, Preston Sy Co.; </em>and laid the damages at 500 dollars. The declaration was in the name of <em>Frederick W. Knapp, A. B. Preston, </em>and <em>Samuel B. Christian, </em>merchants and partners under the name and style of <em>Knapp, Preston Sy Co., </em>and laid the damages at 600 <em>dollars; </em>and the account filed with the declaration, was dated the 30th of September 1835.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-13\">The defendants not appearing, judgment was rendered against them by default, and upon a writ of enquiry of damages, the jury assessed the plaintiffs\u2019 damages at 455 dollars 16 cents, with interest from the 1st day of January 1835 till paid: and the Court gave judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-14\">From this judgment the defendants obtained an appeal to the Superior Court of Law and Chancery for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>county of <em>Henrico, </em>where it was affirmed; and they then obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Af43\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_a\">This being a judgment by default for want of appearance, it is open to any objection which might have been taken at any stage of the proceedings in the Hustings Court, whether by motion, plea, or demurrer. <em>Green, </em>J. in <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Pennell, </em>2 Rand. 174. And for this purpose the writ is a part of the record. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Harper, 3 </em>Leigh 270; <em>Nadenbush </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>4 Rand. <em>413; Payne </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>6 Rand. <em>101; Ming </em>v. <em>Gwatkin, </em>Id. 551.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-7\">1. The first error in this record is, that the writ lays the plaintiffs\u2019 damages at 500 dollars, and the count claims 600 dollars. Upon a judgment by default for want of appearance, this is a fatal variance. <em>Bargamin </em>v. <em>Poiteaux, </em>4 Leigh 413; <em>Cabell\u2019s </em>opinion: and <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>4 Rand. 152.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-9\">2. In the writ, one of the plaintiffs is named <em>F. W. Knapp, </em>and another <em>Samuel P. Christian, </em>and in the count, they are <em>Frederick W. Knapp, </em>and <em>Samuel B. Christian. </em>On this point <em>Ming </em>v. <em>Gwatkin, </em>6 Rand. 551, is directly in point. See also 1 Corny. Dig. Abatement, letter G, 8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-12\">3. Interest is given from the 1st of January 1835, when the account is dated on the 30th of September 1835.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-13\"><em>Morson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayu2\">The damages assessed by the jury, are less than are claimed in the writ or declaration, and therefore even at common law the variance is immaterial. <em>Eardley </em>v. <em>Turnock, </em>Croke James 629. At common law there is no distinction between a judgment by default and on a verdict, and therefore, if this was not error at common law after verdict, it was not error on judgment by default. <em>Starling </em>v. <em>Long, </em>Id. 128.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aeg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>But if this variance was error at common law, it is cured by the statute of <em>jeofails. Hook </em>v. <em>Turnbull, </em>6 Call 85; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Mill, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. <em>502; Stephens </em>v. <em>White, </em>2 Wash. 203. The earlier cases held t^iat ^ statute did apply to judgments by default; and of this opinion was <em>Green, </em>J. in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>reported in a note to <em>Bargamin </em>v. <em>Poiteaux. </em>There are some <em>dicta </em>in the later cases in opposition to this doctrine; but in these cases there was a variance in substance. Such was the fact in the cases cited by the counsel on the other side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-4\">As to the second error relied on, the writing <em>Frederick </em>for <em>F. </em>cannot be considered a <em>variance; </em>it is a mere writing out the name. The other name is correct in the writ, and the judgment; and the error in the count may be amended by the writ. Indeed the plaintiffs were partners dealing under a particular name. In that name they <em>sue; </em>and the judgment is in their favour as constituting the firm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-5\">It is not necessary to state, either in the count or in the bill of particulars, from what time the interest runs ; but the jury are directed by the statute to fix the period when it shall commence. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128, \u00a7 80, p. 508.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b376-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A_I\">Affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
