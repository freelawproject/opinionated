Therefore where a deed of trust of personalty, dated the 15th of July 1812, stated the grantor to be of <em>Henrico </em>county, and the trustee and <em>cestui que trust to </em>be of the town of <em>Petersburg, </em>and the deed was never recorded in <em>Henrico </em>but only in <em>Petersburg, </em>and there was no evidence to shew that either at the date of \u00bfhe deed, or of its recordation in <em>Petersburg, </em>the grantor resided in that town, Held, the deed so recorded is void as to the grantor\u2019s creditors.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-9\">By deed bearing date the 15th of July 1812, purporting to be between <em>John Bell \u201c </em>late of the town of <em>Petersburg </em>but now of <em>Henrico </em>county\u201d of the first part, <em>George Keith Taylor </em>of the said town of <em>Petersburg </em>of the second part, and <em>William </em>and <em>Henry Haxall </em>of the same town of the third part, it was recited that <em>Bell </em>was indebted to <em>William </em>and <em>Henry Haxall </em>the sum of 10,000 dollars, the payment of which he desired to secure, and he conveyed to <em>Taylor, </em>in trust for that purpose, certain articles of household and kitchen furniture and liquors mentioned in a schedule annexed to the deed. In the court of hustings of <em>Petersburg </em>on the first of March 1813, this' deed was acknowledged by <em>Bell, Taylor </em>and <em>William Haxall, </em>and with the schedule annexed admitted to record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-10\">In 1817, <em>Benjamin Cocke, </em>a creditor of <em>William &lt;Sf John Bell If Co. </em>brought an action in the superior court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Prince George </em>county to recover his debt. In that action, judgment was obtained against <em>John Bell </em>on the 27th of April 1818, for 1634 dollars 72 cents with interest from the 1st of June 1815, and costs; and on the 3d June 1818 a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>was issued upon the judgment, and levied in the city of <em>Richmond </em>on property which <em>William </em>and <em>Henry Haxall </em>claimed to have been conveyed by the deed of trust aforesaid. Upon a bill by them in the court of chancery at <em>Richmond, </em>the sale was injoined, and the property restored to the possession of <em>Bell. </em>Under an order of the court of chancery, <em>William Haxall, </em>the surviving partner of <em>William </em>and <em>Henry Haxall, </em>entered into bond on the 8th of November 1831, with <em>Philip Haxall </em>his surety, in the penalty of 4000 dollars, conditioned to pay to <em>Cocke </em>all such costs and damages as might be awarded him in consequence of the injunction, in case the same should be dissolved. This injunction was dissolved on the 25th of June 1833. And thereupon <em>Cocke </em>brought an action upon the injunction bond, in the circuit court of <em>Henrico, </em>against <em>Clara Haxall </em>as executrix of <em>Philip Haxall. </em>Issues were joined upon the pleas of conditions performed and <em>non damnificatus, </em>and at the trial the facts appeared to be as herein before stated. It was admitted that before the dissolution of the injunction, <em>John Bell </em>had died insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\">In this state of the case, the plaintiff moved the court to exclude from the jury the deed aforesaid, upon the ground that at the time of its execution <em>Bell </em>the grantor resided in the county of <em>Henrico, </em>and the property conveyed by it was also in that county, and the deed had never been recorded in <em>Henrico, </em>and was therefore void as to the plaintiff. But the court overruled the motion, and permitted the deed to be given in evidence to the jury as a deed properly and duly recorded. To which opinion the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The plaintiff also moved the court to instruct the jury that the deed was void as to him, unless by the evidence it should appear to the satisfaction of the jury, that either at the date of the deed, or of its recordation in the hustings court of the town of <em>Petersburg, </em>the grantor resided in that town : but the court refused to give the instruction, and the plaintiff excepted to this opinion also. A second instruction was moved and overruled, the purport of which it is unnecessary to state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-4\">A verdict being found for the defendant, judgment was rendered thereupon ; and to that judgment <em>a supersedeas </em>was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-5\">The cause was argued by <em>Stanard </em>and <em>Lyons </em>for the plaintiff in error, and by <em>C. </em>and <em>Q.

Stat. 318.\u2014of 1710, ch. 13. 3 Id. 517.\u2014of 1734, ch. 6. 4 Id. 397.\u2014of 1748, ch. 1. 5 Id. 408. and of 1785, ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>62. 12 Id. 154. that it was the intention of the legislature, in the act of 1792, to require a deed of trust or mortgage of personal estate to be recorded in the general court, or in the court of the district, county, city or corporation in which the grantor resided. And it appearing from the recital in the deed in the bill of exceptions referred to, that the grantor <em>John Bell </em>resided in <em>Henrico </em>county, and the deed having been recorded in the corporation of <em>Petersburg; </em>such deed, so recorded, was void as against the creditors of said grantor. The court is therefore of opinion, that the court below erred in permitting said deed to go in evidence to the jury, and in refusing to give the first instruction asked for by the plaintiff. Therefore the judgment is reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, with instructions to exclude the said deed from going in evidence, if no other testimony should be adduced on the trial, and to give the first instruction as prayed for by the plaintiff, if the same should be again required.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
