It is founded on a mistaken notion, that the Sheriff, in executing such a writ, acts <em>judicially </em>and not <em>ministerially o </em>Itwould puzzle any person, 1 think, to state a case, in which the Sheriffs in this country act judicially. In <em>England, </em>they are to some purposes Judges in every sense of the word, and whilst acting In that capacity they cannot delegate their authority 5 but in all other cases, the rule is, that they may act by deputy unless specially commanded <em>to go in persono </em>This Is laid down in <em>4 Repo 65, </em>where a similar objection was made to a deputy\u2019s executing a writ of <em>Elegit; </em>but it was not sustained. In every instance where It has been determined that the High Sheriff must execute a writ in person, he is either required toy Statute to do so, as in an enquiry of <em>waste, </em>partition, <em>accedas ad </em>curiam,, redisseisin, \u00a3s?c. / or else he executes It in <em>&amp; judicial capacity, </em>as in cases of <em>admeasurement of dower </em>and pasture, which are <em>viconieil </em>writs, and not returnablej consequently, the decision of the Sheriff Is judicial and final, unless the case be removed by <em>Pone </em>before the Court of Common Pleas. <em>Fitzho JYo Bo </em>148. <em>Clatfs Case, </em>1 Cro. <em>Eh </em>10. <em>Dalio Sh. </em>34. Bo in a writ <em>de nativo habendo, </em>if it go to the Sheriff'to <em>hold plea of the matter, </em>he is judge and officer, and must therefore execute it in person. Otherwise it Is, if directed to him, <em>returnable </em>into the King\u2019s Bench, for there he acts ministerially, 4 <em>Baco </em>441; In the case before the Court, the writ is directed t\u00f3 the Sheriff generally. He is to summon and impannel a jury and to charge them, and afterwards to <em>reiurtj) their inquisl </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>turn to the Court, </em>to be there decided upon. All his acts are of a ministerial nature. He exercises no judicial function whatever in this case, more than he does in executing a writ of <em>Elegit. </em>By our law, (see <em>Rev. Laws, </em>p. 129,) all writs, and other process whatsoever, are to be executed by the <em>Sheriff, </em>or by his <em>Deputies; </em>now this is certainly a <em>writ, </em>and within the general expressions of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\"><em>Campbell, </em>on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">Wherever the Legislature has thought proper to except particular cases out of the general law authorising Deputy Sheriffs to act, a particular provision has been made for the purpose. Two cases are at present recollected. The one is Avhere an execution issues against the property of a former Sheriff; and the other, where lands are directed to be sold for the payment of taxes. In both instances the law requires the <em>High Sheriff </em>to attend, and bv doing so, it distinguishes between the <em>High Sheriff </em>in exclusion of the <em>Deputy, </em>and the <em>Sheriff, </em>which' means as well the Deputy as the principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-8\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\">There are two errors in the order of the County Court, (which have not been noticed,) sufficient I think to sustain the reversal of it in the District Court. 1st, The application to the County Court for leave to build the mill, does not state that the <em>bed of the stream </em>-belonged to the appellant. The words of the law are, that \u201c when any person owning lands on one side of any water course, <em>the bed whereof belongeth to himself or to the Comtnonwealth, </em>and desiring to build a water grist mill on such lands, and to erect a dam across the same for working the said mill, shall not himself have the fee simple property in the lands on the opposite side thereof, against which he would abut his dam, he shall make application for a writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum,w &amp;c. (see <em>Rev. Laws, </em>p. 206.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-10\">Now, although the appellant in this case owned land <em>on both sides </em>of the stream, and therefore he is not literally within this clause of the law, yet the 4th section requires the same formalities where the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>.applying owns the land on both sides, as if he were seeking to condemn an acre of ground on one side, as mentioned in the first section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-2\">2d, The jury in their inquisition, say, \u201c they have viewed the lands above and below, and are of opinion, that no person will be injured by the overflow of the water, the said <em>Wroe </em>owning the lands on both sides of the run above and below, his land above, running farther than the water will probably flow to.?5&gt;</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-3\">Now the jury have said nothing about the lands <em>below, </em>which may be injured, as well by the breaking of the dam, as the lands above could be by the overflow of the water.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-4\">As to the principal questions, I have more doubts respecting it. The administering of an oath seems to be a judicial act, or at all events one, which from its nature cannot be delegated. The Sheriff is to perform this solemn act, and it would seem as if it were intended to be confided to the <em>High Sheriff, </em>who Is-always a justice of the peace, and from his mode of appointment holds a more respectable station than deputies of his own choosing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-5\">The Court stopped Mr. <em>Campbell\\ </em>who was about <em>to </em>reply, saying it was unnecessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b173-6\">Carrington J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahi\">There is no weight i think <em>in </em>the two objections started by the appellee?s counsel. Where the person applying owns the land on both sides of the stream, the presumption is, that the bed of it belongs to him, and therefore it Is unnecessary for him to set it forth in his application to the Court. Bui If he own the land on one side only, and seek to condemn an acre on the other side for an abutment, no such presumption exists, and therefore it is necessary <em>to </em>state to the Court, that the property in the bed of the run is in the Commonwealth, or in the party applying. The 4th section of the law refers to the proceedings <em>subsequent </em>to the ordering of the writ. The words are, cc in like manner if the person proposing to build such mill and dam shall have the fee simple property in the lands on both sides of the stream, yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>application shall be made to the Court of the comity wherein the mill house will stand, for a like writ which shall be directed, executed, and <em>returned, </em>as prescribed in the former case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUR\">The second objection is, that the jury have said nothing as to the injury which the lands below the dam might sustain. They have gone as far as they could. It was impossible for them to value the damage which the owners of land below the mill might sustain by the breaking of the dam 5 it was an accident which perhaps might never happen. They have therefore very properly left it to be decided upon by another tribunal whenever the case should occur.</p>\n<p id=\"AMJs\">I come next to consider the point upon which the District Court reversed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AKZ\">The rule is laid down in 4 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>440, 441, and the cases there cited, that the <em>Deputy </em>Sheriff may execute process in all cases where the <em>High </em>Sheriff is not <em>specially required to go in </em>person, or where the thing to be done is not of such a nature as to amount to <em>judicial act. </em>Thus in an inquiry of waste, <em>partition, </em>&amp;c., the writs command the Sheriff to go in person, and consequently being commissions specially directed to himself, they cannot be executed by de- . puty. In two other cases which are mentioned, <em>viz-</em>a writ of <em>admeasurment of dower, </em>and a writ <em>de nativo habendo, </em>the High Sheriff must act in person, because those writs being <em>vicontiel, </em>and not returnable, he decides finally and in the capacity of a Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">But in this case, every act of the Sheriff is purely <em>ministerial </em>The inquisition is the finding of the jury, not the judgment of the Sheriff. It is returned to the Court from whence the writ emanated, and it is there finally decided upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">By the laws of this State, a general power is given to Deputy Sheriffs to execute all writs and process whatsoever, leaving it for particular acts to make exceptions from this general law, when necessary. Consequently, we find that the Legislature has thought proper to require the personal attendance of the <em>High </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>Sheriff, </em>in cases of executions against a former Sheriff' <em>Rev* Laws </em>p\u00bb 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the judgment of the District Court might to be reversed, and ifas order of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Lyons J. \u2014 The general rule is, that whatever <em>t\\t </em>Sheriff may do personally, he may do by deputy\u00bb But from this there are exceptions. If the act he of a <em>judicial </em>nature, he cannot delegate it to another. The case of a writ of <em>admeasurment of dower </em>is an instance of this. So if the High Sheriff be required to act <em>m person </em>he must do .so.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">By our law, the Sheriff is authorised generally to act by deputy, unless in cases expressly excepted. The inconvenience might be very great, if the High Sheriff in' cases of this sort were required to attend lo per son | as if two writs of <em>ad quod damnum </em>were to be executed on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">This writ is directed to the <em>Sheriff </em>which means as well the <em>Deputy </em>as the <em>High Sheriff </em>It is a write; and all writs may be executed by a Deputy Sheriff\u00bb It is not a judicial act 5 it is not a case excepted from the general authority given to Deputy Sheriff\u2019s, and therefore I can see no reason why he may not properly take the inquisition. It may not be improper also to remark, that the general practice of the coun,try has favoured this opinion. There is no weight in the other two objections stated at the bar. I am therefore of opinion that the judgment of the District Court is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The President\u00bb- \u2014 The rule in <em>England </em>is, that where process is directed to the <em>Sheriff generally, </em>and nor by <em>name, </em>if the High Sheriff be not required by the command of the writ, or by some Statute, to go in person, he may act by deputy. The case of am <em>Elegii </em>is not distinguished from the present, and though another reason seems to be given in <em>FulwooFs </em>Case, 4 <em>Rep* 65, </em>why the Deputy may act, vet a more satisfactory one is furnished by the role above men - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>tioned ; namely, that the Statute does not require the <em>High Sheriff to go in person.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">Our law upon this subject appears to be formed upon this rule. All process, without exception, is directed by the general law to be executed by the High Sheriff, or by his deputies, leaving particular cases in which it might be proper for the High Sheriff to act, for future laws to provide for. Accordingly, the Legislature have thought proper in two cases which are recollected, to require the High Sheriff to act in person. As to the charging of the jury, those who make the objection ought to shew that the High Sheriff can <em>ex officio </em>administer an oath, without a positive law to authorise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">It was the common practice for the deputies to ex - ecute writs of <em>ad quod damnum </em>to dock intails, and I do not: know that in any instance it was questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">Judgment of the District Court reversed, and the order of the County Court affirmed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-14\">(1) <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Cralle, 1 </em>Munf. <em>258. 264</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
