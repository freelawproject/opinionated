Chambers, </em>and <em>John Sid ope </em>his surety, to recover the amount due from said <em>William F. Chambers </em>on his guardianship account. The only subject of dispute in this Court was an item of 78 dollars, the amount of a legacy left to the plaintiff by her grandfather <em>Robert Chambers.</em></summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b339-14\">1845. <em>July Term.</em></decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAZ7H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The father of the plaintiff died in 1829; and in 1831, <em>William F. Chambers </em>qualified as her guardian, with <em>John Swope </em>as his surety. In 1836, <em>Robert Chambers </em>the grandfather of the plaintiff made his will and By one clause of his will he says: \u201cto my granddaughter <em>Elizabeth Chambei's </em>seventy-eight dollars, with my bureau and one good cow, to be held in trust by my executor and her guardian, till she is eighteen years old, unless married before; and in that case, she may receive such a part or the whole as her guardian may think proper until she is eighteen; and this money I desire may be put to interest with good security : but if she should demise before that time the money to be equally divided between my other legatees.\u201d And he appointed <em>William F. Chambers </em>his executor ; who qualified as such, and took possession of the estate of his testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pASf\">In January 1842, <em>Swope </em>was, upon his application to the County Court of Monroe, released from his surety-ship for <em>William F. Chambers; </em>and at the April term following, the authority of said <em>Chambers </em>as guardian of the plaintiff was revoked; and <em>James S. Ballard </em>was guardian in his stead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAql5\">After the release of <em>Swope, William F. Chambers </em>settled both his guardian and executorial account, <em>before </em>a commissioner of the County Court of <em>Monroe; </em>and on this settlement he was credited as executor of <em>Robert Chambers </em>by the legacy left to the plaintiff, and charged with it in his account as guardian: and being so charged the balance found against him was 113 dollars 98 cents. <em>Swope </em>the surety of <em>William F. Chambers </em>offered to pay the difference between this balance and 78 dollars, the amount of the legacy; but the present guardian of the plaintiff refused to receive it; and this suit was brought. The bill charged that <em>Chambers </em>held the legacy as guardian of the plaintiff; and <em>Chambers </em>in his answer, said that he always considered himself as liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>for it in that character: but <em>Swope </em>in his answer, denied that <em>Chambers </em>held as guardian, or that he could have so held it under the will of <em>Robert Chambers, </em>before the plaintiff arrived to the age of eighteen: which she had not done when this suit was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-4\">The cause came on to be heard in July 1843, when it appearing that <em>William F.

From this decree, <em>Swope </em>obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-5\"><em>Caperton, </em>for the appellant, insisted 1st.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANM\">That the legacy left by <em>Robert Chambers to </em>the plaintiff was not a vested, but a contingent legacy; and he referred to 2 Lomax\u2019s Ex\u2019ors 53, 55; 5 Bac.

That if the legacy is vested, it is not payable until the happening of the event contemplated; and therefore this suit could not be maintained. 5 Bac.

Chambers, </em>necessarily, received the estate of <em>Robert Chambers </em>as executor; and must be considered as holding it in that character, until he did some act indicating his election to hold it as guardian. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Northam, </em>5 Mass.

In this case the answer of <em>William F. Chambers </em>does not state that he had done any act indicating his election; but that he considered himself liable as guardian. The settlement of the accounts was after <em>Swope </em>was released from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>liability as surety, and an <em>election then made, </em>cannot relate back so as to affect the liability of <em>Swope.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A8_\"><em>N.

The object of this suit is not to have the legacy paid over to the plaintiff, but to secure it; and this a Court of Equity will do at the instance of any party having a beneficial interest in the legacy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-7\">3d. The will puts the legacy in the hands of the testator\u2019s executor, and the legatee\u2019s guardian. This was <em>descriptio personae, </em>and intended <em>William F. Chambers. </em>The will, too, authorizes the guardian to advance to the legatee as he thought fit, after her marriage, and before she attained the age of eighteen years; clearly indicating the intention of the testator that <em>William F. Chambers </em>should hold the legacy as guardian. Being both executor and guardian he could elect to hold in the latter character. Rob. Prac. 377; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Deblois, </em>4 Mass. R. 131; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>6 Rand. 444; <em>Hamlin\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>Id. 574; <em>Pratt v. Northam, </em>5 Mass. R. 95; <em>Broadus </em>v. <em>Rosson, </em>3 Leigh 12. The answer of <em>Chambers, </em>which is evidence against his sureties, <em>(Myers </em>v. <em>Wade, supra,) </em>says he held as guardian; and the <em>ex parte </em>settlement of his accounts, which was not excepted to, proves that he so held. <em>Atwell\u2019s adm\u2019r v. Milton, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 253; <em>Spedden </em>v. <em>The State, </em>3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Har. &amp; Johns. 251: <em>Aston\u2019s </em>Estate, <em>Ex parte, </em>5 Whar. R. 228.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AAC\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aov\">The question propounded by this appeal is, whether the surety in the bond of <em>Chambers </em>as the guardian of the infant plaintiff, be liable to a decree in this case, for the amount of the legacy of 78 dollars, claimed by her under the will of her grandfather <em>Robert Chambers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The argument on the question whether the legacy was, or was not vested, displayed a research and ingenuity most creditable to both the counsel. Though I strongly incline to the opinion that the legacy was not a vested one, and would not vest until the legatee should marry or attain the age of 18 years, neither of which events had occurred when <em>Chambers\u2019s </em>authority as guardian was revoked, and when this suit was instituted, I do not think it necessary, and therefore forbear to give a definitive judgment on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Though it were admitted, that the right to the legacy was a vested one, it is conceded, and properly so, that the legacy was not payable, and, consequently, not demandable until the legatee married or attained the age of 18 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">The fund for the legacy came to the hands of <em>Chambers </em>the guardian, not in that character, but as executor of the testator, and, necessarily, remained in his hands in that character until it could be lawfully shifted, and was in fact shifted to his hands as guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">If the legacy had been vested, and payable during the guardianship of <em>Chambers, </em>so as to make it his duty to pass the fund from himself as executor to himself as guardian, very slight acts, and even declarations of <em>Chambers </em>that he considered the fund in his hands as guardian, might suffice to make him and his surety chargeable in that character. But as the legacy was not demandable or payable, he could not, had the guardian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>been another, have discharged himself of his executorial responsibility for this fund by prematurely passing the fund into the hands of the guardian; and it is not perceived that (he being the guardian as well as executor) even a much more distinct act of election than is in evidence, or even suggested in this case, could have had the effect of terminating the executorial, and fixing the guardianship responsibility, before the legacy was payable or demandable. My opinion is, that no such act is proved; and if it was proved, that any such act was unavailing to terminate the executorial, and create the guardianship responsibility. The conclusion is, that the Court, below erred in decreeing against the appellant as the surety of the guardian for this legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"ATt\">The executor and his surety were before the Court, and if at the institution of the suit the female plaintiff had been entitled to demand and receive the legacy, it would be proper to decree therefor against the executor and his surety. But, confessedly, the infant at the institution of the suit had not a right to demand and receive the legacy; and, consequently, a decree therefor could not be properly rendered. The counsel of the infant, conceding that the infant was not entitled, at the institution of the suit, to demand and receive the legacy, vindicates the institution of the suit as a proper measure for the preservation of the legacy, until one or the other event shall happen on which it will be demandable and payable. A sufficient answer to this is, that such is not the nature or object of the suit. It is brought to recover the legacy, not to secure the fund; and being so, it was prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The decree was reversed with costs; and the Court proceeding to render such a decree as the Court below ought to have rendered in respect to the claim of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>plaintiff below to the legacy under the will of <em>Robert </em>Chambers, it was decreed that the bill so far as it sought <em>to </em>recover that legacy be <em>dismissed; </em>but without prejudice to any suit that the infant plaintiff may institute when she shall marry or attain the age of 18 years to recover said legacy from the executor of <em>Robert Chambers, </em>or his surety or sureties; or to any suit that the infant or any of the parties interested in the legacy may institute for the preservation of the fund out of which the legacy is or may be payable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
