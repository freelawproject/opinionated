After answer put in, a motion was made to dissolve, and on a hearing, the Court over-ruled the motion, but continued the cause and awarded commissions to take depositions. At a subsequent Court, on hearing the bill, answer, depositions and exhibits, the Court dissolved the injunction, and decreed the plaintiff in that Court to pay costs.</p><p id=\"AFNJ\">From this decree the defendant appealed. The High Court of Chancery directed issues between the parties, which were accordingly tried, and a verdict certified thereon. The Chancellor reversed the decree of the County Court, and decreed a perpetual injunction, from which <em>Davenport </em>appealed.</p><p id=\"b266-9\">Contended, that the decree of the County Court was interlocutory; since it only dissolved the injunction. That no appeal could have been taken until the decree was made final by a dismission of the bill; until this was done, the cause was still depending.</p><p id=\"b266-11\">Insisted, that this is a decree for <em>costs, </em>and, as to that, is final. But if not final, then the County Court erred in decreeing costs, and therefore the reversing decree is right either way.</p><p id=\"b266-12\">The Court affirmed the decree of the High Court of Chancery.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
