The District Court, in each case, decided that the lavrwas in favour of .the defendants in error,- and that the release of errors <em>mentioned in the special verdict </em>was good j and therefore <em>dismissed the supersedeas ; </em>from which judg\u00bf ments the plaintiffs in error appealed to this Court.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-11\">The case was first argued at <em>November </em>term, 1807.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>Williams, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3P\">One of the issues was neither tried by the Jury nor decided by the Judge. This leads to the inquiry whether, if a party means to rely on a <em>release </em>to a writ of error, it must not be pleaded. It may be said that this Court is not constituted like the Courts in <em>England; </em>but I understand the law constituting this Court gives the Judges power to try all questions growing out of appeals. As it has, therefore, all the powers of the Courts of Error in England, it should follow the practice of those Courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-4\">The case of <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Mortagh</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>shews that the practice there is to <em>plead </em>the release. In that case it is worthy of observation that the question was, whether, in such plea, it was necessary to lay a <em>venue, </em>and it was decided to be necessary. It was also decided that, although the plea was found against the defendant in error, the Court would inspect the record, and, if there was no error, would affirm the judgment. The same doctrine that a plea is necessary, is laid down in <em>London v. Pickering, </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>quoted, 2 <em>Bac. Abr. Gwil. Ed. 497. </em>title Error, letter L. in <em>Davenant </em>v. <em>Raftor; </em><footnotemark><em>(</em>c)</footnotemark> in <em>Edw. Altham\u2019s case; </em><footnotemark>(<em>d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and in <em>Street v. Hopkinson.</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aesx\">It seems, then, I have shewn that the party must <em>plead </em>the' release. It follows that the Jury ought to have answered to both the issues, and, not having done so, it is error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-6\">But, if the Court should think it unnecessary to have put the <em>second </em>release in issue, yet I contend that the first was void ; having been executed, not by the plaintiffs in error, but by their attorney at law. No principle is better settled than that an attorney cannot enter a <em>retraxit,</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which is the same with a <em>release.</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But, if the attorney was specially empowered to grant a release, he ought not to sign in his own name but that of his <em>principal. </em>In this case, it is true, the attorney was directed by one of his clients to do whatever was necessary to obtain the injunction: yet it was not necessary for the attorney to execute the release, because that might have been done by the. complainants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>themselves. If that authority extended to the making a release, it would comprehend the giving the injunction bond also ; for the one is as much a <em>pre-requisite </em>to obtaining the injunction as the other, According to 3 <em>Vin. </em>30. after judgment against an attorney\u2019s client, his power, under his original warrant of attorney, ceases: and even where the attorney gets a judgment for his client he cannot prosecute a <em>scire facias </em>against the bail without a new warrant.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-9\">Even admitting that the attorney had the power, the release being to a matter of <em>record, </em>ought to have been by <em>deed; </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>whereas here it was by- a writing without any seal, Aii indorsement on a bill in equity would not make it a matter of record, If it was a record, it should have been pleaded <em>as such : </em>but it is pleaded as any other release in <em>puis ; </em>and the party could not reply <em>nul tiel record. </em>If the Jury have found it <em>as a </em>record, they had no right to do so; for they could not find any thing not put in issue. If \u00a1they can, the object of pleading is at an end <em>; </em>and either party may be surprised by pleading one thing and giving another in evidence,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-10\"><em>Say, </em>for the appellees, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A33\">1. That the District Court ought to have dismissed the <em>supersedeas, </em>even if the pleadings and verdict had been amputated from the record j for the releases themselves were before the Court by means of the <em>certiorari, </em>which brought up all the papers. There, ought not to have been <em>any pleading: </em>for no instance could be shewn of a plea to a Writ of supersedeas before this ease. The form of proceecjing in a writ of error is es? sentially distinct from that on a supersedeas. The right course would have been, without any plea, to have <em>moved </em>the Court to dismiss the writ on the ground of the release^ of errors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-11\">2. That the release executed by the attorney was good, The rules in England concerning <em>attornies </em>do not apply to, <em>counsel </em>at law in this country, Th\u00e9 latter are a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>different race of people from the former. Attornies in <em>England </em>are watched with the greatest severity, and cannot stir without a <em>warrant: </em>but no warrant is ever given here to a lawyer to bring a suit, or file a plea: the power is always given verbally. It has also been decided here,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> that an attorney\u2019s power does not cease with the judgment, but that he may receive the money even ten years afterwards.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-4\">That an attorney may release errors is evident from this; that he may, for his client, confess a judgment, which confession is a release of errors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">The <em>custom of the country </em>is admitted to be binding;<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and that custom is for the attornies to execute releases of errors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">Many things decided in <em>England </em>are unreasonable and inconsistent. There, an attorney cannot enter a <em>retraxit </em>of the suit, but may a <em>remittitur </em>of the damages;<footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for which distinction no reason can be given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-7\">But, admitting that an attorney\u2019s power ceases with the judgment, as ending the suit in which he was employed, in dais case, <em>Boyd </em>was, <em>after the decision at </em>law, employed for the complainants to prosecute a suit in Chancery, and could not do it without executing the release. It was a power necessarily incidental 5 because, without it, he could not obtain the injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-8\">3. That it was not necessary for the release to be by <em>deed. </em>A case is mentioned in 5 <em>Bac. </em>682. before cited, in which a <em>deed </em>is not necessary to make a release effectual; for a verbal contract not broken may be released without deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-9\">Neither is a release by <em>record </em>necessary; for a mere <em>receipt </em>in <em>pais </em>may be pleaded in bar to a judgment.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> Yet here the release, if not a record, had, at least, the same authenticity; having been executed by the order of the Court, and in presence of the clerk, its officer. Besides, there may be an <em>implied </em>as well as an <em>express </em>release.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> Now, the very act of going into a Court of Equity is aninx<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>plied release of the errors at law; for the injunction is always granted on those terms and no other; the maxim being that he who wants equity must do equity, and release all technical objections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-8\">Judge Tucker. Suppose there should happen to be <em>several </em>parties, <em>one only </em>of whom should be willing to release the errors at law; and <em>he </em>applies to the Court of Equity in the name of them all: what is to be done then ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-9\"><em>Hay. </em>I am not prepared at present to answer the question; but, Isuppo.se, if the -other parties acquiesce, and suffer the suit to go on in their names, it is an <em>implied </em>release on <em>their part also.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-10\">4. It is unimportant whether the course taken by the counsel in the District Court was right or not, or whether-that Court decided <em>upon correct principles. </em>If, <em>upon the \u2022whole </em>record, they decided right, the judgment ought to be affirmed by this Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A1P\"><em>Hening-, </em>on the same side,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALAN\">in support of the first point, cited <em>Tidd's Practice, </em>c. 33.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> to shew that the releases of errors, with the bill and other proceedings thereupon, were matters of record, and were properly brought up to the District Court by the <em>certiorari. </em>They might, therefore, have been acted upon, by <em>inspection, </em>without pleading. The practice <em>A pleading </em>a release o.f errors in England does not apply <em>here, </em>because of the constitution of our Court of Appeals which has not the power of impanelling a Jury. Suppose a release of errors in the Superior Court of Chancery upon granting an injunction to a judgment of a District Court, and a <em>supersedeas </em>afterwards awarded by a judge of the Court of Appeals. Can the parties make up an issue on the plea of a release, and try it by a Jury in this Court? or has this Court-the power by law.of sending it to be tried in any other? Not an instance of such a practice can be adduced. If then, this Court could not take notice of the release by <em>inspecting </em>the record and deciding without a Jury, the .rule of the Court of Chancery directing are-lease of errors would be a mere nullity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The practice of the Courts of <em>England </em>in proceedings in error is totally different from ours. In one of the best books in the law, <em>Saunders\u2019s </em>Reports, edited by <em>Williams, </em>the whole doctrine relating to writs of error may be found, digested with all the perspicuity for which that able editor is so very remarkable.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> There it is said that a writ of error is grantable <em>ex debito justitice ;</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and is considered a <em>nsvj </em>action <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the manner of allowing it is merely <em>by </em>a certificate of the <em>clerk of errors </em>that he has allowed it ;<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> and that it may be sued out <em>before </em>final judgment :<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> whereas, here, a <em>supersedeas </em>cannot be awarded except hy the Court or Judge, nor until <em>after </em>final judgment. <em>Here </em>errors are assigned in the petition for the <em>supersedeas; there, </em>after the allowance of the writ of error. This introduces the system of pleading in error, into the Courts of <em>England, </em>which system is unknown here. There are material differences, in other respects, which will appear on a farther comparison.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-4\">The pleadings in this case were unnecessary, and may be considered as an informal inquiry concerning a matter of fact which the Court already possessed, and upon which they ought to have given the same judgment before, as <em>after </em>the finding of the Jury. The Court might, <em>ex oficio, </em>'award a <em>certiorari, </em>in order to support the judgment.<footnotemark>(\u0192)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">It may be objected, that the defendants in error having <em>pleaded the </em>release, and issue being taken, they shall be bound by the proceedings, and not take advantage of their own wrong. But they ask no advantage from the verdict, and only wish this Court to give such judgment as ought to have been given by the District Court, even if the releases had not been pleaded. In truth, the whole pleadings were irregular, and no issue Was joined in the cause* After the releases had been pleaded, the plaintiffs in error ought to have replied, and tendered an issue to the country. Instead of that, the entry is, \u201c which pleas -the said <em>Lee, </em>&amp;c. \u201c joinand this is no joining of issue.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In addition to what had been said on the other points. he quoted <em>Tidd\u2019s Practice, 63. </em>to shew that, even in <em>England, </em>the power of an attorney continues twelve months after judgment. In <em>Latuch </em>v. Pasherante,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the attorney\u2019s consent was held to bind the client, though contrary to the express orders of the latter. The attorney may remit damages ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and payment to the attorney is payment to the principal. <footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A3Z\"><em>Call, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxiI\">insisted, that the <em>certiorari </em>could not bring up the <em>Chancery </em>papers, because they were no part of the record <em>at law; </em>that therefore those papers could not' properly be taken notice of by the District Court, except \u25a0when pleaded. The true principle is, that a release, or <em>any other matter, dehors the record, </em>must be <em>pleaded. </em>The case of <em>Street </em>v. Hopkinson<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> shews that the statute of limitations, against a writ of error, must be <em>pleaded; </em>even though the length of time appears in the record itself; in order that the other party may have the opportunity of replying, and shewing that the plea was barred by infancy, coverture, or any of the other exceptions mentioned in the .act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-16\">It appears', therefore, that any fact which may be put in issue, ought to be pleaded. As to a release, whether <em>executed </em>or not, whether by <em>duress </em>or not, are points which ought to be tried. In some cases, indeed, where the release is entered in the same cause, and at the same term with the judgment, and properly forms a part' of the record, it is not necessary to plead it; but wherever it is <em>extraneous, </em>it must be pleaded. The <em>clerk's </em>certificate is nothing to the purpose; for, if he certifies a deed or other paper not in die record, <em>he </em>must be examined like other men. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is of no effect to have a paper' brought up which is not in the record. This can be done only'by a .writ of <em>subpoena duces tecum. </em>To a sheriff\u2019s bond, taken <em>in Court, non est factum </em>cannot be pleaded r Hoy to an injunction bond taken in Court; though in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>cases <em>mil tiel record </em>may. But, if an injunction bond be taken in the clerk\u2019s office, the clerk\u2019s certificate is not conclusive ; but <em>non est factum </em>is pleadable. So, here, the release was not entered in the minute-book, and ought therefore to be pleaded. If you throw the pleadings in this case out of the question, there is no proof of the release \u2014 of <em>Boyd\u2019s </em>authority to execute it \u2014 -nor of any other circumstance relative to it. The consequences would be monstrous, if a paper, merely <em>found </em>in the clerk\u2019s office, without proof of its authenticity, is to be taken as a release of errors; for the other party might have thrown it in.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-4\">A plea being necessary, <em>that </em>which was filed in this case was <em>bad, </em>in not pleading the release, either as a <em>record </em>or a <em>deed. </em>Every plea must state the thing as it is, that the other party m,?y reply to it, and plead <em>mil tiel record, </em>or <em>non est faction. </em>You must plead it so-that issue may be taken. In this plea, there was no <em>profert </em>of the release. The <em>English </em>authorities are <em>all, </em>that it should be pleaded as a <em>deed. </em>Such arc the <em>forms </em>of pleading; <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Which forms are evidences of the law. The plea, too, does not state a release of errors <em>in the judgment, </em>but of all errors <em>previous to the judgment. According to the plea, </em>therefore, if all the other improper proceedings were released, the error existing in the opinion of the Court was not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">The verdict does not cure the defects in the plea; because the verdict is itself insufficient. It does not state <em>\u25a0why </em>the attorney could not get an injunction without executing the release; it ought to have stated, that the Court would not otherwise grant the injunction. It finds <em>evidence </em>of facts, and not the <em>facts themselves; </em>for it does not state whether the injunction was granted or not, leaving this important circumstance to <em>inference </em>only. It may be said, that the <em>record </em>shews the necessity of the release* Take us out of the verdict, and I deny the fact; for the record only speaks of <em>giving bond and security </em>as a requisite to obtaining the injunction, not of <em>signing a release of errors. </em>How, a bad verdict will not help bad pleadings.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Neither does the omission to demur to the pica cure the defect. It is true that, according to <em>Baird and Co. </em>v. <em>Mattox,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the declaration is good and the plea bad, but of such nature that the <em>merits </em>may be investigated, the verdict cures the defect, and the plaintiff shall have judgment; but the case is otherwise, if the <em>declaration </em>be \u25a0bad, as well as the plea.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> So here, the original record being full of error, the omission to demur to the insufficient plea does not prevent the taking advantage of it; because the defendant would be driven (even if the plea was not set aside) back to his defective record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-11\">As to the power of the attorney to release, there is no case to shew that an attorney <em>at lato </em>has such a power. <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Alexander</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is an authority to the contrary. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The difference between the characters of <em>attornies </em>in <em>England, </em>and <em>counsel in </em>this country, is unimportant: the question as to both is to be considered according to the portion of power <em>derived from, their clients. </em>Now, the authority of counsel, received from their clients, relates only to the conduct of a suit, not to <em>collateral </em>acts, or acts in <em>pais. </em>These must be done by attornies <em>in fact.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-12\">It is true that an attorney at law may release a surplus of <em>damages; </em>but this is because he has no power <em>given him </em>to demand more than the damages mentioned in the writ. In that case, too, there is a <em>necessity </em>for the <em>attorney </em>to execute the release, to prevent error in the judgment. But <em>no necessity </em>existed for the attorney\u2019s executing <em>this re</em>lease, since his client might have done it afterwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-13\">The attorney.in this case, if he could have executed the-release, should have done it in the <em>name of his </em>client, and on his behalf; not in-Ais <em>own name; </em>the case being similar to that of <em>a partner </em>binding the <em>company; </em>as in <em>Shelton </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Pollock and Co.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Besides, could <em>Boyd </em>release for the <em>tvives, </em>even if he could for the <em>husbands ? </em>A <em>husband </em>cannot release an erroneous judgment against the <em>wife, </em>because <em>her body </em>may be taken to satisfy it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-4\">The same objection applies to the other release also, which was executed by the <em>husbands, </em>and cannot bind the <em>wives. That release, </em>too, is only to the judgments on the <em>forthcoming </em>bonds, not to the <em>original </em>judgments.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-10\"><em>Hay, </em>to the last mentioned objection,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6B\">said, that the appellants ought not to be permitted to take advantage of it; for it was <em>their </em>duty to have complied with the order o\u00ed the Court of Chancery, and executed the release correctly; and it was not in the power of the plaintiffs at law to have seen that it was done right. They therefore cannot avail themselves of their own error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-11\">This Court has shewn great liberality in discountenancing <em>nice </em>objections to forthcoming bonds, and ought to follow a similar course in cases of this sort.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-12\">\n<em>Curia advisare vult.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-13\">At <em>March </em>Term, 1808, another argument took place, (in pursuance of the Court\u2019s request,) on the single point, whether it is <em>necessary </em>to <em>plead </em>a release of errors to a Writ of SUPERSEDEAS.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-15\"><em>Williams, </em>in support of the affirmative side of this proposition, said, that there could be no question, from the authorities cited at the last argument, but that, upon a writ or error, the release must be pleaded. He then contended, that the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>was the same in its nature with the writ of <em>error. </em>The Legislature, in the year 1753, appears to have considered them so,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and directed precisely the same proceedings upon both. The same reasons of convenience and policy require the <em>pleading, </em>in opposition to a <em>supersedeas, </em>of any thing <em>extraneous to the record, </em>as in opposition to a <em>writ </em>of <em>error. </em>At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>last term it was contended, that this Court could not have a Jury impanelled; but that was begging the question; for, if the District Court can do it, this Court can, the mode of proceeding being th\u00e9 same in both Courts.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-10\">The Court of Appeals is to^give the judgment which the inferior Co\u00fcrt ought to have given.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Now, if the release is not to be <em>pleaded, </em>it must be excluded altogether, except in cases where it forms a part of the judgment; because this Court must act on the same record on which the inferior Court acted, whenever it either <em>affirms </em>or <em>reverses. </em>But the judgment, in case of a <em>release, </em>is \u00e1 different one; not that the judgment of the Court below be <em>affirmed, </em>or <em>reversed; </em>but that the writ of error b\u00e9 <em>dismissed, </em>or the <em>Supersedeas </em>quashed.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-11\">\n<em>Hay, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9Z\">The great object of the law is to facilitate the administration of justice: yet, unfortunately, most questions before this Court relate not to the <em>merits, </em>but to the <em>form </em>of the proceedings. My clients will be deprived of a just debt, if this point be decided against them. I hope, therefore, the Court will, if possible, in this case, reconcile the principles of justice with the forms of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-12\">In <em>England, </em>the <em>writ of error </em>serves only as process to bring up the record. The proceedings, afterwards, are somewhat complicated and troublesome. There is, first, a <em>scire facias ad audiendum errores; </em>and then a plea is required, which may either be <em>in nullo est </em>erratum, or a <em>release of errors. </em>But there is no instance of a plea to a writ of <em>supersedeas, </em>in <em>England. </em>The practice is uniform there, that to a <em>writ of error </em>there is pleading, but not to \u00e1 <em>supersede\u00e1S.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-13\">On what grounds does Mr. <em>Williams </em>say, that the writs of <em>error </em>and of <em>supersedeas </em>are the same ? A <em>supersedeas, </em>in <em>England, </em>is not to bring Up the record, but only to stay proceedings. Why did our Legislature give both the remedies, if they were the same ? Their object was to give the <em>supersedeas </em>the same effect as to <em>bringing up the </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>cord, </em>that a <em>writ of error </em>had, and thereby to simplify the proceedings, by furnishing a process more convenient in its form, and to which no pleadings were requisite. There is no instance, in this country, before the present, of a <em>plea </em>to a <em>supersedeas. </em>This proves the manner in which the iaw has been understood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">In the case of an <em>appeal, </em>where the sum in controversy is not within the jurisdiction of the <em>Court, </em>is die party <em>to plead </em>to the jurisdiction ? Or, in the case of a <em>supersedeas </em>issuing after the time allowed for if has elapsed, is the act of limitations to be pleaded? No: in both cases the errors are rectified by <em>dismissions on motion. </em>Why should not the same course, without a plea, have been pursued in thin case ? If such a motion had been made, the Court would have dismissed the <em>supersedeas </em>without a Jury. Yet it is said, that, because there was no motion, but <em>pleas </em>were filed, the Court could not decide on <em>them </em>without a jury! Wherever the Court is authorised to decide on a motion, it is authorised to decide every question of fact incidental <em>to </em>it; and <em>the putting such </em>question in issue by a <em>plea </em>makes no difference. In the case of a motion on a forthcoming bond, where <em>payment </em>is alleged, or against a sheriff and his securities, where <em>non est factum </em>is alleged, it is done <em>ore terms, </em>and the truth of such allegations is tried by the Court itself. In <em>Asberry v. Calloway,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a formal plea was putin; yet the Court decided without a Jury, and its deciding in that manner was not considered as error by die Court of Appeals j but the judgment was reversed on other grounds. Would this Court summon a Jury, if a release were^pleaded here to an <em>appeal? </em>Would jt not undertake to decide the fact?</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-8\">A trial by Jury is <em>frequently </em>not the best way of ascertaining a matter of fact. The truth of this position is strikingly exemplified in the Courts of Chancery, which decide without a Jury, and generally correctly. This very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>case shews the inconvenience of referring some questions to <em>Juries, </em>since the Jury toolc notice of only half of the plea; yet the Court finally did right in dismissing the <em>supersedeas, </em>because (exclusively of the verdict) the whole matter was before them, and they were satisfied that both, judgments were intended to be released. A great advantage attends the practice of dismissing <em>on motion, only, </em>viz. that, if such dismission be obtained improperly, the Court may set it aside, <em>on motion piso.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-9\"><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaFc\">There can be no reason for a plea in the case of a <em>writ of </em>error, that does not apply with equal force to a <em>supersedeas. </em>The two writs are, in <em>form, </em>the same, or nearly so. The writ of <em>error </em>commands the record to be certified into the superior Court; and the next step is a <em>scire facias to </em>hear errors. The writ of <em>superse~ deas </em>combines both together; commands the sheriff to supersede the judgment,, and to give the defendant notice <em>to </em>hear errors. The analogy is perfect; the only difference being, that, in one case, there are two writs; in the other, only one. The object is the same, the effect the same; for if error, <em>not assigned, </em>be discovered .in. the record, the. Court may reverse in both cases.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-10\">Judge Roane. Suppose the judgment to be erroneous in matter of <em>fact.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-11\"><em>Call. </em>The remedy is by writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>not by <em>supersedeas; </em>and this seems to be the only reason for retaining the <em>writ of error </em>in our statute book; its object being sufficiently answered, in every other instance, by the <em>supersedeas. </em>In a supersedeas, the <em>petition </em>assigns the errors : on a <em>writ of error, </em>errors are. filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-12\">The object being the same, the defence ought to be the same. The argument that you cannot have a <em>Jury </em>hepe, goes as far to the destruction of the <em>writ of error </em>as of the <em>supersedeas. </em>Yet you certainly have the power to issue a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>writ of error. Bates </em>v. <em>Gordon</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was a writ of error; and <em>that, </em>when the Court of Appeals consisted of all the judges, was the usual mode of proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-4\">The party has a right, by the Constitution, to a trial by Jury, whether it lie the best way of ascertaining truth, or not. All pleas tendering an issue in <em>fact </em>must conclude to the country.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> There are two distinct kinds of pleas to every writ of error or <em>supersedeas; </em>either of matters o\u00ed <em>law, or </em>of <em>fact. </em>Where it is a inciter of <em>law, </em>(as \u201c <em>no </em>error,\u201d) the <em>Court </em>is to decide ; where matter of <em>fact, </em>(such as <em>infancy, coverture, </em>the act of <em>limitations, </em>a <em>release, </em>See.) die <em>jury </em>are to deckle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">A <em>tnol/uu </em>to quash the <em>writ of error, </em>or <em>supersedeas, </em>cannot c-e made on <em>either of those grounds; </em>there being only one solitary instance where the Court may quash <em>upon motion: </em>that is, for the want of jurisdiction; the case having been <em>coram nonjudice </em>from the beginning; but, <em>there,, the </em>objection appears in the record itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">As to the case of a forthcoming bond, I think Mr. <em>Hay </em>is <em>wrong; </em>but it is not necessary to argue it; for, whether he is right or wrong, there is no analogy between the cases. A forthcoming bond is a mere easement to the defendant, who has already had the advantage of a trial at law. By giving such bond, he voluntarily waives his constitutional right of trial by Jury. No injustice, therefore, is done him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">If this Court cannot summon a Jury, the cause ought to be remitted to the District Court to try the fact, as the House of Lords does to the iCing\u2019s Bench.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-8\">It is said that, in <em>England, </em>there are no pleadings to a <em>supersedeas. </em>Agreed: but the reason is plain: <em>that writ, </em>there, is only <em>auxiliary, </em>and directed to the <em>sheriff', </em>not to the <em>party. </em>The plea, therefore, is always put in to the <em>scire facias </em>to hear errors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-9\">Another argument is conclusive, that pleadings in this case were necessary. Every remedy created by a <em>statute </em>ought to be assimilated to the <em>common law </em>rules of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ceeding, as nearly as possible. The proceedings on <em>our </em>wr^ <em>supersedeas </em>ought, therefore, to be the same with those on a writ of error, as the statute does not point ihem out.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"><em> </em>2 <em>Ld.

P. </em>Buchanan, and <em>Edward </em>Gaunt, being the husbands of the females aforesaid, (who were not before named,) of all errors in the judgment On a delivery bond,faken upon an execution sued out on the first judgment* The record then proceeds, 44 <em>which pleas the said Theodo </em>\" <em>rick, &amp;c. join, </em>and the same is continued,\u201d &amp;c. on which day came a Jury, who, being sworn to try the issues, returned a special verdict as to the first; but took no notice of the second. The Court gave judgment in favour of the defendants in error, <em>Wilson </em>arid <em>Dunlap; </em>from which judgment the plaintiffs in error appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">In the argument of this case a question arose whether a defendant iri error can be admitted to plead a release of errors to a writ of <em>supersedeas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The tenor of the writ of <em>supersedeas, </em>.independent of authorities, would .seem to settle this question. The sheriff is commanded fa supersede from his execution because the Judgment for <em>cause of error </em>is removed before the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Court <em>to be corrected. </em>And he is further commanded to give the defendants notice to be before that Court to have a rehearing. This operates, in fact, as a writ of error granted by a single Judge out of Court; as is well explained in 1 <em>Wash. </em>117, 118. <em>White </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>and 2 <em>Wash. </em>162, 163. <em>Lee v. Turberville. </em>That a release of errors may be pleaded to a writ of error, and that it ought to be so pleaded, as that the plaintiff may take issue upon it, is clearly-proved by the books.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> And the rule is, that if, in error, a release is pleaded, and found for the plaintiff in error, yet if there is no error, the Court cannot reverse the judgment : and, if the release be found for the defendant, a different judgment must be given, according as the error assigned is sufficient or not; for, if it is a good error, the judgment must be that the plaintiff be <em>barred </em>of his writ of error, and not that the first judgment be a\u00edfirmed.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> I therefore conclude that a release of errors may be pleaded to a writ of <em>supersedeas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">As to the substance of these picas I shall say nothing at present. The plaintiffs might have demurred to them, if they thought them defective in either form or substance. But the record tells us <em>they joined. </em>This is precisely like the case of <em>Stevens v. Taliaferro,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the pleas in which concluded, as these pleas do, with a verification; and then the record stated, \u201c <em>and thereupon issue was joined by the parties.'\u2019\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet, this Court held there was in fact <em>no issue joined; </em>and affirmed the judgment of the District Court which had for that cause awarded a repleader. In that case the Court field the plea to be good, and therefore awarded a repleader only back to the plea. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Walker</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the declaration being bad, this Court did not award a repleader. In the present case, without deciding upon the <em>substance </em>of either plea, I am inclined to think both <em>defective </em>in point <em>ofform. </em>This might have been .brought regularly before the Court by a <em>demurrer; </em>but, as the parties have chosen to contest the <em>fact </em>of the releases pleaded, rather than the <em>law </em>with respect to them, I think we ought to award the rcpleader, its far back as to the supersedeas.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>If, however, the Court should think that no repleader ought to be awarded, I still shall be of opinion that there ought to be a new trial. The Juiy have found nothing as to the second plea <em>\u2018, </em>and, whether that plea be material or not, we can do no more than set aside the verdict for this omission. The case of <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Simms,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>clearly shews that where any issue in fact remains <em>to be </em>ti-ied, or otherwise disposed of, the Court will remand the cause for such further proceedings as the parties may be advised to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Upon these grounds, I am of opinion that the judgment be reversed; the verdict and pleadings, including the pleas, set aside, and the cause remanded to the District Court, and a repleader be awarded there, if the parties should think proper to plead <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b302-10\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"A5C\">The <em>supersedeas </em>obtained m this case, is on the ground of errors <em>in point of law </em>existing upon the face of the record. It does not therefore involve the question whether a <em>supersedeas </em>will lie for errors in point of fact existing at the time of the judgment; such as <em>nonage, death of the plaintiffs, &amp;c. </em>Whenever that point, which has never been decided in this Court, shall occur, it will be important to consider whether the jurisdiction of the Court in granting <em>supersedeases </em>is not limited by the criterion established by the certificates of counsel in such <em>cases; </em>namely, to errors apparent on the face of the record only. On this point I now give no decided opinion; but it is evident that if <em>such </em>be deemed the true construction upon this subject, no injury is done to parties, for they may still proceed, in the other case by way of writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">It is said that in this case, the release should not be pleaded, but that the Court should quash the <em>supersedeas </em>as having improvidently issued. In those cases where this has been done, in this Court, it plainly appeared <em>on the face of the judgment or proceedings </em>themselves that the writ ought never to have issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>In the case of <em>Gaskins </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for instance, by reference to the judgment, and the general rule of limitation, it plainly appeared that the <em>supersedeas </em>was barred by time, and consequently ought not to have issued; and in <em>Burwell </em>v. Anderson<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> it was evident from the <em>record </em>itself, that there existed no judgment in that case to justify the <em>supersedeas: </em>but, in the case before us, while the record exhibited to the Judge seems to teem with error upon the face of it, it only appeared- <em>subsequently, </em>upon pleading the release, or, at most, upon the coming in o\u00ed the new record upon the <em>certiorari, </em>which (perhaps irregularly, as it properly appertained to the <em>Chancery </em>side of the proceedings) introduced the injunctions which had been obtained and the releases of errors granted thereupon, that the <em>supersedeas </em>was thereby <em>probably </em>barred: but ought this Court now to say, that the Judge of the District Court, t aking the existence and the validity of the releases for granted, when they were neither exhibited nor pleaded, ought not to have granted <em>the, supersedeas, </em>and that it ought now to be quashed as having improvidently issued ?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">I will now cite tiro cases which were not mentioned in the argument, and which seem to answer perhaps all the other objections taken in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The ease of <em>Gomez Serra </em>v. <em>Munez</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was a writ of error depending in the <em>Exchequer Chamber, </em>a Court of Error, like this, having no original jurisdiction, and consisting, I believe, of all the Judges.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> The defendant in error moved the Court of Chancery for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the writ of error, on affidavit that he had a <em>release of errors </em>which he could have no benefit of in the Exchequer Chamber <em>for want of power in that Court to try the release. </em>It was answered by the counsel for the plaintiff in error that it was a vulgar error to imagine that <em>they </em>(the Exchequer Chamber) could not try it, for that the <em>stat. 27 Eliz. </em>8. had given them power \u201c to examine all errors, and therefore to \u201c reverse or affirm as the law shall require,\u201d and that it was the highest'absurdity to imagine a Court to be so constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>as to be obliged to reverse a judgment for an error which the party (having given a release) has no right to assign: that besides, the notion that they cannot by a release, proceeds from confounding the case of a release of errors, with that of <em>assigning errors in </em>fact, and concluding from thence that he cannot plead a release, &amp;c. And <em>per </em>King, Chancellor. \u201c I think it a great absurdity to imagine that the \u201c Court which is to hold plea on a writ of error, should \u201c not have power to do justice by giving the party the \u201c benefit of his release s I think they may try the re- &lt;\u00a3 lease and award a <em>venire </em>under the seal of the Court <em>of </em>\u00a3t Exchequer, and if they may, I see no reason why I &lt;c should deprive the party of the benefit of the trial by Jury by inquiring into the validity of the release upon a mo- &lt;\u00a3 tion to supersede the writ. I will make no order in the <em>a </em>case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">This case goes beyond the one at bar s it even extends to the case of a <em>supersedeas </em>taken to <em>this </em>Court: but the case before us is to be considered merely in relation to the proceedings by the District Court, which can be under no difficulty in impanelling a Jury to try the validity of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In the case just cited, however, the release pleaded was a <em>mere private one: </em>but in 3 <em>Atk. </em>297.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> it appears that on a writ of error to the Exchequer Chamber, a release precisely similar to the one before us (namely, a release granted in obtaining an injunction) was pleaded. These two cases therefore seem in all points, to come up to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">As to the pleas in the present case, the record does not shew that any issue was joined thereupon; nor, if so, whether it was an issue in law or in fact: it merely says that they <em>'\u25a0'\u2022joined such pleas A </em>This I infer to have been no issue, upon die authority of <em>Stevens </em>v. Taliaferro, <em>adm'r of Thornton;</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nor has the verdict of the Jury answered to the second plea. I am therefore of opinion that a repleader ought to be awarded 5 and as both pleas are probably de\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>fective in point of form, and the first is also defective in point <em>of </em>substance, in not averring that the release signed by <em>Elisha Boyd, </em>the attorney, was for the purpose of obtaining an injunction, I think the repleader ought to go up to the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>itself.</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-4\">Judge Fleming concurring, the judgment was re versed <em>; </em>ail the proceedings back to the <em>supersedeas </em>set aside ; and a repleader awarded.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\"><em> </em>2 <em>Lord Raym. </em>10<em>05. </em>1046. 1052. 2 <em>Salt. </em>253. 2 <em>Strange, </em>1215. <em>Ca. temp.
