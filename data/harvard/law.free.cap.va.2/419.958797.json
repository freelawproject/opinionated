Fowler, William Miller, </em>and three others, for the sum of 14,840 dollars, the penalty of a bond executed by them to <em>Wilson Cary Nicholas, </em>governor of the <em>Commonwealth, </em>to be discharged by the payment of 7420 dollars. On this judgment an execution of <em>fieri facias </em>was issued in July 1817, which was never returned; and in November 1818, a <em>ca. sa. </em>was issued, upon which <em>Miller </em>was taken in execution, and delivered to the sheriff fifteen slaves, in discharge of his body from custody ; and then with <em>James B. Ferguson </em>as his surety, executed a bond to the officer, for the forthcoming and delivery of the slaves on the day of sale. This bond was forfeited; and in July 1819, a judgment was obtained thereon against <em>Miller </em>and <em>Ferguson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-8\"><em>Miller </em>and <em>Ferguson </em>proceeded to make payment upon the judgme5t~against them, until 1829, when an execution was issued for the balance remaining unpaid, against their lands and goods, and was levied upon the lands of <em>Ferguson, </em>which were sold, and the money made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-9\">The judgment of the <em>Commonwealth </em>having been satisfied by the sale of <em>Ferguson\u2019s </em>land, he, in 1833, filed his bill in the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery for <em>Goochland </em>county, against <em>Jacob B. Fowler </em>and <em>Josiah Leake, </em>in which, after stating the above facts, he charged that <em>Fowler </em>was the principal in the bond on which the original judgment in favour of the <em>Commonwealth </em>was obtained, and that <em>Millet' </em>was his surety; that at the time that judgment was rendered <em>Fowler </em>owned a tract of land in the county of <em>Gooch</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>land, upon which said judgment was a <em>lien; </em>and that this land had since come into the possession, and was then owned by <em>Josiah Leake. </em>He therefore asked that he might be substituted to the rights of the <em>Commonwealth </em>against said land, and that it might be subjected to satisfy him for the amount he had paid in discharge of the <em>Commonwealth\u2019s </em>judgment, pv</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-4\"><em>Fowler </em>had removed from the <em>Contmonioeallh, </em>and in the progress of the cause his death was suggested, and his heirs not being known, the suit was revived against them generally, and they were proceeded against as absent defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-5\"><em>Leake </em>answered the bill, and called for proof of the facts alleged therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">It appeared upon the proofs, that <em>Fowler </em>did own a tract of laud in the county of <em>Goochland </em>at the date of the original judgment; that in September 1817, he conveyed that land to <em>Ferguson </em>and <em>Leake, </em>in trust to indemnify a certain <em>John M. Smith </em>as his surety; that in September 1818, the trustees sold the land under the trust deed, when <em>Smith </em>became the purchaser; and that in the fall of 1819, this land had come into the possession, and was still owned by <em>Leake. </em>The cause seems to have proceeded in the Court below upon the tacit admission that <em>Fowler </em>was the principal, and <em>Miller </em>a surety in the bond to the governor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">In April 1838, the cause came on to be heard, when the Court made a decree subjecting the land in the possession of the defendant <em>Leake </em>to the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim; and appointing commissioners to sell it; and also directing a commissioner of the Court to take an account of the rents and profits, or annual value of the land from the first of January 1820.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">From this decree <em>T^eake </em>applied for and obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-9\"><em>Stanard, </em>and <em>C. &amp;. G. N. Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-10\">It does not appear in this record, that <em>Miller </em>was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>surety of <em>Fowler. </em>He is a co-obligor in the bond; and in the absence of proof, must be presumed to have been a principal. The plaintiff\u2019s claim to substitution, is, therefore, without any foundation, and on this ground must fail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-9\">But assuming that <em>Miller </em>was the surety of <em>Fowler, </em>the question arises, whether the <em>Commonwealth </em>had a lien upon the land in the possession of <em>Leake; </em>and if there was such a lien, whether <em>Ferguson </em>can be substituted to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-10\">We contend first: That the levy of the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon <em>Miller, </em>or the execution of the forthcoming bond by him, was, either of them, a discharge of the lien of the judgment. This Court has repeatedly decided that the levy of a <em>ca. sa. </em>is a discharge of the judgment lien. <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>2 Leigh 425; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>4 Leigh <em>425; Stuart </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>8 Leigh 503. The taking the body in execution is at common law a satisfaction of the judgment, not <em>pro tempore </em>or <em>pro tanto, </em>but forever. Even if a debtor is taken on a <em>ca. sa. </em>and takes the benefit of the insolvent debtors\u2019 act, the creditor is not remitted to his remedy upon the lien of the judgment, but must rely upon the lien of his <em>ca. sa. Rogers </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra; Foreman </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>2 Leigh 284.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-12\">It will not be denied, that as to <em>Miller </em>the lien of the <em>Commonwealth's </em>judgment was <em>lost by the </em>service of the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon him; but it will be contended, that though the lien was lost as against <em>Miller's </em>land, it still existed against the lands of <em>Fowler. </em>Can this be law?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-13\">The judgment being joint, the execution which issues upon it must be joint. In this case the execution which was levied on <em>Miller </em>was a joint execution. Any other execution issued on the judgment must have been joint. Another <em>ca. sa. </em>might have been issued, and served upon the other joint debtors, until they were all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>taken into custody: but as the law does not allow both the body and lands of a debtor to be taken, no execution could have gone out against the lands of <em>Miller; </em>and, therefore, none could have been issued against the lands of the other joint debtors. But the lien of the judgment arises from the capacity to sue out an <em>elegit </em>upon it; and when that can no longer be done, the lien of the judgment must of necessity be extinguished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-4\">Again, there never has been a time since the levy of the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon Miller, that the <em>Commonwealth </em>could have sued out an execution upon her judgment against <em>Fowler. </em>The <em>ca. sa. </em>levied upon <em>Miller </em>has been efficient to make the money. When, then, <em>Ferguson </em>executed the forthcoming bond as the surety of <em>Miller, </em>the lien of the <em>CommmwealtKs </em>judgment had already terminated; and there was, therefore, no lien existing at any time after he became bound for the debt to which he might be substituted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-5\">The same consequence results from the execution of the forthcoming bond. This has been held to be a satisfaction of the judgment. <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>1 Rob. B. 545. From the time of the execution of the bond, the <em>Commonwealth </em>had no right to issue execution upon her judgment. There was, therefore, no existing lien to which <em>Ferguson </em>might bo substituted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-7\">But if it was competent to the <em>Commonwealth </em>to have resorted to her judgment lien against <em>Fowler, </em>upon her failure to make her money by the <em>ca. sa. </em>executed upon <em>Miller, </em>or the forthcoming bond executed by him, is <em>Ferguson </em>entitled to be substituted to her rights in this regard, against a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value ? <em>Ferguson </em>was not the surety of <em>Fowler. </em>He was not originally bound for the debt; nor did he become bound for it at the instance of <em>Fowler.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-8\">The doctrine of subrogation is a creature of equity, not of contract. If one man pays the debt of another, at his request, or as his surety, it is a plain dictate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>equity that he should he indemnified; and that he should be substituted to the remedies of the creditor. But a volunteer paying, not by agreement with the qav:[ng n0 privity with him, has no legal remedy to recover what he has so paid, and, therefore, can have no claim in equity to be substituted to the remedies of the creditor. We challenge the production of a case where a volunteer has been substituted to the remedies of the creditor against his debtor. All the cases in which this doctrine has been enforced, will be found to be cases in which the person paying the debt, was bound for, or paid it, as the surety of the original debtor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUy\">We insist, then, that <em>Ferguson </em>is not entitled to the benefit of the <em>Commonwealth\u2019s </em>lien on <em>Fowler\u2019s </em>lands, either as standing in <em>Miller\u2019s </em>shoes, because <em>Miller </em>not having paid the debt has no such right, or for having paid the debt himself, because as to Fowler, and those claiming under him, he was a mere volunteer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\">If the lien of the <em>Commonwealth\u2019s </em>judgment was in existence, and <em>Ferguson </em>was entitled to be substituted to it, he was only entitled to have half the land sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APA\">The act 2 Rev. Code, ch. 189, \u00a7 8, p. 51, only applies to certain specified debtors of the <em>Commonwealth; </em>and <em>Fowler </em>is not one of them. The lien of the judgment must, therefore, be controlled by the general law on the subject; and that law restricts the lien to one half the land. This is clearly the case, unless the enquiry suggested from the bench be well founded, viz: Whether the <em>Commonwealth </em>does not stand in the place of the <em>Crown </em>in England, and is not entitled here as the <em>Crown </em>is in <em>England </em>to a lien upon all the debtor\u2019s lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-9\">The law in <em>England </em>is thus stated: <em>\u201c </em>If any one is accountant to the King, or if any money or goods, or chattels personal of the King, come to the hands of any subject by matter of record, or by matter <em>in fait, </em>the land of such subject is charged therewith, and liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to the seizure of the <em>King, </em>into whatsoever hands it come afterwards.\u201d The case of the <em>Mines, </em>Piowd. 321 ; Coke\u2019s 2d Inst. 19; Seyntloo'sCase, Dyer 224b.; Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 268.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-4\">This right of the <em>King </em>extends not only to judgments, recognizances, or debts ascertained by a Court of Record, hut to all debts ascertained by regular and official evidence, or the return of a sworn officer, or the party\u2019s own account rendered: and the lien commences from the time when the debt first becomes due. Bacon\u2019s Abr. title Ex\u2019on, letter K., and the cases before cited. The process by which the lien is enforced is a writ of <em>ex-tendi facias: </em>and the form of the writ is peculiar. Tidd\u2019s Prac. 943-44; Coke\u2019s 2d Inst. 19. This preference and lien of the <em>Crown </em>is a guide in the administration of assets. 2 Wms. on Ex\u2019ors 652-53. The lien is moreover strictly a branch of the royal prerogative ; Hobart\u2019s R. 60; Bac. Abr. <em>supra ; </em>Dyer &amp;. Plowden, <em>supra ; </em>and the <em>King </em>is in the habit of remitting it at pleasure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-5\">This doctrine cannot be law in <em>Virginia. </em>The <em>Commonwealth </em>has never attempted to enforce such a lien against her debtors. We have no writ of <em>extendi facias. </em>The <em>Commonwealth </em>has no preference in the administration of assets. <em>Nimmo </em>v. <em>The Commomoealth, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 57; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>1 Bibb\u2019s R. 520. The royal prerogative has been expressly abolished in Virginia; and no instance can be given in which the government exercises any power by virtue of having succeeded without the authority of some statute, to any royal prerogative. We conclude, therefore, that the doctrine is not law in <em>Virginia.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-6\">The plaintiff below was not entitled to an account of rents and profits. This is too well settled to be argued.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-12\"><em>Lyons </em>and <em>Grattan, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOV3\">The question whether <em>Miller </em>was the surety of <em>Fowler, </em>is for the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>time, made in this Court. In the Court below, the fact was not disputed; and if proof had been required, might have been readily furnished. The bill charges the fact, and the answer does not deny it; but speaking of the \u00bfgpj as <em>Fowler's, </em>calls for proof of it. But whatever <em>Miller </em>was, <em>Ferguson </em>was certainly a surety, and has paid a debt for which <em>Fowler </em>was bound to the <em>Commonwealth </em>to the whole amount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-4\">It is contended by the counsel for the appellant, that the lien of the <em>Commomoealth's </em>judgment was discharged ; first, by the levy of the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon <em>Miller, </em>and second, by the execution of the forthcoming bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\">It is true, that the service of a <em>ca. sa. </em>puts a stop to any farther proceedings on the judgment, against the debtor in custody; and it is sometimes said, though with not much propriety, to be a satisfaction of the judgment. But if the debtor escapes from custody, or dies in prison, the creditor is remitted to his judgment, and his judgment lien. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>8 Leigh 503; <em>Allen, </em>J. in <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>1 Rob. R. 545. And the taking a debtor on a <em>ca. sa. </em>upon a several judgment, does not prevent the creditor from using any other remedies against the other persons bound for the debt. <em>Hayling </em>v. <em>Mullhall, </em>2 Wm. Bl. R. 1235. The counsel for the appellant admit that <em>ca. sas. </em>may be repeatedly issued, until all the debtors in a joint judgment are taken in execution. Now suppose <em>Miller, </em>when taken under the <em>ca. sa., </em>had, instead of surrendering property to the sheriff in discharge of his body, taken the benefit of the act for the relief of insolvent debtors. Upon their admission, this would not have prevented the <em>Commonwealth's </em>issuing another <em>ca. sa. </em>upon its judgment; and yet it is certain that <em>Miller </em>could not have been taken in execution again, and the difficulty would have been obviated, by an endorsement on the execution that it was not to be served upon him ; which is precisely the endorsement which would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>made in the case stated hy the counsel, of a levy upon one joint debtor, and then a second execution issued for the purpose of taking the others into custody. Where, then, is the greater difficulty in issuing an <em>elegit </em>upon the judgment, after one of the joint debtors has been taken upon a <em>ca. sa., </em>and has taken the benefit of the insolvent debtors\u2019 act, than exists in the case of a second <em>ca. sa-.; </em>or, indeed, any difficulty which may not be obviated in precisely the same manner. The difficulty is not only no greater in its nature, in the last case than the first, but it is no greater in <em>extent; </em>as the point, of the merger of the lien of the judgment in that of a <em>ca. sa. </em>can never arise, for any practical purpose, except in the case of a debtor in execution who takes the benefit of the insolvent debtors\u2019 act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-4\">But the question in this case, is not, what would have been the remedies of the <em>Commonwealth </em>against <em>Fowler </em>after the levy of the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon Miller, if that <em>ca. sa. </em>had proved unproductive. What they would have been in that event, it is bootless to enquire. The <em>ca. sa. </em>was productive; and the question is, what, in the case that has occurred, are the remedies of <em>Miller, </em>and the appellee standing in his shoes? If, when the <em>ca. sa. </em>was served upon <em>Miller </em>he had paid off the execution to the sheriff, or if he had delivered the slaves mentioned in the forthcoming bond at the time and place of sale, and the sheriff had sold them and paid the <em>Commonwealth's </em>judgment, there can be no doubt, that he would, as the surety of <em>Fowler, </em>have been entitled to the benefit of the <em>Commonwealth's </em>judgment lien upon <em>Fowler's </em>land. He would have paid the debt of his principal, for which he was bound as surety; and if the <em>Commonwealth </em>had released her judgment lien upon <em>Folder's </em>land by the levy of the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon <em>Miller, </em>this fact, upon well settled principles of equity, would have operated as a release of the surety <em>Miller. </em>And thus, the effort to make the debt out of the surety, by means of a <em>ca. sa. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>would have operated a release of the surety, and a release of the judgment lien upon the lands of the principal: an absurdity of which the law cannot be guilty. In the cases supposed, there can be no doubt <em>Miller </em>woui\u00bf have been entitled to be substituted to the creditor\u2019s judgment lien. The principle of every case decided on the subject would give it to him. <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>2 Call 103; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>11 Ves. R. 12; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>4 Johns. Ch. R. 128; <em>M\u2019Mahon </em>v. <em>Fawcett, </em>2 Rand. 514; <em>Enders </em>v. <em>Brune, </em>4 Id. 438; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>3 Leigh 272; <em>M\u2019Clung </em>v. <em>Beirne, </em>10 Leigh 394; <em>Craythorne </em>v. <em>Swinburne, </em>14 Ves. R. 160; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock, </em>2 Vern. R. 608. But if the counsel for the appellant are correct, that the <em>Commonwealth\u2019s </em>judgment lien is extinguished by the levy of the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon <em>Miller; </em>and, therefore, <em>Miller </em>has no title to be substituted to it, then not only has <em>Miller </em>no title to the creditor\u2019s remedy in this case, but, upon the same principle, the whole doctrine of substitution is an absurdity: for in no case, can the surety be entitled to be substituted to the remedies of the creditor, until the creditor is satisfied his debt; and then he has no remedies. But as we understand the doctrine, when the surety pays the debt to the creditor, although at law, the creditor\u2019s remedies are extinguished, he having no farther occasion for <em>them, yet in </em>equity, the remedies of the creditor are considered as transferred to the surety, and as existing in full force for his benefit. And the remedies thus transferred must be all that the creditor had against the principal at the time of the judgment, or afterwards acquired; as, if he has released any, he has thereby released the surety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-4\">We hold it clear then, that <em>Miller, </em>if he had paid the debt to the <em>Commonwealth, </em>would have been entitled to be substituted to the lien of the judgment on <em>Fowler\u2019s </em>land; and the question is, whether <em>Ferguson </em>having paid the debt as the surety of <em>Miller, </em>is entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>remedies to which <em>Miller </em>would have been entitled if he had paid it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-4\">For the appellant, it is insisted, that <em>Ferguson </em>is not entitled to the remedies of the Commonweallh, because as to <em>Fowler </em>he is a mere volunteer. The time has gone by when counsel could, in this Court, advance the proposition, that a purchaser for value from the judgment debtor stood in any better situation than his vendor. The judgment is a legal lien operating upon the legal estate, and as in all other cases of legal lien, the purchaser takes the estate <em>cum onere: </em>and the doctrine of notice has no application to it. <em>Leake, </em>then, stands in the place of <em>Fowler; </em>and the defence insists, that in a Court of Equity, where not the contracts, but the equities between the parties are to be administered, <em>Fowler </em>is to be heard to say: \u201c True, my debt has been paid. True, it was my duty to have protected my surety <em>Miller </em>from being disturbed on account of it. True, that by my failure in the performance of this duty <em>Miller </em>has been taken in execution; and to bo released, has been compelled to surrender his property in discharge of his body. But, nevertheless, although I might, if I had been in his situation, have called upon my friends for aid, to enable me to keep my property in possession until the day of sale, by executing a forthcoming bond, <em>Miller, </em>my surety, could not have this privilege, or he must have it under the penalty to his friend who aided him, of discharging me from all liability for the debt.\u201d And this is the equity of the case! If this defence be sustained, then upon the same principle, in an action against the principal and surety, the principal may give bail, but the surety must not. So, the principal may take an appeal, but the surety must not. The principal may enjoin a debt, but the surety must not. And this, according to the counsel on the other side, is equity. But the defence is against authority as well as reason. <em>M\u2019Clung </em>v. <em>Beirne, </em>10 Leigh 394; <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>1 Rob. R. 545.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Assuming that <em>Ferguson </em>is entitled to he substituted to the remedies of the <em>Commonwealth, </em>the next enquiry is, what is the extent of those remedies? We admit that the statute, <em>2 </em>Rev. Code, ch. 189, \u00a7&gt; 8, p. <em>51, </em>only gives a remedy against lands by <em>fi. fa. </em>upon judgments against sheriffs, collectors, &amp;c.; but we insist, that on the ground suggested from the bench, the <em>Commonwealth\u2019s </em>lien extends to the whole land of its judgment debtor. At common law the lands of the <em>King\u2019s </em>debtor were only bound by judgments, or other debts <em>of record, </em>which were considered on the same footing with judgments ; and it was by the statute of 33 Henry 8th, ch. 39, that this lien was extended to other debtors of the <em>King. </em>Bac. Abr. Execution, letter K.; <em>The King </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>6 Eng. Exch. R. 431. In the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>the cases cited on the other side from <em>Plow-den </em>and <em>Dyer, </em>are reviewed and disapproved. Of the debtors whose lands were bound without judgment, were officers, receivers, and accountants; and our statute was obviously intended for their relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-4\">Our statute repealing British statutes prior to the 4th year of James the 1st, expressly reserves all writs remedial, and judicial, and it is <em>a fortiori, </em>that common law writs continued to be existing remedies. It is said, however, that this remedy by extent is a part of the <em>King\u2019s </em>prerogative; and all royal prerogatives were abolished by the old constitution of <em>Virginia. </em>By the provision of the constitution referred to, it is true the <em>Executive </em>is forbidden to exercise any power by virtue of the royal prerogative ; but this is only a royal prerogative, as the <em>King </em>was the proper authority to enforce the payment of debts due to the government; and in this respect, the <em>Commonwealth </em>of <em>Virginia </em>holds precisely the position that the <em>King </em>holds in <em>England. </em>Surely remedies are equally necessary to the <em>Commonwealth </em>here, as they are to the <em>Crown </em>in <em>England; </em>and as this is a common law remedy in <em>England, </em>and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>law is in force here, the remedy must exist here, as well as there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-4\">The decree for an account was erroneous, but the decree appealed from is an interlocutory decree, and may be corrected when the case goes back.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-20\"> He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b451-10\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AnAq\">Most of the principles involved in this case have been settled by the adjudications of this Court. The lien of a judgment is a legal lien. The question of notice has no influence upon it, or had not until the passage of the recent statute requiring judgments to be recorded to preserve the lien. What influence that statute may have upon a purchaser with notice of an unrecorded judgment, it is not necessary now to consider, as this case must be decided according to the laws previously in force. By those laws, the debtor was left in the enjoyment of the legal title, subject to the right of the judgment creditor to charge the lands; and the purchaser from the debtor took the legal title subject to the legal lien, whether a purchaser with or without notice of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">In this case the <em>Commonwealth </em>had obtained judgment. This gave her a lien upon the lands of the debtors, the extent of which will be considered hereafter. If on an execution against <em>Fowler </em>(supposed to be the principal debtor) his property had been seized, and a forthcoming bond been executed, this bond, if it proved effectual, would have operated as a satisfaction of the judgment. But this Court held in <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>1 Rob. R. 545, that the security in a forthcoming bond, upon the forfeiture thereof, became bound for the original debt; and in the case of <em>Robinson &amp; als. </em>v. <em>Sherman &amp; als. </em>ante, 178, that such security having discharged the debt, is entitled to be substituted to all the rights of the creditor against the original debtor. Those cases also decided, that the execution and forfeiture of the forthcoming bond by one of several joint debtors did not utterly discharge the original joint debt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ors; but that if the forthcoming bond proved unavailing, it would still be competent to proceed on the judgment against the other joint debtors, until satisfaction was ob<em>tained; </em>and, therefore, that the security in a forthcoming bon&lt;j given by one, was entitled, on paying the debt, to the remedies of the creditor against the others. If <em>Miller </em>then, in the case under consideration, were the surety of the original debtor, and had paid the debt, there could be no doubt, under these authorities, of his right to substitution to the lien of the judgment against his principal <em>} </em>unless, indeed, the form of the execution has operated some change in the rights of the parties. The creditor here resorted to the <em>ca. sa., </em>and after taking out a <em>ca. sa. </em>and getting it executed, he can no longer stand on the lien of the judgment. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>4 Leigh 425. This is certainly true, under the decisions of this Court, so far as respects the creditor, and with respect to the debtor on whom the <em>ca. sa. </em>is executed. Yet the service of the <em>ca. sa. </em>is not an actual discharge of the judgment. If it proves unavailing, should the debtor die in custody, escape, or take the oath of insolvency, the creditor, in the two first instances, is remitted to his original judgment; and in every case, where there are joint debtors, upon some of whom the <em>ca. sa. </em>has not been executed, he would, I presume, as against them, stand upon his original judgment after the <em>ca. sa. </em>remedy had been exhausted against the defendant served with process. Though it would not be competent to sue out a <em>ft. fa. </em>or an <em>elegit </em>against some of the defendants whilst others were in custody under the <em>ca. sa., </em>if the defendants in custody should die, or take the oath of insolvency, the creditor could sue out his <em>elegit </em>against the others. The capacity existing to take out the <em>elegit, </em>will preserve the lien of the judgment as against them, for when sued out, it must, by the terms of the writ, refer to, and bind all lands owned by the debtor at the date of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Where a <em>Ji. fa. </em>is levied on a sufficiency of goods, the property of one of several defendants, a new execution cannot issue on that judgment until the levy is exhausted. So that if the levy proved effectual by the payment of the money, it might be contended with the same propriety, that the lien of the judgment was gone, and there could be nothing to which the security could be substituted. In almost every case of substitution, the debt as respects the creditor, has been paid; his claim is satisfied and discharged; but in equity, and for the benefit of the surety, it is not looked upon as extinguished, but transferred with all its obligatory force against the principal. <em>Powell\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>White, &amp;c. </em>11 Leigh 309. So that giving to the levy of the <em>ca. sa. </em>or the <em>fi. fa. </em>executed the effect of satisfaction, it would not take away the surety\u2019s right to substitution. But the cases referred to clearly shew, that as respects the creditor himself, the service of the <em>ca. sa. </em>or levy of the <em>fi. fa. </em>are not a satisfaction of the judgment. It still subsists for the benefit of the creditor until satisfaction is actually made; and thus subsisting, when the surety in the forthcoming bond becomes bound for the debt, no act of the creditor can deprive the surety of the benefit of it. If on judgment against principal and surety, the latter pay the debt before execution, his right to be substituted to the lien of the judgment would scarcely be controverted. The fact that he has been compelled to pay it under process of execution, either against his person or his property, cannot place him in a worse position. To hold that it did, would be to make his rights dependent on the caprice of the creditor. As regards the latter, it may be the humane policy of the law to discourage the harsh process of execution against the body, and, therefore, to confine him to the lien of his <em>ca. sa. </em>executed when he resorts to that remedy. But his act should not deprive the surety of any right which once existed for his benefit. In this case, therefore, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Miller, </em>upon the service of the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon him, had paid the debt, it seems to me, he would have a clear right to substitution against the principal. He is responsible to his surety in the forthcoming bond who has paid for j1jm_ His surety should then be permitted to stand in his shoes, and assert all his rights. Indeed, he occupies still higher ground, for this Court held in <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>that the surety in the forthcoming bond becomes surety for the debt itself, under the terms of the law; and, therefore, a supplemental security for the original <em>debtor; </em>and, as regards the principal, he does not occupy the position of one voluntarily intromitting himself, <em>in invitum. </em>It was the duty of the principal to have discharged the debt and relieved his surety; failing in this, he cannot be heard to allege that the surety to relieve his person or property, which the law allows, has brought in another security who, upon paying the debt, may acquire rights against <em>himy^</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">It is objected that there is no evidence <em>Miller </em>was a security of <em>Fowler. </em>The bill avers it, but the answer puts the plaintiff upon proof of its allegations. This objection seems to have been taken for the first time in the appellate Court. <em>Fowler </em>appears to have been considered as principal throughout the case in the Court below; and it is probable evidence of the fact was not filed because of its notoriety. As the case must go back on other grounds, it is not necessary to consider this objection farther. If the fact is as seems to have been conceded in the Court below, the proof can be supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">It is contended that there was error in directing a sale of the whole of the land instead of a moiety. If this were a new question, now for the first time to be decided, I should incline to think that the judgment of the <em>Commonwealth </em>bound the whole of the debtor\u2019s lands. At the common law the body, land, and goods, of the debtor were liable to the <em>King's execution; </em>for <em>Thesaurus regis est pads vinculum, et bellorum nervi. </em>3 Coke\u2019s R. 12 b.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Herberts </em>Case. And though this arises from the royal prerogative, it is not a prerogative incident to the person of the King, but attaching to him in his political character as head of the State, and for the public weal. The reason for its existence is as applicable to the government now as it was before the revolution. The objection to the establishment of such a rule here, upon the ground that every debt of the <em>King, </em>whether of record or not, binds the debtor\u2019s lands from the time of its creation, seems not to be well founded. The authority for the position is a remark of <em>Gerard </em>in the case of <em>Mines, </em>Plowden 310, spoken <em>arguendo. </em>The correctness of the remark was considered in the case of the <em>King </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>Wightwick 34, 6 Eng. Exch. It. 431. <em>M\u2019Donald, </em>Chief Baron, reviewed all the authorities, and shews very clearly that lands of a simple contract debtor of the <em>King, </em>are not bound by such debt; that the debtors whose lands were so bound by the common law, were those whose debts were of record, or who were the <em>King\u2019s </em>accountants, collectors, &amp;c. whose debts were treated as debts of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In the absence of any statute of <em>Virginia, </em>or decision of this Court, there would be nothing in the nature of our institutions, or the preference claimed, to authorize us in saying that the <em>Commonwealth </em>had not the same rights which by the common law were possessed by the <em>King. </em>But by the act for the more speedy recovery of debts due to the <em>Commonwealth, </em>passed the 7th January 1788, 12 Hen. Stat. p. 558, the right was given to take and sell, under a <em>fieri facias, </em>the lands of sheriffs and other public collectors, under judgments obtained after the passage of the act; and it was furthermore provided that judgments in favour of the <em>Commonwealth </em>should bind the lands of the sureties of such collectors, &amp;c. We have seen that by the common law the lands of such collectors were bound from the creation of the debt, their debts being in the nature of debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of record, from whence it is inferred that it was the intention of the Legislature to mitigate the rigour of the common law, by bringing down the lien from the creation of the debt to the date of the judgment; and also t0 subst\u00faute the speedy remedy of a sale under a <em>fi. fa. </em>for the <em>extendi facias. </em>It is most probable the Legislature did <em>not </em>consider the common law in regard to the King\u2019s prerogative in force in <em>Virginia, </em>or there would have been no good reason for confining the remedy to judgments obtained after the passage of the act. If the lien existed and could have been enforced by an <em>extendi facias, </em>prior to the passage of the act, the remedy by sale under <em>fieri facias </em>would probably have been extended as well to prior as subsequent judgments. This construction is aided by the proviso to the first section, declaring that the act should not extend to securities who became so prior to the passage of the act: shewing that the Legislature did not design to increase the liabilities of securities by giving the act a retrospective operation. But if they had considered that the lands of such securities were bound by a judgment according to the common law, there would have been no necessity for such a proviso. The statute, however, has received a judicial construction, and as perhaps few questions of the kind can ever arise again under the law as it existed prior to 1788, there is no good reason for disturbing it. Since 1788, a judgment in favour of the <em>Commonwealth </em>binds all the lands of a public collector. And by the act of 23d February 1822, Supplement to Rev. Code 339, the law is made general, and applies to all public debtors. The question upon the act of 1788, arose in the case of <em>Nimmo\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 57. A judgment had been obtained against the sheriff in 1786. In 1799, a <em>sdre facias </em>was sued out to revive the judgment against his executor, who pleaded fully administered. In his account adduced in support of his plea, he had charged himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>with the proceeds of a tract of land which his testator had devised to be sold. The General Court held he was bound to take notice of judgments against his testator, and disallowing his credits, charged him with the proceeds of the land sold as legal assets. In the petition for a <em>supersedeas, </em>it was assigned for error, that the proceeds of the land were equitable assets, and as such distributable <em>pari passu </em>among all the creditors of the testator j and that if even legal assets, the bond debts were entitled to a share, since the judgment was prior to the act of assembly subjecting lands to the judgment of the <em>Commonwealth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Another question was discussed, whether the act of limitations was not a bar to the <em>scire facias. </em>All the Judges held that it was not; and so holding, it would have necessarily followed, if the judgment rendered prior to the act of 1788, bound all the lands of the defendant, the <em>Commonwealth </em>would have been entitled to the proceeds. Judge <em>Tucker, </em>as to this branch of the case, says: \u201c The act making sheriffs\u2019 lands liable to the <em>Commonwealth's </em>judgments did not pass until eighteen months after the judgment in this caseand held that the General Court should have disregarded the proceeds of the land as not being legal assets, leaving the <em>Commonwealth </em>to pursue her remedy for a due proportion thereof <em>pari passu </em>with the other creditors. Judge <em>Roane </em>said the judgment was \u201c eminently erroneous in all the particulars stated in the seven last errors assigned,\u201d (embracing the two herein mentioned.) He referred to the reasons given; adopted them as his opinion on that part of the cause ; stating further, they were all assented to by the unanimous opinion of the Court. Judge <em>Fleming </em>concurred, and the decree of the Court affirmed that the proceeds of the land were not legal, but equitable assets, which did not enure to the <em>Commonwealth </em>by virtue of her judgment, and she was only entitled to come in with the other creditors <em>pari passu. </em>So far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>respected a moiety of the proceeds, this decision, according to the settled course of adjudications since, would he held clearly erroneous; for a judgment in favour of the <em>Commonwealth </em>should at least be entitled to as much respect as a judgment in favour of an individual ; but this perhaps was an inadvertence. The attention of the Court was directed exclusively to the act of 1788, and the rights it conferred; and the decision is express, that neither by virtue of it or any pre-existing law, was the <em>Commonwealth </em>entitled to a lien on the lands of its debtor. Thus virtually deciding that this branch of the prerogative was not in force in <em>Virginia, </em>or was disaffirmed by the act of 1788. Yielding to this authority, I am of opinion that as this is, the case, not of a public collector provided for in the act of 1788, but of a general public debtor, against whom judgment was rendered prior to the act of 1822, the <em>Commonwealth </em>had no greater rights than are conferred by a judgment in the case of an individual; and it was therefore erroneous to decree a sale of more than a moiety of the land. <em>Stleman </em>v. <em>Ashdown, </em>2 Atk. R. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">There was also error in directing an account of the rents and profits of the land from the time of the purchase. The security is seeking to be substituted to a mere legal right. On an <em>elegit </em>there is no estimate of the past annual value, with a view to the recovery thereof; and the security here can claim no other rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">For these errors, I think the decree must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"ApJ\">The other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">The decree of the Court was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">The Court is of opinion, that under the pleadings in this case, it' was premature to decree in favour of the appellee without some proof that <em>Fowler </em>was principal and <em>Miller </em>was security in the original debt. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Court is further of opinion, that if that fact is made to appear, the said <em>Miller </em>and the appellee as standing in his shoes will be entitled to be substituted to the lien of the <em>Commonwealth\u2019s </em>judgment against the lands of the said <em>Fowler. </em>The Court is further of opinion, that the lien of the judgment in favour of the <em>Commonwealth </em>in this case, extended to but a moiety of the lands of the debtor, and therefore that there was error in decreeing a sale of the whole tract. The Court is further of opinion, that there was error in directing an account of the rents and profits of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Therefore the decree is reversed with costs, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings according to the principles of this decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
