Upon an application to a Court of Equity to enjoin a judgment at law, and grant a new trial in the case, it is error in the Court to perpetuate the injunction, set aside the judgment, and grant a new trial of the cause which had been terminated; and to finally dispose of the suit in equity.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b232-13\">2. In such case the judgment at law is a security for any thing the plaintiif at law may be entitled to; and a Court of Equity should continue the injunction, and direct proper issues; and upon the coming in of the verdict, perpetuate the injunction, or dissolve it in whole, or in part, according to the finding of the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b232-14\">3. The justices composing a Court before which a cause is tried, having left the bench after the verdict was rendered, so that a motion for a new trial could not be made to them, a Court of Equity has jurisdiction to award it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-15\">In 1838, <em>Hendricks, Byars </em>and <em>Cooper, </em>applied to one of the Judges of the General Court for an injunction to a judgment obtained against them in the County Court of <em>Russell, </em>by <em>Felix Knifong. </em>The facts were, that <em>Hendricks Sp Byars, </em>as partners, recovered a judgment before a justice of the peace against <em>Martin Knifong, </em>and issued an execution thereon, which went into the hands of <em>Joseph Hackney, </em>a constable of the county of <em>Russell, </em>who levied it on a horse found in the possession of <em>Martin Knifong. Felix Knifong, </em>the son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>of Martin, claimed the horse as his own; and the constable demanding indemnity, <em>Hendricks Sf- </em>Byars, with <em>Cooper </em>as their surety, executed an indemnifying bond to the constable, in the penalty of 200 dollars. The sale took place, and <em>Felix Knifong </em>instituted an action in the name of the constable, on the bond against the obligors therein, in the County Court of <em>Russell.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-4\">The only plea filed in the cause by the defendants, was payment. On this plea, an issue was made up, and the parties went to trial. On the first trial of the cause, the right of property in the horse was gone into before the jury, without objection by the plaintiff, and the jury not being able to agree upon a verdict, were discharged, and the cause was continued. When the cause was again called, the issue was the same ; and after the jury were sworn, the counsel for the plaintiff announced to the counsel for the defendants that they would object to any evidence in relation to the right of property; and insist upon confining it to the issue in the cause. Accordingly, when the defendants offered their evidence upon the title to the property, it was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and rejected by the Court. The counsel for the defendants then asked leave to amend their pleadings, but the Court being of opinion that they had no authority to permit the pleadings to be amended after the jury was sworn, refused the leave; and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff for the whole amount of the penalty of the bond; though the proof in this injunction case, as to the value of the horse, was, that in the spring of the year, when <em>Knifong </em>got him, he was worth about thirty-five or forty dollars; but he had improved considerably before he was taken under the execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">After the jury had rendered their verdict, the counsel for the defendants announced that they would ask for a new trial, if the same justices who tried the cause could be gotten on the bench. This, however, could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>done, one of them having left the courthouse, and returned home.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHm\">The injunction was granted; and the defendant filed ansWer, jn which he admitted the facts as to the mode in which the cause in the County Court was conducted, but insisted that the defendants were not surprised ; but that their counsel were of opinion that the question of title to the property might be made under the plea of payment; and exerted themselves to bring the Court to their opinion. He also stated, and the proofs seemed to sustain him, that the defendants\u2019 counsel had needlessly protracted the cause after the Court had decided the question upon the admissibility of the testimony against them ,\u2022 and that after the verdict was rendered, there was unnecessary delay in making the motion for a new trial, whereby it happened <em>that </em>one of the justices could not be gotten to hear the motion: and that when the justice could not be gotten, his counsel made the proposition to the counsel for the defendants, to submit the motion for a new trial to the three justices present who had presided during the trial, and that proposition <em>was </em>rejected, until it was stated by one of the justices from the bench, that he would have granted a new trial, and that all the rest, including the absent one, would give the same opinion. Then they agreed to submit the motion to the three justices present, but the plaintiff\u2019s counsel declined it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">The cause having been matured, came on for hearing on the 20th of April 1838, when the Court perpetuated the injunction: and further decreed that the judgment at law should be set aside and cancelled; and a new trial of the cause be had before the County Court, in which the defendants should be allowed to amend their pleadings. And there being, in the opinion of the Court, no reason for continuing the cause longer in the Court, it was ordered that it should be stricken from the docket.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">From this decree <em>Knifong </em>obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>The Attorney </em>General, for the appellant, and Patton, for the appellees, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AfL\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKE\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AAp\">The Court is of opinion, that as it appears the appellees were surprised by the exclusion at the second trial of evidence which had been admitted without objection at the first trial, and that in consequence thereof a recovery was obtained for a sum far exceeding the amount of damages sustained, a new trial should have been granted, with leave to the appellees so to amend their pleadings as to present the real merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The Court is further of opinion, that as the appellees were prevented from making such motion for a new trial by the dispersion of the justices composing the Court, it was a proper case for relief in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">But the Court is of opinion, there was error in perpetuating the injunction, setting aside and cancelling the judgment, directing a new trial of the cause which had been terminated, and in finally disposing of the suit in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The judgment was a security for any thing the appellant should thereafter appear to he entitled to; and the Court should have continued the injunction, directed proper issues, and upon the coming in of the verdict, perpetuated the injunction, or dissolved it in whole or in part, according to the finding of the jury. The decree of the Court below is, therefore, reversed with costs, and this Court, proceeding to render such a decree as the Court below ought to have rendered, it is adjudged and decreed that the injunction to the judgment in the bill and proceedings mentioned, be continued until a final hearing of the cause. And it is further adjudged and ordered, that an issue be made up and tried at the bar of said Circuit Superior Court, on the law side thereof, to ascertain and try, first, whether the horse in the condition of said bond of indemnity mentioned, was at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>time of the seizure thereof by the officer under the execution in said bond described, the property of said <em>Felix Knifong </em>or not; and if he was the property of said <em>jveiix Knifong </em>at the time of such seizure, then to ascerta^1 and assess the damages sustained by said <em>Felix Knifing </em>by. reason of the seizure and sale of the property <em>; </em>and that the verdict of the jury be certified in order to a final decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
