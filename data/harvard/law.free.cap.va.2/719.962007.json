The injunction is awarded. But afterwards the defendant files an answer denying the allegations of the bill. And the plaintiff relies on the testimony of a single witness, unsustained by any corroborating circumstances. Held, the injunction must be dissolved and the bill dismissed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-10\">On the 29th of March 1823, <em>George W. S. Thornton </em>executed an obligation to <em>Bazil Gordon </em>for the payment of 3000 dollars on the first of January 1828, with interest from the date, to be paid on the first of January 1824, and annually thereafter. At the time of giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>this obligation, <em>Thornton </em>also executed a deed of trust to <em>James W. Ford, </em>conveying a tract of land in trust, with power to sell the same if default should be made in the payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-4\"><em>Thornton </em>having died, leaving <em>Jane W-. A. Thornton </em>an infant and only child his devisee, she, by her next friend, filed a bill in the superior court of chancery at <em>Fredericksburg, </em>in March 1831, against <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Ford, </em>alleging that the transaction was usurious. The bill, after setting forth the facts relied on to establish the usury, averred that the complainant expected to be able to make full proof of her allegations, and disclaimed all benefit of any discovery from the defendants. It played, however, that the defendants might answer the premises, and that they might be restrained from proceeding on the deed of trust until its validity should be ascertained by a trial at law, and also for such other and further relief as to the court might seem reasonable. The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-5\">The defendants both filed answers under oath. That of <em>Ford </em>contained nothing material. In <em>Gordon's, </em>all the facts relied on as constituting the transaction usurious were clearly, positively and explicitly denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-6\">On the part of the plaintiff it was attempted to be established, that though the obligation from <em>Thornton </em>to <em>Gordon </em>was for bank stock transferred to the former by the latter, the transaction was really a loan of money, and the particular form of a sale of stock merely adopted as a shift or device to evade the statute against usury. There was, however, but a single witness whose testimony tended to make out the plaintiff\u2019s case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-7\">The circuit court of <em>Spotsylvania, </em>to which the case was by law transferred, made a decree, on the 30th of June 1832, dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-8\">From that decree the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b753-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The cause was elaborately argued by <em>Harrison </em>and <em>C. Johnson </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Stanard, Patton </em>and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeQ\">upon the question whether the facts deposed to constituted usury: but the notice of the argument will be confined to a point which was made after <em>Harrison </em>had opened the case, and was discussed between <em>Johnson </em>and the counsel for the appellee; the decision of the court being upon this alone.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b753-4\">\n<em>Johnson.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag3\">The answer of the defendant is entitled to no more weight than a plea of a defendant at law,\u2014the plea of not guilty to an indictment, or any other plea which merely puts in issue the matter of charge. The denial of the answer merely countervails the allegation of the bill, and leaves the question of usury in <em>equilibrio. </em>Where the plaintiff calls for the testimony of his adversary upon oath, his answer is made evidence by this exercise of a right on the part of the plaintiff: otherwise where the plaintiff demands no discovery, no answer upon oath. In the latter case the answer, though upon oath (which it need not be), is no evidence against the plaintiff. The defendant cannot become a witness in his own fayour without the requisition and against the will of the plaintiff. In support of these principles, <em>2 </em>Story\u2019s Equity, p. 743-5. \u00a7 152\u00a7. 1529. and <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Moore, 2 </em>Rand. 575. are relied on. The bill here not being filed under the third section of our statute, a call for a discovery might have been demurred to. As to any admissions in the answer, they may be used against the defendant precisely as any other confessions of a party may be used against him, wherever or however made.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b753-8\">\n<em>Stanard.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahq\">Upon examination of the case of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, 2 </em>Munf. 407. the cases reviewed in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Lindsay\u2019s adm\u2019rs and others, </em>1 Leigh 499. and the subsequent cases of <em>Fitzhugh </em>v. <em>Gordon, 2 </em>Leigh 626. and <em>Turpin </em>v. <em>Povall &amp;c. </em>8 Leigh 93. it will be found that the extent to which the decisions in <em>Virginia </em>have gone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>is only this,\u2014that although the bill calls for a discovery and the defendant admits the usury, such admission, where the plaintiff can prove the usury otherwise, shall not deprive him of the opportunity of pleading and proving the usury at law. There is no case deciding that equity may interfere on the sole testimony of one witness, where the usury is denied by the answer. <em>Gilliam </em>v. <em>Clay and </em>others, 3 Leigh 590. certainly does not sustain any such proposition; it may, however, be invoked against it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b754-3\">\n<em>Fatton.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayx\">Suppose a plaintiff goes into equity disclaiming all benefit of discovery from the defendant\u2019s answer, and alleging that he is fullhanded with proof; he fails to produce such proof, but the defendant admits the usury: in such a state of facts, would the court send the question of usury to be tried at law, though admitted by the defendant? or would it take the admission as proof of the usury, and give relief? Surely it would not do so idle a thing as to require the parties to litigate a question which had been settled by the admission of the defendant in his answer; nor so inequitable a thing as to send the parties to a court of law, when the consequence must be the forfeiture of the whole debt, upon proof of the usury by the defendant\u2019s admission in the court of chancery. The usury in such a case would be taken as proved, and relief given as provided for in the third section. Why, then, if the defendant <em>denies </em>the usury, shall his answer not be evidence for him ? According to mr. Johnson's view, though the bill here calls upon the defendant to <em>answer </em>all the allegations thereof, that is no call for a discovery\u2014for an <em>answer upon oath ; </em>it is merely a call on him to answer as in case of a legal demand he would be called on to answer the declaration ; that is, by pleading to the action,\u2014by putting in issue the plaintiff\u2019s claim, if he designs to contest it. This is a novel idea, wholly unwarranted by the principles of equity proceedings, or by authority. It is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>defendant\u2019s privilege to answer, as well as the plaintiff\u2019s privilege to call upon him to do so; the defendant\u2019s right to have his answer weighed as evidence when it makes for him, as well as the plaintiff\u2019s right to avail himself of admissions made by the answer; the defendant\u2019s right to require that his denial of a fact alleged in the bill shall in all cases be equivalent to the testimony of two witnesses, or one witness and pregnant circumstances. By resorting to the court of chancery, by filing his bill, the plaintiff submits himself to encounter the weight of the defendant\u2019s answer; and his disclaimer of benefit from it, his assertion that he is provided with proof <em>aliunde, </em>cannot amount to a retraction of that submission, and deprive the defendant of his rights in the forum of equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b755-4\">\n<em>Leigh.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI2\">The proposition of mr. <em>Johnson </em>is wholly new; not to be found decided, or even expressly stated, in any case whatever. If the proposition be correct, the plaintiff in equity may <em>in every case, </em>by disclaiming any discovery from the defendant, entitle himself to equitable relief upon the testimony of a single witness, as well where such relief is to produce a forfeiture or the infliction of a penalty, as in any other case. If it be correct, it must go the length of changing the whole course of chancery proceeding, and the fundamental principles of chancery pleading and evidence, at least as they have been hitherto commonly and almost universally understood.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b755-5\"><em>Johnson </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQx\">It is the privilege of a plaintiff to resort to the conscience of the defendant, or not to resort to it, as he pleases. If a defendant has a right to answer, and have his answer weighed as evidence, why does not this right extend to all matters pertinent to the issue, instead of being restricted, as it confessedly is, to those matters as to which his answer is specifically called for ? In general, an answer upon oath is called for as to all the matters distinctly alleged by the bill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>because generally the plaintiff expects some benefit from the answer of the defendant, some saving of ironble at least, as to all his allegations. And this is the reason, and a sufficient reason, why the elementary writers speak only of the weight of the answer in general. It is, in general, called for, and the defendant made a witness by the plaintiff as to the whole of the rtiatters charged in the bill. The precise proposition now contended for, it is admitted, is not expressly stated, nor the question directly considered, in any of the elementary works. But the principle is a legitimate consequence from the case of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>and is supported by the opinions of judges <em>Coalter </em>and <em>Roane </em>in <em>M\u2019Pherrin &amp;c. </em>v. <em>King &amp;c. </em>1 Rand. 172. The case of <em>Kincheloe </em>v. <em>Kincheloe, </em>11 Leigh 393. is strongly analogous to this, and the opinions there as to the weight of the answer are applicable here. [Patton. The ground of that decision appears in the late case of <em>Malone\u2019s adm\u2019r and others </em>v. <em>Hobbs and others, </em>1 Rob. 346. in which it was held that it is sufficient to aver in general terms that a writing admitted to probat is not the will of the decedent, and that <em>without any proof </em>of the averment the court is bound to direct an issue.] There was no question in <em>Malone &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Hobbs &amp;c. </em>as to the weight of the answer. It is not contended that the plaintiff here is entitled to the interposition of the court to give him a trial at law, without proof of his case, upon a mere suggestion of usury ; but that he is entitled to have the testimony of his witnesses weighed without prejudice from the defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\"> He had been counsel for the appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b756-4\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AO7\">As the witness relied on by the plaintiff stands alone, unsustained by any corroborating circumstance in the case, the question arises, to what weight is the answer in such circumstances entitled ? In <em>Alam </em>v. <em>Jourdan, </em>1 Vernon 161. one of the earliest cases, the rule which has always been recognized since is laid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>down, that where there is but one witness against the answer, the plaintiff cannot have a decree. In <em>Pember </em>v. <em>Mathers, 1 </em>Bro. Ch. R. 52. it is said, that where the defendant in express terms negatives the allegations of the bill, and the evidence is only of one person, there the court will neither make a decree nor send the case to a trial at law. In 2 Madd. Ch. Pract. 443. the rule is stated in these words: \u201c If the defendant positively, plainly and precisely denies an assertion in the bill, and one witness only proves it as positively, clearly and precisely as it is denied, no decree for relief can be made.\u201d But it has been argued, that the rule giving to the answer the weight of evidence arises from the right of the plaintiff to call for a discovery; that this is the privilege of the plaintiff, and he may waive it: and a passage in Story\u2019s Equity (vol. 2. p. 744.) is relied on to sustain this proposition. The reason on which the rule stands is there stated to be this: \u201c The plaintiff calls upon the defendant &gt;tc answer an allegation of fact which he makes; and thereby he admits the answer to be evidence of that fact.\u201d If this were the sole foundation of the rule, it would seem to follow that if, by calling upon the defendant to answer, the answer when made is admitted to be evidence of the fact, the plaintiff would be concluded by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\">Perhaps the origin of the rule is to be found in the civil law, which required the evidence of two witnesses as the foundation of a decree. Judge <em>Story, </em>in page 745. refers to the rule of the civil law, and observes, that <em>\u201c </em>these coincidences between the civil law and equity jurisprudence, if they do not demonstrate a common origin of the doctrines on this subject, serve at least to shew that they have a firm foundation in natural justice.\u201d To whatever source the rule is traced, it is firmly established as one of the fundamental principles of a court of equity. It is the law of the forum, and all who apply to it for relief must submit to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>their causes tried according to its established modes of \u00ab procedure. It would be as competent for this court to remodel the whole doctrine of a court of equity in regard to pleadings and evidence, as to declare that in this particular case the defendant should be deprived of the benefit of his answer. The cases do not confine this privilege to answers to bills seeking a discovery. In truth the rule has no application to a mere technical bill of discovery, where no relief is prayed, but the discovery is required to be used in some trial at law : for there the plaintiff has his election to use the answer or not. The principle becomes of importance in those cases alone where an issue of fact is to be tried by the court. There are many cases, as of fraud, accident, and the like, where in truth the plaintiff may require no disclosure to make out his case, but equity alone has jurisdiction over the subject. In all such cases, according to the proposition now contended for, he may deprive the defendant of the advantage of his answer, by disclaiming the benefit of a discovery. Judge <em>Story, </em>in the same section to which reference has been made, states the rule, in conformity with the authorities before cited, in these words: \u201cIt is an invariable rule in equity, that where the defendant in express terms negatives the allegations of the bill, and the evidence is only of one person, affirming as a witness what has been so negatived, the court will neither make a decree nor send the case to be tried at law, but will simply dismiss the bill.\u201d The bill must disclose the plaintiff\u2019s case. The defendant, by the law of the court, may respond to these charges in his answer, and is entitled to the benefit of it. In the language of the lord chancellor in <em>Pember </em>v. <em>Mathers, </em>and of the rule as precisely laid down by the elementary writers, and by judge <em>Story </em>in the foregoing passage, where the defendant negatives the allegations of the bill, and the evidence is only of one person, the court will not make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>decree, nor send the case to a trial at law. The right to negative the allegations of the bill by his answer is his privilege, resulting from his position as defendant called on to answer and make up an issue, and the plaintiff cannot, by waiving a discovery, deprive him of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\">The case of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>2 Munf. 407. and the subsequent cases upon the same question, have decided nothing as to this point. The proposition now under consideration was not discussed or considered in any of them. But the .case of <em>Gilliam v. Clay &amp; others, </em>3 Leigh 590. does in effect establish a principle which is decisive of this matter, if the general rule is what I have supposed it to be. That was a bill exhibited by the obligor against the assignee of a bond and his trustees, to injoin a sale under the trust deed, and praying for general relief, on the ground of usury. The deposition of the obligee and assignor of the bond was taken, to prove the usury between the obligor and assignee, as alleged in the bill. It was argued, that an injunction might have been awarded only to stay the sale of the trust subject until the question of usury should be tried at law, and that the assignor could have no interest that a decree to that effect should be rendered for the obligor. The witness was held to be incompetent. Judge <em>Carr, </em>in delivering his opinion, in which the other judges concurred, remarked, that it made no difference as to the competency of the witness, whether it was a bill for final relief or not: that it would be carrying the principle of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris </em>to a fearful extent, if the usury was to be proved in that transaction by evidence which would not be heard on a bill for relief: that before a court of equity should injoin the trustee, and send the assignee to sue at law on his bond, for the express purpose of enabling the obligor to establish usury and thereby get clear of the whole debt, it should be well satisfied that usury had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>been practised; and that such conviction must be wrought by competent, disinterested testimony. This case, then, decides that the usury must be proved. The principle of <em>Marks v. Morris </em>was not permitted to control the rules of law as to the competency of the testimony, or to dispense with the necessity of proof. Proof being necessary, it can be offered but in the accustomed mode, upon an issue made up according to the forms of the court; and the weight of the testimony must be determined according to the rules applicable to other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">I think, therefore, that in this case, as there is but one witness against the answer, the decree dismissing the bill on that ground must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AGs\">This renders it unnecessary to consider the other questions so elaborately argued. But for myself I may add, that the testimony does not, in my opinion, make out the usury; and that the case is not as strong as that of <em>Selby </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>3 Leigh 577. in which it was held that a transfer of bank stock, under the circurnstances there detailed, was a fair sale, and not a device to cover a usurious loan of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Baldwin, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b760-7\">Cabell, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ACqc\">concurred in the opinion so far as relates to the necessity of two witnesses to disprove the answer; and also concurred in affirming the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
