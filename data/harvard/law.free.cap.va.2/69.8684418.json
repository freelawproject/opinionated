The <em>will, </em>which was also inserted, was admitted to record in <em>August, </em>1781.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">From sundry depositions it appeared, that the cryer who sold the slaves, was not informed that any of them were the property of <em>James Micou, </em>deceased ; that <em>James Henry </em>Roy, one of the devisees of the slaves, and son of the defendant, was at the sale, and being asked \u201c what would \u201c be dqnq about the qhildyen\u20193 rights,\u201d said to the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>that \u201c <em>if his father did not make them good, he -would not </em>\u201c <em>lose his proportion </em>(but the sale was not forbidden by him, or by any body else ;) that some time in the month of <em>June, </em>1796, (about six months after the sale,) the <em>complainant </em>was informed, apparently for the first time, of the rights of the children ; that sometime in <em>January, </em>1796, the negroes were all sick, and continued so until <em>May ; </em>that in <em>July, </em>a witness was <em>told </em>that they were still sick ; and that the complainant\u2019s application to rescind the contract was made in <em>August </em>of the same year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">The defendant having brought suit at common law against the complainant, on the bond, and obtained a judgment, while the suit in equity was depending ; an injunction was awarded to stay execution until the matters in controversy in equity should be determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">On the final hearing the Court was of opinion, that \u201cthe \u201c sale and purchase of the three slaves in the bill men- \u201c tioned be set aside; and it was decreed and ordered, that \u201c the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of fifty pounds \u201c paid on the day of sale (concerning which there was no evidence, except the allegations aforesaid) \u201c with interest \u201c thereon at the rate of five per centum per annum from \u201c the 1st of <em>January, </em>1796 ; and that the injunction be \u201c made perpetual.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">This decree, on an appeal to the high Court of Chancery, was reversed, and the bill dismissed with costs; whereupon the complainant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-10\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arf\">The grounds of the suit were that <em>Roy, </em>being an executor, advertised a sale of slaves ; not stating whether he sold <em>as executor, </em>or not. The appellant purchased, believing them to be <em>Roy\u2019s ; </em>but they afterwards turned out to be the property of his testator, who had devised them away : upon which he applied to rescind the contract, and to have his money back, which <em>Roy </em>refused, though admitting them to be his testator\u2019s. The answer states, too, drat <em>Sale </em>was dissatisfied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>purchase, because the negroes were diseased. This circumstance, though not mentioned in the bill, yet, being stated in the answer, may be relied on by the complainant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-8\"><em>Roy, </em>as executor,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFi\">had no right to sell unless he shews there were debts which rendered such sale necessary. This he does not: and therefore it was a mere <em>pretext. </em>Besides, <em>Sale </em>knew nothing of the defect in the title before he paid die purchase money; and ought therefore to be protected, as an innocent purchaser. If an executor' sells a <em>specific </em>legacy improperly, the purchaser, if innocent, has a <em>right </em>to hold the property; but <em>may </em>give it up if the legatee wishes it, and he chuses himself to do so ; and the court will compel the executor to refund, where there are no debts to pay, or diere is other property which might be sold. This is the rule where the money has been <em>paid ; </em>but, if it has not been paid, the purchaser <em>cannot </em>protect himself, but <em>must </em>give up the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-9\">But, if this point be against me, it is established by the testimony that <em>Sale </em>was imposed on in the purchase; the slaves being <em>'diseased at </em>the time, which was known to <em>Roy, </em>but not to him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-11\">Randolph, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuR\">If Mr. <em>Call </em>is right, the power of executors is at an end, and they cannot provide for the payment of debts ; for no person will purchase of them. As to the objection that no account of debts is rendered, the answer is, that none is demanded by the bill, nor had the plaintiff a right to one. The only parties are the purchaser and seller; not the specific legatee.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> There the executor sold a specific legacy; and the case was between the legatee, executor, and purchaser: yet the court declared the sale effectual; and that, if it was not necessary to pay debts, the legatee might recover of the <em>executor ; </em>for the purchaser cannot be conusant of the state of the <em>assets. </em>Here, it is objected that the purchaser may <em>waive the benefit: </em>but, certainly, the <em>purcha</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>ser </em>lias no such right: that is a question between the Isgatee and executor only; for, if the executor has paid debts with the money, he has done what he had a right to do, . and ought not to be compelled to refund. The circumstance that part of the purchase money was not paid makes no difference in the case. As to the disease of the slaves, the bill was filed more than a year after the sale, and expressed no complaint of any disease. If there had been such a ground of equity, it would certainly have been stated in the bill. the party here obtained the injunction upon <em>his own </em>oath, and therefore did not make this charge. The testimony proves, too, that when he applied to rescind the contract, he did not mention this objection, but only the supposed defect in the title. The <em>answer </em>does not put the question of disease of the slaves in issue <em>; </em>for the law does not authorise the plaintiff to prove any ground of equity not stated in his <em>bill.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-9\">Call, <em>In </em>reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABL\">If the answer states a thing which is <em>refiled </em>to, it is <em>then </em>a fact <em>in issue ; </em>and the plaintiff may take depositions upon that point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-10\">As the executor relies that there were debts which rendered the sale necessary, he ought to shew it. The presumption is against him, as the will was proved in the year 1731, and the sale did not take place until December, 1795.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b88-10\"><em> 2 P.Wms. </em>148. <em>Ewer </em>v. <em>Corbet.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Saturday, <em>March </em>12th, 1808, the Judges delivered their \u00abpinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b89-12\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad4\"><em>James Micou </em>by his will, which was proved on the 9th of August, 1781, bequeathed certain slaves to the children of <em>Mungo </em>Roy, whom he constituted his executor. In December, 1795, <em>Mungo Roy </em>advertised a sale of between twenty and thirty negroes at his plantation in <em>Caroline </em>county ; one-half of the purchase money o be paid down, and a credit for the balance till the next November, tire purchaser giving bond, &amp;c. No no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tice of the <em>title </em>was taken in the advertisement. <em>William Sale, </em>the plaintiff, became the purchaser of the slaves bequeathed by <em>James Micou, </em>without notice (as he alleges in his bill) that the title was as abovementioned. After the purchase, being informed of this circumstance, at a distance of about eight months, he applied <em>to Roy </em>to deliver up his bond for half the purchase money, (havingpaid one-half down,) and proposed to him to take back the negroes, which <em>Roy, </em>on his part, refused3 <em>Sale </em>then brought a bill in the County Court to have back the money he had paid, and the bond which he had given, upon delivering to <em>Roy </em>the negroes purchased, or such of them as were alive. <em>Roy </em>in his answer insisted he had a right to sell, and did sell the negroes to <em>assist </em>in the payment of his testator\u2019s debts <em>; </em>but does not allege <em>any deficiency of other personal assets. </em>The Chancellor pronounced an opinion (the 'cause being brought before him by appeal) \u201c that an executor\u2019s \u201c legal power to dispose of his testator\u2019s goods, chattels, and credits is absolute. That the statute enacting that \u201c executors shall not sell the slaves of their testators, u<em>n </em>less their other personal estate be not sufficient for pay- \u201c ment of debts, did not <em>abridge </em>the power of an execu- \u201c tor ; did only <em>prohibit </em>him' to exercise it, if the slaves were not requisite to supply deficiencies in other species \u201c of property, first subject to such demandsand dismissed the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"Aac\">I pass over the other circumstances of the case as perfectly immaterial to the question upon which I do.ubt. For I am by no means prepared to yield my assent to the broad terms in which the Chancellor\u2019s opinion is conceived. I can find no. law whatsoever in our code antecedent to the act of 1705, which pronounces the <em>nature </em>of the estate which a man might have in <em>slopes. </em>Being utterly unknown to the common law, we can derive no information upon the subr jeef from that source. The act above referred to, declared them in categorical terms to be <em>real estate, </em>and not <em>chattels. </em>The exceptions which followed in the act, created doubts respecting its true construction. It was explained by the act of 1727, the seventh section of which declares, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201c that no executor <em>hath, </em>or shall have, any power to sell \u201c or dispose of any slave or slaves of his testator or in-<em>u </em>testate, except for the payment of his just <em>debts; and </em>\u201c <em>then </em>only, where there is <em>not sufficient </em>of the personal es- \u201c tate to satisfy and pay such debts ; and, in that case, it \u201c shall and may be lawful for the executor or administrator \u201c to sell and dispose of such slave or slaves, as <em>shall be \u201c sufficient </em>to raise so much money <em>as the personal estate \u201c falls short </em>of the payment of the debts N This is a declaratory law, as is shewn as well by the preamble, as by the word <em>hath, </em>in this clause, and being on a subject where we have no guide but the will of the legislature, must be taken as they have thought proper to express it. it made slaves not <em>general </em>assets, but <em>special assets </em>only, to supply any deficiency in the personal estate, and so jealous was the legislature of the abuse of the authority vested in an executor or administrator by this act, that in the year 1748, they passed another act,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the 29th section of which is, word for word, as that before cited, except that itcxpressly requires the sale to be made at public auction. It is further to be observed, that the legislature at the same session, passed an act,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> declaring slaves to be <em>chattels personal </em>in all cases. This act was refused the royal assent, and consequently never became a law ; but it shews the intention of the legislature to have been to restrain the power of an executor as to selling slaves, although they were willing that they should no longer be <em>real </em>estate. Would the Chancellor have pronounced the power of an executor over the slaves of his testator so absolute, (to use his own terms) as that <em>a private sale of a </em>slave, in \u201c disregard, even in contumacious disobedience to the pro- \u201c hibition,\u201d not to sell except at <em>public auction, </em>would have been valid ? The doctrine contained in his decree seems to me to assert as much. But such a doctrine, I trust, will never receive the sanction of this Com\u00ed in the latitude in which it is expressed. In the present case, the sale made at <em>public </em>auction ; there is therefore no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>. ground to impeach it, as contraiy to the prohibitions of the act. And even if it had been made in private, the <em>purchaser </em>could <em>not </em>rescind it, though the <em>legatee </em>would, not, I conceive, be bound by it: nor would he, perhaps, be bound by a <em>public sale, if the purchaser had notice </em>that -there were either <em>no </em>debts, or that there was <em>other </em>sufficient personal estate to discharge them : and this I find to be the doctrine of the Master of the Rolls, with respect <em>to </em>terms for years, in the case of <em>Ewer </em>v. Corbet, 2 P. <em>Wms. </em>148. and which I think equally applicable to <em>slaves </em>in this country,, under the general provisions of our law, whether specifically bequeathed, or not. I am well aware that there are some <em>general expressions </em>in the opinions of the Court as delivered by the presiding Judge in the cases of <em>Walden </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>and <em>Brock </em>v. <em>Philips,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which may seem contrary to tire principles I contend for.. But the point now under consideration,, was. not before the Court in. either of those cases ; and I hope it cannot be construed as a disrespect to the Court, to dissent from such general expressions, where they may be applied to cases not under their consideration at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In the present case, the purchaser bought the slaves-upon the plantation of the defendant, where a number of others were exposed to sale, at public auction, without any notice of the nature of the sellers right thereto. He might very naturally suppose they were <em>all </em>(as a part are said to have been) his own property. The legatees were <em>all probably </em>present. <em>One of them </em>is <em>proved </em>to have been so. The sale was not forbidden. The purchaser then stands upon the ground of a fair purchaser without notice : nay more, of a purchaser buying with-the knowledge of those who' <em>might </em>claim tide, yet standing by, and not disclosing such-claim. Under such circumstances, the sale can never be impeached by them, whether justified by a deficiency of the personal estate, or not. The purchaser, then, is in no danger from that quarter. That being the case, there is no ground upon which to set aside the sale, for any thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>alleged in the <em>bill. </em>And it ccrtaiuly appears to me, that diere is no equity arising oat of the matter contained in the answer, which I think it would be rnlspetiduig time to notice further.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">On these grounds, and not for those mentioned by che Chancellor in his opinion, I think the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b93-4\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AAn\">It k neither put in issue, nor proved, that the slaves in question were <em>diseased </em>at the time of the sale. The case, therefore, stands merely upon the general question whether the sale of a <em>slave </em>specifically bequeathed, and sold by an executor, <em>at public </em>sale, for the payment of debts due from the testator, can be annulled by the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The case of <em>Ewer </em>v. Corbet, 2 <em>P. Wms. </em>148. (followed, up by the other cases) is decisive to shew that the doctrine Is otherwise in relation to personal estate in general j and that an objection to the sale does not lie in the mouth of a purchaser, however it may be as to the <em>legatee. </em>In that case it tras said with great force, that it is not reasonable to put every purchaser of a lease (the case was that of a <em>lease) </em>from an executor, to take an account of the testator\u2019s debts : and that,, if equity were otherwise, ic would lay an <em>embargo </em>on all personal estate in the hands of executors, which would be attended with great inconveniences : the bill of the specific legatee to recover the term sold by the executor was dismissed ; and, it was decided that the <em>legatee </em>bad no remedy but against the <em>e</em>x<em>ecutor </em>to recover the value of the legacy, in case there were sufficient other assets for the payment of debts. The-\u2019 principle of this decision has been expressly extended to-<em>slaves </em>by the decisions of this Court. In the case of <em>Walden v. Payne, 2 Flash. </em>A it was declared (which, indeed, was before sufficiently evident) that slaves were clearly <em>assets </em>in the hands of an executor, and liable to the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>of debts, &amp;c. and, in the case of <em>Brock </em>v. Philips, 2 <em>Wash. </em>68. the above doctrine was expressly recognised as applicable to <em>slaves. </em>It was there said that, although the principle <em>caveat amptor </em>applied to <em>lands devised </em>to be sold for the payment of debts, it ivas otherwise as to <em>slaves </em>and personal estate ; and that a <em>purchaser </em>of slaves sold at public auction by an executor, for the payment of debts, could not be disturbed. If this doctrine be correct, which I hold it undoubtedly to be, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that there is no pretence that the purchaser, on his part, can annul the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">If it be said that slaves are a kind of <em>special </em>assets, and only liable in the event of the deficiency of the <em>other </em>personal estate to pay the debts, the same may be said of <em>other chattels specifically </em>bequeathed ; but, <em>as to them, </em>the objection does not prevail. Goods specifically bequeathed are liable to a similar exemption, not only by the general principles of law, but by the particular provision of our act. I cannot, therefore, discriminate between slaves, and <em>other goods, when specifically bequeathed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">On the ground, therefore, that the law on this point ought to be considered as settled, and settled on right principles, I am of opinion that the decree of the Chancellor is correct, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b94-7\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A3e\">It is admitted that an executor has no right * to sell a specific legacy for the payment of his testator\u2019s debts, so long as he has in his hands other assets sufficient to discharge them : but whom does the law presume to be the proper judge of the circumstance ? <em>The executor himself: </em>and, therefore, if he sells a specific legacy, when there are . other assets sufficient to pay all the debts of his testator, I conceive it to be sound law that <em>he </em>and his securities are <em>alone </em>responsible to the legatee <em>; </em>and the fair purchaser, for a valuable consideration, at a public sale, without notice, shall be quieted in his purchase. And, supposing the act of 1748, declaring that slaves shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>be sold for the payment of a testator\u2019s or intestate\u2019s debts, <em>only </em>where there is not sufficient <em>other </em>personal estate to pay and satisfy the same, to have been in force when the sale now under consideration was made, (which, however, is not admitted,) yet the sale, being a public one, would \\tave been good, as to the fair purchaser without notice ; for the reason above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The purchase of the negroes by the appellant was made at a public sale, on the 31st of December, 1795, part of the purchase money paid to <em>Roy </em>the executor, and a bond given for the balance, payable the <em>November </em>following. The appellant, finding he had made an improvident purchase, about seven or eight months after, offered to give up the negroes to <em>Roy </em>the executor, whom he required to return the money paid in part of the purchase, and to cancel the bond given for the balance ; under pretence of a defective title in the negroes : but there was not even a suggestion that they were <em>unhealthy : </em>and it is remarkable, that in his bill of injunction, filed fourteen months after the purchase, in which he prays relief against the judgment obtained on his bond, there is no complaint of the unsoundness of the negroes, or either of them : and if appears to have been an after-thought, and a feeble attempt to bolster up an unsustainable equity : and there is no evidence that either of the negroes had been unhealthy, or were so at the time of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">Had the appellant conceived his purchase an advantageous one, we should, probably, have heard no complaint from him ; but he would have defended his title, if called in question, by the laws of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">It appears to me a very plain case, and I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\"> <em>Ed. </em>1769. c. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\"> 1748. c. 5. <em>Ed. </em>1752.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\"> 2 <em>Wash. 7. </em>&amp; 70.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
