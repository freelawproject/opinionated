Though this rule in modern times hath not governed universally, yet it is stated by Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in the case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Laming, 2 Burr. </em>1106, 1107 ;\u2019* that it is never <em>departed from </em>but <em>in favour of intention.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">The rule, with the exception from it, being thus established, we are to inquire, whether the devise to <em>James, for life, </em>be enlarged, either by the second or by the third branch of the clause under consideration <em>f</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-7\">I shall not contend that the estate is enlarged by the second branch of the devise, \u201c to his first and every other son who shall survive him, in tail male, equally to be divided/* 1st. Because the words are descriptive only of <em>certain issue mole, </em>namely, <em>surviving </em>sons5 fee, and not of his issue male generally. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Sicily. Because the estate is to go to them as tenants in common, under the words, \u201c equally to be divided,\u201d and, therefore, cannot pass in a course of descents, which would carry it to the <em>eldest son only. </em>The sons, therefore, must take as purchasers, and, consequently, under the rule which I have before mentioned, the life estate of the ancestor is not enlarged by the devise to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-9\">But I shall insist, that the estate for life is enlarged by implication, by the operation of the words, \u201c and if my said son <em>James </em>shall die without issue male, then to my son Muscoe,\u201d &amp;c. In order to determine and support the truth of this proposition, I will, 1st. consider the devise as if the first and third branches of it had stood together, without the second being interposed ; as if it had been thus-, \u201cTo <em>James </em>for life, and if he die without issue male, then to Muscoe,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-10\">2dly. \u2014 I will consider how far the intervention of the devise \u201c to the first and every other son in tail male equally to be divided,\u201d will alter the case; and lastly, I will close with an inquiry, concerning the intention of the testator, in order to ascertain the influence which it can have in this case, upon the results of the previous reasoning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-11\">1st. I am to contend, that a devise to <em>James </em>for life, and if he die without issue male, &amp;tc. rvould have passed an estate tail to <em>James. </em>Inheritances have been created chiefly by <em>necessary implication. </em>The rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case, </em>furnishes no doctrine, which is not exemplified, and proved, by almost every gift or devise that can be conceived. Thus, in a gift to <em>A. </em>and his heirs, or heirs male, <em>A. </em>has only an estate for life, which is enlarged by the subsequent words, \u201c to the heirs or heirs male. A devise to a man and his heirs male, gives him an estate tail, and the law will supply the words, -\u201c of his body lawfully begotten.\u201d <em>Co. Lit. </em>9 <em>b.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-12\">There are also other expressions which are considered as being tantamount to those before mentioned ; such as \u201c to a man and his seed\u201d; 2 <em>Fern. </em>766. \u201c To one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>and if he hath issue male, that issue to have it\u201d <em>9 Rep. </em>128. <em>Owen </em>29. Ventr. 227. So, \u201c to one, and f be die without issue.\u201d 1 Ventr. 234. <em>King </em>v. Melling. Hob. 30. <em>Venir. </em>250. 1 Rep. 99. If then, the clause stood as I am now considering it, without the inter\u00bb vertion of the devise to the surviving sons, it is olear that an estate tail would have passed to James, be\u00bb cause the remainder to Muscoe, being limited upon the condition that <em>James should die without </em>issue, it could never vest until that event should take place. This brings me to the consideration of the</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-3\">2d point, viz. Does the intervening devise make any difference in the case <em>? </em>If it do, it mu \u00abse be upon one or other of two grounds ; either that the genera! words, <em>u </em>and if he die without issue\u201d <em>must </em>be referred to the intervening and preceding branch of the clause, so as to mean such issue as is there spoken of, to wit, <em>surviving sons: </em>or, that the intervening estate bin\u00bb ders the first devise for life, and the last devise to the issue male from uniting, so as to make the latter, en= large the former, or in other words to vest in <em>James </em>an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-4\">I say these are the only grounds ; because if the devise is (notwithstanding the intervening estate,) to be construed in the same manner as if it had been \u201c to <em>James </em>for life, and if he die w ithoui issue male re\u00bb mainder over; and if the words, 5i and if he die without issue male\u201d are unrestrained, and mean a <em>general failure of issue mule, </em>and not of any <em>particular </em>issue3 then it is absolutely necessary that <em>James </em>should have taken an estate tail, as all the cases prove; because, it is clear, that the remainder over could not vest until there should be a general failure of issue male.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-5\">Here then seem to lie the great points between us. It is admitted, that the devise to the surviving sons does not enlarge the estate; or if issue male mean <em>such </em>issue, it is equally clear, that an estate tail did not vest in the father. But if it can be shewn that the implicative words are oo\u00ed so restrained, then it must be conceded on the other side, that <em>James </em>took an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>I shall at once admit, that an implication to enlarge . an estate, must be a necessary one. \u201c Thus, if there be a devise to <em>A. </em>remainder to <em>all </em>his sons in tail, and if he die without issue male, then to <em>B; </em>it is clear, that the latter words \u00a3\u00a3 and if he die without issue male,\u201d will not enlarge the estate previously given ; because, as the first part of the devise had comprehended <em>all </em>the issue male, the latter part can have reference to <em>none </em>other, \u00e1nd therefore shall be construed to mean <em>such </em>issue male, and consequently will not operate to enlarge the estate. The <em>whole male issue </em>being comprehended, there is no <em>necessity </em>to enlarge the of the latter words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq5\"><em>i </em>But if there be a devise to the first, second, and third sons down to the sixth, or to any other particular number of sons, and \u201c if the tenant for life die without issue male, remainder over;\u201d these words shall not be construed to mean <em>such </em>issue, because the testator, by the <em>generality </em>of the latter words, clearly meant, that <em>all </em>the issue male should take, and the former words having only given the estate to a certain number, if the latter words were construed to mean <em>such </em>issue, a part of the issue would be left unprovided for, contrary to the evident will of the testator. In such a case, therefore, the Judges will not restrict the general meaning of the words \u201c issue male,\u201d but will construe them ta mean <em>all the issue male, </em>and consequently, will determine the estate to be an entail in the ancestor. <em>Langly </em>v. <em>Baldwin, Fitzg. </em>14. <em>The Attorney General </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>1 <em>P. Wms. </em>759. These cases seem to be decisive. They are founded upon the strongest reason, and are in unison with the best established principles of law. And if cases seemingly opposite to these should be produced, they will, if examined, be found not to vary from, but to strengthen the principle established in these cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-9\">The last point to be considered, is the intention. If it be contended that the testator meant to give <em>an estate for life only, </em>to <em>James, </em>because he has used expressions proper to evince such an intention, the answer is, that the intention is equally clear and strong, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>hat <em>all the issue </em>male, of <em>James </em>should take, and that <em>Muscoe </em>was not to take, so long as <em>James </em>should have , issue male; and unless James took,an estate tail, some of his sons might have died in his life time, <em>leaving </em>issue, who would be entirely unprovided for. If then there be <em>two </em>intentions, the one, contradictory to the other, all the authorities prove-, that a preference is given to that, which favours the issue, where it is clear they were meant to be provided-fpr. The authorities, from <em>Shelley\u2019s </em>Case, down to the latest that we meet with, prove, that an estate given expressly for life, may be enlarged by words of implication. But I doubt if one can be produced, where, if the issue were meant to be prov ided for, a construction has been adopted, which went to defeat them, merely because the estate was given to the ancestor <em>expressly for </em>life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-3\">Let it also be remarked, that the reason upon which the cases in England, which aim at the destruction of the rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case, </em>are founded, is, that the tenant in tail might, by suffering a common recovery, bar the provisions intended for the issue, if a construction be made so as to vest the inheritance in the ancestor. This I consider to be the operative reason which has prevailed in those modern decisions which seem to weaken the force of the rule I have been contending for. But this reason could have no influence in this country, whilst estates tail were permitted, because they could not be barred with the same facility.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-4\">I rely therefore, that upon principle, and upon authorities, <em>James Garnett </em>took an estate tail by implication ; and if so, that estate was converted into a fee simple by the Act of 1776, and descended to the lessors of the plaintiff, as the heirs at law of Molly, the only daughter of <em>James Garnett.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-5\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-6\">The rule laid down in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case, </em>considered as a general one, is not denied. But this rule is always departed from in cases where it appears that the testator intended to give only an estate for life to the an \u2018 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>cestor. That such an intention appears in the presen;; case, we are to prove.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-10\">Let it be remembered, that the intent of a testator is to be collected from his whole will, and not from any particular clause in it. This principle is laid down in the case of <em>Baddeley </em>v. <em>Lappingwell, </em>3 <em>Burr. </em>1541, and also in the case of <em>Frogmorton, </em>v. <em>Holiday, </em>3 Burr\u201e 1618. No rule of law is better established than this, that an estate given without any words of limitation passes only an estate for life; and yet, in the last mentioned case, where there are no such words, other words evincing an intention to give a fee, were considered as sufficient to set aside the rule. The intent is the polar star to guide the construction of a will. <em>Swinb. </em>10. 1 Burr. 39. 49. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, Cro. Jac. </em>448. <em>Dougl. </em>321. Having thus admitted the rule contended for to be generally true, and pointed out the principle by which it is to be corrected, I shall insist, <em>first, </em>that the <em>intention of the testator </em>in this case was clearly to give an estate for life only to <em>James. Secondly, </em>there being no rule of law to prevent the issue male of <em>James </em>from taking by purchase, if the intention be clear that they should do so, the words of the devise under con - sideration are not sufficient-to bring this case within the rule w'hich is contended for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-11\">1st. The will shews, that the testator was desirous of disposing of a large estate amongst the male descendants of his name. To effect this, it was necessary to devise it to his sons, and to their male descendants. Hence we see him devising parts to his sons; other parts to his grandsons, the grandchildren of a deceased son, for and during their natural lives severally, with remainders in trust in each devise, for the use of the sons of those sons and grandsons severally, who should survive them in tail male, thereby intimating an intention, that the estates tail might commence in the male descendants of the devisees for life; and hence we find him giving dower to such women as his sons and grandsons might marry, clearly demonstrating, that he considered them as only tenants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>for life, and that, without such a devise, they would not be entitled to dower. Bvst what principally fixes the intention of the testator, and proves that he knew what he was about is, that where he gives express estates for life, he also gives a right of dower to the widows ; but to the widows of the sons of his sons and grandsons, in whom he supposed an estate tail commenced, he says nothing about dower, knowing that the law provided for such. In <em>Bagshaw </em>v. Spencer, 2 <em>Atk. </em>570. 579, the words, \u201c without impeachment of waste,55 were considered as sufficient to take the case out of the rule ; and surely, those words do not furnish stronger evidence of intention, than may be drawn from the provision made in this case respecting dower. The case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling, </em>does not weaken this argument; for though dower is an incident to an estate tail, yet a power to make a jointure (as in the case cited) of the whole estate devised, is not an incident, but repugnant to such an estate, and therefore such a power could not take the case out of the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-3\"><em>Blackborne </em>v. Edgeley, 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>601, may perhaps be relied upon against me. But it must be recollected, that this case was decided prior to that of <em>Bagshaw </em>v. Spencer, and besides, the words <em>i( </em>without impeachment of waste55 were in that case passed over <em>sub silentio, </em>the decision turning upon another point, to wit, that words of implication would turn an express estate for life into an estate tail. And if this principle be true, surely words of implication shewing a strong intent to give no more than an estate for life, which was <em>expressly </em>given, shall retain it in that situation. This brings me to the</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-4\">2d point. \u2014 I shall consider this clause in the will according to the subdivision thereof made by Mr. <em>Campbell. </em>The first member of the sentence, it is admitted, gives only an estate for life. The second member gives the whole fee to <em>Muscoe </em>in trust, and his estate commences only when the estate for life ends ; so that the fee, was not to be for the use of the legal heir of James, but for his use, <em>upon condition </em>that the first son should be that heir, and should survive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>him, jointly with the other sons, not as a joint tenancy, but as a tenancy in common of an estate tail which was to commence in the sons. The sons therefore could not take by descent as tenants in common, because only the eldest son, or his representative, could be heir to the father. From this consideration it is evident that the estate tail was to commence in the sons, which is further proved by the position of the words in the sentence ; the words <em>in tail male, </em>being placed between the words \u201c survive him,\u201d and \u201cequally to be divided.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Laming, </em>2 <em>Burr. </em>1100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-9\">The third member of the sentence is principally relied upon to constitute this an estate tail in <em>James. </em>Considering the operation of this part of the sentence upon the plain principles of common sense, the words <em>issue male </em>would be intended to signify <em>such </em>issue male, that is, a son, or sons surviving <em>James. </em>It might perhaps be even construed to mean the male issue of a deceased son or sons. But here, if there were any surviving son, the heir might be disinherited; and if there, were no surviving son, but the sons ol several deceased sons, they would all of them be issue male under the contemplation of the former member of the sentence, and would take equally; and if they did, the estate would not pass according to the rules of inheritance to the heirs general or special; for by these rules an eldest son is the heir, and so on, to his most remote posterity, and not all the male descendants, deriving their descent through males. The same difficulty would occur, if the words were construed to mean male descendants, either deriving their descent through sons or daughters. Whichever exposition is taken, this conclusion follows, that the estate to the ancestor for life is not necessarily limited by the words \u201c to his heirs general or special,\u201d and therefore the words of the devise are not of themselves sufficient to bring the present case within the rule. Keeping in mind that the intention is to be sought for in the whole, and not in any one part of the will, this conclusion follows, that as it is evident by the second member of the clause, thatan equal division was intended amongst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>all the sons who should survive James, so when the male issue are spoken of, a like intention, as to them, is to be presumed, in case any such should be left. This is the only implication, under which, the law will presume that any estate was by the words devised to them, and they can derive no estate from the words, but by implication, <em>Dougl. </em>264. 3 Term. Rep. 484. This exposition gives effect to all the words, and consistency to every part of the will. That this is a necessary construction, will appear, when another principle of law is considered, to wit, that an express estate for life, cannot be altered by words of implication, 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>54, <em>Bamfield </em>v. Popham, which is recognised and confirmed in the case of <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Legge. </em>3 <em>Term </em>Rep. 488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">Upon the whole, it seems clear, that the true construction of this will is to give to <em>James </em>an estate for life, and to the surviving sons, or to the issue male, estates tail as purchasers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-8\">Washington, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-9\">To avoid the confusion which will generally follow, from plunging at once into the consideration of a multitude of authorities, I will endeavour to class them under four different heads.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">The first, which begins with <em>Shelley\u2019s </em>Case, need not be mentioned, because the rule is well understood and admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-11\">The second comprehends those which raodifv the. rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s </em>Case, and establish the principle, that <em>the intention of the testator </em>shall prevail <em>against the rule.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-12\">This will lead to an examination of the intention in the present case, independent of the latter, which is justly termed the implicative branch of the clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-13\">Though Mr. <em>Campbell </em>has conceded, that the second branch does not enlarge the estate expressly given for life, yet it deserves our consideration, so far as it tends to throw light upon the testator\u2019s intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-14\">The inconsistency into which Mr, <em>Campbell </em>is forced^ ought not to be passed over^ for though he ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>mits, that the parts of the will which we rely upon to . prove that an estate for life was intended, do successfully establish it, and that the intention must prevail, yet he finally concludes that <em>James </em>took a greater estate : those parts are,</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-6\">1st.

And who can doubt for a moment, but that <em>James </em>was meant to take an estate for life only ? What then has become of the rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case, </em>or how can it operate upon this case? The rule is best stated by Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>in the case of <em>Bagshaw v. </em>Spencer, to wit: \u201c that though the intention is to prevail, yet it must not conflict with the settled rules of law.\u201d But what are those rules? The same Judge describes them ; he says, that they will not permit a testator to create a perpetuity; to produce an abeyance; mount a fee upon a fee, or make an heir take chattels by descent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-12\"><em>Shelley\u2019s Case </em>would not apply at all if it were not so modified; for the devise there, is to <em>heirs </em>male, which are words of limitation, whereas <em>issue </em>is pro \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>periy a word of purchase. And in <em>Backhouse </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>it was said, that if the words had been <em>heirs </em>male, operation of law would have over-ruled the intention <em>\u00b0 </em>\u2014 Pow. <em>on Dev. </em>360. Let me conclude my observationsupon <em>Shelley\u2019s </em>Case, by observing, that no Judge has gone beyond the rule there laid down ; the reason of it has ceased, and none are bound by it, but in cases coming strictly within it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">The above view of the question embraces the two first branches of the clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">The third class of cases furnishes a rule, as well established as the one drawn from <em>Shelley\u2019s Case </em>it is, that an <em>express estate for </em>life, cannot be enlarged by words of implication. <em>Bamfield </em>v. Popham, 1 P. <em>Wms. 54. </em>This principle has never been controverted, and is recognised in the case of <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Legge, </em>3 Term. <em>Rep. </em>488 ; also in the case of <em>Letheullier </em>v. Tracy, 3 <em>Atk. </em>784. Now, this is a different rule from that in <em>Shelley\u2019s </em>Case; not affected by it, and is in point, to defeat all the arguments drawn from the third branch of the will. This rule, I said was opposed by no case whatever; I ought to except that of <em>Blackborne </em>v. <em>Edgeley; </em>but that case is not an authority as to this point, because it is founded upon <em>Sunday\u2019s Case, </em>which is not a devise of an <em>express </em>estate for life. This leads to the consideration of the</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-9\">4th Class of cases, which operates upon the rule last mentioned, in the same manner, as the second class does upon that in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case, </em>to writ, to correct and explain it. And the principle resulting from the rule thus corrected is, that an estate for life may be enlarged by words of implication, if the intention of the testator manifestly appearing, <em>cannot otherwise be effectuated. </em>Without this <em>necessity, </em>the estate for life will not be increased; but the word <em>such </em>will be supplied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-10\">Under this view of the question, it will be found, that we occupy the strong ground which the appellant\u2019s counsel think they had secured. For in a case-coming within the rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case, </em>the person who would defeat the rule, must shew <em>an intention op</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>posed to it. </em>AncI this would be our situation, if the issue male claimed <em>by an express limitation. </em>But the limitation in this case, arising only by implication, we pave the rule in <em>Bamfield </em>v. <em>Popham </em>on our side, and the proof of an intention, <em>which cannot otherwise be </em>effectuated,, than by enlarging the estate for life, lies upon the appellant. It is not necessary for us to shew an intention to give an estate for life; the appellant\u2019s counsel must shew an intention sufficient to subvert the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ\">This will serve to introduce the following cases, which will also contribute to exemplify the rule in <em>Bamfield </em>v. <em>Popham. </em>The first is the case of <em>The Attorney General </em>v. Sutton, in which it was contended, that it was the clear intent to give to <em>all the issue; </em>and so it was. For first, a strict settlement was manifestly intended, since it is not to be supposed that the testator could have a preference to a third, more than to a second son, and of course, his stopping at the second son, must have been an undesigned omission.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-7\">2dly. The words of the will in that case too plainly shew an intention to give an estate tail, to have admitted of a doubt; see the note to the report of this case in the last edition of 1 <em>P. Wins. 754.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-8\">3dly. The remainder there, is to a Charity, here to a son.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-9\">The second case is <em>Langly </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>which is much relied upon. In this also, it is to be observed, 1st. That there was a clear intention to provide for all the sons in <em>strict settlement. </em>2d. The course of descents is there preserved \u2014 in our case, it is broken. 3d. In that, the only mark of a contrary intention, is the devisee being freed from impeachment of waste: for that the clause respecting jointure proves nothing, has been well explained by Mr. <em>Warden.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-10\">4th. In that, the remainder over is to a stranger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-11\">These cases only shew, that where the intention is clear, and can only be supported by enlarging the estate for life, the Court will do so; and this we concede. To give <em>James, </em>then, an estate tail, it is absolutely necessary to prove, that the testator <em>meant to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>pfovidejor the sonqfanon-surviving son, </em>Itisnotsuffieientto say, that such a person <em>would be otherwise unprovided for </em>/ because, if this were all, it would be placing the proof of intention upoh us, who are safe under the rule in <em>Bamfield v. </em>Popham, unless an intention to give a larger estate than for life is shewn on the other side. In <em>Bamfield </em>v. <em>Popham, </em>the rule was not departed from, though a posthumous son <em>might have been disinherited </em>under it, and this was an argument much relied upon in opposition to the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">So in <em>Blackborn </em>v. <em>Edgley, </em>though it was objected that the adoption of the rule would prevent the sons and daughters from taking, yet the Court would not, for that reason, dispense with the rule.- So-the same reason was urged in <em>Lethieullier </em>v. Tracy, to wit, the exclusion of a great grand-daughter, yet the rule prevailed. In the case of <em>Wyld </em>v. Lewis, 1 <em>Atk. </em>432, cited in the case of <em>Leihieullier </em>v. Tracy, an <em>express estate for life </em>was not devised. So, too, in 2 <em>Bac. </em>68, who cites <em>Bulstr. </em>63, <em>Dy. </em>171, the rule was supported, though the heirs general might have been excluded. So the case of <em>Doe </em>v. Reason, cited in <em>Doe </em>v. Holme, 3 <em>Wils. </em>244, is precisely apposite to the \u2022present, and answers all the objections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-8\">It is not true, then, that because <em>an inconvenience </em>may happen from the adoption of the rule, that, therefore, it shall be dispensed with 5 but it is essentially necessary to shew7 <em>an intention to provide </em>for the son of a non-surviving son, <em>growing out of the will, </em>for it is admitted that <em>the implication </em>must be a <em>necessary </em>one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-9\">Upon the whole, these points seem to be established. 1st. That the intention of the testator was to give an estate for life \u2014 -the construction contended for, is to defeat that intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-10\">2dly. There is nn evidence of an intention to pro- . vide for the case which is supposed, and, therefore, bo necessity to enlarge the estate of <em>Jamess </em>by implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-11\">3dly\u201e To do so, would defeat the intention in ano- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>and let in the sons of a non-surviving son, the eldest would take by descent, in exclusion of the others, though it was evidently the intention that those who took, should take equally, as purchasers, and, in this respect, our case differs most essentially from that of <em>Langley </em>v. Baldwin, where the course of descents was preserved throughout.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-8\">The answ er given to all our cases is, that they are founded upon the power of tenants in tail in <em>England, </em>to bar the right of the issue. But this is not the reason, as the case of <em>Lethieullier </em>v. <em>Tracy </em>proves ; and besides, there were two ways of barring estates tail in this country while such estates existed ; the one by a writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>and the other by application to the Legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-9\">But if, after all, intention is to be sacrificed, and all the rides of law destroyed, in order to let in the son of a non surviving son, 1 can see no reason why he might not take by purchase, as well as by descent, for <em>issue male </em>are properly words of purchase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-10\">Wickham, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-11\">It is agreed, that an estate for life is given to <em>James, </em>but it is contended, that the remainder unites with and enlarges it; and this doctrine is bottomed upon the rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-12\">To this rule, we oppose that in <em>Bamfield </em>v. <em>Popham, </em>which does most certainly defeat it, wherever the limitation over is not hv <em>an express and direct dezs\u00fce to the heirs or issue. </em>But I contend, that if the devise in this case had been directly to the issue male of <em>James, </em>the remainder could not, npon the principle laid down in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case, </em>unite with the estate for life. It is admitted, that this union can never take place, where the estate for life, and the remainder, are of different natures ; as if the one be a <em>legal, </em>and the other a <em>trust estate. </em>Now, in this case, th\u201de inheritance, after the death o\u00ed <em>James, </em>is devised to <em>Muscoe, </em>in trust, and, consequently, the <em>cestui que trust </em>would have been entitled, before the Statute of Uses, to a merely equitable interest. Is this a case within the operation of the Statute ? I contend that it is n o\u00ed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>because that Statute only vests <em>the legal estate </em>in him, who is entitled to the use or equitable estate, which ( can only be effected, when there is a person <em>in esse </em>in whom the use resides. 1 <em>Rep. </em>1\u00bf6. But, in this case, there never was such a person in being, <em>James </em>having never had any male issue ; and, consequently, the legal estate, which continued in the trustee until <em>James </em>should have such issue, ngver was executed by the Statute, and, therefore, the limitation to the male Issue, never could incorporate with the life estate vested in James\u201e It is equally necessary to produce this union,, that the two estates should pass by the same conveyance. But, in this case, <em>James </em>took under <em>the </em>will, and the <em>male </em>issue, (if there had been such,) <em>under the operation of the Statute of </em>Uses. The only way by which <em>James </em>can take an estate tail, is by uniting the estate, given by implication in the third branch, of the clause, with the estate for life given to him in the first. But if this union cannot take place, from the different natures of the two estates, the certain consequence Is, that he never had a greater estate than for life. If I am correct in this argument, there is an end of the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-4\">The estate for life can only be enlarged, by implication, to favour the intention of the testator. But an implication to destroy the intention is an absurdity in terms. That the testator well knew the difference between an estate for life, and an entail, is proved by the very clause under consideration, where he gives an Intermediate estate in fee to a trustee, which could only have been for the purpose of preventing the union of the two estates, and to preserve that which he knew was contingent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-5\">The testator could not by stronger language have expressed his will not to give an estate tail to his sons and grandsons. The many circumstances to prove this intention, which have been mentioned by the counsel who have preceded me, one would suppose were sufficient. But there is another. There are several devisees, to each of whom he gives an estate for life $ then to the issue. But how <em>f In </em>succession5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>as estates of inheritance must go ? No. But it was . certainly his intention that the <em>issue male </em>should take in the same manner as the <em>sons </em>did, and it is admitted that they took as <em>purchasers, </em>because they did not take <em>in succession. </em>If, then, <em>James </em>is construed to take an estate tail, the issue male would have taken, in a way not intended by the testator. This, then, forms the striking difference between the present case, and all those which have been relied upon by the appellants counsel. In <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling, </em>there is no intervening estate changing the course of descents. <em>The Attorney General v. Sutton, </em>was reversed in the House of Lords. But, admitting its authority, <em>the line of succession </em>was there preserved, and, therefore, the construction put upon the implicative branch of the devise went with the intention. The same observation applies to <em>Langly </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>and <em>Dodson </em>v. <em>Grew, 2 Wils. 322. </em>This last case proves the principle which governed all the others, to wit, that the issue were intended to take <em>in succession, </em>which they could not do, if they took <em>as purchasers. </em>But here they were intended to take altogether, which they cannot do, if they take by descent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-7\">It is contended, that <em>Muscoe </em>could not take so long as <em>James </em>had issue male living; and that the only way by which the son of a non-surviving son could take, was by descent from the father. It is evident that the testator never contemplated such an event, and, therefore, he could not mean to provide for it. But if he did intend that all the issue male should take, it was equally his intention that they should take <em>all together, </em>u hich they could not do, if the construction contended for be correct. Could a <em>grandson </em>of <em>James </em>have taken equally with <em>the sons </em>of <em>James ? </em>Surely not; but the sons would have taken the whole, and left to their nephews a paltry remnant after the expiration of an estate tail. We have-seen that the leaving of a posthumous son unprovided for, does not afford a reason for giving an estate tail by implication, where only an estate for life was intended, and yet this is an event as probable as that now supposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The last branch plainly refers to the children before mentioned, that is, to <em>surviving </em>sons; and the Court will not stretch che meaning of it <em>to issue gene</em>rally, unless induced thereto for the purpose of complying with the testator\u2019s intention, which I have endeavoured to shew would be defeated by such a construction. The word <em>but, </em>is plainly a word of reference to ivhat had gone before ; and that <em>heirs general </em>may, by reference to preceding words, be construed to mean <em>heirs </em>male, is proven by the cases read from 2 Bac. 68c So that the Court will, in this case, take the whole clause together, and correct the last branch by the second, so as to mean, \u201c if <em>James </em>die without male children surviving,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-3\">In many of the devises, the remainder is limited <em>immediately </em>over. For instance, the land devised to his grandson <em>Augustine </em>is, <em>u </em>to him for life, remainder to James, in trust for the use of the sons of <em>Augustine </em>who shall survive him in tail male equally to be divided, remainder to all the sons of his grandsons <em>Francis </em>and <em>Harry, </em>who shall survive them in tail male equally, &amp;c\u201e <em>remainder to his son James and his heirs for </em>everNow is it probable, that the testator meant to provide for the issue male generally in some cases, and to exclude them in others? The whole will should be taken together, and the same intention be presumed throughout s for it seldom happens, that the same idea is by the same person, and in the same instrument always expressed <em>in the same </em>words. We here find the testator sometimes using the words, \u201c for want of heirs\u201d \u2014 \u201c heirs male,\u201d \u201c in default of issue male,\u201d fkc\u201e</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-4\">But suppose that a devise to the issue male generally of <em>James, </em>must necessarily be implied. May they not take as purchasers ? It is assumed as a point given up, that they could not; and yet I can see no reason, why they should not, if it be so intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\">Even <em>heirs, eo nomine, </em>must take as purchasers, if they take otherwise than in the <em>quality </em>of heirs; and the issue male in this case cannot take at all, consistently with the intention of the testator,, unless they take by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>purchase ; for otherwise, they would come in by <em>aic- </em>. <em>cession, </em>and not altogether, which would contravene the intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-10\">Upon the whole, I think there is no principle which will bear the appellants out, in contending that <em>James </em>took an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-11\">Marshall, in reply.' \u2014 The single question in this cause is, did <em>James Garnett </em>take an estate for life, or an estate tail ? I shall attempt to maintain the ground which Mr. <em>Campbell </em>has taken, though I shall not precisely follow him in the rr.N'de of discussing the subject. I shall contend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-12\">1st. That upon authority, the male issue of the non-surviving sons of <em>James </em>must take before <em>Muscoe.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-13\">2dly. That according to the intention of the testator, they must take before him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-14\">3dly. That they must take by descent, and cannot take by purchase,</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-15\">4thly. That if they take by descent, the estate must be in the ancestor, and therefore that <em>James </em>took an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-16\">1st. It is a rule supported by a connected train of authorities, that wherever in a will devising a legal estate, a remainder over is to take effect, on the failure of issue of a particular devisee, or on failure of male issue, that such issue must take <em>in infinitum </em>by the implicative devise, before the remainder man, unless there be strong circumstances to take the case out of the rule. To prove this rule, I cite <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>mentioned by Lord <em>Hale </em>in <em>King </em>v. <em>Mailing, </em>1 <em>Vent. </em>230. <em>Gilb. Dev. </em>38, 39. <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>1 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>185. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Sutton. Robinson </em>v. Robinson, 1 <em>Burr. </em>58. To this rule, I admit there are exceptions, within none of which can the present case be brought, and within some one of them, all the cases cited against us are to be found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-17\">A principle indeed has been urged, which if true in the latitude contended for, would embrace our case. It is, that an express estate for life cannot be enlarged by implication. In the extent it is laid in the books, I deny the principle to be law. <em>Bamfield </em>v. <em>Popham, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>a Lofe In 3 <em>Term. Rep., </em>488, and 2 <em>Bac. </em>68, are cited <em>h\u00bf </em>support of it. it is also laid down In Humberson <em>v. H</em>um<em>berson, </em>which Is decided upon the authoriiy of <em>Bamfield </em>v. <em>Popham, </em>and must therefore stand or fall nich it. In <em>Bamfield </em>v. <em>Popham, all the sons and their issue are provided for. </em>The only argument in favour of enlarging the estate for life was, that a posthumous son might be disinherited, unless the ancestor took an estate tail It is not certain that the argument was applicable to the case, for even admitting that, before the IQtf md 11th of <em>William &amp;1 </em>Mary, a posthumous son could not have taken, it is certain, that the case was provided for by that Statute. This ease was decided subsequent to the making of that Statute, and we are not informed whether the testator died before or after It. But independent of this objection, I contend that the case is not law, and would shortly after have been otherwise decided. St Is admitted, that the testator did not intend to exclude a posthumous son, and yet, the construction there put upon the will, was aga:nst the intention, upon the authority of the legal principle, that an express estate for life cannot be enlarged by Implication. The principle as there laid down is totally unqualified and unrestrained, so that it would prevail against the clearest intention. The principle Is exploded by all subsequent adjudications, and not attempted to be maintained by those which notice it. It Is denied In the ease of <em>Blackborne </em>v. Edgley. I admit that <em>Sundajfs Case </em>does not support the principle for which It is there cited ; but surely the cases which I have before mentioned, do most conclusively over-rule the solitary case of <em>Panfield </em>v. Popham\u201e The decision in the case from, Term,. Rep. turned upon the words of limitation which are superadded, and Is besides, a mere <em>obiter </em>dictum, unnecessarily stated. But above all, 1 rely upon the decision of this Court In the case of <em>Shermer </em>v. Shermer, [ante,\u00a1 vol. L p, 266,) as over ruling this principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-5\">Having cleared the cause of this rule, so much re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>lied upon, I proceed to state the exceptions to the principle I am contending for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-8\">The first is, where the whole issue is provided for by the intervening clause. For, in such a case, it would be unnecessary, and, therefore, absurd, to create an implication for the purpose of providing for those who took by an express devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-9\">The second is, where a plain intention appears to exclude such issue. Within this exception, is the case of <em>Blackborn </em>v. <em>Edgley ; </em>for the testator having declared an intention to, provide for <em>his </em>name, it would have been a manifest violation of his will to create an implication which should let in the females, who were clearly meant to be excluded. The third exception is, where words of limitation are superadded, so as to render the first word issue, descriptive of the <em>person, </em>and yet the issue <em>in </em>infinitum, may take by force of the subsequent limitation. Or where there are other words annexed, making it merely descrip\u00bb tive of the person. Under this exception, is to be ranked the cases cited from <em>Moor, </em>593. 3 <em>Wils. </em>244. 3 <em>Term </em>Rep. 484. <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Gray. Long </em>v. <em>Lamming, </em>2 <em>Burr. </em>1100. The reason of the first member of this exception is obvious. <em>Issue </em>cannot be, at the same time, a word of purchase and a word of limitation. If it be the former, only a life estate passes, as it merely describes the person of the first taker; where it is the latter, the issue take <em>in infinitum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-10\">Now if words of inheritance be superadded, the word issue may be taken as descriptive of the person, and the subsequent limitation will carry the estate to the heirs of the first taker; so that all the issue must be spent before the remainder-man can take. It is also evidence of intention, that the issue should take by purchase. This distinction was taken in <em>Loddington </em>v. <em>Kyme, </em>and has ever since been regarded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-11\">The fourth exception comprehends the cases of trusts. For where application is necessary to be made to a Court of Chancery, that Court will so mould the conveyance, as that the legal construction upon the words of it shall, in favour of the in - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tentjon, be different from what it would have been, if a legal estate had been originally conveyed\u00bb Upon this principle was <em>Bagshaw </em>v. <em>Spencer </em>decided\u00bb 1 might go further and say, that this case is not easily to be reconciled with foregoing cases, or with <em>Garth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>afterwards decided by the same Judge. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Morgan, Bro. C. C. </em>206. But it is not necessary to impeach that case, since the principle upon which the decision was made is inapplicable to this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-4\">This case comes not vod-m any of the exceptions. For, 1st. All the issue are aJot provided for, but, on the -contrary, the sons of non-surviving sons would be disinherited, unless protected by the implicative devise. 2d. They are not intended to be excluded. \u20223d. There are no words of inheritance grafted upon the limitation, nor are there any words descriptive of the person. 4th. Nor is it the case of a trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-5\">2d point. It is always presumable that the issue <em>in infinitum </em>are intended to take before the remainder-man, where the limitation in remainder depends on the failure of the issue of the first devisee. In this case, <em>Muscoe Garnett </em>is to take but at what time ? When <em>James </em>shall die without issue male. Can he then take sooner <em>? </em>The dying of <em>James </em>without male issue, is like a condition precedent. The construction contended for is the same, as it would have been, had the words 66 but if <em>James </em>shall die without issue ma!e/? been omitted Why reject them ? They are operative, there is abundant use for them, and they have a known legal signification. Such words then are never to be rejected. This can only be the fate of such as are senseless or repugnant. The intention to provide for the sons of non-surviving sons, is further proved from the devise to the surviving sons being in tail \u00a7 for if <em>they </em>had been alone the objects of the testates bounty, it would have been more beneficial to them to have had a fee simple ; and though he might prefer the surviving sons to grandsons, it is not easy to assign a reason for preferring the sons of <em>surviving sons </em>to <em>Muscoe* </em>and yet preferring <em>Muscoe </em>to the sons \u201c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>of <em>non-surviving sons. </em>It is also material, that the property is distributed in tail male amongst families ; each son and grandson being considered as the head of that family. It is reasonable to suppose an intention, that the property should remain in the respective families to which it was assigned, so long as there were any male issue to take it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-8\">The counsel on the other side, have laboured to prove, rather that <em>James </em>was intended to take an estate for life, than that the testator did not intend to prefer all the male issue of <em>James </em>to <em>Muscoe. </em>The former we concede. I believe, in all the controverted cases upon this subject, the testator meant to give an estate for life ; but there is no incompatability of intention between giving <em>James </em>an estate for life, and preferring all his male issue to <em>Muscoe. </em>The intention to provide for all the male issue, is equally clear, and must over-rule the other intention. This is clearly stated in <em>Hargr. Law </em>Tracts, 503. 2 <em>Wils. </em>322. <em>Bro. c. c. 220.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-10\"><em>It </em>is contended, that the provision for dower is an unanswerable proof of the intention to give only an estate for life.

The words of the'will in that case, to wit \u00b0 that on a certain event, *- the estate he had given to <em>Thomas </em>and the <em>heirs of his body </em>should be void/? were not relied upon in making the decision of the Court, nor are they mentioned by the counsel. But a trust, and a legal estate, were devised by the same words, and the devisee was adjudged to take an estate tall in the legal estate, and only an estate for life in the trust. If the words relied upon had evidenced an intention to give an estate tail, that intention would have controuled the trust, as well as the legal estate. Of course, the ground of that decision mast have been that which was contended for, to wit, that all the Issue were not provided for. Neither was the decision Influenced by the remainder being limited <em>to </em>a charity $ for it was admitted that such limitations are favored. Though the plea was over-ruled in the House of Lords, yet the principle was established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-11\">Many other objections are made to the application of <em>Langley </em>v. Baldwin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-12\">In that case, as in this, there is an express estate for life given 5 an estate tail to the sons, and the remainder was to take effect on the failure of issue. In what do they differ? Though the sons in this case do not take by succession as in that, y^ei no preference to the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>mainder-man can therefore be inferred. The intention to provide for all the male issue is as crear, as that the sons should take in a particular mode, and ought therefore to be effectuated. It is not more unlikely in this case, that the testator should mean to prefer the sons of surviving sons to the remainder-man, and not the sons of non-surviving sons also, than in that case, that he should prefer a sixth to a seventh son; both were eq: all} unknown to the testator. But the ground of that decision was obviously the principle we are contending for, to wit, that all the issue not being provided for by the <em>express devise, </em>there was an use to be made of the <em>implicative branch </em>of the clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-10\">Third point. \u2014 This is bottomed upon the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s Case, </em>which has never been denied, and is admitted in the case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Morgan. </em>The reason of the rule is, that if the heir do not take by descent, he can only take an estate for life ; for taking by purchase, <em>he </em>only, and not <em>his posterity </em>is described. This principle is stated very clearly in <em>Shaw </em>v. Weigh, <em>Fortesc. 74, </em>78 that where the word issue is <em>nomen collectivum, </em>they must take by descent, and that in all cases where they take by purchase, it is <em>nomen singulare, </em>and the issue without further limitation can only take an estate for life. In our case, the word is <em>nomen collectivum; </em>it must mean all the male issue, or else the issue of that issue could not take, and the remainder would vest before a failure of issue, though by the express w\u2019ords of the will, it is to be postponed Until a failure of issue takes place. The case from S <em>Atk. </em>784, is not in point, because the limitation to the issue is restrained to issue living at the death of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-11\">In <em>Doe </em>v. Laming, the heirs are so described, as to render it impossible for them to take by descent; it would have rendered the devise totally void, and there are also words of inheritance superadded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-12\">It is objected, that the sons of non-surviving sons must, according to the intention of the testator, take equally But I conceive this would go to defeat the intention, and could not be extracted out of the will. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>but by inserting limitations not in the will, and rejecting those tbar are.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-3\">4th. point-\u2014 The principle of this point is founded on <em>Shelley's </em>Case, and is obvious.

The devise under the Statute would execute in the same person, and take effect beneficially to the devisee, precisely at. the same time, with a devise of a legal estate at Common Law\u00bb I have seen no case determined on this distinction, and yet such would naturally occur\u00bb For if the Statute in this case will not execute the use in the ancestor, until the issue come in esse, neither would it have executed it, if the devise had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>been to trustees for the use of <em>James, </em>remainder to the . same trustees for the use of the issue; for the first devisee being in <em>esse, </em>no legal estate whatever, with respect to him, is in the trustee, and is in law just the same, as if the devise had been immediate to James. Yet in such cases, the estates have been united, and therefore, the difficulty stated to the union in this case cannot be a solid one. The case in 2 <em>Wils. </em>322, is a devise immediately to the first devisee, with remainder to the use of the issue, and there we find, that the two estates incorporated, and vested an estate tail in the first taker.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b46-9\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AS9\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The material parts of the agreed case are, that <em>James Garnett </em>by will, devised the estate in question to his son <em>James </em>for life, remainder to his son <em>Muscoe </em>in fee, in trust, for the use of the first and every other son of <em>James </em>who should survive him in tail male, equally to be divided; but if <em>James </em>should die without issue male, then he gave the land to <em>Muscoe </em>for life, with like remainders to his first and every other son who should survive him, in tail male, equally to be divided; but if <em>Muscoe </em>should die without issue male, then in trust for three grandsons and their surviving sons, in tail male, equally to be divided, remainder to his son <em>Muscoe </em>in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">After having disposed of his slaves and other property to his children and grandchildren by the different clauses of his will, he declares, that their respective wives should be entitled to dower. The testator died before the year 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\"><em>James </em>survived that period, never having had a son, but leaving a daughter his heir at law, under whom the appellants claim, insisting that <em>James </em>took an estate tail, under the u ill, which by the Act of 1776, was turned into a fee simple, which descended to his heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">The appellee contends, that <em>James </em>took an estate for life only, on which the Act did not operate, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>that the contingent remainders limited upon that es= tate, being at an end, the remainder to him is become vested In possession,</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\">The conclusion of each party is sight from his premises, and brings us to the question, which of those estates <em>James </em>took, whether for life or in tail <em>?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Upon the face of the will itself, difficulties arise, what was the testators intention ? As usual therefore, authorities are produced, for the purpose of illustrating, or of controuling it ; multifarious indeed, but in general unsatisfactory; containing rules of construction, as well as principles and reasoning from them by different Judges, in many cases obscure and contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In bringing these into review, the gentlemen of the bar, on both sides, have ably discharged their duty, In giving the Court full information on this complicated subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">That the testators intention is to be the general rule of construction, ivas laid down soon after the Statute of Wills, It has never been contradicted, but is amplified rather than- restrained in all subsequent instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The exception to this rule, <em>u </em>that he shall not be \u2018 allowed to control or change settled principles of law9 as established by the Judges/* seems to be as fixed as the rule itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">But another exception,, that the intention shall not Interfere with the established rules of construction, which Judge <em>Blackstone </em>states, as of a flexible nature, has produced, in its application, a variety of reasons and decisions, which I am not able to reconcile, and therefore am inclined,, as I always have been, to look to the will itself, and not to those unsettled rules of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">That the testator intended to devise an estate for life to James, could not be made more manifest than from the will itself, if confirmed by one from the dead, even if that were the testator himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">But if a subsequent part of the will shews a man\u00ed\u00bb' fest intention, though not so strongly expressed, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>provide for all the male issue of <em>James, </em>and both intentions cannot stand, that of the devise for life must yield to the other, which is supposed to be most important in the testator\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p id=\"AW5\">Cases may be classed into those, where the conflict of intention arises from <em>express devises </em>in the will, and those, where they are to be <em>impliedfrom what is expressed. </em>To the first sort, the case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling </em>applies. A devise to <em>A. </em>for life, remainder to the issue of his body by a second wife, remainder over; <em>A. </em>was adjudged to take an estate in tail, as the only means of providing for the issue, who could not take as purchasers, not being <em>in esse, </em>and could only take through the ancestor; and for that purpose, the estate for life was turned into an inheritance according to the rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case. </em>This case is constantly referred to, in most, if not in all subsequent cases, and its principle, as well as its authority, is no where denied.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">In questions of this sort, it has been thought a circumstance of considerable weight, that issue must be taken as a word of limitation, where no words of inheritance are superadded in the devise, because in such a case, if the isue take by purchase, they would only take an estate for life. From hence a distinction has arisen, that where words of inheritance have been superadded in the devise to the issue, the issue has been adjudged to take by purchase, so as not to enlarge the estate of the ancestor; and this was <em>Archer\u2019s Case, </em>1 Rep. 66, and in several cases since. But in others it has been decided not to have produced that effect, and the point has been determined upon another circumstance, to wit, that of the issue being <em>in esse, </em>at the death of the testator or of the tenant for life, or within a reasonable time after; as in the case of a devise to the heirs of <em>I. S, </em>who is living. And under this distinction the parties have rightly agreed, that the devise to the surviving sons did not enlarge the estate for life in James, since the surviving sons not only might, but must take as purchasers, being t\u00a9 take, not in succession, but as tenants in common. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The part of each son would descend to Ills male issue, which would thereafter go in succession m tail male . to the eldest son, and would not, (as the appellee\u2019s counsel supposed,) continue to go in common to all future generations. So far then the estate for life is preserved, being consistent with the other intention to provide for surviving sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">But the difficulty results from the testator\u2019s being supposed to have devised the land to his male issue, upon the contingency of his having no surviving sons, which it is said, he manifestly intended, from having given oyer the estate to Muscoe, upon the death of <em>James </em>without male issue, thereby shewing that he did not intend <em>Muscoe </em>to take the land, so long as there were any male descendants of James. We come therefore to the second class of conflicting intentions, not collected from <em>express devises </em>to the issue, but to be implied from what is expressed; on which subject there are a number of cases, the decisions in which are extremely various, and sometimes contradictory. But the most prevailing rule seems to be, that an <em>express devise </em>for life is not to be changed into an estate of inheritance by implication, unless that implication be a necessary one, because the testator\u2019s intention, to be collected from the whole will, cannot otherwise be effectuated. To take up the present case on this mle. If there be any apparent intention to provide for the issue male of <em>James, </em>in case there were no surviving sons, or In case their male issue should fail, it is evident, such provision, (if the case happened) could no otherwise take effect, than by a descent from <em>James\u00a1 </em>and by that means changing his estate for life into an estate tail, thereby producing that sort of necessity, which will admit a devise, even by implication, to control an express devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The case, furnished by the will, of a chasm between the provisions for part of the issue of <em>James,, </em>and the limitation over upon the failure of his <em>whole male </em>issue, though uncommon, Is not new. The case of <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Baldwin </em>seems to apply directly to it. There, the testal- -r gave to his grandson an estate for life, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>impeachment of waste, and with power to make a to his wife for life, and after his death, devised to his six sons, one after another, in tail, and made provision for no other sons; but added, that if his grandson should die without issue male, the estate should go over. It was adjudged, that from the express limitation over, the testator intended to provide for all the issue male of his grandson, although they should not be one of the six; and as that could not be effected any other way than by desc\u00e9nt from the grandson, the Court adjudged him to take an estate tail, .though expressly given for life. .</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The same thing was done in the case of <em>The Attorney General </em>v. Sutton, where a provision was made for two sons only of the tenant for life, with a limitation over upon his dying without is.sue male of his body. Here then are two according decisions, which apply to the case at bar in terms, and in principle, and if not contradicted, must be considered as fixing a rule of property. The case of <em>Popham </em>v. <em>Bamfield </em>is produced in opposition to those I have just mentioned. That was a devise to <em>Popham </em>for life, remainder to his first, &amp;c. son successively in tail male, and for want of issue male of Popham, remainder over.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">An attempt was made to bring this to the former cases, by supposing that there was a chasm between the provision for the sons, and the limitation over, and this could only happen, and might happen, in the case of a posthumous son, who it was said could not take under the provision. Whether he could or could not is immaterial. The answer which the Court gave was, that though it might have been intended that such posthumous son should take, yet the testator was herein mistaken as to the law, or he might not consider of it, being a remote mischief, or contingency, and therefore supposing he had made provision for all the sons of the tenant for life, his intention might be complied with, without enlarging the estate for life, and both intentions might be preserved. Without taking notice, that this case, being produced after-wards in the case of <em>Blackborn </em>v. <em>Edgley, </em>the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Is said to have exploded the notion, that words of implication should not turn an express estate for life an estate tail, I observe, that the case in principle does not contradict the former cases, being unlike them in this, that in that, all the sons are provided for. This curious case may happen ; <em>Muscoe Gar-nett </em>takes this estate in remainder, as well as all the lands devised immediately to himself, in the same manner as <em>James </em>did, if he has several sons, and they should marry, it may happen, that all of them may die in his life time, and some, if not all of them, leave sons, and his whole estate may go over in remainder from his grandsons, upon the principle he now con - tends for, that an implied remainder to the male issue shall not be admitted. This possibility give a striking proof of the impropriety of departing from established rules of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">An objection is then made, that the intervening bequest to the surviving sons, between the devise for life, and that to the issue by implication, prevents the union of the two last mentioned devises. The rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s Case </em>enlarges the estate for life, into an inheritance, where the devise to the heirs or issue is mediate or immediate; the former describes the case of the present devises. In <em>Fearne on Contingent Remainders,. </em>25, it is said, that the only difference between the limitation being mediate, or immediate Is, that in the latter case, the tenant for life takes an estate tail in <em>possession, </em>and in the former, he takes the estate tail in remainder, dependent upon the determination of the intermediate estate. So that this objection seems to have no weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Another point made was, that under the implied limitation to the male issue, they might take as purchasers, since they were to take, not in succession in tail, but as tenants in common, in the same manner as the surviving sons were to take. This has been mentioned before, not to have been the testator\u2019s intention, or if it had, it was controled by one of the rules of law, stated to be inflexible, to wit; that a testator could not make his land descend to all his sons, in\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>stead of the eldest. So that upon the whole, it seems to me, that if there were nothing more in this case than the point which has been noticed, the Court would be compelled to adjudge, that <em>James </em>took an estate tail in remainder, expectant upon the determination of the estate tail to the surviving sons. But though I am well satisfied in this opinion, some of the other Judges doubt about it, and we thought it unnecessary to decide that point, since admitting that <em>James </em>took such an estate tail in remainder, we are all of opinion against the appellant upon two remaining points.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The first depends upon the devise to the trustee,, The trust commences at the death of James, so as not to include the estate for life devised to him; it comprehends the contingent remainders to the surviving sons, and to their male issue, and the implied remainder to the male issue of <em>James. </em>Perhaps it goes farther, and extends to all the subsequent remainders, since, after the estate for life to <em>Muscoe, </em>a further trust is declared, without naming a new trustee, or without a devise to such new trustee. The legal estate in fee therefore, in trust for the surviving sons in tail male, interposes between the estate for life of James, and the implied remainder to his male issue, which is supposed to enlarge the former into an estate tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">To admit that effect, and to describe the whole interest which <em>James </em>took in the lands, he was tenant for life in possession, with remainder in tail male, expectant upon the determination of the estate tail devised to his surviving sons. And we come to consi der, what operation the Statute of Uses will have on this estate, under the devise to the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">The Statute gives the legal estate to him that hath the use, so that there must be an use, before the Statute can operate upon it</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">In <em>Powell on Devises, </em>283, it is said, that as to per sons <em>in esse, </em>the legal estate is executed immediately; and as to persons not <em>in esse, </em>it vests immediately upon their coming into being, if they <em>come in good time, </em>otherwise it goes over to the next remainder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>man. To apply this. Here was a trust for surviving sons, and for male issue not <em>in </em>esse, and who never <em>same into </em>being, it being stated, that <em>James </em>never had a son in whom either use could vest. The^ood <em>time </em>therefore, for them to come into <em>esse, </em>was expired at the death of James, and the estate either remained in <em>Muscoe, </em>as the trustee, (the trust not being executed by the Statute, but remaining at common law,) or the estate passed over to him as the next remainder-man, either of which defeats the appellants title.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">But then a question arises upon the Act of 1776, whether this was such an estate tail in James, as wan by the act turned into a fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The act operates upon all estates tail in possession, and those in reversion or remainder, after the determination of an estate for life, or lives, or of any lesser estate. <em>James\u2019s </em>estate has been described as an estate tail in remainder, after the determination of a preceding estate tail. It was therefore a greater estate than for <em>life or lives, </em>and consequently not within the operation of the act, so as to defeat the remainder to <em>Muscoe, </em>now to take effect, as there are neither su;: viving sons^ nor male issue in his way.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">So that upon these two grounds to wit, first, that the estate at law remained in the trustee for want of a person coming into <em>esse </em>in whom the use could vest, or when that event was become impossible, passed over to <em>Muscoe </em>as the next remainder-man, and first <em>cestui que use </em>in <em>esse,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Secondly. That <em>James </em>being seised of an estate tail in remainder, after the determination of a prior estate tail, is not such a tenant in tail, whose estate is to be changed into a fee simple by the Act of Assembly of 1776\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">The law therefore is in favor of the appellee, and the judgment of the District Court is to be affirmed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-14\">(1) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 Hen, &amp; Munf, 24,0. 296. <em>Sleighs </em>v. <em>Strider 3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 299, note.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
