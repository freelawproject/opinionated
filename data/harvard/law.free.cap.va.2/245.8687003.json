Five days after this account was made up, to wit, on the 27th of <em>August, </em>1801, he filed his answer in the High Court of Chancery; stating that <em>fourteen </em>slaves were left and claimed by <em>Susanna Fox; </em>of whom <em>fee, </em>including Milley, and her children, and a negro woman named <em>Charlotte, </em>had been sold for the paymentof her debts; <em>fve </em>had been recovered by <em>Joseph Fox; one </em>by the name of <em>Phil, </em>been a runaway for a considerable time, but (as he believed) had been retaken, and would be sold for the benefit of the estate ; and the <em>residue </em>were secreted by <em>Richard </em>Anderson, and .detained in his family ; that the other legatees of <em>Susanna Fox </em>held their slaves by <em>gifts in her life-time, </em>of which her will operated as a <em>confirmation only; </em>but that <em>Richard Anderson </em>and his wife had xio right, except that which they claimed under the will; that he, as executor, never assented to the legacy of <em>Milley, </em>and her increase, to <em>Catij Anderson, </em>and therefore had a right to sell them, to pay the debts of the estate ; that the said estate was largely indebted to <em>himself, </em>as would appear by the certificate of the commissioners who had settled his account; (according to which, a balance, pf 154/. 16.8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>8d. </em>3-4 appeared to be due to him;) that <em>Susanna Fox </em>had jiye\u00bf at <em>Richard Anderson\u2019s </em>for a considerable time before her death, and continued there till she died; that, while sNc lived there, some of the said slaves in her possession were seized by executions, against <em>Richard </em>Anderson, and. released on her asserting her right to them; that if, however, these slaves were liable for the said <em>Richard Anderson\u2019s </em>debts, he, the respondent, claimed them to satisfy a judgment which he had obtained many years ago, against the said <em>Richard </em>Anderson, in <em>Louisa </em>County Court, for nearly three hundred pounds yet unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\"><em>Joseph Fox </em>filed his answer, denying all fraud and collusion with respect to his recovery of the <em>five </em>slaves, which he claimed by a title paramount to that of <em>Susanna Fox. </em>\u2014 \u25a0 No answers were filed by the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-9\"><em>; </em>The plaintiffs having replied generally, a number of affidavits were taken on both sides, which related principally to the circumstances under which the slaves were received, and held by <em>Richard Anderson </em>and his wife, and the reasons which induced the jurors to give such heavy damages. \u2014 &gt; <em>It </em>appeared from these affidavits, as to the <em>first of </em>these points, that <em>Richard </em>and <em>Caty Anderson </em>had been married upwards of twenty years ; that <em>Susanna </em>Fox, aff ter the marriage, went to live with them, and carried with her all her negroes and other- personal property; that she continued to live there until her death; that, during her life-time, some of the negroes were taken by vim tue of an execution against <em>Richard </em>Anderson, claimed by her, and relinquished by the sheriff, in consequence of her claim; and that, after her death, another execution against <em>Richard Anderson </em>-was levied on Jenney, one of the said slaves; the sale forbidden by <em>John Fox ; </em>a Jury impannel-. ed and the property discharged. There was no proof that Mrs. Fox, had given, <em>in her </em>life-time, any of these negroes to <em>Richard Anderson </em>or his -wife; (except that one witness heard <em>him </em>say, that they belonged to him;) nor that he paid Mrs. <em>Fox </em>any hire for the use- of them.

That, as a creditor and surety of <em>Richard Anderson, </em>who was insolvent, the appellant, <em>Nelson </em>Anderson, had a right, in equity, to stand in his place., and \"assert all his rights to <em>Blilley </em>and the other slaves devised to his wife <em>; </em>that the title of <em>Richard Anderson, </em>if not supported by a gift in the life-time of Mrs. Fox, was good under her will; and that the assent of the executor, ought to be presumed from his suffering <em>Milky, </em>and her children, to remain in his possession so long without suing for them.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-10\">In support of this position, it was observed that the bill stated the estate of the decedent to have been amply sufficient to pay all the debts due from it, without sacrificing: the interests of the specific legatees. The executor, in his answer, alleged that the estate was considerably indebted to himself; but the account exhibited by him, having been taken <em>ex parte, on his own motion, </em>and by commissioners selected by himself, was no proof of the truth of this.\u2014 Therefore,</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-11\">2dly. The Chancellor, instead of dismissing the hill, ought to have directed a new <em>account </em>to be taken of <em>John Fox's </em>administration. An, account ought also to be directed of the property which came to the hands of the other <em>legatees; </em>for, though the defendant, <em>John Fox, </em>pretended that the slaves held by them were donations during the life of Mrs. <em>Fox, </em>they really stood on the same footing with <em>Richard Anderson's </em>claim; and therefore, if in fact a sale for the payment of debts was necessary, they ail ought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>abate- in proportion.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Tibs account being necessary, tbr Court of Chancery ought not to have decreed, till all the defendants were before it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-7\">Sdly. The appellee, <em>\"John Cox, </em>ought not to have sold <em>Milky </em>to <em>any person </em>for the payment of a debt alleged to be due td himself, until that debt had been established ; and,- if he had a right to sell, his purchase for his own benefit was not binding, but might be set aside on payment to him of the purchase-money. . The justice of liis claim was very questionable, from the evidence of <em>Kitty Perkins </em>proving his declaration that Mrs. <em>Fox </em>owed him <em>eighty </em>pounds only; and, also, from that of another witness,- <em>(JVilliam Smith </em>JS.-) that the voucher oil which the claim was founded was an <em>acknowledged account, </em>whereas he charged it as a <em>bond. </em>If it was only an acknowledged <em>account, </em>it might have been, barred by the act of limitations. True it is, the executor Could not have pleaded the act against himself; but nevertheless, if the demand was old and stale, it ought not tc bo countenanced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\">The point, that, if the executor had <em>a </em>right <em>to sell, </em>he had \u2022not a right to become the <em>purchaser, </em>was strongly urged, on the ground of the similarity between the office and duty of an <em>executor, </em>and that of a <em>trustee </em>appointed to sell lauds, who, according to a number ox authorities, is not authorised to purchase <em>for his own benefit, </em>but only for the use of <em>cestuy que trust. </em>The authorities cited were 7 <em>Bac. Abr. Gwillim\u2019s ed. </em>p. 181. the case of <em>Whelpdale </em>v. <em>Cookson, </em>1 Vesey, 9. <em>Killick </em>v. <em>Flexney, </em>4 <em>Bro. Ch. Cases, </em>161. <em>Campbell v. Walker, 5 Vesey, </em>jun. 678. and Sugden\u2019s <em>Law of Vendors, </em>in which, from p. 391 to 405. all the doctrine on this subject is contained, and ail the cases are referred to.\u2014 The general proposition laid down by Sugden is that \u201ctrus- \u201c tees, agents, commissioners of .bankrupts, assignees of M bankrupts, solicitors to the commission, auctioneers, cre- \u201c ditors who have been consulted as to the mode of sale, \u201c or any persons who, by their connexion with any other 4( person, or by being employed or concerned in his affairs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>*' bare acquired a knowledge ox his property, are incap<em>a</em>ble of purchasing such property themselves ; except un,c dcr certain restrictions which he afterwards mentions.\u201d This rule is founded upon the principle that there is an irreconcilable difference between the interests of the <em>buyer </em>and <em>seller; </em>since the former buys for as <em>Vatle </em>as he can, and the latter \u00abells for as <em>much </em>as he can. An executor, therefore, ought not to act in both capacities; and, if he sells and buys himself, any person interested may set the sale aside,</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-3\">4thly. The damages assessed by the Jury being cxces\u00bb \u00bfuve, as being greatly beyond tbe value of the slaves, the complainants were entitled to relief against them; especially as their ground of relief was originally an equitable one. It was obvious that the suit at law was not defended.\u2014 <em>Starke </em>summoned no witnesses, and <em>Anderson </em>was not informed when the trial was coming on. The Jury were; influenced to give such vindictive damages by their supposing that <em>Starke </em>had been guilty of a wanton and atrocious in\\ as ion of private property without a colour of title. The evidence, now, shews the contrary; and, if it had been before them, would have produced a very different verdict, What makes the case still stronger is <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>offer to <em>Four </em>to give him up the negroes, and to pay <em>hire </em>for them which, he refused to accept. This shews that the sum allowed him by the verdict was more than just on his own principles, But <em>vindictive </em>damages, in a case of this sort, ought not to have been given j for, as the verdict <em>changed the </em>property, since the recovery in this action of <em>trespass </em>might be pleaded in bar to an action of <em>trover </em>for the same slaves, their <em>value </em>only ought to have been the amount of the damages. The sheriff, too, only did his duty, (as! <em>Richard Anderson </em>had been so long in possession of the property,) and if he had refused to sell, after being indemnified, might have been sued,</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>On the p'art of the appellees, it was insisted that the' plaintiffs in equity were not entitled to relief on the ground of any objections to the administration account; because the action at law Was for a <em>tort </em>\u2014 -for a <em>trespass </em>committed by the public officer, in illegally takiiig away the property from <em>Fox; </em>that the verdict, therefore, ought not to have been influenced by collateral circumstances. ,,,It has been heretofore a practice in the Court of Chancery to grant injunctions to judgments for just debts, on the ground of other actions founded on <em>torts being </em>depending, by the complainants, in equity, against the plaintiffs at law; but that practice is now discountenanced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-10\">The case of a sheriff permitting an escape is similar to this. He is liable for damages, notwithstanding the plaintiff may still proceed against tire debtor ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and, if the <em>escape </em>be voluntary on the part of the sheriff, nothing afterwards will purge it.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The case, also, of <em>Lang </em>don, executor of <em>Dick</em>enson, v. the <em>African Co. </em>and <em>Dockwray,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is analogous to this; for, there, the complainant, executor of Dickenson, brought his bill to be relieved from a judgment which <em>Dockwray </em>had recovered against his testator for a trespass, and the bill was dismissed, as to the defendant <em>Dockwray. </em>So here the sheriff asks to be relieved against a verdict founded on a trespass which he had himself committed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-11\">That <em>Nelson Anderson </em>indemnified the sheriff, and that, therefore, the sheriff ought to have the same remedy which <em>he </em>would have, is an argument of no weight. Starke, the sheriff, either gave <em>Anderson </em>notice of the suit, or he did not. If he did not, <em>Anderson </em>might plead the want of notice in bar of his action against him on the indemnifying bond.. If notice was given, (which is most probable,) <em>Anderson </em>was the substantial defendant to the suit, and the verdict was found against <em>him. </em>The sheriff was <em>AndersoAs agent; </em>as in the case last cited, <em>Dickenson </em>was agent for the <em>African Company, </em>who were compelled to indemnify him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Strike out <em>Anderson </em>from the bill, and <em>Starke </em>has clearly no right to the relief requested; and, in every point of view, <em>Anderson </em>ought to be bound by the verdict as much as <em>Starke.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-4\">If <em>Anderson </em>be entitled to an account, lie may go on for it in another shape, notwithstanding his injunction is dissolved ; for in the case of <em>White, Whittle </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Banister\u2019s Executors,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the injunction was dissolved, and the complainants left to pursue the effects of <em>Banister\u2019s </em>estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">Let it be admitted that the verdict changed the property ; yet the Jury had a right to give more than the <em>value ; </em>the overplus being damages for the <em>trespass. </em>But there is no case where a Court of Equity has granted a new trial for excessive damages, <em>-without proof of fraud.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">As to the point that the executor who <em>sold </em>had not a right <em>to purchase, </em>this is not the law of <em>Virginia; </em>the custom of the country being altogether opposite to this doctrine ; for the rule <em>here </em>is that, if the executor purchased <em>fairly, </em>he had a right to the property ; if <em>not fairly, </em>the sale may be set aside; and that in such cases, the burthen of proof lies on those who suggest unfairness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">With respect to the administration account exhibited <em>by 'John Fox; </em>the universal practice is to admit such accounts, settled before commissioners <em>ex parte, </em>as <em>prima facie </em>evidence. In the case of <em>Quinney </em>v. <em>Jett\u2019s Executors, </em>in the Federal Court, the <em>Chief Justice </em>of the United States decided that the audited account of an executor is <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and that it is incumbent on those who attack it <em>to </em>surcharge or falsify it. The executor may say that he has lost the receipts which he once laid before a competent tribunal; though if he has not lost, it is admitted that he is bound to produce them. If the account is not to be considered as having any <em>effect </em>until settled by a commissioner of the High Court of Chancery, an executor will never know what to rely upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">This would have been a clear case if the account had been filed before the bill: but its being filed <em>since </em>makes no difference ; for a party cannot, by exhibiting a bill in equit y, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>take away the right of the County Court to call the executor to an account under a' positive act of Assembly.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This acccount was taken on the motion of the executor himself ; but that makes no difference; for he acted in conformity with his duty in making the motion. The bill calls for an <em>account. </em>The account which was taken was made a part of the answer. If. die plaintiffs did not like it, they ought to have exhibited <em>exceptions; </em>instead of which they replied generally,</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">As to contribution, the suit is still going on, for <em>that </em>against the legatees, in the High Court, of Chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-9\">In reply, it was argued that the cases cited from <em>Precedents in </em>Chancery, 221, <em>and </em>2 <em>Wilson, </em>294, 295. were both inapplicable. In the <em>former the merits </em>were againsttheagentof the <em>African Company; </em>in the latter, the party was not entitled to recover the <em>full amount </em>of the debt against the sheriff for an escape on <em>mesne process; </em>but only the damages <em>actually </em>sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\">The conduct of the executor was highly fraudulent throughout. Under the circumstances of the case, he had .no right to withhold his assent to the legacy ; his refusal to assent was therefore fraudulent. At first, indeed, he <em>did not refuse ; </em>for the will was recorded, <em>September 1</em>3, 1790, and nothing <em>adverse </em>to <em>Richard Anderson's </em>title appeared until 1792; during all which time <em>Richard Anderson </em>continued in possession. It is presumable, therefore, that he held with the assent of the executor. The producing the slaves to be appraised, and the hiring them to <em>Caty </em>Anderson, was a mere sham to shelter them from <em>Richard Anderson's </em>creditors; as the smallness of the hire (being only <em>six pounds </em>for <em>seven </em>valuable negroes) clearly proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmT\">The executor\u2019s getting possession of <em>Milley </em>and her children was by stealth in the night-time, and his subsequent <em>sale </em>was shortly afterwards. There was no proof that that sale was public, or that it had been <em>advertised. </em>The <em>onus probandi </em>lies on him to exculpate himself by shewing the circumstances. But, whether the sale was fair, or unfair, it was certainly void if no debt rendered it necessary. <em>A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u00e1ale to a <em>third person </em>by an executor is good, though no debt requii-e it; the executor being, in that case, responsible to die legatees ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but it is otherwise where the executor is seller and buyer both. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-4\">As to the account, the decision of Judge Iredell, which gave rise to that of the <em>Chief Justice </em>in <em>Quinney </em>v. <em>Jett\u2019s </em>Executors, must have been founded on a supposition that the practice <em>here </em>ivas to summon all the parties interested, <em>as in England. There </em>the rule in the Ecclesiastical Courts is to serve a citation on the legatees and others ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and, when the account is once settled in that manner, it is conclusive. But, it is said, that the County Court had jurisdiction to <em>settle </em>the account. If so, the legatees ought to have been summoned; if it had not, there is an end of the question. Indeed, said Mr. Wickham, I lay down the broad principle, that an account taken <em>ex parte </em>without summoning the legatees, ought to have very little weight in a Court of Chancery. To consider it as <em>evidence </em>would violate two important rules of law ; that the best evidence the nature of every case admits shall be produced; and that no person shall be judged unheard. It would be unjust to make it incumbent on the legatees to <em>surcharge </em>or <em>falsify; </em>because, although many items might be altogether fictitious, it might not be <em>in their power </em>to shew their impropriety ; it being impossible to prove a negative. But, be the general principle as it may, in <em>this case </em>the bill of the complainants demanded an <em>account; </em>not an account taken <em>ex parte </em>before commissioners nominated by the executor himself and appointed by the County Court without the knowledge of the legatees ; but an account before a commissioner of the Court of Chancery, in presence of all the parties ; not an account <em>merely recorded without examination^ </em>as is always the case in the County Courts ; but an account \u00a9pen to scrutiny and exceptions, <em>before it should be received.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">The account itself, as exhibited, is highly objectionable rm its face; PAo-Sc, a valuable negro girl, having been credit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ed at <em>17l. 10s.

Whether there was any actual gift by Mrs. <em>Susanna </em>Fox, in her life-time, of the slaves in question, to her daughter, the wife of <em>Richard Anderson \u00b6 </em>It seemed, I thought, to be conceded, towards the close of the argument, that there was no evidence.of such a gift; nor have I been able to find any direct evidence in the record to thatefiFect; and the-presumption from circumstances is, I think, against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">2. That if Mrs. <em>Anderson </em>was entitled only as a legatee, the executor, Mr. Fox, had assented to the legacy. This is flatly denied by the answers, and there is neither direct <em>nor </em>collateral evidence to contradict the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\"><em>3. </em>That Mrs. <em>Fox </em>left assets sufficient-to pay all her debts without recourse to her slaves, which were specifically devised. Upon this point the evidence is very unsatisfactory. The executor swears, that the will of Mrs. <em>Fox </em>directs her just debts to <em>be first </em>paid, and authorises her-executors to dispose of <em>any part </em>of her estate for that purpose ; which is correct. He then proceeds to state, that his testatrix left only fourteen slaves^ whom he names, <em>fve </em>of which, also named, were sold, and the produce of the sale credited the estate; but the account to which he refers, has omitted a credit for one of them, named Charlotte\u00bb Another, whom he <em>states to </em>have been a runaway for a considerable t'ime, and to have been retaken; and that he would be sold for the use of the estate, is not mentioned in the account referred to, nor in any subsequent account. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>H </em>That the estate of his testatrix, after a <em>full settlement </em>of all accounts with him, is greatly indebted to him, as will \u201c appear by a certificate of the commissioners appointed for \u201c that purpose.\u201d The account thus referred to, appears to have been submitted by an order of <em>Louisa </em>County Court, after the commencement of this suit, <em>on his own motion, </em>to six commissioners named by the Court, or any three of them, to whom it is referred to <em>examine, state, </em>and <em>settle </em>the same, and to make report thereof to the Court, which <em>three </em>of them accordingly did, at the next succeeding Court. The bill contains a prayer that <em>Fox </em>may \u201c <em>settle </em>\u201c <em>his executorship of the estate of his </em>testatrix\u00bb\u2022\u201d but does not suggest any fraud in the account rendered; probably, because it was after the bill was filed; nor is there any exception to the answer, to which it js said to have been annexed, nor was there any motion for a reference thereof to a commissioner, as perhaps ought to have been done, unless it was intended to <em>accept it, altogether, </em>as it stood. And, although a general replication was made to the answer, and a general commission awarded to take deposit tions, none appeared to have been taken, with a view to sitreharge, or falsify, the executor\u2019s account. But the account is objected to as a mere <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, on the <em>motion </em>of the <em>executor himself, </em>without having been first summoned to render his account, and without any summons issued to the legatees, creditors, or other .persons interested, to appear and attend, and contest the settlement if they should think proper. This appears to he the course of the Ecclesiastical Courts in <em>England, </em>as cited <em>by </em>Mr. <em>Wickham,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but I have strong grounds to believe has never been practised in this country, even in the former General Court, which united common law, chancery and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, within its powers, and was the Supreme Court in this country, until the revolution. To call in question a practice sanctioned <em>by </em>that of the Supreme Court of the country for perhaps a century, and never, that I know of, drawn in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>question before the present occasion, is what I canno't pre -' sume to do. It ought,- therefore, I conceive, to be taken as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the several charges, and credits therein contained. But Still, any person interested therein, may, I Conc\u00e9ive,be at liberty by a bill in equity to <em>surcharge </em>and <em>falsify </em>the whole, <em>if capable of adducing </em>satisfactory evi-&gt; dence to that purpose. The present account, for example, ftiay be <em>surcharged </em>by a reference to the defendant\u2019s own answer, which admits the sale of one of the negroes, (Char<em>lotted) </em>not credited in that account. It may, perhaps, be <em>falsified </em>also, if it be true, as suggested by the appellant\u2019s counsel, (though possibly he may be mistaken,) that there - was in fact no bond from the testatrix to her executor. The presumption is against him upon the face of the account* Which states the amount Of the principal even to a farthing, and changes interest upon it from a particular day, which. Was probably the date of the bond. I mention it only to illustrate thy conception of the proper course in such cases-, Which I take to' be this : The party who wishes to open an executor\u2019s account, (which has been returned and audited by commissioners appointed by the Court which granted the probate of the will,) by a bill in equity, in order to surcharge and falsify the account so audited and admitted to record, ought in his bill to suggest the grounds' Upon which he means to surcharge or falsify the account r and call for the inventory, appraisement, and account of sales of the estate, together with the vouchers in the hands of the executor. And, in case of any fraud, concealment, or diminution in the inventory, or in the accounts rendered, he ought to suggest the Same in his bill, and seek a discovery <em>; </em>or, if any fraud or malpractice shall have been committed, or so supposed, in the payment of debts, or the -Settlement of accounts, or in the conduct of the sales, these things ought also to be specifically charged in the bill, that the executor may discover the sanie by his answer. And, upon a reference to the commissioner, the accounts so Audited and returned to the Court granting the probate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ought to be admitted in every respect as just and true, except as to such articles as may be <em>surcharged </em>or <em>falsified by </em>the evidence <em>produced to him.</em><footnotemark><em>(</em>1)</footnotemark> In the present case, as there was no motion made for a reference to a cornmissioner, I am inclined to think it was not incumbent on the Chancellor to refer the accounts, (as I see no necessity for putting the parties to such an expense, where the accounts are neither long nor intricate,) were it not that the answer itself disclosed the omission above noticed, therein. This of itself was sufficient to direct a reference, and the omission to do so, was, I think, an error. Especially as there were some other reasons, arising also out of the answer, to suppose that the executor has not rendered as perfect an account of the assets which came to his hands, as possibly he <em>might; </em>or that <em>he </em>omitted to possess himself of such parts of the estate of his testatrix, as he notices'in the latter part of his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">As to the purchase of the negroes, <em>Milley </em>and her children, by the executor himself, I am <em>by no </em>means prepared to say, with the counsel for the appellants, that he is to be regarded as a <em>mere </em>trustee, as to the property of his testatrix, so exposed to sale, and purchased by himself. If this Court were to declare the law to be such in all cases, even-where there was an undoubted deficiency of assets, and, although the sale should have been made after due notice, at public auction, and with all possible fairness, it would probably be the immediate parent of a thousand suits in Chancery, to set aside such purchases, either in behalf of the legatees, distributees, or creditors; although, as fre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>quently happens, the executor should have been largely is advance for his testator\u2019s estate, and should have saved it from total ruin by his exertions. What would be the consequences of such a doctrine, if we were to declare that the progeny of a female slave, so purchased, at any distance of time, might be recovered against the representatives of a deceased executor, or those claiming under him ? The practice has been too general in this country, and has prevailed too long, to be now drawn in question, by analogy to the doctrines in England, concerning trustees of lands, or commissioners of bankrupt. For though executors and administrators are, <em>to many </em>purposes, considered as \u25a0trustees in a Court of Equity, they are not so <em>in all cases,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At the same time, I am free to declare, that I think there <em>may </em>be cases, where the sale of a slave by an executor may be avoided by a legatee, distributee, or creditor of the testator, as I have before said, during the last-term, in the case of <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Roy,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>from which opinion I have found no reason to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">It only remains to consider two other points :</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The recovery by <em>Joseph Fox </em>is expressly denied both by that defendant and <em>John </em>Fox, the executor, to have been by <em>collusion, </em>I therefore think the bill was properly dismissed as to him. The suit for contribution, I understand, is still depending before the Chancellor. Nothing, therefore, ought to be said as to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The next question is, whether the injunction ought to be dissolved at this stage of the proceedings. And I incline \u25a0to think it ought not; for the damages against the sheriff who levied the execution and sold the slaves, appear to be Vindictive, rather than according to the value of the pro*perty as twice before sold at public-sale. And, if the complainants should, upon the final hearing of the cause, be entitled to relief, they would, in that case, be kept out of the money which they had wrongfully paid, for a long time. For these reasons, I do not think the injunction ought to be dissolved, and I concur -in the decree which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>has been agreed to in conference by tire unanimous opinion of the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"b279-4\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"A4D\">There is no doubt but that the damages given in this case were vindictive, and that the jury in assessing them, had not a due regard <em>to </em>the injury actually sustained. This is evident from the testimony of three of the jurors themselves ; from a comparison of the sum recovered with the prices for which the slave in question lradt been twice sold at two several <em>public </em>sales; and from the offer of the appellant <em>Anderson, </em>to give her up with her increase, in lieu of the sum recovered. It is a case in which, I presume, even a Court of Law would, on a timely and proper application, have granted a new trial; as such Court would have had sufficient <em>data </em>from whence to infer that the verdict had greatly exceeded the standard of justice. But as to a Court of Equity, the case of <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Pines,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>informs us, that, although, in niatters of <em>tort, </em>a Jury is not bound to an exact calculation, yet, where a verdict is owing to sudden passion in the Jury, it ought not to bind; but <em>it </em>is the duty of the Chancellor, in such case, to moderate the verdict. In that case, this temper in the Jury was merely <em>inferred </em>from the enormity of the second verdict compared with the first, and confronted by the Judges\u2019 certificate, that the verdict was against evidence: In this case, this temper is admitted by the jurors themselves, and is further manifested by a reference to the <em>data </em>just mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Notwithstanding this character of the verdict, however, if this were now a mere law case, as no motion for a new trial was made in the Court of Law, I should doubt whether this Court ought, on this ground, to interfere. Even the <em>alleged </em>circumstance, that <em>Anderson </em>received no notice from his co-plaintiff of the pendency of the suit againsi, him, and therefore did not defend it, would probably not furnish a just exception from the general doctrine. It ought not to affect a verdict duly obtained by the appellee, against a proper and sufficient party.</p>\n<p id=\"ARpG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>But this is not a mere legal controversy. Circumstances exist in it which could not have been properly and availaply brought forward in the trial at law, and which are peculiarly proper for the interposition of equity. For exam-pie, the public sale of the slave in. question, and purchase by the executor, purported in him a complete legal title : but in equity it is <em>more practicable </em>and more proper than at law to, impeach that sale by an inquiry, (which will involve an account of the executorship,) whether it was rendered necessary for the payment of debts, and whether it was competent for the executor <em>himself </em>to purchase. On these grounds, ulterior to any existing in the case at law,, or at least existing more efficaciously in a Court of Equity, it is competent in such Court to impeach the verdict and demand a hearing of the case in equity, although a motion for a new trial was omitted to be made before the Court in which the verdict was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"AMnO\">It is not.necessary to decide, how far an <em>ex parte </em>settlement of his accounts by an executor, with commissioners appointed by the County Court, on his motion, is valid. That question is very important, and I should require to be aided by a fuller argument than has yet been urged, were it now to be solemnly settled. I believe, however, that the usage and understanding of the country has been to give to such settlements <em>some </em>validity. But, as to the ease actually before us, I am clearly of opinion, that, after a suit is brought against an executor, the direct object of which is to inquire into and enforce a full and fair settlement\u2019 of' his accounts before the Court of Chancery or its commissioners, the defendant shall not elude that object by slipping away into another County, and making an <em>ex parte </em>settlement by auditors appointed on his own motion. A settlement of this kind,\u2019and made under these circumstances, shall not affect or arrest the avowed object of the suit, as before mentioned. I lay no stress upon the circumstance, that the record does not exhibit any <em>particular </em>motion on the part of the appellants for a reference of tho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>accounts to a commissioner. The bill is always before ihe Chancellor, and it contains a prayer for an account. In the case before us, the settlement exhibited is not only of the character just mentioned, but it omits a credit of a negro, admitted by the answer of <em>J. Fox </em>to have been sold, belonging to the estate in question. This circumstance alone is conclusive, that a new account is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">As <em>to the </em>general question, whether an executor can purchase slaves sold by himself at public sale, <em>zuhen necessary for the payment of debts, </em>neither is <em>that question </em>necessary to be decided in the case before us. The considerations on which the decisions cited on the part of the appellants are founded, appear to me to be important; but I am not, at present, prepared to say how far these decisions consist with <em>the </em>usage and understanding of this country upon this subject; or what might be the consequences of adhering, in cases of this hind, to tire principle stated jn those decisions, I have, however, no hesitation to say, that a purchase made by an executor of property sold by himself, in a case where in truth <em>no sale was </em>necessary, may be vacated. In the case of <em>Ewer </em>v. <em>Corbet,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>cited last term in the case of <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>the decision in which case entirely conformed to jt, it was held that a purchaser of personal goods from an executor shall not have his title impeached,for that it is not reasonable to put every pur- \u201c chaser from an executor <em>to take an account of the lestau ioFs </em>debts, and that, this would lay an <em>embargo </em>on per- \u201c sonal estates in the hands of executors, which would be \u201c attended with great inconvenience.\u201d As to <em>strangers </em>who purchase from executors, these reasons hold very strongly; but, as to the <em>executor himself, </em>who is at all times conusant of the state of the testator\u2019s affairs, the reason seems to fail; and, if an executor sells and purchases in himself property which he knows (or might know) he had no right to sell, he is not injured, and cannot complain, if his purchase under such circumstances, should be vacated. I have no difficulty, therefore, in saying, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>if the state of the testator\u2019s assets in the case in question (whic-h will be ascertained by the account to be taken) did not justify the sale of this, or some other part of the pro-&gt; petty devised to <em>Richard Anderson, </em>the sale itself should ge considered as if it had never been made.</p>\n<p id=\"AVF\">As to contribution from the other legatees in this case, the plaintiffs have brought the cause to a hearing without including such legatees. Such contribution, therefore, (as between the parties to this suit,) cannot be decreed. Th\u00a9 plaintiffs, however, will still have liberty to proceed against them, and, if their property be liable, may, in the final ar.rangernent in this suit, make an end of the whole case by obtaining against them also a decree for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag5\">It results from these ideas, 1st. That an account ought to be taken of the state of <em>S. Fox's </em>assets; 2dly\u00ab That if \u2022that result should shew that the sale and purchase by <em>J. </em>Fox, of the slave in question, was made unwarrantably, and without necessity, (of which the Chancellor will judge <em>on </em>the report made to him by the commissioner,) the sale shall be considered as invalid, and the property in the said negro as having existed in <em>Richard Anderson, </em>at the time of the levying the execution under which she was purchased by the appellant, <em>N. Anderson. </em>This result would put an end to the cause, and call for a perpetual injunction to the judgment in question; and, 8dly, That if, on the contrary, the sale and purchase be justified, and the slave In question consequently considered to have belonged to <em>f. Fox </em>at the time of the sale to the appellant; the verdict in the trial at law, for the trespass, having been produced by Improper motives on the part of the Jury, and being for a sum greatly exceeding the yalue of the slaves, or any injury which the appellee has sustained by the trespass; a new trial ought to he granted, and the appellants made liable only for the sum recovered in such second trial. I am of opinion, therefore, that the decree be reversed as to <em>John Fox, </em>the injunction continued, and the cause remanded tq be proceeded in, in conformity with the ideas now stated;,</p>\n<author id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u2022Judge Fleming</author>\n<p id=\"A1q\">pronounced the following as the de'8 ree wliich had been <em>unanimously </em>agreed to in conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u201c This Court having maturely considered* &amp;c. is of opinion that the said decree is erroneous in dismissing the \u201c appellants\u2019 bill as to the said <em>John </em>Fox, instead of direct- \u201c ing an account to be taken \u00f3f his administration of the es - 144 tate of his testatrix, the said <em>Susanna Fox ; </em>but that there 44 is no error in so much of the said decree as dismisses 44 the bill against the said <em>Joseph </em>Fox. Therefore, it is 44 decreed and ordered that so much of the said decree as \u201c is stated above to be erroneous, be reversed ; that so 44 much thereof as is stated not to be erroneous* be affirm- \u201c ed, &amp;cs And this Court proceeding to make such de- \u201c cree as the said Superior Court of Chancery ought to 44 have pronounced, It is further decreed and ordered, 44 that the said <em>Thomas </em>Gardner, administrator as aforesaid \u201c of <em>John Fox </em>deceased, do make up before a commission-4,4 er to be appointed by the said Court of Chancery* a full 44 and true account of the said <em>John Fox\u2019s </em>administra\u00bb 44 tion on the \u00e9state \u00f3f the said <em>Susanna Fox </em>deceased, after 44 due notice to the adverse parties ; and that the Said c\u00f3m44 missioner make report thereof to the said Court of Chan-44 eery for further proceedings to be had thereon.
