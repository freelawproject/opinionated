The confession of judgment fixed the value of the money, and furnished the Clerk with a standard for ascertaining the value of the'sum mentioned in the condition.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-9\">The appellee brought an action of debt in the District Court of Fredericksburgh, on a bond, with a condition, payable in <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency. The declaration was for the penalty, <em>viz. </em>1800/. <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency, of the value of 1440/. <em>Virginia </em>currency. After oyer, the defendant pleaded payment. He afterwards withdrew his plea, and confessed judgment generally. The judgment was entered up for <em>18001. Pennsylvania </em>currency, of the value of 1440/. current money of Virginia, to be discharged by the payment of 720/. current money of Virginia, with interest and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-10\">From this judgment, the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAYg\">Campbell, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-11\">Though it is certain, that if 1800/. <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency is equal to 1440 <em>Virginia </em>currency, the ha,lf of the former, must be equal to half the sum of the latter, yet as the value affixed by the plaintiff is merely arbitrary, a general confession will not warrant a judgment for the value fixed by the party himself. What the value of foreign money is, is always a fact to be ascertained by a jury, and not by the calculation of the Clerk.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-12\">Lee, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-13\">The declaration having stated the value of the foreign money, the confession of judgment generally is an acknowledgment that the value is truly stated,\"and renders the aid of a jury altogether unnecessary. The. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>sum acknowledged to be due is in truth the penalty, and the permission to discharge it with a smaller sum, is an indulgence to the obligor. To do this, the condition, with the standard thus agreed upon by both the parties, was properly resorted to ; and as the sum in the condition is the. half of that in the penalty, and the parties have agreed upon the value of the penalty in <em>Virginia </em>currency, half that value must be the sum to which the appellee is justly entitled. But if the appellant is unwilling to avail himself of the benefit of the condition, I am willing to put it out of view, and to take a judgment for the very sum confessed by the defendant, which is 1440/. But I have always supposed, that it was neither usual, nor proper, for the party to assign for error that which is for his advantage.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b201-3\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-hp\">If a verdict had been given in this case, It would have been necessary for the jury to have found the value of the <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency, since this is a fact proper for their inquiry. But the appellant by confessing a judgment, rendered the interference of a jury unnecessary, since he acknowledged that he owed the appellee 1800/. <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency, <em>of the value </em>o/T440/, <em>Virginia </em>currency. Having thus furnished a standard the sum by which the penalty was to be discharged was easily found. I think there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The other Judges concurred in opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
