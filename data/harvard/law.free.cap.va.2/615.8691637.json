He stated a variety of matter for the interposition of a Court of Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-14\">The Chancellor granted the injunction; but, upon the coming in of the answer, dissolved it. At a subsequent day, he reinstated the injunction, and directed a new trial of the issue at law. From this <em>order. Price </em>took an appeal. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b632-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The Attorney-General, for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOOR\">insisted that the order of the Chancellor was a mere interlocutory proceeding in the cause, instituted for the purpose of informing his conscience as to the merits of the question, before he could be prepared to render a final decree. Although an appeal might be allowed, by the Chancellor, from an interlocutory decree, yet it must be such a decree as <em>affirmed </em>or <em>disaffirmed </em>some right of either party.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b632-3\">Randolph, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJN\">contended, that this was not the ordinary case of an interlocutory order. <em>Price </em>had obtained a judgment at law; and the object of <em>Strange's </em>bill was to have a new trial. By granting a new trial of the issue at law, the right of Strange. had been affirmed, and that of <em>Price </em>disaffirmed. As long as the order for a new trial remained unexecuted, the judgment of <em>Price </em>would be suspended by the injunction.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\"> The law, by which the Court of Chancery is authorised to grant appeals from interlocutory decrees, is in these words: <em>\u201c </em>It shall be \u201c lawful for the High Court of Chancery, upon any interlocutory decree, \u201c where the right claimed shall have been affirmed or disaffirmed, to grant, in its discretion, an appeal to the Court of Appeals, if the High <em>\u201c </em>Court of Chancery shall be of opinion, that the granting of such ap. ** peal will contribute to expedition, the saving of expense, the fur- <em>\u201c </em>therance of justice, or the convenience of parties.\u201d See <em>Rev. Code, </em>vol. 1. p. 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Under this act, it has been held, that although the <em>High Court of Chancery </em>might allow an appeal from an interlocutory decree, yet that the Court of Appeals could not do it. 1 <em>Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>553. <em>Bowyer </em>v. <em>Lewis. </em>2. That appeals from interlocutory decrees must be allowed, if at all, by the Chancellor <em>in Court, </em>and not by the Judge in vacation.

The Chancelkir, on a motion for that pwpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>dissolved the injunction; but at another day reinstated it&gt; and directed a new trial, and that the verdict should be certified to the Court of Chancery. From this order an appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The verdict not having been set aside altogether, but only a new trial directed, in order to inform the conscience of the Chancellor, I am of opinion that the right was not so far determined as to authorise an appeal; and that this appeal should now be dismissed as having been prematurely allowed.</p>\n<author id=\"b633-5\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AEj\">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Chancery, <em>reinstating </em>an injunction, which had been dissolved, and directing another trial of the issue, in the action at law, in which the judgment enjoined was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">I presume that so much of this order as <em>reinstates </em>the injunction, is as little the subject of an appeal, as an order <em>granting </em>an <em>injunction; </em>and in that case, the allowance of the injunction by the Judge neither affirms nor disaffirms the right of the defendant to avail himself of his judgment at law, but merely <em>suspends </em>the effect of such judgment, until the further order of the Court, or until the matter can be heard in equity. That case, therefore, does not come within the act of 1798,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> which extends only to cases, where a <em>decision </em>upon \u201c the right claimed,\u201d shall have been given, although a <em>final </em>decree has not been rendered in the cause. It is a solecism to say, that an appeal lies for the purpose of <em>correcting </em>an erroneous opinion of an inferior Court, in a case, in which, <em>in </em>fact, no decision has been given. Neither is the case otherwise, in relation to that part of the order, which directs another trial of the issue. This award of a new trial has no manner of effect upon the rights of either party; but is only preparatory to a decision thereupon, to be <em>afterwards </em>rendered. It is not by virtue of the award of the new trial, but in consequence of the <em>granting </em>or <em>reinstating </em>the injunction, that the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>of the defendant is affected: but that right is affected (as is before said) by no decree, <em>affirming </em>or <em>disaffirming </em>the same, but only by an order enjoining or suspending it.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">I \u25a0 am therefore of opinion, that the Court of Chancery had no right to grant, nor this Court to entertain, this appeal, but that it ought to be dismissed, and the cause sent back to be proceeded in.</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-11\">Judge Fleming said, it was the unanimous opinion of the Court, that the appeal had been prematurely allowed,, \u2022and ought to be dismissed,</judges>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b633-12\"><em> Rev.
