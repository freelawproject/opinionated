The verdict referred to in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>bill of exceptions, (among other circumstances,) found that wari:ant on which the <em>caveatee </em>made his entry of <em>150 </em>acres, \u201c was all appropriated before the same was \u201c made but said nothing concerning the entry of 30 acres by virtue of that warrant: neither did the testimony of the surveyor, with the list of entries exhibited by him, nor the, said verdict, mention any thing concerning the other two entries of the <em>caveatee </em>of 198 and 2Q acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">The Jury returned a verdict in which they found the entries, surveys and patents made and obtained by <em>Harvey, </em>the <em>caveator, for 25 </em>and <em>130 </em>acres, as aforesaid; but said nothing,about his entry and survey of <em>97 </em>acres; the platt and certificate of which were nevertheless inserted in the record. They also found that the warrant for 2,906. acres, No. 10,629, was exhausted before <em>Preston </em>made his entries of <em>150 </em>and 30 acres; but said nothing about his other two entries aforesaid, amounting to 218 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_X\">It appeared from the first verdict, that <em>Preston\u2019s </em>entry of 150 acres was not surve3red until the 13th of <em>December, </em>1793, when his inclusive survey was made; and although a certified copy of a survey and platt was inserted in the record, (by wrhat authority does not appear,) shewing that his entry of 30 acres was surveyed the 16th of <em>March, 1785, </em>it does not appear that his other entries, of 198 and 20 acres, were ever surveyed until the time of the inclusive survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-10\">The District Court decided, that, upon,the whole matter, the law \\vas for <em>Robert Harvey; </em>\u201c therefore it was consi\u201cdered that no grant issue to the said <em>Thomas Preston </em>\u201c for the <em>land mentioned and described in his inclusive sur- </em>\u201c <em>vey caveated by the said Robert Harvey? </em>&amp;c. from which judgment <em>Preston </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AyV\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj4\">said, that tire objection taken in the first bill of exceptions was a good one, The question was, whether a warrant was exhausted by prior entries. To prove this the <em>book </em>of entries ought to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>produced; the testimony of the surveyor from memory being not the best evidence the nature of the case would admit, and therefore exceptionable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-8\">The second exception was also well founded; because-the Court had held a former verdict on the same point to be conclusive. He allowed it to he <em>good </em>evidence, but not <em>conclusive; </em>for it may be repelled by <em>other </em>evidence: as a Jury may find a verdict describing boundaries* which anaother J ury may find incorrect. This is certainly the rule in <em>ejectments ; </em>for, after the decision of one ejectment against the plaintiff, he may bring another for the same land against the same defendant, and this would be of no use if the finding of the former Jury was <em>conclusivei </em>The advantage of a former verdict is great, however, by way of <em>inducement </em>or <em>persuasion </em>to the second Jury; but it is not conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-9\"><em>Caveats </em>are Unknown at common law; but there is good reason for not holding them to stricter rules than <em>ejectments; </em>because in a <em>caveat </em>no issue is made up; and no information is given of the points in dispute, except by the <em>caveat </em>itself. This is not the same case with that reported in 3 <em>Call, </em>495. In that suit <em>Harvey </em>claimed <em>187 </em>acres, concerning which there is <em>now </em>no question;</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-10\">Wickham, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa3\">The case reported was \u00e1 <em>caveat </em>to a grant on this very survey of 590 acres. I admit that our <em>caveat at that tim\u00e9 </em>related to a different <em>part </em>of the land from our <em>caveat now. </em>But, in the argument of that case, I went upon the ground that the <em>xvhole </em>survey was radically wrong, <em>Preston </em>got permission to make an inclusive survey by an order of Court under the act of assembly,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> prescribing the mode of obtaining inclusive surveys and grants. Under this authority he attempts to unite <em>three </em>different rights; one a survey and patent, another a survey under an exhausted warrant; the third an entry without a survey at ail. An <em>inclusive survey </em>applies onh to cases where there have been <em>actually previous surveys; </em>and an <em>inclusive grant </em>to cases only where there had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>been actually <em>separate grants; </em>the law therefore does not comprehend <em>Preston\u2019s </em>case. There was no original survey of the 218 acres ; therefore there could have been no <em>resurvey. </em>This point is the same as that decided in the case reported, which is therefore precisely the same with this. Assume, for argument\u2019s salce, that the warrant for 2,906 acres was not exhausted; still the other objections to die survey were such that no grant could issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-8\">As to that warrant, the circumstance, that a number of the entries referred to did not appeal- from the surveyor\u2019s book, to have been made under it, was unimportant; because it sufficiently appeared that there had been entries, prior to those of Preston, to the full amount of the warrant. Patents are frequently issued where the entry says orily \u201c by virtue of a state warrant.\u201d In such cases, therefore', a warrant never can be considered as exhausted, unless the testimony of the surveyor be admitted to prove that it has been exhausted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-9\">There is no analogy between an ejectment and a- <em>caveat.</em>The latter is conclusive between the parties, and settles the. dispute as finally as a writ of right. It is not denied that a verdict in <em>ejectment </em>is not conclusive: but a verdict in <em>trover,, </em>or any other action that- <em>concludes </em>the right, is conclusive between the parties, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-11\">What is it that <em>Preston </em>wants? A grant on a- survey made without authorityj 180 aci-es without any warrant: 218 acres not surveyed at all. If it be said that those 218 acres were entered before <em>Harvey\u2019s </em>entry, I answer, it is enough for him, as caveator, to shew that he has a claim, whether correct or <em>not; </em>provided his adversary\u2019s claim be such as ought to be <em>caveated. </em>If <em>Harvey\u2019s </em>title be defective, <em>Preston </em>may <em>caveat him-</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-12\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuN\">Once more I ask the Court to consider <em>what </em>the judgment is, which I say ought to be reversed. <em>Preston\u2019s </em>survey is prior in every respect to <em>Harvey\u2019s </em>rights. Yet the <em>caveat </em>and <em>the judgment </em>is, that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>grant shall ever issue to <em>Thomas Preston </em>for the 218 acres, which are free from all the exceptions about the exhausted warrant. I admit it was wrong to comprehend them in the <em>inclusive </em>survey; yet they were <em>surveyed. </em>The land is not to be forfeited; yet it is to be cut up by the comprehensiveness of <em>Harvey\u2019s caveat, </em>and of the judgment. Let the project of <em>caveating Harvey </em>be tried: A man of one thousandth part of Mr. <em>Wickham\u2019s </em>sense would defeat the <em>caveat; </em>since the judgment now in question not being reversed, would be set up against it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-3\">We have the lines delineated in the inclusive' survey: the Court have declared it void as an- <em>inclusive </em>survey; but it is good as a <em>separate survey of the parts; </em>and the sur veyor may be made to strike out all but the 218 acres, our title to which is admitted to be good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-4\">As to cases cited to prove that parties are estopped by a verdict: wherever a verdict operates <em>in rein, </em>or maybe pleaded <em>in </em>bar, it is conclusive. Not so in ejectment, because in that action every fact decided in a preceding ejectment may be controverted. The Courts in this country ought to be as liberal in <em>caveats </em>as the British Courts are in <em>ejectments. </em>Is the decision in a <em>caveat peremptory </em>against a man who holds a <em>patent </em>in his hand at the time, but fails in his <em>caveat ? </em>The principles of law do not warrant such a doctrine, which, if it prevailed, would unsettle many good titles. According to this doctrine, a man holding# a patent <em>caveats </em>another; if he fails in any of the critical learning about caveats, he is. to lose his freehold altogether. But surely, he may lose in the caveat, and afterwards stand, a trial in <em>'ejectment </em>on the validity of his patent,</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-5\"><em>Wickham. </em>We only contend that the grant shall not issue on the <em>survey now in question; </em>not that surveys cannot be made on the entries for 218 acres, <em>I think </em>that surveys <em>cannot now be </em>made on <em>those </em>entries. But, if I am wrong in this, <em>Preston </em>may proceed to have them made.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>If he has lost the title, it is by his own fault, for not surve&gt;'inS' according to law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKS\"><em>Randolph. </em>The attempt is to deprive us of the possibility of shewing that we still retain the legal right to those J218 acres..</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b75-11\"><em> Rev.

The Judges delivered their opi- . \u00abions.</p>\n<author id=\"b78-7\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"A-E\"><em>Harvey </em>entered a <em>caveat </em>against the emanation of a patent to <em>Preston </em>for 590 acres of land, on a, survey dated the 13th of December, 1793, because-he claims part of the land therein contained under a better right, which he sets forth accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Mr. <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee, contended, that the question now presented to the Court had been already decided in. this Court, in the case between the same parties, reported in 3 <em>Call, </em>495. And, at first, I was inclined to suppose it was. But, on reference to the record in that case, I find the judgment was, that no grant should issue to <em>T. Preston </em>for <em>that part of the land </em>contained in his inclusive survey, which is included in the said <em>R. Harvey\u2019s </em>survey of 187 acres; which was the only part in controversy in that suit. The title to the residue of the 590 acres, therefore, was not affected by that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">On the trial of the present <em>caveat, </em>the defendant offered two bills of exceptions to the opinion of the Court, which were allowed. The first alleged that the plaintiff introduced the surveyor of the County, with a list of entries and surveys referred to, to prove that the defendant had, by prior entries, exhausted the warrant on which his last entry was founded; which surveyor also proved that, <em>as to a number of entries referred to, it did not appear in his books that they were made under the warrant in question. </em>And the defendant objected to the evidence of the sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>-,'eyor\u2019s <em>certificate to the said </em>list, as not the highest evidence which the nature of the case will admit of; but the objection was overruled by the Court, and I am strongly disposed to think that they erred in so doing. For, in a question of that nature, I think the book of entries itself ought to have been introduced, that the Jury, by inspecting the original entries in each case, might determine wheth\u00e9r any or all of them were made upon, other warrants; more especially when it came out upon the oral testimony of the surveyor, that <em>as to a number of entries referred to </em>in the list it did not appear <em>in his books </em>that they were made <em>on the -warrant in question. </em>This part of the testimony might have the effect of warning the Jury not to place implicit confidence in the list submitted to their inspection; but, on the other hand, the permitting the list to go to them as evidence might tend to mislead them. And it has befen decided in this Court that the permitting any improper evidence to go to the Jury, is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The second bill of exceptions states, \u201c that the counsel \u201c for the plaintiff moved the Court to direct the Jury, that \u201c a verdict on which a judgment was rendered in another \u201c trial between the same parties, was <em>conclusive evidence to </em>\u201c <em>prove the fact of the -warrant being exhausted; </em>the find- \u201c ing in the said verdict being in a trial between the <em>same </em>\u201c parties, in which the <em>same point </em>was controverted, and in which the title to the same land was in controversy, as \u201c was the subject of the <em>caveat </em>then depending, and <em>finds </em>\u201c <em>the same fact; </em>and the Court directed the Jury, that the \u201c said verdict was <em>conclusive </em>evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">It has long since been settled, that a verdict on the <em>same </em>point, and between the <em>same </em>parties, may be given in evidence, though <em>the lands are not the </em>same.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But this is to be understood with this restriction, that it is of a matter which <em>was in issue </em>in the former cause.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> And, not only .between parties, but between <em>privies </em>also, is the verdict ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>missible evidence.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Now, here the question was, in both cases, as <em>to </em>the validity of <em>Preston's </em>last entry; the <em>fact </em>put in issue being that the warrant upon which that entry was made had been <em>exhausted </em>by <em>prior </em>entries. I therefore think the verdict was rightly admitted to go to the Jury: and on the authority of <em>Shelton </em>v. Barbour, in this Court,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> where the question was, whether the evidence offered should have been left to the Jury as <em>circmnstantial </em>evidence only, or as <em>conclusive </em>evidence of the fact in issue ; and this Court decided, that the District Court erred in not instructing the Jury that it was <em>conclusive </em>as to that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The question now is, whether there must be a <em>new trial </em>between the parties, because of the admission of the evidence excepted to in the first bill of exceptions, which I have already spoken of, as erroneously admitted. It is in general true, that if the Court admit <em>any </em>improper evidence, upon a trial, which is made to appear by a bill of 'exceptions, there <em>must be </em>a new trial. I was, at first, inclined to suppose, that the present case furnishes an exception (and probably the <em>only </em>exception) to the rule. For the error apparent from the first bill of exceptions was, I conceived, completely cured by the matter contained in the second bill of exceptions; the evidence excepted to in both instances being adduced to prove <em>one and the same </em>fact, upon which fact the merits of the case entirely depended; viz. whether <em>Preston's </em>warrant was <em>exhausted </em>by <em>prior </em>entries. And, although the Court admitted improper evidence as to that fact, at first, yet as <em>further evidence, </em>and that conclusive between the parties, was also adduced to the <em>same </em>fact, I thought that it would be a vain thing to reverse the judgment for the first error, and to direct a new trial to be had, in which the verdict should be admitted as conclusive evidence of the fact in question, since the result (except as to costs) must be precisely the same, as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>we should affirm the judgment. And, though it might seem a little hard to throw the .costs upon the appellant, where there has been <em>any </em>error, yet, as, by his own shewing in the second bill of exceptions, that error was rendered unimportant by subsequent <em>conclusive </em>evidence to the same fact, I thought it would 'be running the parties to much unnecessary expense, if, from a mere scruple in respect to costs, we should award a new trial. But, from a further examination of the record, I find that the conclusive evidence arising out of the verdict in the former suit relates only to <em>Preston\u2019s </em>entry for 150 acres of land, made on the 20th of <em>August, </em>1785, of which <em>Harvey </em>recovered in the former <em>caveat </em>the part included within his <em>flarvey\u2019s') </em>survey of 187 acres; but has no relation to <em>Preston\u2019s </em>entry for 30 acres under the same warrant, made antecedent to the entry for 150 acres, 'nor to the entries for 218 acres, made under other warrants; touching which the former verdict contains no evidence that it was exhausted. Consequently, as to these entries, the evidence objected to in the-first bill of exceptions, remains unfortified by the <em>conclusive evidence </em>in the first verdict. There ought, therefore, to be a <em>neto trial, </em>unless there be some other reason, arising out of the record, to the contrary. This reason, I apprehend, is furnished by Mr. <em>Preston\u2019s inclusive </em>survey, which I am of opinion was not authorised by the act relied on,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> which I concur in thinking relates only to patented lands.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Upon <em>this point, </em>therefore, I am o\u00ed opinion, that the judgment of the District Court must be affirmed, with some small amendment, viz. that no grant issue to <em>Thomas Pres-ton in, pursuance of his inclusive </em>survey, made the 13th day of <em>December, </em>1793, under an order of the County Court of <em>Botetourt, </em>granting leave to him to comprehend in one survey his several adjoining claims.</p>\n<author id=\"b81-10\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa5f\">The question made by the first bill of exceptions, need not be decided by this Court. That question, in relation, as well to the inconveniences and conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>quences possibly resulting from a reversal of the decision of the District Court, as to the actual practice of surveyors touching the point in dispute, may be so <em>important, </em>that, without necessity, and with no greater lights than I have at present, I shall be unwilling to pass an opinion upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The decision,' to which that exception was taken, was, that the surveyor (with the list of entries) was admitted to prove that the land warrant, No. 10,629, was <em>exhausted </em>before <em>Preston\u2019s </em>entry for the 150 acres was made. Admitting, for the present, that this testimony was <em>illegal </em>to prove this point, is not the error cured by the decision mentioned in the second bill of exceptions ? That decision is that the verdict, in the former case, between the same-parties, respecting the same land, and going to <em>this very </em>point, is conclusive evidence to establish the point. If this last decision be correct, was not the former error of the Court merged in <em>it, </em>and deprived of all power and tendency to injure the cause of the appellant? for the latter covers more ground than the former, and destroys its effect. He could not be <em>injured </em>by the admission of illegal evidence to a particular point, if, afterwards, legal and <em>conclusive testimony </em>was exhibited, under the express sanction of the Court, which overwhelms the former testimony, and concludes and shuts up the point forever. In such case, it is the <em>latter </em>and not the <em>former </em>testimony, which produces the verdict of the Jury. It has often been decided here, that an <em>error </em>of the inferior Court cannot be complained of, or appealed from, if it be beneficial to the party appealing. In the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Harmanson,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in debt on a bond, the Jury found a verdict of an <em>aggregate sum </em>of principal and interest, for which judgment was rendered. This Court was of opinion, that, although this was erroneous, yet, being- for the benefit of the defendant, (inasmuch as it stopped the continuing interest,) he could not complain of it, or appeal on that account. In the case of <em>Pendleton </em>v. Vandevier,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> <em>Pendleton </em>was appellant, and complained of a judgment against him for land: the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Was reversed; but this Court being of opinion that <em>Vandevier </em>ought to recover a <em>greater </em>quantity of land, the judgment was entered for such greater quantity, and <em>Vandevier </em>also recovered the costs as the <em>party </em>prevailing, inasmuch as the error of the Court below was <em>in favour </em>of <em>Pendleton. </em>Many other decisions might probably be found going to establish the same principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The doctrine then seems to be established, that a party shall not complain of, or reverse a judgment for, an error which is beneficial to him. It is but pursuing the same principle to say, that a judgment shall not be reversed for an erroneous decision, unless some injury could <em>possibly </em>have resulted therefrom to the party appealing. This Court does not sit here to reverse judgments for erroneous opinions on mere abstract or immaterial questions; but to give redress to parties <em>grieved </em>by the decisions of the inferior Courts,</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">In the case before us, no injury could have arisen to the appellant from the admission of the testimony excepted to in the first bill \"of exceptions, because, as I have already said, that testimony was entirely superseded, and rendered unnecessary to be considered by the Jury, by the superior and <em>conclusive </em>evidence of the verdict mentioned in the second bill of exceptions. It is said to have been settled here that the permission of any illegal evidence to go to the Jury, is error. This is admitted as a general position ; but, in a case like this, it is not such an error as to cause the reversal of the judgment. This distinction seems warranted by the principle of the cases before stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">There is no doubt but the opinion of the District Court, in relation to the admission of that verdict as evidence, is right. The case of <em>Shelton </em>v. Barbour<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> is full up to this point, and perhaps goes beyond <em>it; </em>and in the case of <em>Pegram </em>v. <em>Isabell,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the doctrine in that case seems admitted, <em>as between parties and privies, </em>by the counsel on both sides. In <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>the same objection was taken as is here taken, viz. that the former verdict was only <em>persuading </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>evidence; but the objection was overruled, and the verdict declared to be <em>conclusive </em>evidence. It is unnecessary to , fortify the solemn decisions of this Court by repeating the reasons on which they are founded; but it is evident that the rule in question is a wise one, inasmuch as it is necessary that an end be put to litigation, and in order to provide against the loss of testimony, &amp;c. On the other hand, the adverse parly is not injured, for he had an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses on whose testimony the first verdict was founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">On these grounds, <em>Harvey </em>was entitled to prevail against <em>Preston </em>on the merits, as to all the land which he (Preston) claimed by virtue of the warrant, No. 10,629. As to the residue of the unpatented land, claimed by <em>Preston's </em>other entries, the <em>inclusive survey </em>in question is incompetent to bar <em>Harvey\u2019s caveat; </em>it being still my opinion that an inclusive survey does not extend to lands held merely by <em>entry. </em>As to this residue, I presume that the judgment of the District Court has reference only to the <em>inclusive </em>survey, which is opposed by the <em>caveat. </em>It ought not, and, I presume, does not, affect any ulterior claim or survey, (a separate one for example) by which <em>Preston </em>may <em>possibly </em>hold this land. If, however,, there be any doubt on this subject, I agree that the decision of the Court may be so expressed as to be fully understood upon the point; and, upon the \"whole, that the judgment of the Distinct Court be Affirmend.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\"><em> Sherwin </em>v. <em>Clarges, Bull.
