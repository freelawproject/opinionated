An action on the <em>case </em>for consequential damages was held not to lie ; but that the proper action was trespass to <em>et armis.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-16\">The distinction between trespass to <em>et </em>armis, and trespass on the <em>case </em>for consequential damages, is this : \u2014 that where the act done is <em>in itself </em>an <em>immediate </em>injury to another\u2019s person o.r property, <em>there </em>trespass <em>m et armis </em>will he, and nor such action on the case ; but, where the act is not <em>immediately </em>injurious, but only by <em>consequence, </em>and <em>collaterally, there </em>no action of trespass <em>vi et armis </em>will lie, but a special action on tlie <em>case </em>for the damages consequent on such act.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b439-17\">In trespass to <em>et armis </em>it is immaterial whether the injury be committed <em>wilfully, </em>or not.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b439-18\">The <em>species of action </em>will be designated by the.

At this trial, the defendant moved the Court to instruct the Jury that the plaintiff could not maintain his action under the facts proven in the cause. The Court refused to give the instruction,, and the following bill of exceptions was tendered, sealed, and made a part of the record. 44 Memorandum, at the trial of this cause, the 44 plaintiff having proved by several witnesses, that the de44 fendant <em>John </em>Taylor, through neglect, and for want of due caution, <em>but -without any design to </em>injure, had dis-44 charged a loaded gun in a public place where many peo44 pie were assembled, and that the contents of the said 44 gun, had struck the said plaintiff in his leg, and had 44 wounded him grievously, having also proved that in con-44 sequence of the said wounds, the said plaintiff had lost 44 his leg, had been run to great expense in curing the said <em>'\u25a0i </em>wound, and had been rendered unfit to carry on his 44 trade arid business as before ; and this being all the evi44 deuce offered in the case, the defendant by his attorney 44 moved the Court to instruct the Jury, that the plaintiff' 44 could not maintain this action, under these facts estab44 lished in this case in a special verdict. But the Court 44 were of opinion that the plaintiff could maintain this ac-44 tion under these facts, and refused to instruct the Jury to 44 find the facts established in this case in a special verdict. 44 To which opinion of the Court, the defendant, by his at-44 torney, excepted, and prayed that these his exceptions 44 might be saved to him, and this his bill signed and seal-44 ed according to law.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Judgment was rendered upon this verdict; and, on appeal to the District Court, the judgment was affirmed ; from which affirmance <em>Taylor </em>again appealed to this Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-13\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ1\">relied on the following points : 1. That the action being <em>trespass on the </em>case, and the charge in the declaration being for a <em>direct and immediate injury accompanied by </em>force, the action could not be maintained. In support of this position, he cited 3 <em>Blacks. </em>Com. 123. 208. and the cases of <em>Day </em>v. <em>Edwards,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Leame </em>v. <em>Bray.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-15\">If it be said that this is a declaration <em>in </em>trespass, and not <em>in </em>case, because of the words \u201c <em>with force and </em>arms\u2019\u2019 inserted in it j the answer is, 1st. That the declaration charges the defendant in a plea of <em>trespass on the case; </em>2d. That the essential part of the declaration in trespass, the <em>eontra pacem, </em>is omitted ; and 3d. That the writ is <em>in ease, </em>which as to the designation of the action is a part of the record, according to the decision of the Court in <em>Savignac </em>v. <em>Roome.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-16\">2. That the charge in the declaration is by way of recital only; and not a direct averment. Whether this declaration be considered in <em>trespass vi et armis, </em>or <em>in case, </em>the want of a direct averment is equally fatal. The <em>gist </em>of the action must always be positively <em>laid.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-17\">3. That the instruction given by the Borough Court at the trial, and stated in the bill of exceptions then filed was erroneous ; because the defendant is liable in <em>trespass </em>for involuntary acts injurious to others, where there is neglect or want of due caution, but not in <em>case ; </em>as is expressly said by Lord <em>Mansfield </em>in the case of <em>Tarlton v. Fisher.</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>trespass </em>it is not necessary that the plaintiff should shew the trespass was <em>wilfully </em>committed ; but in <em>case </em>it is necessary to prove that the act was <em>maliciously- </em>done <em>; </em>the <em>quo animo </em>being all important.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-18\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4xc\">The first position which I am to maintain is, that the action-is well brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The first reason is, that die plaintiff, when the injury is <em>\u00a1minediate, </em>may bring trespass for the <em>-whole </em>iujury, or waeu for tlx*, <em>consequences </em>only, even where they proceed immediately from the <em>force. </em>Tor a man may <em>-waive </em>the injury, and go for the <em>damages </em>only. An analogous case Is, that the plaintiff\u2019 may bring <em>trover </em>or <em>trespass, </em>for the same cause of action. So if a person lake goods wrongfully ami sell them, the owner may bring <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for the price, though ii is clear tint he might have maintained <em>detinue </em>or <em>trover.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Of course, he may elect to include the <em>whole </em>in trespass, or the <em>consequences </em>only In case.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The case of <em>Watson v. </em>Norbury, cited from <em>Style, </em>p. 201. is perfectly analogous. There the plaintiff first recovered in <em>trespass </em>and then brought <em>case </em>for consequential damages, and the action was supported. In the present case the plaintiff brought his action for expenses in physicians\u2019 bills, and for attendance, and the <em>force </em>was only-laid as inducement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-17\">In Alcyn, 84. <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> it appears that the plaintiff brought <em>case </em>for taking down his fences, <em>per quod </em>the cattle from the common entered on his soil and did the damage; although this was a trespass on the plaintiff\u2019s own soil. So in 6 East, 388.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> it is laid down that an action for <em>crim. con. </em>may be brought in <em>trespass </em>or <em>case. </em>The case of <em>Ash </em>v. <em>Brudnel,</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is much stronger than the present. There, <em>case </em>was supported for an act which was simply a <em>trespass </em>\u2014 for tearing oiF the seal of a deed. <em>In 2 Vin. Abr. 13. </em>pl. 40. <em>case </em>tor burning deeds. 1 Roll. <em>Abr. </em>104. <em>Let. </em>K. pl. 3. <em>case </em>for pulling off the tiles of the plaintiff\u2019s house. Though it was said that <em>trespass </em>would lie in such case ; yet <em>case </em>would also lie, because it was alleged that by pulling off the tiles the water penetrated and rotted the timbers of the house. In all these cases, the damages were consequential, and necessarily grew out of the force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-18\">Other authorities shew that, where the damages are in any degree <em>collateral, </em>or <em>unconnected </em>with the force, there i'is no doubt but <em>rase </em>will He. The case from <em>Style, </em>201. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>proves that position. So in Aleyn, 22.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> case for killing cattle distempered with the murrain, and throwing the entrails into the plaintiff\u2019s fields. The injury in the present case arising from the expense of medicine, attendance, and loss of business is wholy disconnected from the force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-10\"><em>Wickham. </em>Do you mean to contend that the conseqential damage could not have been given in evidence, in an action of trespass ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-11\"><em>Call. </em>Yes. And for that I refer <em>to'Style, </em>page 4. where the Court say that \u201c the Jury had no power to take any \u201c damages into their consideration, which happened after \u201c the trespass done.\u201d *</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-12\">In 11 <em>Mod. 180.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is said, that if a man by being unlawfully imprisoned receive any special damage; as if he cannot appear, <em>per quod </em>his recognizance is forfeited, he shall have an action on the case. This doctrine is approved by Judge Blackstone, in his celebrated argument in the case of <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Shepherd.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Though, on the main question, the other Judges differed from him, yet the soundness of this position was not denied. In the case of <em>Lodge </em>v. Weeden, cited from Aleyn, if trespass had been brought, the plaintiff could only have recovered for the simple act of throwing the <em>garbage </em>over his fence. So, in the present case, the plaintiff could nob have recovered for the consequential damages, in an action of trespass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-13\">This, brings me to consider some of the exceptions taken to the declaration itself. It is said that the charge is only by way of recital; tand that there is no direct averment. The <em>quod </em>cum, in this case, is but inducement, and the <em>consequence </em>is the <em>gist </em>of the action; in which the averment is as explicit as it can be made. For the charge is, \u201c <em>and also for </em>this, <em>that </em>inconsequence,\u201d <em>&amp;c. </em>It is admitted that whatever relates to the wound and amputation of the leg is mere recital; but the averment of consequential damages is as express as it can be stated. This recital was absolutely necessary; as, without it, the declaration could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>not have been supported on demurrer, or, perhaps, on a motion in arrest of judgment. That this is the correct mode, will appear from a precedent in <em>Modern </em>Entries, page 21/.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-4\">But, if there be a want of positive averment in the declaration, it is supplied by the writ, of which <em>oyer </em>was taken, and which has thus become a part of the record. The indorsement on the writ shews the nature of the action and contains a positive charge. According to the principles of <em>Ballard </em>v. Leavell,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the writ may be considered as supporting the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-5\">The last point respects the merits of the cause, as stated in the bill of exceptions. It is said, there was no malice, <em>no design to </em>injure, and, therefore, this action would not lie; and for this we are referred to Douglas, 674. It is true, there is one species of action on the case, in which malice is necessary to be proved: but it is equally true, that it <em>is not necessary </em>in others. In that case the action was for arresting the plaintiff. Where a party acts under the colour of process it is necessary to shew malice, otherwise he is not liable.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-11\">Randolph, on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag1b\">The great and only question in this cause is, whether the Court below decided right in saying this action was sustainable. This involves the question whether it should have been trespass <em>vi et armis </em>or trespass <em>on the case.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-12\">Though the declaration charges force by <em>way of </em>inducement, yet it wants those parts which are pecalb ,\u2022 i &gt; <em>et, </em>pass, as <em>against the </em>peace, &amp;c. There therefore which designates it a declaration <em>a </em>m <em>ir m(.\"&gt;(\u25a0\u00bb., </em>but the whole tenor of it being in case, it shall be <em>whom to be </em>case, according to the principle of <em>Byrd </em>v. Cocke.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-14\">The Court will depart from the sts iCi. a oh / <em>r.g\u00edj rc, </em>Y matters of practice, where it is too rigid. This is case for slander; after verdict, the Court <em>wil</em>l not inquire whether the words were actionable or not.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>If we are left unfettered by the decisions of <em>the English </em>Courts, no good reason can be given why <em>this action </em>is not <em>case </em>as well as <em>trespass. </em>The defendant has\u2019the same opportunity of defending himself, has as full notice of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and may be as fully prepared for trial Why not permit <em>case </em>or <em>trespass, </em>in this instance, when you may have <em>trover </em>or <em>trespass; detinue, replevin </em>or trespass, and in such a variety of cases, elect to have one action or another,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-11\">But, in truth, the reason why the Courts of <em>England </em>supported <em>trespass </em>was, that the King was entitled to a fine in that action, which he would lose in <em>case.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-12\">In the passage cited from the third volume of <em>Black-Stands </em>Commentaries, page 123. it is said that the remedy for an immediate injury to the person or property of another, is <em>usually </em>by an action of trespass <em>vi et armis. </em>This is <em>permissive </em>only, and not <em>exclusive.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-13\">No case has been cited which comes up to this. Here is no violence charged: it goes for consequential damages only. There is a <em>recital, indeed; </em>but it concludes, in cm-<em>sequence of this act </em>the plaintiff is entitled to damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-14\">This is simply an action on the case for consequential damages, arising from the negligence and folly of the defendant; and the plaintiifhaving obtained a verdict commensurate with the injury, the Court will not deprive him of it by too rigid an adherence to technical objections.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-15\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT5\">If this cause really turned upon the point, on which the counsel on the other side have placed it, it ought not to have taken up a moment in argument. It was presumed by us, that they would have attempted <em>to </em>shew, that, though this action in appearance is <em>case, </em>yet in truth it is <em>trespass. </em>They have endeavoured, however, to prove^ that for trespass <em>assault and battery, </em>case <em>will lie.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-16\">It is unnecessary to <em>reason </em>on the propriety of keeping up the boundaries of action: it is a <em>settled rule of law </em>that they <em>must </em>be preserved. In 1 Wash. 232.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> this principle is recognized; and in. 6 <em>Term Rep. </em>129.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> <em>Ld. Kenyon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>in giving his opinion, expressly says, that the bounda- \u201c ries of actions should be k opt up.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-4\">This, then, is an action <em>on the case; </em>and the question is, whether case can be maintained for such a trespass as this, committed with force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-5\">The case of <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Ward,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was cited and relied upon as law, in the cese of <em>Leame </em>v. <em>Bray,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is the very case at bar. That was an action of <em>trespass, assault and battery </em>for an injury clone to the plaintiff by the defendant\u2019s negligently discharging his musket, while they were both <em>innocently </em>engaged in performing military exercises, in opposite companies of the trained bands of <em>London. </em>The case of <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Hewson,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is also, in principle like the present. There the defendant in uncocking his gun, discharged it, and wounded the plaintiff who was looking on ; and it veas holden that <em>trespass </em>lay. Nor does the wilfuluess of the act make any difference : as appears from the cases of <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Ward </em>and <em>Leame </em>v. Bray, just cited, and also from <em>Day </em>v. <em>Edwards.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Hobart,</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is stated by the plea that the defendant <em>accidentally, and by misfortune, and against his will, </em>in discharging his piece, wounded the plaintiff, &amp;c.n IBut it was held, that, if there be the slightest degree of negligence, <em>trespass </em>was the proper action: nothing but inevitable necessity, or where the act was \u201c utterly without \u201c the fault\u201d of the defendant would excuse him. Besides, was it ever stated in a declaration for <em>trespass, assault and battery, </em>that the defendant committed the act <em>wilfully f</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">This is exactly the same thing as if in a common case of assault and battery, the party should bring <em>case </em>for consequential damages, and state the battery by way of inducement. Has such an action ever been maintained either i,n <em>England, </em>or in this country ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">But, says Mr. <em>Call, </em>this action was brought for consequential damages only; for expenses incurred in medicine and attendance. Are sot all damages consequential? <em>His </em>argument proves too much. For, if the plaintiff can recover only for damages <em>immediate </em>on the injury, then, as, in trespass, no damages are <em>cotempormsotfs </em>with the apt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>none could be recovered. But it is the constant practice, in actions of trespass, assault and battery, to give in evidence the injury sustained from the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-8\">The authorities are often misapplied by not adverting to a distinction in the term <em>immediate. </em>It is used by Mr. <em>Call, </em>in the present case, in reference to <em>time </em>only; whereas it should be used with reference to the act, and not to \u25a0 the damages consequent thereon; it should be used as opposed to mediate, or, where there is no <em>intervening agent. </em>Thus, if a man throw a log of wood across the street, and another fall over it and get injured, <em>case </em>only lies for the consequential damage; but, if, in throwing it, he strike another, <em>trespass </em>lies for the immediate injury. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">If it be <em>law, </em>that case for consequential damages will lie upon such facts as these, surely some authorities could be found to support the action ; but not one can be produced. Such an action Would be contrary to all principle. For if the plaintiff could bring <em>one </em>action for consequential damages, he might bring <em>twenty; </em>as for loss of business, purchase of a wooden leg, fitting it on, the expenses of the doctor, nurse, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-12\">In the report of the case of <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>by <em>Wilson,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the declaration is given, in which all the circumstances and consequences flowing from the act are as fully stated as in this case; and no doubt was entertained but that <em>trespass </em>was the proper action. All the Judges agreed in this; though Judge <em>Blackstone </em>thought that <em>trespass </em>did not lie for Scott v. Shepherd, because of the intermediate, agency of others, and because, on the first lighting of the squib, the force as proceeding from <em>Shepherd </em>had ceased, and it received a new impulse and direction from others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-13\">In 2 <em>Lilly's Entries, </em>428. and 455. there are precedents of declarations in trespass, assault and battery, in which the particular circumstances of the case, and die consequential damages, are stated. The <em>per quod, </em>in trespass, is laid merely in aggravation of damages.<footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3L\">Only one case has occurred in which an attempt was made to recover consequential damages, for a trespass, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>assault and battery, in a new and subsequent action. That was the case of <em>Fetter </em>v. <em>Beale, </em>reported in 1 <em>Salk. </em>11.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But the Court held that the action would not lie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-4\">It appears clearly that the present is nothing but an action of assault and battery misconceived.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">I come now to consider the cases cited by Mr. <em>Call.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">.Such authorities as <em>Aleyn </em>and <em>Style </em>maywith propriety be cited in tracing the history of the law; but when decisions' reported by them have been overruled by all modern determinations, they ought not to be regarded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">The case of <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Norbury, </em>in <em>Style </em>3. and 201. may or may not be law; but it has no bearing on the present case. The action was brought for unlawfully procuring a commission of bankruptcy against the plaintiff, and breaking open his shop in executing it. They were separate and distinct acts and might admit of different remedies <em>; </em>one for the loss of credit in consequence of the commission of bankruptcy, the other for the injury in breaking open his shop.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-13\"><em>Aleyn </em>reported during the commotions produced by the civil wars ; and is an authority not much to be relied on. In his report of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>St. </em>John, page 84. the case is made to turn upon the question, whether the action should have been trespass <em>vi et armis </em>or <em>case; </em>but he has left us totally in the dark as to one important <em>fact, </em>which would make the one action or the other proper: he has not told us whether the fence was on the land of the plaintiff, or of the defendant. In 2 <em>Vin. Abr. </em>2. pl. 6. this case from <em>Aleyn </em>is noticed. <em>Finer, </em>who is a mere collector of cases, cites one from the <em>Tear Books, </em>which <em>Aleyn, </em>in this case of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>St. John, </em>says is not law. <em>Fitter, </em>however, inserts it, and leaves it to the Courts to decide. <em>Style, </em>130. reports the same case of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>St. </em>John, and makes it quite a different action. This shews the loose manner in which they reported at that day. Again, this case is mentioned in <em>5 Vin. Abr. </em>404. pl. 8. where it is said that the fence was <em>not on the land of the plaintiff. </em>This circumstance makes the case more inielligible. For, if the fence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>were not on the xana of tne plaintiff, <em>he </em>coulu not bring <em>trespass ; </em>but the owner of the fence only. The plaintiff could only recover, <em>in case, </em>for the damages done to him by the cattle getting into his field.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-10\">The point cited by Mr. Call, from 2 Vin. 8. pl. 14. was merely state-d by the Court <em>arguendo, </em>in the case of \u2014 v. <em>Slater.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In pl. 15. of the same page, <em>Finer </em>refers to the case of <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Clarke,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the distinction is taken between trespass <em>vi et armis </em>and trespass <em>on the case. </em>But in pl. 13. of page <em>7. </em>he gives the decision of the Court on the main point in - v. <em>Slater; </em>which was <em>case </em>for <em>causing </em>the plaintiff to be arrested, and maliciously charging her with felony, &amp;c. but it neither being stated that the defendant arrested the plaintiff <em>by his own authority, </em>nor appearing that there was any false imprisonment, the plaintiff had judgment. But, if there be a <em>direct trespass, </em>if the defendant, <em>by his own </em>authority, maliciously make an arrest, <em>case </em>will not lie; as was settle<em>d </em>in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Hughes.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There an action <em>on the case </em>was brought against the <em>Justice himself, </em>for illegally and maliciously arresting the plaintiff by <em>his own warrant; </em>but <em>the </em>judgment was arrested, because it should have been <em>trespass. </em>The injury arising from the Justice\u2019s <em>own act </em>in unlawfully issuing the process, made him a trespasser <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-15\">The'case of the <em>King\u2019s farmer, </em>noticed in 2 <em>Vin. </em>2. pl. 14. is like that of <em>Pitts </em>v. Gainee,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> cited in 2 <em>Vin. 7. </em>pl. <em>11. </em>where it was held that <em>case </em>would lie, because the plaintiff who was <em>captain of the ship </em>had <em>no property, </em>but only <em>declared as a particular </em>officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-16\">2 <em>Vin. </em>2. pl. 10. cites the case of <em>Lewson </em>v. <em>Kirk, Cro. Jac. </em>265. where it is only said by <em>counsel </em>that the action ought to have been <em>trespass ; </em>but the <em>Court, </em>very properly, decided that it should be <em>case. </em>It is not <em>law, </em>but a mere <em>dictum </em>when it is said that either <em>trespass </em>or <em>case </em>would lie upon the facts stated in that cause. In 4 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>589. it is cited merely to shew that a master may maintain an, action against his servant upon such circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The next authority relied on by Mr. Call, is 2 <em>Vin. </em>13. <em>pl. 40. </em>where it is said that <em>case </em>lies for <em>burning </em>deeds, &amp;c. This loose note may in many cases be law, and in many others not, according to the circumstances. If the act was immediate, as by taking a fire-brand and setting fire to a house which was consumed together with the deeds, &amp;c. <em>trespass </em>would be the proper remedy; but if the defendant kept his fire so negligently that it consumed the house of his neighbour, with the deeds, &amp;c. then it should be <em>case for </em>consequential damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">In 1 <em>Vin. 598. </em>the case of <em>Booth </em>and Oliver, from <em>Rolle, </em>is cited, where the defendant pulled down the wall which divided the houses of the plaintiff and defendant, and also pulled off the tiles from the house of the plaintiff, <em>per quod </em>the water came into the plaintiff\u2019s house and rotted the timber. Now, if the wall was upon the defendant\u2019s own land, as it probably was, the plaintiff could not bring trespass, but <em>case </em>for consequential damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-9\">The case in <em>Cro. Jac. 255. </em>never turned upon the distinction between <em>trespass </em>and <em>case. </em>It might happen that <em>case </em>was the proper action; because the deed, the seal of which was torn off, might or might not be the property of the plaintiff, he being merely interested in an annuity for life secured by it. So, in Aleyn, 22. the ground of the action was for throwing the entrails of diseased cattle, into the plaintiff\u2019s field. Probably, the defendant had leave to throw entrails there, <em>in general terms; </em>but in doing it he threw those of <em>distempered </em>cattle, whereby the murrain was communicated to the plaintiff\u2019s cattle. The sole question there was, whether the plaintiff ought not to have stated the number of his cattle which died of the disease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-10\">11 <em>Mod. </em>180.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> was an action on the case for a malicious prosecution without probable cause; but what is there said, is a mere <em>conversation </em>among the Judges, as the case was never decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-11\">In 6 East, 388. the objection was that the husband brought an action without joining his wife. If for the battery of the wife, the husband must join; but, if for conso <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>quential damages, not. This case turned wholly upon th\u00e9 circumstance of its being an action, brought by the husband <em>singly </em>for an injury done to the wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-5\">All the modern cases cited on the other side, which have any application to this, from 2 Ld. <em>Raym. </em>1216. down to the present time, were cases of <em>property </em>and not of <em>personal injury. A. </em>takes the property of <em>B. </em>and turns it into money. There the plaintiff may waive the force and go for the money. Or, if he keep the property in his own possession, the plaintiff may bring detinue, or trover, or' trespass, at his election. Take away the <em>force </em>in all such cases, and the <em>property </em>remains; but, take away the <em>force </em>in this case, and what remains ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-6\">The precedent in 1 <em>Mod. Entries </em>depends upon its own principles. That was an action for negligently managing a boat. If the injury had merely arisen from the winds and the waves, the captain would not be liable. Perhaps he was struggling against both, but was considered liable for not having a sufficient boat, sails, See.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-7\">This is said to be a peculiar case. What is it but the common case of a trespass where the consequences are natural and direct ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-8\">But the <em>reason </em>of the law has been gone into ; and we are told that the plaintiff will lose his verdict, if the distinction which we contend for should prevail. This argument will fit any case. It would apply as well, if the plaintiff had brought an action of <em>debt, </em>or a bill in <em>equity.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> <em>5 Term Rep. </em>648.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> 3 <em>East, 593.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\"> 6 <em>Term Rep. </em>125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\"> 2 <em>Call, </em>39. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Simms. </em>2 Ld. <em>Raym. </em>1413. <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Edmunds.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b452-11\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahnv\"><em>Rainbow </em>brought an action <em>on the case </em>against <em>Taylor </em>for shooting off a gun, and woundingi him in the leg, \u201c so that his leg, by reason thereof, was <em>obliged </em>tobe amputated and taken off, and then the plaintiff\u2019s business in the mean time was in consequence thereof ne- * glected; and the .plaintiff put to great expense in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201c cure,\u201d &amp;c. The declaration begins, \u201c For that <em>whereas </em>\u201c the defendant, with <em>force and </em>arms, a certain gun, load-\u201c ed, &amp;c. did shoot,\u201d &amp;c. It appears, from a bill of exceptions at the trial, that it was proved that the defendant, through neglect, and for want of due caution, but without any <em>design to </em>injure, discharged a loaded gun in a public place, where many people were assembled, and that the contents were lodged in the plaintiff\u2019s leg, in consequence of which it was cut off; that he was thereby unable to carry on his business, and put to great expense in the cure, &amp;c. And the opinion of the Court was required as an instruction to the Jury, whether the plaintiff could maintain <em>this </em>action, upon these facts. The Court being of opinion that he could, there was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, which was affirmed in the District Court, from which judgment there is an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The great point in question in this cause is, whether the plaintiff ought to have brought an action of trespass <em>vi et armis for </em>this injury, and alleged the loss of his leg, the expense of the cure, and the consequent inattention and neglect of his business, by way of <em>aggravation </em>of his damages ; or whether he can maintain this action, which is agreed on all hands to be an <em>action on the case, </em>and not trespass <em>vi et armis; </em>there being no <em>assault </em>charged, &amp;c. and many other circumstances which clearly designate it as an action on the <em>case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">There are some cases where one may have either trespass <em>vi et armis, </em>or an action upon the case, at his election; as in <em>Wheatly </em>v. <em>Stone, Hob. </em>180. <em>Tiffyn </em>v. <em>Wingfield, </em>3 <em>Cro. </em>325. and in a much more modern case, <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Baker and Stapleton, </em>2 <em>Wils. 362. </em>which is certainly a very strong one \u2014 being a <em>special action on the case </em>for unskilfully <em>breaking </em>and disuniting the <em>callus </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s leg, after it had been set, and the <em>callus </em>formed. The plaintiff declared upon their <em>undertaking the cure </em>of his leg, which had been broken and set, and the <em>callus </em>of the 'fracture formed; and that, not regarding their promise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>&amp;c. they had ignorantly and unskilfully broke it, See. And a^ter ver&lt;iict it was objected, that it ought to have been trespass <em>vi et armis; </em>but it was answered by the Court, was ignorance and unskilfulness to do contrary to the rule of practice in the prof\u00e9ssion, for which this action would lie, and the plaintiff had judgment. \u2022 The plaintiff, in this case, having declared upon a special undertaking to <em>cure </em>his <em>leg, </em>seems to have been entitled to his actioH founded upon that <em>undertaking, </em>although the means made use of to effect a cure might have been such, as, if not founded upon a previous <em>contract, </em>and <em>consent </em>on the part of the plaintiff to submit to whatever they might think proper to be done for his cure, might have amounted to a violent <em>breach of the peace. </em>As, suppose a surgeon called in to amputate a leg, should do it in the wrong place, or so unskilfully, as to render a second amputation in another part indispensably necessary; although, the cutting off the leg would, without the patient\u2019s consent, well have justified an action of trespass <em>vi et armis, yet, </em>being done with his <em>consent, </em>and in the way of his <em>profession </em>and <em>undertaking, </em>an action of trespass on the case, (founded upon his <em>ignorance </em>and <em>unskilfulness </em>in performing what he had undertaken,) would seem to be the proper remedy, and not trespass <em>vi et armis. </em>But, where there is no such undertaking or agreement on the part of the defendant, nor any consent or agreement on the part of the plaintiff, the distinction as laid down by Lord Ch. J. <em>Raymond, </em>in the case of <em>Reynolds v. Clarke, 2 </em>Ld. <em>Raym. </em>1402. and 1 Strange, 634. is, that, whei-e the act done is, in itself, an immediate injury to another\u2019s person or property, <em>there </em>trespass <em>vi et armis </em>will lie; but where the act is <em>not.immediately </em>injurious, but only by <em>consequence, </em>and <em>collaterally, there </em>n\u00ae action of trespass <em>m et armis </em>will lie, but a special actio\u00bb on, the <em>case </em>for the damages consequent on such act. This distinction is adopted by Judge <em>Blackstone </em>in his Commentaries, vol. 3. p. 123. The same was adopted by the Court of K. B. in the case of <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Bankes, 2 Burrow, </em>1114. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>which was an <em>action on the case, </em>for damage done to the plaintiff\u2019s colliery, by what the defendant had done in his <em>own </em>colliery, and within his own soil. On a motion in arrest of judgment, the Court said, \u201c The plaintiff describes in his declaration a fact which, as it comes out at the \u2018\u2018 trial, may, or <em>may not, </em>be a <em>proper strict </em>trespass.\u201d It might, at the trial, be proved to be either trespass, or <em>case, according to the evidence. </em>And, it appears, that it <em>was here proved </em>at the trial, to be trespass <em>upon the case. </em>If it hftd been proved to be trespass <em>vi et </em>armis, the plaintiff must, in that event, have been nonsuited. The case of <em>Harker et al. </em>v. <em>Birbeck et al. </em>3 <em>Burr. 1556. </em>was also an action <em>on the </em>case, in which the plaintiffs declared that they were lawfully entitled to the sole liberty and privilege of digging for, getting, and raising lead-ore, within a certain place, and that the defendants, intending to injure them, and to deprive them of all the benefit and advantage of getting and raising lead-ore, did sink fox-, and raise, a large quantity within the same limits; whereby they were deprived of the benefit and advantage of their privilege. Upon a special case stated, the Court was of opinion, that the plaintiffs being in possession of the mine, the injury done was a <em>trespass, </em>and that the action ought to have been trespass ; and judgment was given for the defendants. The same case is reported by Sir <em>William Blackstone, </em>vol. 1. 482. He concludes the opinion of the Court, as delivered by Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in these words: \u201c The \u201c plaintiff is <em>cestui que trust </em>in possession, and therefore \u201c was entitled to an action of trespass, and no other, U for the present injury.\u201d These authorities clearly shew, that the rule, as to the distinction of these actions, is now settled, that where the act done is an <em>immediate </em>injury to another\u2019s person or property, and <em>without, </em>or <em>against </em>his <em>consent </em>or <em>agreement, </em>there the proper and only remedy is by action of trespass <em>vi et </em>armis.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">But here another distinction occurs. It is said, that, to cfonstitute a trespass, for which an action of trespass <em>vi et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>armis </em>is maintainable, the act causing the injury must be. voluntary, and with some degree <em>o\u00ed fault; </em>for if done <em>involuntarily, </em>and without fault, no action of trespass <em>vi et armis lies.</em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> As, where the defendant drove the plaintiff\u2019s sheep out of his <em>otvn </em>ground with a dog that chased and followed them into the <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>ground, it was held, that the defendant might justify chasing the sheep off his own ground, and, as the dog could not be suddenly called in, the trespass and injury was involuntary, it appearing that the defendant had <em>called </em>the dog in; and the defendant had judgment. But that, in an action <em>on the </em>case, it is no excuse for a defendant that an injury was <em>involuntary </em>on his part; for if any damage is caused to another from the folly, or want of due <em>care </em>and <em>caution </em>in such defendant, an action on the case lies.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> As, where an unruly horse is brought into a place of public resort to break, though the person might not intend to do an injury to any one, yet, if the horse kick or otherwise hurt any one, he shall have an action on the case; for it was folly and want of care to bring him to such a place, for such a purpose, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> But, in this case, the injury might have proceeded, not from the immediate act of the defendant, viz. the bringing the horse into the <em>public </em>place, but from a <em>consequential </em>act of the horse, which it was the defendant\u2019s folly not to have guarded against. But, if the defendant had <em>rode </em>over any person in a public place, unless his horse had suddenly taken fright and run away with \u25a0 his rider against his will, the authorities are clear, that an action of trespass <em>vi et armis </em>would have been <em>proper.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> For, </em>where, from the'nature of the act, the <em>time </em>and <em>place </em>when and where it was done, <em>make it highly </em>probable, that some personal damage will immediately happen thereby to somebody then present, in a public place; as where the defendant threw a <em>lighted squib </em>into a market, which was tossed to and fro till it struck the plaintiff\u2019s eye, and put it out, <em>there </em>trespass <em>vi et armis </em>is the proper action.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The case of <em>Mosley </em>v. Gaisford, <em>2 H. Bl. </em>402. which was an action <em>on the case </em>against a master for injury done to the plaintiff\u2019s chaise, by his servant\u2019s negligently driving his cart against it in the highway, may seem in contradiction to the cases I have before cited. But, it must be recollected, that that was an action against the master, not against the <em>servant </em>who committed the injury. And, on motion in arrest of judgment, for that the action should have been trespass <em>vi et </em>armis, the Court said it would be difficult to put a case where the <em>master </em>could be considered as a trespasser, for an act of his <em>servant, not clone at his command. </em>But, in <em>Savignac </em>v. Roome, 6 <em>T. R. 125. </em>the Court of King\u2019s Bench decided otherwise, and arrested the judgment, because the action brought, was an action upon <em>the case </em>instead of trespass <em>vi et armis. </em>And the decision in <em>Day </em>v. <em>Edwards, 5 T. R. </em>648. was to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In the present case the plaintiff begins his declaration with complaining against the defendant in a <em>plea of trespass on the </em>case, \u201c for this,\u201d &amp;c. The whole declaration is manifestly a declaration in case, and not in trespass <em>vi et armis. </em>In <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Cocke, </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>232. this Court observed, that the declaration being in debt, although after a verdict, they could find no authority to justify a rejection of <em>that part </em>as surplusage, which designated it to be an action of <em>debt; </em>and for that reason reversed the judgment. The case of <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Jameson, Nov. </em>15, 1804, was reversed upon the same point, because the plaintiff had brought an action of debt for military certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">With respect to the special damages which the plaintiff would be entitled to recover in consequence of this injury, it is said that many things may be laid in <em>aggravation </em>of damages, for which alone trespass would not lie.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> And the case of <em>Scott </em>v. Shepherd, 3 <em>Wils. </em>403. furnishes a precedent of a declaration that would be proper in such cases., And, as no objection was taken to the <em>declaration </em>on that ground, nor to the <em>damages, </em>which were evidently given not only as a <em>recompense </em>for the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s eye, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>and the pain he suffered from that injur}', but also as a <em>satisfaction </em>for the <em>expense </em>he was put to in the cure, I con - ceive that it affords a strong presumption that it was not liable to any.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">This is undoubtedly a case of very great hardship, and I have felt every disposition to support, if possible, the verdict of the Jury; but the authorities are too strong and conclusive against this action, in its present <em>form. </em>I therefore think the judgment must be reversed, and judgment given that the plaintiff take nothing by his declaration, &amp;c.</p>\n<author id=\"b458-12\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AL9\">There is no position in the law more clearly established than this ; that, 44 wherever the injury is 44 committed by the <em>immediate act </em>complained of, the ac- \u201c tion <em>must be </em>trespass.\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This doctrine is also to be found in a great variety of other cases. In <em>Leame </em>v. Bray,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> the Chief justice says, that \u201c if the injurious act 44 be the <em>immediate result of the force </em>originally applied by 44 the defendant, it is the subject of an action of <em>trespass </em>44 <em>vi et armis </em>by all the cases ancient and modern; and that 44 it is immaterial whether the injury be <em>wilful or </em>not.\u201d He then refers to several cases which are entirely analogous to the case before us <em>-, </em>as, where one shooting at butts, for trial of skill, with a bow and arrow, and having no unlawful purpose in view, wounded a man, it was holden to be <em>trespass. </em>So in the case of <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>where a like unfortunate accident happened whilst persons were <em>lawfully </em>exercising themselves in arms. And this doctrine is said by one of the Judges in that case, to be traced up to the <em>Tear Books.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">The case of the squib, ill <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Shepherd,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>goes infinitely beyond our case, and was yet held to be trespass, Blackstone, J. <em>dissentiente. </em>If the injury had been done to the person upon whom the squib first alighted, it <em>would </em>have been similar to the case at <em>bar; </em>and, in that view, it is supposed that that Judge would have concurred: he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>not have dissented; because <em>then </em>it could not have been pretended that the injury was merely <em>consequential.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWj\"><em>Case </em>therefore will not lie in the present instance. This seamed to be, in a measure, conceded by one of the appellee\u2019s counsel; but he endeavoured to get round the objection by waiving the trespass, considering all that part of the declaration, which relates to the force, as mere inducement, and going only for the consequential injury. No precedent, however, justifies that attempt in a case like the present. It might equally be argued, that, in the case of a battery, a man could sustain <em>trespass on the case </em>for the pain and injury arising from the infliction of the blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">This concession establishes, however, as far as the concession of counsel can establish it, the only material point in the cause, (considered in relation to the general question, | and which was sufficiently clear before, namely, that the <em>declaration </em>in question is a declaration in <em>case. </em>The plaintiff tells us, that it is so, <em>tolidcm verbis. </em>It begins, \u201c <em>Thomas Rainboto </em>complains of <em>John </em>Taylor, in custody, \u201c &amp;c. <em>of a plea of trespass 071 the case.\u201d </em>It omits the <em>co7itra paean; </em>it has no averment that the gun was shot <em>against </em>the plaintiff; (allegations which would naturally have been found in a declaration in <em>trespass;) </em>and, on the whole context, appears to be a declaration in <em>case. </em>On the other hand, indeed, the act is stated to have been done with <em>force and arms; </em>and the question is, whether this circumstance, in opposition to all the circumstances just mentioned, will pin it down to be a declaration in trespass ?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">In the case of <em>Day </em>v. Edwards, the declaration did not indeed charge the act to have been done with <em>force and </em>arms, in so many words; but it charged in very emphatical terms, (twice repeated,) that the defendant drove his cart <em>u furiously,\u201d </em>and that it was then and there \u201c driven and \u201c struck <em>with great force and violence </em>against the car- \u201c riage of the plaintiff;\u201d and yet judgment was given for the defendant, on the ground that the action should have been <em>trespass. </em>So, in <em>Savignac v. Roome, </em>6 <em>Term Rep. </em>125. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>where the declaration charged the driving one carriage \u201c <em>wilfully </em>against\u201d another, the judgment was <em>arrested; </em>because <em>case </em>would not lie for this injury. In that case, after observing that \u201c the bounds of the different actions should be preserved,\u201d Lord <em>Kenyon </em>added, that \u201c the <em>ci whole frame and structure </em>of the declaration shew that it \u201c is 'an action on the case, and that the memorandum\u201d (which the Judges looked into) \u201c is of an action on the <em>t- </em>case.\u201d This latter circumstance might <em>perhaps </em>(if necessary) justify us in looking into the writ and <em>indorsement </em>in' this case, (of which <em>oyer </em>is craved,) and which expressly state the action to be an action on the <em>case. </em>The case of <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Cocke,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>seems also to shew that the Court will designate a declaration according to its general form and structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Considered, however, as a declaration in <em>trespass, </em>I am strongly <em>inclined to think </em>that the trespass is not sufficiently charged, being only under a <em>quod </em>cum. On this point, however, I will merely refer to the ground of my opinion in the case of <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Leavell.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If any aid could (in this view) be derived from the writ and indorsement to cure the want of a positive averment, that writ and indorsement would equally shew, beyond all controversy, that the declaration is in <em>case, </em>and thus cut up by the roots the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">On these grounds, I am of opinion, (however I may regret it,) that the decision of the Court stated in the bill of exceptions is erroneous; that this action cannot be sustained <em>; </em>and that the judgment must be reversed, and entered for the defendant.</p>\n<author id=\"b460-10\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AG8\">Were it not that I think myself tied down, and bound by precedents, I should have differed in opinion from the Judges who have preceded me on the first great point in this cause, (to wit, the <em>nature </em>of the action,) because it does appear to me, from the <em>reason </em>of the thing, and upon sound general principles, that three things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>only are essentially requisite to maintain an action: 1st. That the plaintiff make out such a case as will entitle him to recover; 2dly. That he state his case in such a manner as to afford the defendant a fair opportunity of making a full and complete defence; and 3dly. So that a recovery in the suit may be pleaded in bar to any future action for the same cause. All this seems to have been done in the case now before the Court. But a line of distinction between actions of trespass <em>vi et </em>armis, and actions of trespass <em>on the case, </em>seems to have been settled in the case of <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Clarke,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which it is laid down, that, where the <em>immediate act itself </em>occasions a prejudice, or is an injury to the plaintiff\u2019s person, house, land, See. the remedy is by action of trespass <em>vi et armis; </em>but, where the <em>act itself </em>is not an injury, but a <em>consequence </em>from that act is prejudicial to the plaintiff\u2019s person, &amp;c. his remedy is by an action on the case. And this doctrine is further illustrated and confirmed, in the case of <em>Hayward </em>v. Banks, 2 <em>Burr. </em>1114. in that of <em>Harker and </em>others, in 1 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>482. and more at large in 3 <em>Burr. </em>1556. in <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Shepherd, 2 Bl. </em>892. and in other cases that have been already cited. In many of those cases, the Judges have declared the necessity of keeping up the distinction, to avoid a confusion of actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">It appears from the record in this case, that the injury to the plaintiff was immediate, being occasioned by the discharge of a gun by the appellant; and that, according to the cases cited above, he has mistaken his action, which ought to have been trespass <em>vi et armis, </em>instead of an action on the <em>case. </em>And therefore, without deciding on any other points in the cause, I am constrained, under those authorities, to concur in opinion, that the judgments of both the Courts below are erroneous, and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the judgments of the District and Borough Courts reversed'.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b455-9\"> 1 <em>Esp. </em>313.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AuGo\"> 1 <em>Esp. </em>383.
