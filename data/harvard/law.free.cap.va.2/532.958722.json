That <em>Cromwell </em>had brought suit upon this covenant against <em>Taylor </em>in <em>Ma</em>njland, and had recovered a judgment against him for <em>\u2022si </em>1000 dollars, and his costs; upon which judgment, an execution of <em>fieri facias </em>had issued, and had been returned no effects. That <em>Taylor </em>had afterwards removed to the county of <em>Hampshire </em>in Virginia, where he acquired land; and had died seized of said land, which had descended to his heirs. That <em>Cromwell </em>had brought suit on said judgment, in the Superior Court of <em>Hampshire </em>county, for the benefit of <em>Beall\u2019s </em>administrator, against the administrator of <em>Taylor, </em>and had recovered a judgment, upon which an execution had issued and had been returned \u201c no effects.\u201d They made <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>administrator, and heirs parties to the suit; and prayed for a decree against the administrator for the amount of any assets in his hands, and that the land descended to the children and heirs of <em>Taylor </em>might be sold for the satisfaction of so much of the debt due the complainants as the personal estate should not pay, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-12\">The administrator and heirs of <em>Taylor </em>demurred to the bill; and the cause coming on to be heard, the Court sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-13\">From this decree, <em>Beall\u2019s </em>administrator obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-14\"><em>Patton, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-15\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b553-16\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AcV\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-17\">The Court is of opinion, that the judgment obtained in the State of <em>Maryland, </em>against the intestate of the appellees, not being a judgment of a Court of Record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>in this State, did not so merge the original specialty executed by the intestate as to prevent the appellant from proceeding upon said specialty against the representatives of the intestate in Virginia, in respect to real assets *n <em>Virginia. </em>The Court is further of opinion, that the administrator was properly made a defendant to kave an accoun\u00a3 0f the assets; and where it is sought to charge the heirs upon the bond of their ancestor, the personal representative is a necessary party for their protection, and in order that the personal assets should be applied for their relief, as far as they may go towards the extinguishment of the debt. The Court is therefore of opinion, that there was error in the decree of the Circuit Superior Court in sustaining the demurrers to the bill; the said decree is therefore reversed with costs; and this Court proceeding to make such decree as the said Circuit Court ought to have made, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed that said demurrers be overruled; and the appellees ordered to answer; and this cause is remanded for further proceedings, to be had in pursuance of this decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
