It recited, that he as attorney had prayed and obtained the attachment; and was conditioned that <em>Bacon </em>and his security should satisfy and pay to <em>Hendley </em>all costs which should be awarded to him in case the said <em>Bacon </em>should be cast in the said attachment, and all damages which should be recovered against the said <em>Bacon </em>for suing out the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">At the ensuing <em>Loudoun </em>Court, <em>Hendley </em>gave bail and obtained a release of the attached effects. At the rules in October, a declaration was filed in the name of <em>Mantz </em>as plaintiff; and <em>Hendley </em>took a special imparlance, \u201c re\u00ab \u201c serving all benefit of exception, as well to the <em>attach\u25a0, a ment </em>as to the declaration:\u201d after which the cause was continued at the rules until March, 1?'97, when the words \u201c never absconded, and demurrer joined,\u201d are found in the record,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-8\">At <em>June </em>Court, <em>1T98, Hendley </em>obtained leave to amend his plea. He thereupon prayed <em>oyer </em>of the attachment, declaration and bond, and filed a plea, saying, \u201c that the \u201c plaintiff ought not to have and maintain bis action and at- \u201c tachment against him, because he was not removing out \u201c of the County aforesaid privately, nor absconded or con- \u201c eealed himself so that the ordinary process of law could, \u201c not be served on him, as was alleged and complained of \u201cin said attachment;\u201d concluding with \u201cand this he is \u201c ready to verify; wherefore he prays judgment if the said \u201c plaintiff ought to have and maintain his attachment and \u201c action aforesaid against the defendant for his debt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201c damages aforesaid,\u201d &amp;c. To the end of this plea, the words \u201c and payment\u201d are added in the record. The . <em>1 J </em>plaintiff, by his counsel, objected to this plea, that in this stage 0f the suit, <em>oyer </em>could not be craved of the attachment j and if it could, it ought not to be connected with or made a part of the said plea. The Court overruled the objection; to which opinion a bill of exceptions was signed and sealed. The plaintiff then filed a <em>general </em>demurrer to the <em>first </em>plea, and replied generally to the plea of <em>payment, </em>and issues were joined. On argument, the Court sustained the demurrer; and a Jury being\u2019 impanelled to try the issue on the plea of payment, found a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant, by his counsel, filed errors in arrest of <em>judgment; </em>1st. That the attachment was erroneous, because it was issued on the complaint of the attorney, and not on the complaint of the <em>plaintiff; </em>2dly. That the condition of the attachment-bond was not such as the law requires ; and, lastly. That the attachment and the attachment-bond, and all the proceedings, were erroneous, illegal and insufficient. At a subsequent term, the Court overruled these objections, and entered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed to the District Court of <em>Dumfries, </em>Where the' judgment was reversed, <em>in general terms, </em>without proceeding to enter any other judgment in the room of that of the County Court; and thereupon <em>Mantz </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-6\"><em>Williams, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfNU\">observed, that, after the defendant had pleaded and given bail, no exception could be taken to the attachment or attachment-bond. If he thought the attachment issued irregularly, he might have moved the Court to quash it; but, having pleaded, he waived such objections. The law is the Same, where a <em>writ </em>issues, which is improper upon the face of it, and the defendant pleads to the <em>action ; </em>for, after that, it is too late to crave <em>oyer </em>of the <em>writ. </em>At. any rate, the <em>attachment-bond </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ftDt part of the record; for <em>oyer </em>of that bond was not prayed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-4\">If the County Court proceedings were erroneous, the District Court was wrong also; because it <em>merely reversed </em>the judgment of the County Court, but entered no judgment at all; whereas such judgment should have been pronounced by the District Court as the County Court ought to have rendered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-9\">Botts, for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZS\">insisted on the following points: 1st. That the complaint on which the attachment was founded was not conformable to the 6th section of the act on that subject ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> being <em>not that Hendley had absconded, </em>but that he <em>intended to </em>remove his effects, and <em>would </em>elude the ordinary legal process ; 2d. That the bond was illegally given by the plaintiff\u2019s <em>attorney, </em>instead of the plaintiff himself; 3d. That it was not too late to crave <em>oyer </em>after a special imparlance reserving all exceptions, and after an immaterial issue had been joined, and leave granted to amend the plea; and 4th. That the attachment and attachment-bond, being the groundwork of the proceedings, (all of which are <em>summary,') </em>would form a part of the record without <em>oyer. </em>The intention of the act of Assembly was to introduce a new mode of proceeding, different from that in use under the common law. No declaration or pleadings would have been requisite, if bail had not been given: of course, they were not necessary after bail was given. The declaration, therefore, ought not to have been admitted ; but all the proceedings ought to bave been founded on the attachment itself.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-10\">Williams, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARl\">The attachment law is a <em>remedial </em>law, and ought to be construed liberally. According to its lair construction, a <em>declaration, </em>in such case, is proper. If pleadings were not necessary, why should <em>bail </em>be given to answer the ultimate judgment of the Court ? If the proceedings were intended to he merely <em>summary, </em>judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>would be entered immediately without bail, and by the Court, without a <em>Jury. </em>But, where the attachment is <em>replevied, </em>it ought to go on as an ordinary suit.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b327-11\"><em> Code, </em>p. 116.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\"><em>Tuesday, April </em>26. The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b328-8\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AC8\"><em>Asa Bacon </em>(as attorney for Mantz) obtained an attachment against the effects of <em>Hendley. </em>The warrant recites, that <em>Bacon </em>had' made oath, \u201c that he had <em>u </em>grounds to suspect, and verily did believe, that <em>Hendley u intended to remove </em>his effects,\u201d and \u201c that he <em>will elude </em>\u201c the ordinary legal process,\u201d &amp;c. <em>Hendley </em>gave bail, at the return of the attachment. The cause was proceeded in at the rules, when the defehdant pleaded that he was not removing, &amp;c, to which there was a demurrer, and judgment for plaintiff thereupon. He also pleaded payment, which was found against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Upon the first consideration which I had of this cause, I was prepared to shew that the County Court decided right upon the demurrer to the defendant\u2019s plea, in the \u2019 form in which it was pleaded, which seemed to me to be materially defective. And of that opinion I am still; but think it unnecessary to detain the Court with my reasons, because, upon a more minute examination of this warrant of attachment, it is so materially defective, that the Court ought, <em>ex officio, </em>to have <em>quashed </em>it, upon inspection, without waiting for a plea in abatement. The general rule is, that where a writ is only abateable, it must be <em>abated </em>by pleading in time; for matters <em>in </em>and <em>before </em>the writ cannot be taken advantage of in <em>error.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But where it appears to the Court, <em>from the writ itself, </em>that it <em>ought to abate, </em>there the Court ought, <em>ex officio, </em>to give judgment against the plaintiff, though the defendant does not <em>plead </em>in abatement: otherwise, where it does <em>not appear in the writ.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The attachment law authorises that mode of proceeding, only where a person makes complaint to a magistrate, that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>debtor <em>is removing </em>out of the County or Corporation, privately, <em>or </em>ABSCONDS <em>or </em>CONCEALS himself, so that the ordinary process of law cannot be served upon him. Here the oath is, that the party hath grounds to suspect that <em>Hendley </em>\u201c <em>intends to </em>remove, and that he <em>will elude </em>the or- \u201c dinary legal process.\u201d This was not a sufficient reason -for granting the attachment. It ought to have been shewn that he <em>actually was removing </em>privately, or <em>actually did abscond, </em>or <em>actually did conceal himself; </em>either of which facts might have furnished a sufficient reason for the attachment. But, as it appears upon the face of the warrant, that neither of them were alleged as a ground of the attachment, the County Court erred in not quashing it; and consequently the judgment of the <em>District </em>reversing that of the <em>County </em>Court, ought to be affirmed. There is error in not having entered such judgment as the County Court ought to have rendered: but, the judgment being substantially in favour of the appellee, he is entitled to casts, according to <em>Pendleton </em>v. Vandevier, 1 Wash. 381. and <em>Preston </em>v. Harvey, last term.</p>\n<author id=\"b329-8\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AhZh\">There are two kinds of causes for which a <em>writ </em>(and, <em>a </em>fortiori, an <em>attachment) </em>may be abated; the one <em>dehors </em>the writ or attachment, and the other intrinsic.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The matter stated in the plea demurred to in the present' case, is of the former kind. It is a ground of opposition^ which, if proved or admitted, would go to abate <em>any </em>attachment whatever: whereas a matter <em>intrinsic </em>relates to the particular writ or attachment which is in question* The plea in question in this case is <em>substantially </em>a plea in abatement, though, in point of form, it approaches very nearly to a plea in bar. A plea in abatement is one \u201c which, w shews cause to the Court why the defendant should not \u201c be impleaded, or, if impleaded, not in the manner and \u201c form he now is,\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This definition determines the present to be <em>substantially </em>a plea in abatement; for the, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>fendant,'-for the reason he alleges, namely, \u201c that he was! \u201c not removing,\u201d &amp;c. demands judgment whether the plaintiff ought to maintain \u201c his <em>attachment </em>and action a against him.\u201d It does not object to the <em>action </em>of the plaintiff generally, but to this particular action b)' <em>attachment. </em>In point of form, however, the plea is defective, in not having a proper conclusion. It ought to have demanded, that the attachment be <em>quashed. </em>This defect would, clearly be fatal, on a <em>special </em>demurrer; but, taken as a plea in abatement, the same effect is supposed to result from a <em>general </em>demurrer. I infer this from a passage in 1 <em>Cromp</em>ton, 174. where it is said that the statutes of 27 <em>Eliz. </em>and 4 and <em>5 </em>Anne, (substantially agreeing with our act on this subject respecting <em>demurrers,)</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>so far as they require judgments to be given \u201c <em>according as the right shall appear, </em>\u201c extend only to such demurrers as go to the action, and \u201c not to demurrers to <em>pleas in </em>abatement.\u201d The author cites no adjudged cases in support of this position j but the doctrine seems congenial with that'stj-ictness with which <em>dilatory </em>pleas are generally considered. This plea in abatement, therefore, though substantially sufficient, yes not being so in point of form, the judgment of the Co-so far as it goes to sustain the demurrer and overrule the. plea, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The regular course in such case Would have been to award a <em>respondeos ouster; </em>but, where there is a matter of abatement <em>intrinsic </em>in the writ, it is said, that the Court will themselves take notice-of it.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> This position seems justified by many decisions in this Court, in which it has been held, that if the declaration be radically defective in point of law, the Court ought not to give judgment upon it, notwithstanding the objection has not been <em>taken; </em>and I will ask, <em>cui </em>bono, shall the Court order further proceedings in a case, in which it sees manifestly that final judgment for the plaintiff can never be given ? This doctrine will, no doubt, at least equally apply in the case of the summary proceeding by attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>My opinion, therefore, is, that the County Court ought, on account of the eminent and intrinsic defects existing in <em>chis </em>attachment and verdict, (some of which have been mentioned,) to have <em>abated </em>the attachment after the judgment upon the demurrer, at least, <em>if not at an earlier </em>pe<em>riod; </em>and that the judgment of the District Court not having done this, but on the contrary having merely reversed a <em>general </em>judgment for the plaintiff, ought also to be reversed and corrected in this particular,</p>\n<author id=\"b331-3\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A9W\">In giving my opinion in this case, I must take the liberty of premising, that the law, commonly called <em>the attachment </em>laxo, which was formerly contained in the act establishing County Courts, and now, with small variation, makes apart of the act of <em>It92, </em>entitled, \u201c <em>An </em>\u201c <em>act directing the method of proceeding in Courts of Eq\u00fai- </em>\u201c ty, <em>against absent </em>debtors, <em>or other absent </em>defendants, \u201c <em>and for settling the proceedings against absconding' </em>\u201c debtors,\u201d though sound in principle, and salutary in its operation, when duly and properly administered, has been, within the course of my experience and observation, oftener perverted, and more abused, than any law in our whole statutory code; and, instead of promoting justice, is often made the engine of injustice and oppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The mode of proceeding against a certain class of debtors', by original attachment, being a summary procer dure unknown to the common law, the strict letter of the statute ought, I conceive, to be adhered to in all cases whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In the 6th section of the act last above mentioned, it is enacted, that if any person shall make complaint to a justice of the peace, that <em>his </em>debtor <em>is removing out of the </em>County, <em>or privately conceals himself so that the ordinary process of law cannot be served upon </em>him, such justice shall grant an attachment against the estate of such debtor, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to satisfy the. debt and \u2022casts of such complainant, See,</p>\n<p id=\"AEh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The attachment before us recites, that <em>Asa Bacon </em>maketh oa&lt;h&gt; that he having a bond of <em>Hendley, </em>assigned to Mantz, in his hands to collect, has grounds to suspect, and verily tpat tpe sajq <em>Hendley </em>intends to remove his effects, and will elude the ordinary legal process, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The variance between the words of the law, and the ground on which the attachment is stated to have been awarded, goes to the substance as well as to the form of the complaint5 and therefore, it was the duty of the Court <em>ex officio, </em>to have quashed the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In the case of <em>Hughson </em>v. <em>Webb, Cro. Eliz. </em>121. <em>debt </em>was -brought against the defendant as administratrix, upon a [simple] contract of the intestatethe defendant pleads fully administered, which was found against her. It was moved in arx-est of judgment, that <em>debt </em>xxpon a [simple] <em>contract </em>lieth not against an administrator.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> And it was resolved <em>by all the\u25a0 justices, </em>that the plaintiff shall not have jxidgmexxt: for although the defendant, by her plea, admitted that the action lay against her, yet, when the matter at the beginning is not sufficient to chai-ge hex-, the Court, <em>ex officio, </em>ought to abate the writ, without exception' of the <em>party, and </em>the defendant\u2019s plea taketh not away the authority of the Court, but they may abate the writ at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">If this be the law, then, in common cases, how much more foi-cible is the reason in this suminary proceeding, where the greatest strictness is required, and ought to be observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In' my apprehension, indeed, let the situation and circuxixstances of the debtor,' <em>Hendley, </em>have beeix what they might, <em>Bacon </em>could not have legally obtained an attachment on behalf of <em>Mantz </em>without a special, or general jxoxyer of attorney, comprehending the case; and he ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>pears to have been a mere collector, without any particular powers, either general or special.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag4K\">The attachment bond, executed by <em>Bacon </em>and Binns, is by no means such a one as the law requires; which is, that the justice, before granting such attachment, shall take bond and security of the party <em>for </em>whom the same shall be issued, in double the sum to be attached, payable to the defendant, for satisfying all costs which shall be awarded to the defendant, in case the plaintiff suing out the attachment shall be cast in his suit, and also all damages, See\u00bb And every attachment issued without <em>such </em>bond taken, or where no bond shall be returned, is hereby declared illegal and void, and shall be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The condition of the bond, in this case, is not agreeable to the requisition of the law. It is executed by Bacon, when the attachment issued <em>for </em>Mantz, at the instance of Bacon, (who styles himself his agent, it is true,) but that does not alter the case. The condition farther states, that he, Bacon, shall satisfy and pay all costs which shall be awarded to the said John, in case the said <em>Bacon </em>shall be cast in said attachment, &amp;c. when <em>he </em>is no party to the suit, as appears through the whole record; there being only two parties, to wit, Mantz, plaintiff, and Hendley, defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On these grounds, I am of opinion, without critically examining the pleadings, that the attachment, being improvidently awarded, contrary to law, (which no after proceedings could sanction,) ought to be quashed; but without prejudice to the right of Mantz, to recover his debt by any legal means he may think proper to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The opinion of the Court was, \u201c that the warrant of ah 44 tachment, which was granted in this case, is so defective \u201c upon the face thereof, that the' County Court to which it \u201c was returned ought to have quashed the same upon in-44 spection, without permitting any farther proceedings to be &lt;4 had thereupon; and therefore that there is no error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u201c judgment of the said District Court, reversing the judg* \u201c ment of the said County Court, with costs: Therefore, it is considered, that the same be so far affirmed, and <em>u </em>that tbe appellee, being tbe party substantially prevailing, \u201c recover against the appellant his costs, &amp;c. But this u Court is farther of opinion, that the said District Court \u201c erred in not entering such judgment upon that reversal \u201c as the said County Court ought to have rendered. \u201c And this Court proceeding to render such judgment as \u201c the said District Court ought to have rendered, it is &lt;0! farther considered, that the said warrant of attachment &lt;c be quashed, and all tbe proceedings in the said County \u201c Court subsequent thereto set aside, and that tbe appellee \u201c go thereof without day.\u201d'</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"><em> </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>2. <em>Show. </em>169. 1 <em>Roll.
