That the defendant, on the 1st day of <em>January, </em>as well as in <em>November </em>1778, offered to pay <em>to </em>the plaintiff the <em>amount </em>of his debt, including interest thereon, in the then circulating paper money, which the plaintiff, at each time, refused to receive. That the non-payment of the debt was owing to the creditor, the same having been offered and refused as aforesaid. That the defendant sold a sufficiency of the estate, together with money in the house, and debts due to the testator, to pay all the debts owing by the estate. That on the motion of one of the legatees, an order was made by the County Court of <em>Stafford </em>in <em>September, </em>1778, appointing commissioners (of whom the plaintiff was one, and acted as such) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>to divide the estate of the testator according to his tvill, in consequence of which the estate remaining unsold, and not disbursed in the payment of debts, or \u2022offered to the creditors, was on the 27th of November, (more than a year after the testator\u2019s death,) divided, and the share of each claimant delivered, no bond to refund being taken. Thai the estate so divided consisted entirely of slaves. That the money offered as aforesaid, was of the paper money then in circulation, and was liable and subject to the law for calling in and redeeming the said paper money, at one for 1000, and that the defendant had received of the same sort of money, to a greater amount than the plaintiff\u2019s demand, for debts due to his testator, and contracted previous to the year 1776. That one of the legatees is insolvent, and two others have removed to parts of this State very distant from the defendant. That the defendant divested himself of the whole estate of his testator before the institution of this suit, in paying the debts, and in obedience to the order and division aforesaid, except 427/. paper money, so offered by him to creditors. That the defendant has not paid the debt in the declaration mentioned. If upon the whole, the law be for the plaintiff then they find for him, the debt in the declaration mentioned, to be discharged by the payment of the principal and interest, or so much thereof as to the Court might appear just and equitable ; otherwise for the defendant. Upon this verdict, the Court gave judgment for the plaintiff, for the full amount of principal and interest, from which the defendant appealed</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b11-3\">Marshall, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b11-4\">I shall insist first, that slaves' are not assets in the hands of executors, if the personal estate be sufficient to pay the debts. If so, then secondly, that the defendant has fully administered the assets. Thirdly, if these points be against the appellant, still the Court may give an equitable judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b11-5\">First,- \u2014 Slaves, by the Act of Assembly passed in 1705. Co 3, are declared to be <em>real </em>estate, with certain exceptions ; and though some of the exceptions ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>der them like to chattels, yet, there is no law which them to be assets, nor can the executor dis pose of them, as he may of the personal estate, for payment Gf debts, unless there be a deficiency of the latter; in that case only-can he sell slaves. The laws passed in 1727,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and in 1748,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> were made, because slaves having been-declared to be real estate, could not, as such, have been applied by the executor to the payment of debts, and the Legislature in these laws, have been careful to distinguish this species of property from chattels.\". If we refer to other laws, we shall find, that slaves are always contemplated as a species of property totally unlike to personal estate. Thus, in the law respecting distributions, slaves are not comprehended under the words <em>goods, </em>chattels, and <em>personal </em>estate. Again, by the same law, the executors or administrators <em>may </em>distribute the personal estate after nine months from the death of the testator, taking bond and security to refund. But by the Act of 1748, c. 3, \u00a7 30, the slaves of a decedent are to continue on the land to finish the crop, (where the testator or intestate dies between the 1st of <em>March, </em>and the 25th of December,) until the latter period, when they are to be delivered to those having a right to them, well clothed at the expense of the estate, and their crops are declared to be assets. Now mark, the difference between slaves and personal estate. The latter <em>may </em>be distributed at one time, the former <em>shall </em>be delivered at another ; in the latter, security to refund may be required, but not in the former. Why? Because they are not assets, nor as such liable to pay the debts, unless the personal estate be deficient. The obvious conclusion is, that this sort of property is made an auxiliary fund for the payment of debts, where the assets are insufficient, and the executors are empowered, by a special law, to sell them <em>for that purpose only. </em>The executor in this case had no power to retain possession of the slaves, there being a sufficiency of personal estate, <em>first, </em>because the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>not only Imposed it as a duty1 upon him to deliver them op, but the judgment of a Court, having competent jurisdiction, compelled him to do so, and this order, he was bound to obey, without a power given to him of protecting himself, by taking security to refund. Let it also be remarked, that it would be exercising an unnecessary, as well as.anv unjust rigor against the executor, to charge him with a <em>devastavit, </em>when the legatees may, in \u00e1 Court of Equity, be resorted to. 2 <em>Vern. </em>75. 205. 1 <em>Vern. </em>94. 162. 2 <em>Ventr. </em>360. 358. 2 <em>P. Will, </em>447. Should it be contended, that an executor, before he delivers or pays a legacy, snay demand security, to refund, and that if he neglect to require such a security, he cannot compel the legatee to refund, I answer, <em>first, </em>that the cases on <em>this </em>head relate to personal estate only, which are always assets, and liable to pay debts ; whereas, slaves are. real estate, and are liable to pay debts, only as an auxiliary fund; that the executor is obliged to deliver them up within a limited time, without security, unless there be a deficiency of the personal estate. Secondly, the delivery in this case was not voluntary,</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-4\">2d. point. \u2014 The verdict finds, that all the estate hath been administered, except the slaves which were delivered to the commissioners, to be divided under the order of Court, and 427/. paper money. Now this money was either funded, or it was not. If the former, it remains a debt due from the public, (worth, according to the scale, 8s. <em>6d. </em>specie,) payable at a future day, as the public Acts of the Legislature prove. If the latter, it is taken out of circulation by an Act of the Government, and thereby deprived of all its value. In either point of view, it forms no part of the <em>assets in the hands of the executor, </em>being a debt due and uncollected. 2 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>417.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-7\">To charge the executor with a devastavit, he should be guilty of mismanagement, misapplication, fraud, or of paying legacies when the assets are insufficient to pay the debts. 2 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>435. The executor in this case did not mismanage nor misapply the assets, by selling the personal estate, and offering the money in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>discharge of the debts, 1 ^cause this was a part of his duty. Neither has he left debts unpaid, by disposing of the <em>assets </em>to legatees, if I am right upon the first point. If then, the executor is subject to no blame for delivering up the slaves under all the circumstances of the case, there is no possible ground left to charge him, unless indeed he can be chargeable with the consequences of a legislative act, which destroyed in his hands the funds he reserved for paying the debt; an idea too monstrous to be contended for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-10\">3d point. The issue upon the third plea is with the defendant, the jury having found, that <em>the nonpayment was owing to the creditor ; </em>and, therefore, the Court may give an <em>equitable judgment </em>on the case. I will not repeat all the equitable circumstances which appear to favour the executor, believing that no case ever exhibited more than the present. The case of <em>Kenner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>in the old General Court, was not so strong in favour of the defendant as the present; for, in that, the Court interfered, even after a verdict rendered upon the plea of payment. The case was, that <em>Turner, </em>who was indebted to <em>Kenner, offered to pay the debt, </em>(without making <em>a legal tender,) </em>which was refused. The Court scaled the debt as of the day w hen the offer was made, because <em>Turner, </em>holding the money in his own right, was presumed to have afterwards made use of it, it not being improper in him to do so; it was therefore thought just, that he should sustain the loss by subsequent depreciation. But in this case, <em>the executor, </em>acting as a <em>trustee, </em>ought not to be presumed to have used the money, because it was improper that he should have done it, and therefore, it would be unjust to make him bear any part of the loss by depreciation, but it should be borne by the creditor, for whose use the trustee held it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b14-11\"><em>Ronold, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-12\">There might be some weight in the arguments drawn from the hardship of this case, if the jury had not expressly found that the executor had notice of the debt in question before the division took place. But the arguments chiefly relied upon are, 1st. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>slaves are assets only <em>sub modo. </em>2dly. That they were delivered to the legatees under the judgment of a Court. In answer to the first, I would observe, that slaves, in he hands of an executor, resemble personal chattels In almost every ' respect <em>% </em>for, 1st. The possession of them belongs to.the executor. 2dly. They cannot be taken by a legatee without his assent; and 3dly\u201e They are subject to the payment of the testator\u2019s debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa\">That the possession of them belongs to the executor is evident, because he is to deliver them to the legatee, which he could not do if he had no right to possess them ; and they, like the personal estate, are to be inventoried and appraised,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which would be absurd, If they were considered as real estate. Thai the executor\u2019s assent to vest the possession in the legatee is necessary, is not only proved by the law just alluded to, but is necessarily implied from the power given him to sell them for payment of debts. These circumstances form the strong line of distinction between real and personal property. But it is contended, that they cannot be sold but as an auxiliary fund to the personal estate. This is equally the case with specific legacies, which cannot be sold, unless there be a deficiency of other property, and yet it never was contended that they are not assets. Another circumstance is, that the penalty of an executor\u2019s bond is always so fixed as to cover the supposed value of the slaves, as well as of the personal estate. Were it otherwise, an ex-executor might waste that part of the estate so as to defeat the rights, not only of creditors, but of others. The truth is, that slaves, though real property, <em>in a course of </em>descents, are considered like other chattels, in cases where the executor has a power over them for payment of debts. They cannot be sold any more than specific legacies can, for the purpose of paying pecuniary legacies, nor even debts, unless there Be a deficiency of the personal assets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-3\">As to the order of the County Court, I dp not conceive that it was obligatory upon the executor, as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>was made upon an <em>ex parte </em>motion, and without a re guiar suit. There is no law which authorizes this mode of proceeding, and, consequently, the order was entirely extra-judicial. Besides, the executor was bound to oppose it, and to state the necessity of his retaining the possession until all the debts were paid ; this, at least, he ought to have done, before he could attempt to excuse himself against the consequences of his having obeyed it to the prejudice of others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-10\">As to the finding upon the third plea, it surely cannot avail the appellant, because the Act pleaded and relied upon, relates, by express words, to contracts made <em>after the first day of January, </em>1777, and this was entered into <em>prior to that date. </em>The preamble of the law states the inconveniences resulting from the depreciation of the money, in respect of contracts entered into between the first day of <em>January, </em>1777, and the first day of <em>January, </em>1782, and is, therefore, inapplicable to all other cases. Besides, if a legal tender had been made, yet the jury should have found that the money was such as might be <em>lawfully tendered </em>which they have not done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-11\"><em>Marshall, </em>in reply. \u2014 It must be admitted, that the decision of the County Court was not made upon proceedings regularly conducted; yet as that Court had <em>jurisdiction over the subject, </em>the judgment, standing in force and unreversed, was obligatory upon the executor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-12\">It is true, that the second section of the Act of 1781, is confined to contracts made after the 1st day of <em>January, </em>1777, but it does not follow that the law is confined entirely to contracts entered into between the periods mentioned in that section. The third section, which declares that execution shall not issue upon <em>any judgment </em>theretofore obtained, before <em>December </em>1783, is obviously not restrained in its operation; and why should the fifth section, (the language of which is as general as it could be,) be restrained, when the mischief intended to be remedied, is the same ? If it were just, that an equitable judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>should be given upon a contract made on the 1st of January, 1777, where the non-payment was owing the creditor, is it not as much so, if it had been made on the last day of December, 1776 ? And since the words of the fifth clause of the law, do not expressly confine the cases to particular contracts, the Court will so construe the Act, as to extend the relief to every case coming within the mischief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-6\">An objection which was over-looked in opening the cause, may here be mentioned : it is, that no is&gt; sue is made up. The pleas conclude with an averment, as it was proper they should, to which there is no replication. The case of <em>Stevens </em>v. Taliaferro, <em>(ante. </em>vol. I. page 155,) is in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-8\"><em>Bonold, </em>\u2014 There is certainly no ground for this objection, after verdict, and a defence made. The record states, that the plaintiff replied generally to the plea, and that issue was thereupon joined. Although the pleadings might have been more formal, yet it is too late after verdict to make an objection.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b10-12\"> See this act recited in a note to the case of <em>Watson &amp; Hartshorn </em>v. <em>Alexanders ante, </em>vol. i. p, 341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b12-6\"> Act of 1727, C. 4. \u00a77.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b12-7\"> Act 1748, C.

They were originally so, and the law made them real estate, only in particular cases, such as in descents, See. But in most other instances, and especially in the payment of debts, they were declared to be personal estate. It is true, the law has protected slaves from distress, or sale, where there is a sufficiency of other personal estate to pay debts or levies, and in this respect thev differ from other chattels; but this qualified exemption does not change their nature, or give to them the qualities of real property. Slaves therefore, being clearly assets in the hands of an executor, and liable to the payment of debts, the executor had a ri &gt;ht to demand securitv of the legatees before he delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>them up, and a Court of Equity would not have com-him to part with the possession, without such security being given, upon the principle of making hjm equity who would have it. The executor appears in this case to have consented to the division directed by the county Court, since it does not ap. pear, that he disclosed the fact of debts subsisting against the estate, or that he opposed the order which, was made upon any principle whatever. That order should be construed according to the reason and justice of the case, and that it was intended only to compel a division of the estate which should remain, <em>after satisfying all legal demands against it. </em>If the executor, with a know ledge of this claim, chose to deliver the slaves to the legatees, without taking security to refund, under an opinion that he had money in his hands to satisfy the debt, he might have made a legal tender of the money, and thus have exonerated himself. But this he did not do. The executor being a trustee for creditors, ought to have taken care to keep enough in his hands to satisfy them, and it is no answer to their demand against him to say, that they may pursue the legatees. They are under no obligation to follow' the estate, though they may do so, if they please. Whether the executor has subjected himself to a <em>devastavit </em>or not, would be a premature inquiry at this time; when a suit is brought suggesting a devastavit, that question may properly be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">As to the other objections, there is no weight in them. The Act of 17b 1, relied upon in the third plea, does not extend to contracts made antecedent to the 1st of January, 1777. This Act has been greatly misunderstood. The principle of the decision in the. case of <em>Kenner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>was soon after reconsidered, and corrected ; for it was absurd to scale specie debts. Whether the executor in this case kept the money or not, does not appear; but if he did not make <em>a legal tender, and kept it} </em>it was his own fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">Though the <em>issues </em>are not formally joined, yet they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Slave been fairly tried, and being found bj? the jury, it is now too late to seek an advantage in consequence \u00a9f that informality.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-4\">Judgment affirmed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b19-5\">(1) 2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 69. <em>77.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
