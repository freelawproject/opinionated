He then appoints his three sons his executors, and empowers them to execute deeds for the lands which he had sold, and ordered to be sold. Only two of the executors named in the will qualified. The testator was possessed of 92,000 acres of land on <em>James </em>river, as well as of other tracts on Catawba, a branch of the same river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Amg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Joseph Borden, </em>the plaintiff in this cause, claiming under <em>James Pritchard </em>and wife (the latter being one of the five daughters of the testator) filed his bill in the High Court of Chancery against <em>Harvey </em>and his wife (the latter of whom is the heir at law of <em>Benjamin Borden, </em>the eldest son and executor of the said testator) for an allotment and conveyance of the 1000 acres devised to Mrs. <em>Pritchard </em>by the clause before mentioned. The bill states that <em>Benjamin </em>the younger had purchased the shares of the other four daughters, and had received a conveyance from <em>Worthing</em>^0?2) former husband of the fifth daughter, (now Mrs. <em>Pritchard) </em>under w hom the plaintiff claims, but that she was not privily examined as the law directs, in consequence of which his title to her share was invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-8\">The answer states that the part to which the daughter under whom the plaintiff claims was entitled, was set apart by the said <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the younger, out of a tract of 20,000 acres on <em>James River ; </em>that he sold considerable quantities of land to discharge the debts of the testator, and he insists, that if the plaintiff is entitled to the quantity now claimed, it ought to be laid off\" out of the 20,000 acre tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-9\">An amended bill was filed for the purpose of making certain persons defendants, who are stated to be in possession of 2,218 acres on <em>Catawba, </em>of the best land which belonged to <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the elder, under a voluntary conveyance from their mother Mrs. <em>Harvey, </em>the female defendant, and heir at law of <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the younger, and praying to have the 1000 acres claimed by the plaintiff laid off out of those lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-10\">The new defendants insist, that the plaintiff ought to have his 1000 acres laid off out of the large tract on <em>James </em>River, and not out of the <em>Catawba </em>lands, as there was not, in the latter tract, as much land as would satisfy the bequest of 5,000 acres, and of course that tract could not have been contemplated by the testator, in the devise to the daughters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-11\">By the report of sundry commissioners, appointed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>an order of the Court of Chancery to state the situations, ascertain the quantities, and describe the boundaries of the lands whereof <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the elder died seised, and particularly of such parts as had been allotted by <em>Benjamin </em>the yt\u00ed\u00fcnger to auv of the daughters of his testator, it appears, that <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the testator, at the time of his death, was possessed of sundry tracts on <em>Catawba, </em>amongst which was 2,218 acres, reputed to be his best land, and which the commissioners think more nearly answers the description of that devised to his five daughters, than any other\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-3\">It does not appear from any part of the record, that the commissioners who took the privy examination of Mrs\u00bb Pritchard, (who with her husband conveyed the land in question to the plaintiff\",) were <em>justices of the peace ; </em>they are not stated to be such in the commission, nor in the certificate\u00bb The deed from Mrs\u00bb <em>.Worthington, </em>(now Mrs\u00bb Pritchard,) and her husband i:\u00bb <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the younger, and which for want <em>Cm her </em>privy examination was void as to her, describes the 1000 acres thereby intended to be conveyed, to be on <em>one of the branches of James River.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-4\">The decree of the High Court of Chancery was as follows, <em>viz. </em>\u2018c That the defendants, or such of <em>them </em>as are in possession of 1000 acres of land herein after directed to be assigned to the plaintiff, do resign the said possession, and convey the said 1000 acres of land to the plaintiff at his costs, and pay to him so much of the profits of the said land since the commencement of this suit as shall exceed (if they do exceed,) the value of the permanent improvements on the said land made by <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the younger, and by the defendants <em>f </em>and commissioners were appointed to assign to the plaintiff one thousand acres of the land mentioned in the reports, to which <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the elder was entitled, and which is in possession of the defendants, or some of them, causing the said 1000 acres of land to be laid off <em>\u2019 </em>y the county surveyor, in one entire parcel, and in a convenient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>form ; and to examine, state and settle the said ae= of profits, and to estimate the said permanent improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A60\">From this decree the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A57\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-8\">The first question in this cause is, whether the appellee has any right at all ? 2dly, whether the land decreed, best answers the intention of the testator ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-9\">1st, The Act of 1748, Ch. 1, \u00a7 6, requires the commission for the privy examination of a <em>feme covert, </em>to be directed to two juctices of the peace, which this is not. It cannot be denied, but that if the persons to whom the commission was directed were not justices of the peace, the deed could not pass the estate of Mrs. <em>Pritchard, </em>and therefore, the <em>Chancellor </em>has presumed that they were such as the law required. I cannot discover any ground upon which to raise such a presumption. The commissioners are not styled justices of the peace in the instrument itself, nor does it appear from their own certificate that they were so. If either had been the case, a presumption might possibly have been created so far at least as to lay the other side under a necessity of disproving it. It should at least appear upon the face of the instrument, that the law has been pursued, or otherwise it can have no legal operation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN4\">2d, The testator had one tract of 92,000 acres of land on the waters of <em>James River, </em>in one body. The lands which are subjected by the decree to satisfy that clause in the will are upon <em>Catawba, </em>a <em>branch of James River; </em>and it appears by the report of the commissioners, that there are not five thousand acres of land in this tract. From these facts, it seems to follow inevitably, that the large tract of land best answers the intention of the testator, because, out of that tract, 5,000 acres may be got in one body, and upon the waters of <em>James River, </em>sufficient to satisfy the will. Whereas the land decreed is out of a much smaller tract than 5,000 acres, and is on the waters of <em>Cataw</em>ba,. In some parts of the will, where the testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>speaks of other branches of <em>James </em>River, he calls them <em>by name, </em>clearly shewing, that he knew how to , distinguish between <em>James River </em>and its branches.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-3\"><em>iStark, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-4\">In no instance do commissions for privy examinations name the persons to whom they are addressed as justices of the peace j and if they did, it would not prove that they were so. Neither would the fact be established, if the commissioners were to style themselves so in their certificate. The <em>Chancellor </em>was right in presuming that they were magistrates, because the law required them to be so; and if they were not, it was easy for the appellant to repel the presumption by positive proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">2d, It appears that <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the younger disposed of all the good land out of the large tract, and having a general power to sell, under the will, he deprived the appellee of the power of resorting to that tract, even if it had best answered the description. The land on <em>Catawba </em>is in the possession of persons claiming under his heir as volunteers, and therefore they are in no better situation than he would have been himself. The testator it is proved had not in any of his tracts 5,000 acres of good land <em>in a </em>body, and because that quantity cannot be found in one tract, is the appellee to have no land at all ? We are then <em>to </em>come as near it as possible ; and however hard it may be upon the appellants that their land should be taken, yet it is to be attributed to the conduct of their ancestor, who has caused it by disposing of all the other good lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-6\">Campbell, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">The objection to the appellee\u2019s title seems to be built upon a misapprehension of the Act of 1748, which is merely directory to the Clerk, and does not require that the persons named in the commission should be therein styled, \u201cjustices of the peace.\u201d The words of the law are 46 that it shall be lawful for the Clerk to issue a commission to two or more commissioners <em>being justices of the </em>peace,\u201d &amp;c. Whether justices or not, is a fact capable of proof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>and the Court will presume they were so, until the , contrary appears.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-7\"><em>Benjamin Borden </em>was bound as executor and trustee, to reserve 5,000 acres of land, all good, for the five daughters. He did reserve lands on the <em>Cataw</em>ba, though not all in a body, nor does the will require it. Nay, it appears that that quantity of good land in a body could not have been found in the estate of the testator. But it is said, that the appellee ought to receive his quantity out of the 92,000 acres of land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\"><em>Benjamin </em>the younger has disposed of this land, arid therefore it is holden either by purchasers for valuable consideration, or by volunteers, as the <em>Catawba </em>lands are holden. If the former, we cannot touch them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">If the latter, may they not object to our claim with as much reason as the present appellants do ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-10\">The report of the commissioners appointed by the <em>Chancellor </em>to view the lands, leave no doubt, Out that those of <em>Catawba </em>will best satisfy the intent of the testator, and to that report there is no exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-11\">Marshall, in reply. \u2014 There is no proof that the 92,000 acres are sold. But if there were, it does not alter the question, which is, do those lands answer the description given by the testator, better than the <em>Catawba </em>lands? I contend, for the reasons first mentioned, that they do, and if so, and by the conduct of <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the younger, such land cannot be obtained by the appellee as he is entitled to by the will, then his claim for compensation will be against the estate of <em>Benjamin </em>Borden, and not against a part of his representatives, who by this decree are to bear the whole loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-12\">The opinion of the commissioners will not carry the claim from the 92,000 acres, if that was the tract contemplated by the testator. A part of this tract must at any rate have been taken to satisfy the devise, since there were not 5,000 acres on <em>Catawba.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b214-13\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahn\">This is a plain case, and, though contained in a voluminous record, the essential parts of it lie within a small compass. An objection is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>io the title of the appellee, because the commission which ivas to enable Mrs\u00bb <em>Pritchard </em>to pass away estate, was not directed <em>to justices of the peace. </em>The Act of 1748, requires the commission to be addressed to persons <em>being justices of the </em>peace, but does not preset ibe the form of it It is certainly necessary that the commissioners should <em>in reality </em>answer this description, because the law requires it; but it does not require that they should be so styled in the commission\u00bb The question then is, ought we to presume the fact that they were justices ? I think we ought\u00bb The law requires the Clerk to direct it to such persons, and he ought not \u2022 to be presumed to have done wrong\u00bb The contrary might have been shewn and if the party meant to avail himself of this objection, he ought to have proved the fact\u00bb I can never agree that the party should be surprised at the trial with an objection of this sort, particularly, where the presumption is in his favour\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">As to the location of the land claimed under the will, one thing is evident, which is, that the testator intended to give to each of his five daughters, 1000 acres-of <em>good lands </em>and it is not required to lie in one body\u00bb But if it had been, the report proves that his intention! as to quality could not in this respect have been fulfilled\u00bb It is to lie on the waters of <em>James </em>River, and so I think the <em>Catawba </em>lands do\u00bb But if it could be avoided, the land ought not to be laid off in small surveys ; and as it is io proof that the 5,000 acres of good land could not have been got io the large tract, in less than twenty surveys, the testator could not have meant that tract, <em>Benjamin </em>the younger seems himself to have considered the <em>Catawba </em>lands as intended by the testator\u00bb Had he then a right to purchase up all the good land, and to impose the bad on the devisees <em>? </em>It is shown by the report, that there remains no good land unsold, and it would be highly unjust, that the executor should by his conduct deprive any of the devisees of that which the testator intended for them j and the appellants claiming merely as volunteers, stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>in the situation of <em>Benjamin Borden </em>whom they represent. I think the decree ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A_G\">Fleming J. \u2014 The first objection made by the appellants counsel to the decree was, that the commission was not so directed, or returned, as to pass the estate of Mrs. <em>Pritchard. </em>It is duly executed by the persons to whom it was directed, and the Clerk is required to address it <em>to justices of the peace. </em>The deed with the commission is returned, and admitted to record. I do not think that we carry the doctrine of presumption beyond its accustomed limits when we say, that to support this deed, we will intend that the law has been obeyed unless the contrary appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The second point respects the location of the land. The Chancellor, discovering much difficulty in ascertaining what lands would best fulfil the intention of the testator, very properly appointed commissioners to view all the lands of the testator on the waters of <em>James River, </em>and to report thereupon. These commissioners had certainly the fairest opportunity of judging, and after stating that <em>Benjamin Borden </em>the executor had sold almost all the good land out of the large tract, they report their opinion to be, that the lands on <em>Catawba </em>more nearly answers the description given by the testator than any other. I am therefore of opin - ion that the decree is right.</p>\n<p id=\"AOh\">The President. \u2014 -I concur fully in sentiments with the other Judges, and for the reasons given by them, I am of opinion, that the decree is right upon both points, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
