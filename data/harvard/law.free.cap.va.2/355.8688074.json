Lord <em>Mansfield </em>said, that, as the trespass <em>-was jointly charged, </em>several damages could not be assessed; but observed expressly, that he did not meddle with the case of <em>several actions. </em>Where the suit is <em>joint, </em>the pleas <em>several, </em>and several verdicts for damages, there must be a choice <em>de melioribus damnis: </em>not so where the <em>actions </em>are several. 7 <em>Vin. </em>256. citing <em>Bulstr. </em>p. 157. <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Cranfield, </em>says, \u201c the battery of one \u201c cannot b\u00bb the battery of anotherand, upon principles of reason and common sense, such ought to be the rule. The case of <em>Lane </em>v. Santeloe,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> is an express adjudication in my favour: for there, in an action for a malicious prosecution, the damages were permitted to be severed, even though the <em>action was joint, </em>the defendants not having <em>pleaded jointly.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-12\">There is nothing against us in the cases cited by Mr. <em>Call. </em>In <em>Ruble </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>the only point decided was, that a release to one joint-trespasser is a bar to a suit against the rest. In <em>Ammonett </em>v. <em>Harris and Turpin, </em>the precise question here in controversy did not exist. It was a joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>action. The release of part of the damages and receipt fon ^le balance5 was a bar to the farther progress of the same action. But in no case that I have seen has it been decided, t]la^ wj}ere there are separate actions, a judgment against one can be pleaded in bar to an action against another. If such was the law, there would be no advantage in bringing separate' actions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-3\">But the Jury in this case have not found that the assaults and batteries <em>were joint, </em>or the <em>same. </em>They only say that it was the same <em>affray </em>in the court-yard; but not that the ^assault was jointly concerted by <em>Burwell Wilkes </em>and <em>Tho-&gt; mas </em>WilkesThey say too, that no evidence was exhibited in the suit against <em>Burwell Wilkes </em>of the assault and battery committed by <em>Thomas Wilkes. </em>It would seem from this, that, in fact, there were two distinct and separate assaults and batteries,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-4\"><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoE\">There is no battery <em>expressly </em>found by the Jury. To supply this, you go back to the <em>plea </em>which says it was the sam\u00e9 assault and battery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-5\">The case of <em>Ammonett </em>v. <em>Harris and Turpin </em>settled the principle now in controversy, upon full consideration of all the authorities. That principle is, that, in assault and battery, all are principals, and satisfaction by one is satisfaction against all. Where the action is joint, and <em>judgment </em>i$ taken, the plaintiff can proceed no farther, because he can have but one satisfaction. The same reason applies where he sues one separately: by taking <em>judgment </em>against that one, he tacitly admits, that this is all the satisfaction he is entitled to,</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-6\">Mr. <em>Hay </em>observed, that, if such is the law, there is no benefit in bringing separate actions. Neither is there, nor can there be. If the plaintiff brings separate actions, it is. at his peril.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\n<em>\u0430) 1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 488.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>p. 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b373-13\"> 11 <em>Co.

The Judges pronounced their \u00bf\u00a1pinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b375-9\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"A7q\">The only material question that seems to occur in this cause is, whether in an action of trespass, assault, and battery, brought against <em>one </em>defendant, he can plead in bar of a recovery, a judgment obtained against <em>another </em>defendant, for the same cause of action, in <em>another </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Mr. <em>Hay </em>endeavoured to distinguish between this case and the cases of <em>Ammonett </em>v. <em>Turpin and </em>Harris, and <em>Ruble </em>v. <em>Turner and </em>others, in this Court,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but the principle, that the plaintiff can have but one satisfaction appears to be precisely the same. And it appears from <em>Bull. Ni. Pri. </em>20. who cites <em>Telverton </em>68. that it matters not, whether the recovery was had in a Joint, or in a <em>several </em>action. 1 <em>Esp., </em>318. is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">But, it may be thought that the verdict is too uncertain as not being responsive to the issue joined between the parties. The <em>gist </em>of the inquiry upon this plea is whether the assault and battery charged in the plaintiff\u2019s action against <em>Burwell Wilkes </em>is one and the same with the assault and battery charged in <em>this </em>action. The Jury have, indeed, With an apparent affectation of superior sagacity, told the Court that \u201c the blows of <em>Thomas Wilkes </em>were not the blows of <em>Burwell Wilkes J\u2019 </em>But, if those blows were given at the <em>same time </em>and <em>place, </em>and in <em>concert </em>with each other, the law pronounces differently from the Jury. The Jury afterwards find that both <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Burwell </em>were, concerned in the <em>same affray, at the same time; </em>they then proceed to say, that it was the same affray, for which a judgment <em>zvas rendered in that Court against </em>Burwell Wilkes. Now what is an affray? We are told that it is the fighting of two or more persons in some <em>public place.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Now, though there may be an assault and battery, without <em>fighting, </em>there cannot I think be any fighting without an assault. And, if the fighting be not with <em>missile </em>weapons, it must also be attended with a battery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Judge <em>Blackstone </em>distinguishes an affray from an assahlt, only from the circumstance of the <em>place </em>where it happens.* If in a <em>public </em>one, it is an <em>affray ; </em>if in private, an assault. I therefore think the verdict sufficiently responsive to the issue, to entitle the defendant to a judgment in his favour 5 and therefore that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed, and'that of the County Court affirmed*</p>\n<author id=\"b376-11\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AQa\">An examination of the case of Ammonett <em>v. Harris and Turpin,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>will shewthat (perhaps) every Judge expressed an affirmative opinion upon the point now in question; namely, that a judgment recovered in an action against one trespasser may be pleaded in bar to an action brought against another for the same trespass: and this seems warranted by the. cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">As to the present Verdict, s\u00f3me ambiguity arises from its having used the word \" affray \u201d but when we consider its true import, I think the verdict sufficiently certain. An affray is defined to be, \u201c the <em>fighting </em>of two- or more per- \u201c sons in some public place. \u201d<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> An <em>affray therefore is </em>nothing more than a public <em>fight. </em>If the word \u201c fight,\u201d or \u201c public fight,\u201d be read in the verdict in lieu of the word \u201c affray,\u201d it will <em>sufficiently </em>appear, that the battery now in question is the same battery with that for which the former recovery was had. In <em>substance, </em>therefore, I think the verdict sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">I am consequently of opinion that the judgment of the District Court is erroneous, and that judgment be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<author id=\"b376-14\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AWA\">The only point respecting the merits of this case is, whether, if a trespass, assault, and battery, be committed by several, a judgment against one of them is satisfactidn for the whole ?</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">It has been decided,by the Unanimous opinion of this Court, in the case of <em>Ammonett </em>v. <em>Harris and </em>Turpin,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> that a recovery against one, and a receipt of the damages recovered, is full satisfaction, and precludes the plaintiff from making ah election against which of the defendants he will. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>take that satisfaction: but that was a case of a joint action;. against several defendants: and Mr. <em>Hay, </em>in the argument, made a distinction between that case and the one now under consideration, in which there were separate actions;, and \u2022 therefore insisted that the recovery against <em>Burwell Wilkes </em>was no bar to his action against' the appellant <em>Thomas Wilkes: </em>but the distinction taken seems not to yai-y the principle ; as it has been shewn by the cases already cited, that if a recovery be had in a separate action against one joint trespasser for a battery, <em>that </em>recovery may be pleaded in bar to an action for the same battery, brought against another.' -</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">On my first perusal of the record, however, -! was doubt-' fill whether the facts found in the verdict were sufficiently explicit to authorise a <em>judgment - thereon, </em>and whether a <em>venire facias de novo </em>would- not be necessary j but, on particular attention to the definition of the word <em>affray, </em>made use of in the verdict, instead of the word <em>battery, </em>used i\u00fa the pleadings, they appear tobe synonymous, and my doubt is removed; so that I have no difficulty in saying that ,1 think the judgment of the District Court is erroneous, and ought to he reversed, and that of the County-Court affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\"> 1 <em>Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>p. 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b375-12\"> <em>4 Bl.
