I give to <em>William Clarke, </em>son of my brother <em>Edward Clarke, </em>after the death of my wife, the abovementioned plantation,'to him and his heirs forever. My desire is that the abovementioned negroes, as they arrive at lawful age (after my wife\u2019s death), shall have their freedom ; and if the said <em>Charles </em>should not be of age at my wife\u2019s death, my desire is that my brother <em>Edward Clarke </em>have the said <em>Charles </em>until he arrives to the age of twenty-one years; also my desire is that if the said <em>Jenny </em>and <em>Rhoda </em>should not be of age at my wife\u2019s death, that <em>Benjamin Lennard </em>have the said <em>Jenny </em>and <em>Rhoda </em>until they arrive to the age of twenty-one years. My desire is that my negro woman <em>Rachael </em>be sold for the payment of my debts. Also my desire is that at my wife\u2019s death all my estate, except land and negroes, be divided between my sister <em>Sarah Bowry </em>and <em>Elizabeth Lennard </em>daughter of <em>Benjamin Lennard.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7p\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The will concluded with the appointment of an executrix and executor, and they qualified as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AK8\">In February or March 1833, the widow died. At her death there were living various descendants of <em>Lnicy, Jenny </em>and <em>Rhoda, </em>born after the testator died. In a suit in chancery between the next of kin of the testator, a decree was made upon the principle that he died intestate as to the descendants so born between the time of his death and the death of his wddow, under which decree a division was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-5\">A bill of injunction was afterwards filed in the circuit court of <em>Charles City, </em>by <em>Jenny </em>and other descendants, suing <em>in forma pauperis </em>for their freedom, against <em>John Ellis </em>and the other next of kin, some of whom it was alleged were about to remove some of the plaintiffs out of the commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-6\">The plaintiffs contended that the will bestowed on <em>Lucy, Jenny </em>and <em>Rhoda </em>an immediate right to freedom, though it postponed the enjoyment thereof until they should respectively attain the age of 21 years, and until the death of the tenant for life : and they claimed that all the descendants of the said <em>Lucy, Jenny </em>and <em>Rhoda, </em>born after this right to freedom was given, and before the time of its enjoyment, were free also. The circuit court was of opinion that this claim was well founded, and, by a decree made the 13th of July 1843, declared the plaintiffs entitled to their freedom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-7\">From which decree, on the petition of <em>Ellis, </em>an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b630-8\">The cause was argued by <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Robert G. Scott </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmL\">For the appellant it was contended that this case was like that of <em>Maria and others </em>v. <em>Surbaugh, 2 </em>Rand. 228. which had been since adhered to in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>10 Leigh 277. and <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>1 Rob. 53. and the principle of which is confirmed by decisions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Tennessee, Kentucky </em>and <em>Maryland, </em>as appears by <em>M'Cutchen and others </em>v. <em>Marshall and others, </em>8 Peters <em>220. </em>For the appellees it was insisted, that, taking the whole will together, this case was distinguishable from <em>Maria and others v. Surbaugh, </em>and that it fell more properly within the principle of <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>West's ex'or, </em>6 Rand. 652. The subsequent cases of <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Elder's ex'or, </em>4 Leigh 252. <em>Erskine </em>v. <em>Henry and wife and others, </em>9 Leigh 188. and <em>Anderson's ex'ors </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>11 Leigh 616. were also relied on.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b631-5\">Cabell, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ACD\">The court is of opinion that this case is not distinguishable from that of <em>Maria &amp; others </em>v. <em>Surbaugh. </em>The decree is therefore reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b631-6\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AI8\">I entirely concur in the opinion delivered by the president for the whole court, that this case comes within the rule which governed the case of <em>Maria &amp; others </em>v. <em>Surbaugh. </em>But as that rule has been sometimes questioned, I shall make some remarks upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The rule is, that the issue shall follow the condition of the mother; a rule taken from the civil law, and adopted by one of our early statutes. The application of the rule in <em>Maria &amp; others </em>v. <em>Surbaugh was to </em>the condition of the mother at the time the issue were born, and not to her prospective condition when she should arrive at the age of thirty-one years, at w'hich period she was to be free. At the birth of the issue she was a slave to all intents and purposes. That was the condition the issue were to follow. To have extended to-the issue the future condition of the mother would have been to place them in a condition the mother might never attain, as she might die before she arrived at the age of thirty-one, or she might be sold for the debts of the testator, and might never be free. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The application of the rule by the court to the actual condition of the mother at the birth of the issue avoided these contingencies, and was more humane as regarded the issue. There was no legal obligation on the master to take care of the issue, especially in cases in which the mother might be set free at an early age, and before he could be compensated by their labour for the expense of raising them. The properly in a slave did not give the right to the master to create a new <em>status </em>of slavery unknown to the law. I differ with justice <em>Thompson </em>in what he says on this subject in his opinion in the case of <em>M\u2019Cutchen &amp; others </em>v. <em>Marshall &amp; others, </em>8 Peters <em>220. </em>in which case the rule and application of it in <em>Maria &amp; others </em>v. <em>Surbaugh </em>was followed. He says, that as a general proposition, it would seem a little extraordinary to contend that the owner of property is not at liberty to renounce his right to it, either absolutely or in a modified manner, as he may think proper: that as between the owner and his slave, it would require the most explicit prohibition by law. All this is undeniable as regards his property: but his <em>slave </em>would still be a slave, unless he was authorized by law to manumit him, by renouncing all property in him. I think it one of the highest acts of sovereignty to exalt a slave into the rank of a freeman, as I have before said in one of these cases. It is true that at an early period there was a law prohibiting persons to emancipate their slaves. But it is not to be inferred that the right existed before. As soon as the mischief was felt, it was corrected by law. That maxim of the law, <em>sic ntere tuo ut alienum non Icedas, </em>forbade it, until afterwards the legislature pointed out the mode of emancipation; which unfortunately has not been pursued according to its terms, or the cases of prospective emancipation would never have existed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
