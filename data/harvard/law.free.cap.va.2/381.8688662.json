Elizabeth, the widow of <em>William </em>Upshaw, accepted the provision made for her by the will of her husband, and after- being in possession of his whole estate for more than twenty years, she gave up part of it to those entitled in the remainder, (the children of <em>James Upshazv,') </em>in consideration of their enlarging her interest in the residue to a fee-simple: she also, on the death of <em>Ann Upshaw, </em>took possession of a moiety of the slaves which had been bequeathed to her by her brother-<em>John Hunt.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-7\">The appellees, <em>(the </em>complainants in the Court of Chancery,) are the three children of <em>Forest Upshazv </em>named in the codicil to <em>William Upshaw\u2019s </em>will, and were brothers and sisters, of the half blood of <em>John Hunt. </em>In <em>March, </em>1797, they filed their bill in the High Court of Chancery, against <em>Elizabeth Upshaw, </em>stating the above facts, claiming a discovery of those slaves, and asserting a title to them and their profits, on the ground that the title in remainder in the said slaves after the death of <em>Ann Upshaw </em>either vested in <em>William Upshaw, </em>or, being <em>devised </em>away by him, ought not <em>now to be </em>claimed by his widow, who under his will had held property of greater value and received the profits thereof for more than twenty-five years, and thereby, as well as by the contract since made with the other legatees of <em>William Upshazv, </em>had made her <em>election </em>to submit to his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-9\">The appellant, (the defendant in the Court of Chancery,) pn her answer, admits the wills of <em>John </em>Hunt.and <em>William </em>Upshaw, but contends, that as <em>John Hunt </em>was entitled as heir at law, to the slaves in reversion after the death of his Brother, <em>Ann Upshaw, </em>by which they were held for. life in right of dower; and, as <em>William Upshaw </em>died before the expiration of the dower estate, <em>he </em>could not deprive her of the slaves which had been specifically bequeathed to her-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>by the will of <em>John </em>Hunt, and which had never been reduced into possession by her husband. None of the other <em>r J </em>allegations in the bill are denied in the answer; but she states that she was obliged to pay, together with <em>James Dillard, </em>her sister\u2019s husband, the sum of <em>77l. </em>16s. 4d.l-2, towards the discharge of <em>John Hunt\u2019s </em>debts, for which those slaves were liable, and advertised, to be sold by his administrator; which she supposes to have been the full value at that time, as they were under the incumbrance of her mother\u2019s dower estate; and therefore hopes that she may be considered in the light of a purchaser, inasmuch as if the slaves had died she must have lost her money, <em>John Hunt </em>having left no other estate to pay his debts; but, in any event, that she may be considered as entitled to a <em>lien </em>on the slaves, for the money so paid with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-9\">The proof as to the payment of the debts of <em>John Hunt </em>was very defective, resting- merely on the- declarations of <em>Dillard, </em>that he had paid a certain sum of money to the administrator, with some other circumstances not of them-, selves amounting to full proof,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-10\">The Chancellor being of opinion that the defendant <em>Elizabeth Upshaw </em>could not <em>righteously </em>retain both one half of the slaves which belonged to <em>John </em>Hunt, and the property bequeathed to her by her husband, and that by disposing of part of the 'latter, she had disabled herself tq resign the one and elect tire other, decreed that on payment by the plaintiffs to the defendant of one half of those debts, of <em>John Hunt </em>with which the said slaves were chargeable, the defendant should deliver up such of them as were held by her, with the increase of the females, and account for their profits before a commissioner, who was also to state an account of the said debts of <em>John </em>Hunt,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-11\">Th'e defendant appealed to this Court,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-12\">This cause was argued on the 29th of <em>June, 1807, </em>by <em>Hay </em>and Randolph, for the appellant, and by Wickham, for the appellees. On account of the continued indisposition of Judge Lyons, who sat in the cause, the other Judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>delayed giving an opinion till this term, when they were unanimous for affirming the decree of the Chancellor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-12\">Hay, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar-E\">The first question is, <em>had William Upshaw a right to devise those slaves to the appellees P Or, did they not survive to his wife f </em>This question he had supposed was forever settled by the decision of this Court in <em>Wallace </em>and wife v. <em>Taliaferro </em>and wife,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> where it was resolved, after a full consideration of the acts of 1/05, and <em>1727, </em>and a review of all the cases, that the husband could not devise slaves, to which he was entitled in right of his wife, unless they were reduced into possession during the coverture; and, in the event of the wife\u2019s surviving the husband, the slaves also survived to her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-13\">Another point arises in the case which is attended with more difficulty. It may be said that, admitting <em>William Upshaw </em>had no right to dispose of those slaves from his wife, still, as he has given her a beneficial interest under his will, she will be compelled to make her election, and cannot take both. In answer to this, the authority of <em>Towel </em>may be quoted, who expressly says that no case has gone so far as to establish this general, position.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> But if the doctrine be^ correct, as laid down by <em>Bacon,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and others, that no person may claim <em>under </em>the will and <em>against </em>the will, it cannot effect the case of <em>Elizabeth Upshaw: </em>she claims those slaves under the will of <em>John </em>Hunt, not under that of <em>William Upshaw, </em>The appellees, <em>Le Roy Upshaw </em>and others, claim under the will of <em>John Hunt alone.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-14\"><em>Randolph, </em>on the same side,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcdP\">relied on the case of <em>Cull </em>and wife and others v. <em>Showell </em>and <em>others,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as decisive of this question. In that case it was held that the testatrix merely intending to give ayyay property, to which she believed she had aright, but being mistaken in that belief, the doctrine of election did not apply. The reason of the difference between our case and others is this. It may be supposed that it was never the <em>intention </em>of a man especially in the case of his wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>to give <em>her </em>estate away. <em>William Upshaw believed </em>the negroes wei-e <em>his; for </em>he devises them as <em>his part.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-7\">Wickham, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3i\">It was not contended that these slaves were <em>absolutely </em>vested in <em>William Upshaw </em>the husband of the appellant; for according to the decision of this Court in the case of <em>Wallace </em>and wife v. <em>Taliaferro </em>and wife, the wife surviving the husband'is entitled, in remainder, to slaves not reduced into possession during the coverture; yet it is equally true, that if the husband chooses to exercise an act of ownership over them, as to release his interest, or dispose of them in any manner, he has power to do so. The husband in this case, having such right, exercises it by giving the slaves to the appellees. He gives by the same will, all his estate to his wife during her life. She accepts of the provision of the will; and afterwards puts it out of her power <em>to </em>renounce it, by a sale of the property. Taking possession of this estate she had a <em>right to </em>dispose of it. She had an estate for life under the will of her* husband upwards of twenty years in possession: this she sells for other property; she sells it for value received. She must be considered as having an <em>interest </em>because she derived a <em>benefit. </em>If a wife takes as <em>devisee </em>she takes as <em>devisee in all respects. </em>She may make her election either to stand by the will or not. In this case she <em>has </em>made' her election, and has by her own act, put it out <em>of </em>her power to renounce it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-9\">The authoi'ity relied on by Mx-. Randolph, even if it had not been oyexi-uled by latter detei'minations, does not apply. There,, a person was mei-ely exercising' a <em>power; </em>she was not disposing of an estate of <em>her own </em>by will. She had no idea that she was giving away her- own property. But the case of <em>Cull and wife </em>v. <em>Showell </em>and others, as to the point relied on by the opposite counsel, has been impeached indie case of <em>Whistler </em>v. <em>Webster,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and 'other cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>All the cases on the doctrine of elections go to establish the principle, that a person cannot claim <em>under </em>and <em>against </em>a will.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\"> 2 Call, <em>447.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\"><em> See Powel on Devises, </em>465.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b401-10\">\n<em> See Suppl. to 7 Bac.

That <em>William Upshaw </em>the husband of Elizabeth, the legatee, on the 17th of <em>January </em>* 1761, made his will, whereby he gave to his wife his <em>whole </em>estate real and personal during her widowhood, and after her decease to the heirs of <em>James </em>Upshaw, equally to be divided amongst them: and by a codicil dated in <em>June, </em>1761, he devised u the negroes in the possession of Mrs. <em>Anne </em>Upshaw, that <em>li </em>were given to his wife by her brother <em>John Huntf </em>il his part he desired might be equally divided among \u201c his uncle <em>Forest Upshaw's </em>three children, at their \u201c mother\u2019s decease.\u201d The appellees are those children \u2014 - and <em>Elizabeth Upshazv </em>having taken possession of the estate of her husband William, and enjoyed it more than twenty years, on the death of her mother <em>Anne </em>Upshaw, possessed herself of a moiety of the slaves, devised to her by her brother <em>J. Hunt; </em>to <em>recover </em>which is the object of the bill. The appellant admits the wills of <em>J. Hunt </em>and <em>William Upshaw; </em>but contends the latter had no right to bequeath the slaves in question; he having died in the life of <em>Anne </em>Upshazv, who held them as her dower. And that she was obliged to pay, together with <em>James </em>Dillard,, her sister\u2019s husband, the sum of 77l. 16s. <em>4d. </em>1-2 towards the discharge of <em>John Hunt\u2019s </em>debts for which those slaves were liable and advertised by the administrator to be sold: which she sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>poses to <em>have </em>been their full value at that time, as the;^ were then under the incumbrance of her mother\u2019s dower estate: and, therefore, hopes she may be considered as a purchaser, <em>J. Hunt </em>having nq other estate left for payment of his debts ; but in any event that she may be considered, as having a <em>lien </em>in the slaves for the money so paid with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The Chancellor decreed the <em>slaves </em>with their profits to the appellees, upon payment by them to the appellant of one half those debts of <em>f. Hunt </em>with which these slaves were chargeable. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The doctrine of elections seems to have been' fully considered by Mr. Powell,- in his- treatise on devises. Therein' he lays down the following principles, ofi the authority of <em>Lord Ch. J. </em>Talbot, in the case of <em>Streatfield </em>v. <em>Streatfield.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c When a man takes upon him to devise what <em>he u has n\u00fa fotver </em>over, upon the supposition that his <em>will# </em>\u201c will be acquiesced under,- the Court of Chancery will \u201c compel the devisee to take <em>entirely,. </em>but not <em>partially u </em>under it,- there being \u00e1 tacit condition annexed to all \u201c devises of this nature, that the devisee do not disturb the tc disposition that the devisor has- made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">To <em>the </em>same effect are the remarks of <em>Lord Ch. J. Dd Grey, </em>in his judgment in <em>Pulteney </em>v. <em>Lord Darlington ;</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c A man may by a mean, and indirectly, <em>give what is not </em>\u201c <em>his </em>own, either by express condition, or <em>equity arising </em>\u201c upon an implied condition.\u201d And to the same effect is <em>Whistler </em>v. Webster.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">And the rule equally applies, says Powel,. whether the benefit under the will be immediate or <em>consequential; </em>for' though the effect in such cases is, that the devise operates as a satisfaction for the previous interest of the devisee,yet the principles by which satisfactions strictly speaking, are governed, do riot apply to cases of this <em>kind; </em>therefore, it is <em>not necessary </em>that the .thing devised should be of the <em>same </em>nature, or of <em>adequate </em>value, with the thing in lieu ol\" which it is to be received, <footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">And <em>Lord Talbot, </em>where the will comprised both real arid personal estate, and the land, to which one child was\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>entitled in tail, </em>was thereby given to another, and a <em>personal legacy </em>to the tenant in tail, went so far as to infer an intent, that whoever took by that will should comply with the whole, and put the party to an <em>election of the estate tail, </em>or the <em>personal legacy.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">To these rules there are some exceptions, or rather qualifications, as if the devisee be a creditor, and not a volunteer, and some others, <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">But (it is said) no case upon this rule has yet gone so far as to establish the proposition that, if a devisor in his will takes upon himself to dispose of an estate in which he has <em>no </em>interest, but which is absolutely another\u2019s, and, in the same will, gives a beneficial thing to the owner of such estate, the owner of the estate shall either waive the benefit of the devise, or renounce his estate: the <em>foundation of the rule </em>being a <em>supposed misconception </em>of the testator as to the situation of his own property.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> And this observation Was particularly relied on by the appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">True it is, <em>William </em>Upshaw, by his codicil, gave the appellees what he had no power to bequeath ; his wife\u2019s interest in the dower slaves held by her mother being merely a reversionary interest, which, in the event of her surviving\u2019 her husband, without his disposing thereof in his life-time, or reducing the slaves into possession, would survive tS her. But it is clear from the words of the codicil, that he thought the slaves were <em>his </em>oxvn, and that he had a-power to bequeath them by his will. This was clearly a <em>misconception </em>of his right in respect to them. For, though he might have <em>sold </em>his wife\u2019s reversionary right, it being a vested interest, yet, if he neglected to do so, he could not dispose of it by <em>xuill, </em>but it Would <em>survive </em>to her. The case of <em>Dade </em>v. Alexander,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> I conceive, does not affect this principle ; for the husband\u2019s right was in that case decided to be absolute, in case <em>he survived </em>the wife; but here <em>she </em>was the survivor.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">But, in order to put a devisee to the alternative of either waiving his own interest under a will, or foregoing his claim to some interest disposed of therein, to which he is previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>entitled independent of the will, it must be clearly evinced that the devisee\u2019s taking both will defeat the <em>general </em>intent of the devisor, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">In the present case it was manifestly the testator\u2019s intention to limit his bounty to his wife to the period of her widowhood, or perhaps her life, after which he beque\u00e1ths the estate before given to her, (or rather, to use his own words, <em>lent to her,) </em>for life, <em>at </em>most, to the childrenof <em>James Upshaw. </em>Whether he was at that time apprised of the bequest of his wife in <em>John Hunt's </em>will, does not <em>appear; </em>but the codicil manifests an intention to make some provision for his uncle <em>Forest Upshaw's </em>children, the appellees ; and he has done it in such a way, as to compel .the appellant to elect either to forego the <em>use </em>of his property, so long as she continued a widow, or to renounce the benefit of the reversion, whenever it should happen. The devise to her being of the use of his whole estate during her life, gives great weight, I think, to this construction. In the ease of. <em>Whistler </em>v. <em>Webster,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> it is </em>held \u201c drat a clear \u201c knowledge of the funds, being requisite to election, no \u201c person shall be bound to elect without such previous know-* \u201c ledge.\u201d Many other cases<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> may be cited to the same effect: and the rule appears to me to be so reasonable, just,- and consonant' with every principle of equity, that I think it ought t\u00f3 be adopted. In the present case, the compromise between the appellee and the remainder-men may <em>be </em>considered as some evidence of such knowledge; and the nature of that compromise is such that it would seem that, in making it, she had determined her election. Otherwise, I should have inclined to think she could not have been considered as concluded of her election, until the death of <em>Anne Upshaw </em>put it in her power to ascertain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>amount and value, both of the property and estate bequeathed TO her, and of that bequeathed from her, by her husband\u2019s will. But talcing all the particular circumstances of the case together, I am of opinion that the decree be affirmed, as to this particular point. But I think the Chancellor ought to have allowed interest upon the money paid to prevent the sale of the negroes by <em>Hunt's </em>executor. In that respect I think the decree erroneous; but I concur in the decree which has been agreed to in conference.</p>\n<author id=\"b407-7\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AIX\">If the case of <em>Cull </em>v. <em>Showell, </em>(Ambler, 728.) relied upon by one of the appellant\u2019s counsel, had never been overruled, or departed from, he <em>might </em>have had more cause to be \u201c sanguine\u201d upon the strength of it, than he has at present. The ground of decision in that case (which was decided in 1772) has, however, been expressly overruled in the cases of <em>Whistler </em>v.

In those decisions it is considered as the settled doctrine of a Court of Equity that no man shall <em>disappoint </em>the will under which he claims; and that, therefore, if aman bequeaths to another, property to which he has no title, but which belongs to a <em>third </em>person, to whom he gives by the same will other parts of his estate, such <em>third </em>person must elect and convey <em>his </em>property to the devisee, or he cannot take the property devised to him under the will: that the only question is, did the testator <em>intend </em>(clearly upon the face of the will) the property to go in such a manner? and that the Court will not ask whether he had <em>power </em>to do so : that it is immaterial whether the testator thought he had the right, or, knowing the extent of his authority, under the influence of this principle, intended, by an arbitrary exertion of power, to exceed it: that the legatee, in such case, cannot dispute the <em>ozvnership </em>of the property bequeathed to the other: and that the legatee can only take the pror perty <em>on the terms on zvhich it zvas given.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>These doctrines are full up to, and even go beyond the case before us: I say go <em>beyond </em>it, because the testator not only considered the negroes in question as his own, having bequeathed them by the terms \u201c <em>my part </em>of the negroes \u201c given to my wife by her brother <em>John liuntf </em>but also because, although the property in those negroes was not then absolutely vested in him, yet from the unsettled state of the law at that time upon this subject,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> he might naturally have concluded the law in this respect to- be otherwise. It is not equitable that, when property is given to another upon a consideration, the <em>property </em>should be exacted, and yet the <em>consideration </em>withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">It is not necessary ip this case to inquire into the <em>extent </em>o'f the rule that a party electing must have a clear knowledge of the situation and amount of the fund elected. In this case the compromise, made with the devisees-over, of the estate derived to the appellant under her husband\u2019s will, not only disabled her from electing the <em>other </em>interest; (she having thereby conveyed the absolute interest in part thereof <em>to </em>such devisees, and herself acquired the absolute interest in the residue;) but was made after so great a lapse of time, that she must have had a clear and undoubted knowledge of the value apd actual situation of both the interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">On the merits, therefore, the case is clear for the appellees. I concur, however, that the decree be corrected sq as to allow the appellant interest upon the money paid by her to redeem the negroes in question,</p>\n<author id=\"b408-11\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AKD\">It is admitted by all parties that the testator, <em>William </em>Upshaw, had no right to, or vested interest in, the negroes bequeathed to the appellees ; but that,' under the will of <em>John </em>Hunt, the right was in the appellant upon the death of her mother <em>Anne Upshaw. </em>The most material point in the cause then is, whether the appellant, to. whom her husband lent the whole of his estate during her widowhood, should be . put to her election, either to take under the will, and relinquish her right to the negroes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ftr to renounce all claim under the will, and take the negroes bequeathed to the appellees, which she claimed under the will of <em>John Hunt ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The case of <em>Cud and wife </em>v. <em>Showed and others, </em>in <em>Ambler, 727. </em>seems in favour of her not being putto her election; but later cases, as <em>Whistler </em>v. <em>Webster,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and others that have been cited, have overruled that case, with some exceptions, and qualifications; and it seems now settled? that where the devisee is instructed, and hath a clear knowledge of the amount or value of the estate claimed under the will, the election must be made; but, othenvise, the legatee shall not be put to an election:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In the present case it seems that the appellant must, of necessity, have been so instructed and informed; because the whole of the estate was devised and bequeathed to her, during her widowhood 5 and she was appointed the executrix of her husband\u2019s will; and that she, after having remained in possession of the estate, more than twenty years, made a contract with the legatees in remainder, whereby she gave up to them a part of the estate, in consi - deration of their conveying to her an absolute right to the residue: which affords the strongest evidence of her having already made her election with full notice and informations of the value of the estate she took under the will of her husband\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">But it appears clearly to nie that she ought to have been Allowed <em>interest </em>on the money she'paid to redeem the negroes chargeable with the debts of <em>John Hunti </em>and that, in, the account to be taken of the profits of the slaves that came into her possession on the death of <em>Anne Upshaw, </em>a just and reasonable allowance ought to be made her, for the support and maintenance of the aged, the children, and others that were unprofitable, (if there be any such among them,) and for other incidental expenses which she may have incurred on their account; as I have been taught by experience, that the maintenance .of a parcel of negroes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>where a considerable proportion of them are breeding \u25a0m&gt;rnerb is rather expensive than profitable.</p>\n<p id=\"Asf\">I am therefore of opinion that the decree is in those respects erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aar\">The opinion of the Court was, \u201c That there was no error <em>l&lt; </em>in so much of the decree of the Superior Court of Chan- \u201c eery as decides that according to the principles of equity \u201c the appellant cannot retain both the slaves bequeathed to \u201c her by the will of her brother <em>John </em>Hunt, on the decease \u201c of his mother <em>Anne </em>Upshaw, who held the same for her \u201c life in right of dower, and the property devised and ct bequeathed to her by her husband <em>William </em>Upshaw, by \u00a3\u00a3 whom those slaves- at the death of the said <em>Anne </em>Upshaw, \u201c were bequeathed to the <em>appellees; </em>and as directs the said \u201c slaves, with their progeny, to be delivered to the said \u201c appellees, with an account of their service and the profits-<em>a </em>arising therefrom ; and as requiresthe appellees to recom- \u00a3,\u00a3 pense the appellant for the monies paid <em>by her in </em>dis- \u2022\u201c charge of the debts of <em>fohn </em>Hunt, with the payment of which those slaves were chargeable: but that there is \u00a3\u00a3 error in the said decree in not allowing to the appellant \u201c interest upon the monies so paid'by her. And this Court <em>u </em>is further of opinion that a just and reasonable allowance should be made to the said appellant for the support &lt;\u00a3 and maintenance of such of the said slaves as are, or may i\u00a3 have been aged, infirm, children, or otherwise expensive \u201c or unprofitable to the <em>holder; </em>as also for such taxes, 5\u00a3 doctor\u2019s bills, and other reasonable expenses paid or in- \u00a3\u00a3 curred by the appellant on account of those slaves, as \u201c she shall be. able to prove-: Therefore it is decreed and \u201c ordered, that so much of the said decree as is contrary to \u201c the above opinion be reversed and annulled, and that the-<em>a </em>residue thereof be affirmed,\u201d &amp;c. .</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\"> Cases <em>temp.
