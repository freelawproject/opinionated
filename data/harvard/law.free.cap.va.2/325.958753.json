Sf M. Booth, </em>and others, to enjoin the sale under a deed of trust which he had made to secure the payment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>bond he had executed to the <em>Booths. </em>The bill alleges, that in August 1837, the plaintiff borrowed of <em>Matthews </em>the sum of 1000 dollars, for which he was to pay five per cent, a month; that he made frequent payments, anc^ th\u00ae1'6 were settlements in which he was charged interest at that rate until December 1838, when he confessed judgment to <em>Matthews </em>in the Hustings Court of Lynchburg, for 1150 dollars; and it was agreed between them that he should pay the same rate of interest on the judgment. That the plaintiff made payments on the judgment, especially one in February 1839, of 1000 dollars; and in May 1839, the parties had another settlement, when <em>Matthews </em>gave him a receipt for 1150 dollars paid at different times, which purported to be in full of the judgment; though <em>Matthews </em>still brought him in debt in the sum of 321 dollars 20 cents, which the plaintiff agreed to pay, with the same rate of interest. This sum it was alleged was wholly and exclusively for the usurious interest, or a part thereof, arising on the foregoing usurious transactions.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b345-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>1845. <em>July </em>Term.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The bill farther stated, that there were subsequently, several transactions and settlements between the parties in relation to the aforesaid debt, and the plaintiff in the year 1839, confessed a judgment thereon to the said <em>Matthews </em>for a sum he does not recollect, but he thinks between five and six hundred dollars; upon which interest at five per cent, per month was to be paid. After this judgment, <em>Matthews </em>pressing the plaintiff for payment, he procured the defendants <em>J. Sf M. Booth </em>to execute their bond to <em>Matthews </em>for the sum of 850 dollars, payable at three months; which he took in part discharge of his judgment against the plaintiff, at five per cent, per month discount; and the plaintiff gave his bond to the <em>Booths </em>for the same amount, and executed a deed of trust on a tract of land and certain slaves to secure the same. The bill charged that the transactions were usurious; that the <em>Booths </em>knew at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>execution of the plaintiff\u2019s bond to them, the nature of the debt for which it was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3D\"><em>Matthews </em>answered the bill, disclaiming all knowledge of the deed of trust, or the considerations on which it was executed, and all interest under it. He said he held the bond of <em>J. 6f M. Booth, </em>of whose solvency he was entirely satisfied, and had sought for, and desired no other security. As to the loan made to the plaintiff in August 1837, he admitted it was true ho had lent the plaintiff 1000 dollars at five per cent, per month interest ; that there were payments and renewals of the note from time to time, until May 1839, when there was a full and final settlement of their transactions in reference to this loan, and the interest upon it, when it was ascertained the plaintiff still owed upon it the sum of 320 dollars: which sum he then paid, and took the defendant\u2019s receipt therefor. This, the answer insisted, fully terminated that transaction; and as more than one year-had elapsed from the said final settlement to the filing of the bill, that the plaintiff was barred of all right to disturb that transaction either at law or equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-5\">The answer farther stated, that, after the aforesaid settlement and payment had taken place, and wholly unconnected with it in any manner, the plaintiff applied to the defendant for a new loan of money, and in May 1839, the defendant lent to him the sum of 500 dollars, on which he was to pay interest at the rate of five per cent, per <em>month; </em>and in May 1840, the defendant advanced to the plaintiff the farther sum of 485 dollars on the same <em>terms; </em>and a statement having been made of the amount due upon these two sums, the plaintiff confessed a judgment for the amount, being 1195 dollars 50 cents. Shortly after this, the plaintiff offered to the defendant the bond of <em>J. fy* M. Booth </em>for 850 dollars, in part discharge of this <em>judgment; </em>and there being a considerable balance still due thereon, the plaintiff gave to the defendant another bond of the <em>Booths, </em>for 450 dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>lars; both of said bonds being made payable directly to the defendant; and a balance of 74 dollars 75 cents still remaining, the plaintiff paid that off, and the judgment wag tjlus fu]}y satisfied and discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8O\"><em>Booth </em>in their answer say, that being called upon to pay their bond to <em>Matthews, </em>they had required the trustee to sell in order to raise the money to meet the debt. They deny that they had any knowledge of the dealings between the plaintiff and <em>Matthews </em>when they executed their bond; and they insist, if the plaintiff is entitled to relief against <em>Matthews, </em>that their bond shall be delivered up to them, and they be discharged from all liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-6\">The cause having been removed to the Circuit Superior Court for the county of <em>Montgomery, </em>came on there to be heard in May 1833, upon a motion to dissolve the injunction, when the Court dissolved the same; and from this decree <em>Cabaness </em>applied for and obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-7\"><em>Eskridge, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APzp\">insisted, 1st. That the appellant was entitled to recover from <em>Mattheios </em>the usurious excess of interest which had been paid by him on the first loan admitted by <em>Matthews, </em>as well as the usurious excess of interest on the second loan; and that a Court of Equity ought to open the accounts as to the dealings and transactions of the parties, from the commencement of the first loan. For this he cited <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>6 Munf. 541; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>3 Johns. Ch. R. 395; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>6 Id. <em>95; </em>and <em>Dey </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>2 Id. 182.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-8\">2d. That the act for preventing usury contains no limitation to a suit at the instance of the party aggrieved to compel the defendant to discover and refund the usurious excess of interest; and that the plea relied upon by the appellee <em>Matthews, </em>that the appellant did not bring his suit within one year after the settlement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>payment of the money and usurious interest upon the first loan, cannot avail him. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Lord, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-4\">3d. That the Court ought not to have dissolved the injunction; but should have referred the case to a commissioner to ascertain the whole amount of illegal interest exacted by <em>Matthews </em>of the appellant, in the series of transactions which occurred between them; and treating <em>Matthews </em>as the creditor, not of the <em>Booths, </em>but of <em>Cahaness, </em>should have set-off the usurious excess of interest against the debt of 850 dollars; and if <em>Matthews, </em>after the said sum of 850 dollars was extinguished, was still indebted to <em>Cahaness, </em>the Court should have given him a decree for the balance against <em>Matthews.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-5\">4th. That although the <em>Booths </em>had no notice of the usurious nature of the transaction between <em>Cahaness </em>and <em>Matthews, </em>yet as they have not paid any part of their bond, the Court has it in its power to relieve <em>Cahaness </em>without in any way affecting their rights, by enjoining a sale under the deed of trust, and directing their bond to be delivered up to them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-10\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9a\">The light in which law and equity will regard this transaction, I apprehend to be as follows. It will regard <em>Cahaness </em>as having induced the <em>Booths </em>to buy a debt tainted with usury, by virtually representing to them that he owed the debt <em>hona fide </em>to <em>Matthews. </em>When, therefore, <em>Cahaness </em>comes into a Court of Equity averring that it was not a <em>hona fide </em>debt, but that it was usurious, he thereby admits that he made a false and fraudulent representation to the <em>Booths, </em>and must on this ground be turned out of Court as to the <em>Booths; </em>because a plaintiff in equity must come into it with clean hands. The application of this general principle of equity jurisprudence to cases like this, and far weaker than this, has been made by this Court again and again. <em>Buckner &amp; als. </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; als., </em>1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Wash. <em>296; Hoomes ex'or &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Smock, </em>Id. 389; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>6 Munf. 541.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-4\">Although the case had been set for hearing, it was not taken up to be heard upon the merits, as between <em>C'a- </em>and <em>Matthews; </em>but it came on upon the motion by the <em>Booths </em>to dissolve the <em>injunction; </em>and it does not appear that the plaintiff was then ready or willing to have it heard as between himself and <em>Matthews. </em>Coming on simply on a motion to dissolve the injunction, it would have been, obviously, premature to order an account of the transactions between <em>Cabaness </em>and <em>Matthews ; </em>or to have passed upon the questions in controversy between them. Accordingly, these questions are not acted on or decided by the Court below, but might have been afterwards considered; and the only purpose of the decree appealed from, was to disconnect the <em>Booths </em>from a controversy in which it was not proper that they should be involved by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-5\">Upon these grounds the decree of the Court below must be sustained, and it is, therefore, unnecessary to discuss any other.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-6\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AfH\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Without minutely stating all the facts of this case, it suffices for the decision of the question presented by this appeal from the order of the Court below dissolving the injunction that had been awarded the appellant to restrain the trustees in a deed of trust from the execution of it for the purpose of providing the funds to pay an obligation of <em>J. Sf M. Booth </em>to <em>Edwin Matthews </em>for 850 dollars, to state, that the pleadings incontestibly shew that after a series of transactions commencing in August 1837, between <em>Cabaness </em>and <em>Matthews, </em>on Avhich usury at the rate of five per cent, per month was charged, <em>Cabaness </em>was ostensibly indebted <em>to Matthews </em>on those transactions the amount of 1195 dollars, for which he confessed judgment in May 1840. That on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the 2d of June 1840, <em>Cabaness </em>obtained the obligation of <em>J. M. Booth </em>to <em>Matthews </em>for 850 dollars, (it being that provided for in the deed of trust,) and delivered it to <em>Matthews, </em>as a payment of 743 dollars 75 cents on said <em>judgment; </em>and afterwards settled the balance of the judgment with <em>Matthews. </em>That the usurious interest charged to <em>Cabaness </em>in the course of these transactions, and which he will pay if he pays the said obligation of the <em>Booths </em>to Matthews, will exceed the amount of that obligation. That the <em>Booths </em>had no notice when they gave their bond to Matthews, of the usurious transactions between him and <em>Cabaness; </em>and their bond is still outstanding in the hands of <em>Matthews, </em>and unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">On this state of facts the question is, was the injunction properly dissolved ? The facts ascertaining that at the time the obligation of the <em>Booths </em>was delivered by <em>Cabaness </em>to <em>Matthews, </em>he had received from <em>Cabaness </em>for usurious interest, more than 743 dollars 75 cents, the amount at which the obligation was valued; if <em>Matthews </em>could be made accountable to <em>Cabaness </em>for these usurious payments, then <em>Cabaness </em>did not owe him any thing, and the obligation as between <em>Cabaness </em>and <em>Matthews, </em>was wholly for usury, and without consideration ; so that so far as <em>Matthews </em>was concerned, it- is not nor could be considered that there should be a dissolution of the injunction. Did the rights of the <em>Booths </em>require that the injunction should be dissolved ? They had paid nothing, and if they were relieved from their obligation to <em>Matthews, </em>they would have no right to proceed on the deed of trust to provide the funds to pay it. The object of enforcing the deed of trust, to provide the means of paying their obligation to <em>Matthews, </em>and the effect of permitting them to do so, is to apply the property of <em>Cabaness </em>to pay a debt to <em>Matthews </em>when <em>Matthews </em>is liable to <em>Cabaness </em>for the usury he would thus receive, and has heretofore received, to a larger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>amount. If the <em>Booths </em>raise from the trust property of <em>Cabaness </em>850 dollars, and pay it to <em>Matthews, Matthews </em>by that payment becomes accountable to <em>Cabaness </em>for an eqUjva]entj for which <em>Cabaness </em>would be entitled to a c^ecree gainst <em>Matthews, </em>and if the deed of trust be enforced, the strange spectacle would be exhibited, of a Court of Justice deliberately adjudging, with all the parties before it, and subject to its order, that the <em>Booths </em>shall sell the property of <em>Cabaness </em>to raise money to be paid to <em>Matthews, </em>which as soon as received by <em>Matthews </em>it ought to decree to be paid by him to <em>Cabaness. </em>This circuity would be not merely wanton, it would be a gratuitous mischief, producing advantage to no one. As the parties were before the Court, subject to its order, the plain course was to have retained the injunction, until the amount due from <em>Matthews to Cabaness </em>for the usury should be ascertained. If it exceeded the amount of <em>Booth\u2019s </em>obligation to <em>Matthews, Mattheios </em>should have been decreed to surrender that obligation to the <em>Booths, </em>and crediting that against the amount due on the account between <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Cabaness, </em>should have decreed in favour of <em>Cabaness </em>for the balance. Thus every right and interest of <em>all the </em>parties would have been upheld and protected. Instead of dissolving the injunction, it should, if <em>Matthews </em>endeavoured to enforce the obligation of the <em>Booths, </em>be extended, so as to prevent him from doing so, while this controversy is unsettled.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded to be proceeded in according to the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
