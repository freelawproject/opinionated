The defendant appeared In his proper person, and failing to chew sufficient cause to discharge the rule, the information was ordered to be filed. The caption of the information is thus:- \u2014 \u201cDistrict of Wythe, <em>Washington </em>and <em>RusselP </em>It states, \u201c that the office of Clerk of the Peace in each County, is an office of great trust and confidence touching the administration of justice,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>&amp;c., and that the said office, in case of vacancies, is inr the disposal of the Justices of the Peace for the same county. That by an Act of Assembly, entitled an ^\u201cC* county of <em>Wythe </em>was formed, and it was, among other things, enacted, that the J astices of the Peace to be commissioned for the said county should meet at the house of <em>James M\u2018 </em>Gavock, in the said county, upon the first Court day after the same should take place, and having taken the oaths prescribed by law, should proceed to appoint and qualify a Clerk, provided that such appointment should not be made, unless a majority of the Justices were pre - sent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXu4\">\u201c That upon the first Court day after the said county had taken place, viz. on the 25th of May, 3790, at the house of <em>James Mt Gavock, </em>in the said county, a majority of the Justices were present, and the said <em>James Nexvell </em>was then a Justice of the Peace for the said county, and was then and there present, and did then and there take the oaths of a Justice of the Peace prescribed by law, and a certain <em>W. Crocket </em>and a certain <em>Robert Crocket </em>were then and there candidates for the office of Clerk of the Peace, for the said county. That the said <em>NewelI, </em>not regarding the oaths of a Justice of the Peace so by him taken, See. upon the day and year aforesaid, at the house of <em>James M' Gavock, </em>in the County aforesaid, did unlawfully, wickedly, and corruptly accept, receive and take from the said <em>W. Crocket, </em>a corrupt promise, that if he, the said <em>James Newell, </em>would then and there give his vote in favour of him, the said <em>W. Crocket, to </em>be Clerk of the Peace in the said county, and if he, the said <em>W\". Crocket, </em>w\u00e9re elected, then he, the said <em>James Newell, </em>should, as a reward for his vote, have from him, the said <em>W. Crocket, </em>one-half of the profits that might accrue to him by virtue of the said office; and that he, the said <em>James Newell, </em>did then and there, acting j\u00bb the capacity of a Justice of the Peace, unlawfully, corruptly, and wickedly, give his vote in favour of the said <em>W. Crocket </em>to be Clerk of the Peace <em>in </em>the said county, in consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>said corrupt promise, so as aforesaid made by the the said <em>W, </em>Crocket, and accepted by the said <em>Newell, </em>to the great dishonour of the office of I ustice of the Peace, against the form of the Statute in such case made and provided, in open violation of the laws, and against the peace, fee.551</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">On the plea of <em>not guilty, </em>the jury found, the defendant <em>guilty, </em>and amerced him in the sum of <em>SOL </em>The defendant moved in arrest of judgment, and assigned as cause thereof, that the information concludes, that the offence was contrary to the <em>form of the Statute </em>in that case made and provided, and in open violation of the laws, and the information cannot, be maintained on either the Statute or Common Law of England, as the Assembly of <em>Virginia, </em>on the 19th day of <em>December, </em>1788, passed an act, entitled <em>u </em>An Act to punish bribery and extortion,\u20195\u2019 and that, In the Act last mentioned, only a <em>qui tam </em>information could be maintained. The errors being over-ruled, judgment was entered for the <em>SOL </em>for the use of the Commonwealth, and the costs, from which judgment the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-6\"><em>Campbell, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-7\">The first exception which I shall take to the proceedings is, that it does not appear the appellant <em>was summonedto </em>shew cause against filing the information, in the manner required by the Act of Assembly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-8\">This mode of proceeding, by which the party accused is deprived of a trial by the grand inquest of his country, ought to be so guarded, as to diminish as much as possible the injury which he may experience from losing the chance of an acquittal by that tribunal. In criminal cases. It is not only necessary that the Court should do right, but It should appear in the record of their proceedings that they have done so. Nothing Is to be intended. It is not enough, then, that the Court <em>directed </em>the party to be summoned, but it should appear that he was <em>actually </em>summoned. It is true, the appellant is stated to have appeared, and failed to shew cause against filing the information 5 but lie might have been accidentally in Court, and to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>circumstance may fairly be attributed his inability to shew cause against the prosecution. It has never been decided that an appearance in criminal cases could cure any error whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-9\">2d. This is a prosecution for bribery and corruption in the election of a Clerk. I contend that the information ought to have stated that <em>an election was holden. </em>If a man be arraigned for misconduct in his <em>official </em>capacity, it ought t\u00f3 be charged that he <em>officially </em>acted. Only one magistrate is stated to have qualified, and it does not even appear that a Court was convened.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-10\">3d. The offence is not laid to have been committed <em>'\u25a0\u2018\u25a0within the jurisdiction of the CourtP </em>I \u00e1dmit, that if there be <em>tantamount </em>words, they will supply the want of those above mentioned. The <em>caption </em>of the information does not more necessarily mean the names of <em>three </em>counties, than it does the names of three persons. But if it do, there is no way by which to infer that the offence was committed within the jurisdiction of the Court, but by connecting <em>the caption </em>with the sentence which charges the offence to have been committed at the house <em>o\u00ed James Ml Gavock, </em>in the county aforesaid, which is nonsense. We cannot hunt over the intermediate parts of the information, so as to connect the above clause with the <em>caption. </em>There is no precedent where the want of laying a jurisdiction has been considered as fatal, in which an industrious Court might not from the whole information have collected enough to remove the objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-11\">Lastly, I contend that upon the merits of the case the judgment is erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-12\">The offence charged is either <em>bribery </em>or <em>the sale of an office. </em>It cannot be the first, because that can be committed only by a person in a judicial capacity. 3 <em>Inst. </em>145. 147. <em>Extortion </em>may be committed by him who acts ministerially, but <em>bribery </em>cannot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-13\">The election of a Clerk, though committed by the law to the <em>judges, </em>is a ministerial, and not a judicial act. The Legislature might authorise the judges to do an act of a ministerial nature; but it would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>therefore change its nature, and become a judicial act\u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-3\">The Information then must be supported, as an offence in the sale of an office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-4\">The Act of Assembly against the sales of offices, was passed in <em>October </em>1792, and this prosecution was instituted in <em>May </em>1791, so that the appellant cannot be convicted under that Act The Statute of <em>Edw. </em>VL then must be resorted to 5 and if so, It Is liable to the following objections:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-5\">First The appellant is ordered to be cited to shew cause why an information should not be filed against him for <em>bribery and corruption; </em>instead of which, he is charged with an offence of a different sort\u00bb If it be necessary that the party accused should be cited at all, I contend that It is the more necessary that the citation should <em>truly state </em>the nature of the accusation 5 for otherwise, it would rather serve to entrap than to benefit him. The information cannot be filed without the leave of the Court: but the leave granted In this case, authorised an Information for one offence, and an information for a different offence is filed, it was therefore filed without leave.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-6\">Secondly. It is determined in <em>Salk. </em>411, that the Statute <em>Edw. </em>VL does not extend to the colonies.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-7\">Marshall, for the appellee\u00bb</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-8\">The first objection Is, that the appellant does not appear to have been summoned. But to this, the record seems to furnish a complete answer. He Is stated to have appeared, which must mean a <em>legal appearance, </em>which it could not be unless he was summoned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-9\">The second objection is, that it does not appear that an election took place. It Is stated that the appellant received the bribe, and voted for the Clerk, which makes the offence complete, though the election from any cause whatever did not take place. The information states that he accepted a corrupt promise, &amp;e. and <em>acting as a Justice of the </em>Peace, did give his vote. He must then have been in Court, acting In h'is <em>official </em>capacity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-10\">The third objection is, that no jurisdiction Is laid\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>It is contended that the names of the counties mentioned in the caption, may as well mean <em>men </em>as <em>counties. </em>But three men cannot make a district; this would be absurd. The information charges, that by law, the justices were to meet at the house of <em>James M\u2018 Gavock, </em>in the county of <em>Wythe; </em>that they did meet at that house in the said county of Wythe, and that then and there the appellant committed the offence. It follows, that the house was in the county of Wythe, and <em>Wythe </em>is said to be one of the counties composing the <em>district. </em>The offence then must necessarily have been committed <em>within the jurisdiction of the Court. </em>Besides, if this be error, it is cured by the Act of <em>Jeofails. </em>In <em>England </em>it is determined, that the Statutes of <em>Jeofails </em>do not extend to <em>criminal </em>cases, because the first Statute being confined to <em>civil </em>cases, the Judges construed all those which followed, in the same manner. It is otherwise with respect to our Act of Jeofails, which is not confined to civil cases by any expressions which the Legislature have used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-8\">Upon the last objection I would observe, that whatever may have been the <em>English </em>decisions concerning the operation of the Statute of <em>Edw. </em>VI. in the colonies, the convention, in this State, by an ordinance passed in the year 1776, adopted all the <em>English </em>Statutes prior to the 4th <em>James </em>I. not of a local nature. This is certainly not local, since it applies to offices tvhich are as well known here as in <em>England; </em>and if the act of selling them be criminal there, it is equally criminal here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-9\">Campbell, in reply. \u2014 -I have contended that it should appear that the appellant was cited. 2 <em>Haw. P. C. </em>263, may be mentioned against me. To this I answer that the recognisance there spoken of, was not essential to the defence of the accused; a notice of the intended prosecution was. \u2014 The same answer may be given to what is said in the same book, p. 270; the oath was required for greater solemnity, but was not necessary to the defence of the accused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-10\">2d point. 2 <em>Haw. P. C. </em>225, shews the certainty necessary in an information. The information states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that a majority of the Justices were present, but not that they held a Court, and unless they did so, the tices might have been present on other business, and not in their official capacities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-5\">3d point. The <em>caption </em>is no pari of the indictment, 2 <em>liatvko </em>P. <em>Co </em>165 to 169. It' cannot therefore be referred to, to shew the place at which the offence was committed, though it may be, for the purpose of showing that the Court ivas holden within the extent of the commission.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-6\">4th point. If the Statute of <em>Edtu* </em>VI. were adopted by the ordinance of the Convention, yet that ordinance .was repealed by the Act passed in <em>December </em>1782/\\vhich declares, that no <em>English </em>Statute, or Act of Parliament, shall have any force in this Common-</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b127-7\">Roane, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_Y\">Several objections were made at <em>the </em>bar to the information and proceedings in this case. As there is one which I deem substantial, it will be unnecessary to take notice of the others. It is not alleged in the information that an election was holden, or that at that election the vote was given. The prosecution, as appears by the order for a summons, and from the whole tenor of the proceedings, was for bribery in the election of a Clerk. But is the o9emce properly set forth? Though I am well satisfied that an election took place, and that upon such election a corrupt vote was given, yet as implications can never without danger be admitted in criminal prosecutions, whether they be by information or indictment I cannot judicially know the fact unless it be certainly alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">It is not certainly stated that the other Judges were sworn, that an election was holden, or that ihe vote was given at that election. If the information had been sufficiently particular in these respects, the validity of the election would have been immaterial. But the vote, from all that appears in this information, might have been a solitary one by <em>J\\\u00b0eweU3 </em>and not social with his companions 5 and 1 hold it to be exceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ingly clear, that wherever an election depends upon the votes of a particular body, composed of many in-div \u00a1duals, it should as plainly appear that an election was holden by that body, as that the individual accused voted at it; for the Statute against the sale of offices will not, in such a case, apply to an individual exercise of the power of appointing. If the appellant gave a solitary vote, it was not an offence within the meaning, because it could not be within the mischief of the Statute, for such a vote could not confer even a colourable title to the office. Neither do I conceive that the case would in this respect be different at common law, supposing that a promise of a reward would constitute the offence at common law. I am therefore of opinion, that the offence is not sufficiently set out in this information, to authorise a judgment either under the Statute, or at the common law. The judgment I think, ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Carrington J. \u2014 I am clear that the information wants that precision necessary in all criminal prosecutions. We can presume nothing; and since it was essential that an election should have been holden, and the vote then given, it ought to have been clearly alleged, and cannot be intended. I agree with my brother <em>Roane, </em>that the information is insufficient, and ought to be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Lyons J. \u2014 I concur in opinion with the other Judges, that the information has not certainty enough in describing the offence. It ought to appear that the offence existed otherwise than in intention: and that it was actually carried into execution, which could only be, by an election having been holden, and the corrupt vote then given.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The President. \u2014 We all agree that there is not sufficient certainty in the information in describing the offence. It is not sufficiently alleged that a majority of Justices qualified 5 that a Court was holden. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>feat an election took place, and that the vote was then given\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\">Judgment reversed with' costs, and the Information quashed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-10\">(1) <em>Dilliard v.
