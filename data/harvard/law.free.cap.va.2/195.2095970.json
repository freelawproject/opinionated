Walker deceased <em>v. </em>Thomas Walke.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-3\">Payments by a former to a subsequent guardian, in depreciated paper money, should be accounted for at their nominal amount, and are not subject to the scale of depreciation. By the appointment of a second guardian, in the room of a former one, the power of the former, as well as his habit of receiving and disbursing moneys, generally, on account of the ward, ceases ; and therefore, payments made by him in depreciated paper money to the subsequent guardian, are not subject to the scale.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\">The appellee filed his bill in the County'Court of <em>Princess </em>Anne, stating, that the said <em>Thomas R. Walker </em>was appointed his guardian, and in the year 1776 was indebted to the plaintiff, 1312/. 12s. Of d, as appeared by his guardianship accounts, settled and filed in the County Court. That in the year the said <em>Thomas R. Walker </em>paid to <em>John Thoroughgood </em>the subsequent guardian of the plaintiff, 854/. 3s. 3d In bonds, leaving a balance of 468/. <em>8s. 8fd. </em>still due\u201e The prayer of the bill is for payment of this balance with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">The answer states, that after the appointment of <em>Thoroughgood </em>as guardian to the plaintiff, he and the testator, <em>Thomas R. </em>Walker, settled the accounts of the latter, and stated a balance then due to the plaintiff, of 244/. 12s. 2d That they have understood, that in the year 1787, after the plaintiff came of age, he accepted a bond from the said testator for the above balance. They state a small payment since, and are ready to discharge the balance still due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">Amongst the exhibits filed in this cause, is a letter from Thoroughgood, to the testator, <em>Thomas </em>R. <em>Wal</em>ker, dated in <em>June </em>1786, enclosing a blank bond, with a request, that the testator would settle the balance due to the ward, (the present plaintiff,) fill up the bond with the sum due, and return it executed. The wri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ter also acknowledges in this letter, the receipt of 300/\u00bb in <em>January </em>1780, \u201c which\u201d he says, \u201cwill, according to the scale of depreciation, amount to <em>11. </em>10s. specie, and being deducted from the balance now on the books of the said testator, will be the amount in which he is indebted.\u201d He also adds, \u201c that the testator should not complain of hardship in the settlement, as a great part of the money paid by the testator, was received by him in paper money according to its nominal amount.\u201d In answer to this letter, (also dated in <em>June </em>1786,) the testator promises to prepare for the settlement, and adds, \u201c that he shall say no more about hardships, being fully satisfied that all debts should be settled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-9\">The bond was accordingly filled up with the sum of 244/., and returned : it was afterwards accepted by the plaintiff without objection, except, that by letter, he required a bond from the testator for the amount of the interest on the 244/., from a date anterior to the principal bond ; this bond for interest was not given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-10\">The cause coming on to be heard, on the bill, answer, replication and exhibits, an account was directed. The commissioners report a balance of 784/. <em>4s. </em>due the plaintiff, w\u2019ith interest. In this account, they reduce the 300/. by the scale of <em>January </em>1780 ; they also make a special report, stating the bond above mentioned, amongst other exhibits, but give it as their opinion, that the plaintiff was not bound by the settlement, nor by his letter to the testator, since the terms of it were not accepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-11\">The report not being excepted to, a decree was made confirming it, from which the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-12\">The High Court of Chancery directed an account to be settled before one of the masters of that Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-13\">To the report made by the master, exceptions were filed, and amongst others, the following : <em>viz. </em>that the settlement with <em>Thoroughgood </em>ought to be established; and if not, the payments in paper money ought to .be credited at their nominal amount, and not according to the scale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The exceptions being over-ruled, the decree of the County Court was affirmed, and an appeal was prayed to this Court</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-3\">Marshall, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-4\">The settlement between the first and second guardian was binding upon the ward, unless unfairness or collusion between them in making it had been charged, and proved. But if I am incorrect in this, I contend, that the payments made to the second guardian in paper money, ought not to have been scaled. The Act of 1781, Ch. 22, is too clear upon this subject to be misunderstood 5 it declares, that all payments, either to the full amount, or in part discharge of any debt, are to be credited at their nominal amount. Nothing I conceive but the agreement of parties could vary this rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">It is true, that in this case, the payments were scaled by the settlement; but this was part of the settlement ; and if the settlement be annulled, the agreement to scale has equally lost its obligation upon the parties f for surely, the Court will not set aside the former, and bind the parties by the latter, when both constitute one entire act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-6\">Campbell, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">This is the common case of a ward calling upon his guardian for an account. The guardian attempts to avoid it, by insisting upon a settlement made with the former guardian ; a fact not responsive to the bill, and therefore not to be noticed, further, than as he could prove it to be correct and fair. . That it was either, in this case, cannot be contended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-8\">As to the payments made by the guardian, they ought to be scaled. That clause of the Act of 1781, Ch. 22, which declares, that payments made of any sum, either to the full amount,-or in part payment of any debt, should be credited at the nominal amount, was never considered as being applicable to cases of running accounts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-9\">Wickham, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-10\">I consider it as an important question, whether the exception to the master\u2019s report can avail the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>lant, as it was not <em>originally taken to the report made in the County Court.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-9\">I doubt very much the power of the High Court of Chancery, acting as an <em>appellate </em>Court, to direct an account. The decree, such as it appeared upon the record, should have been affirmed, or reversed and remanded; and if so, the former must have taken place, since the report <em>on </em>Avhich the decree sought to be reversed, was founded, was not excepted to. As well might this Court direct an account, and upon the report, make a decree corresponding with it; but this was never yet attempted. The reference in this case was only for the purpose of calculation, and was not intended to open the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-10\">As to the merits, I lay it down, that nothing can discharge the guardian from accounting, but a settlement with <em>the ward, </em>after his attaining full age. <em>Payments </em>to the second guardian, would, I admit, be valid ; but a <em>settlement </em>would not. Great inconvenience might result from a contrary doctrine; the second guardian might with the best intentions be imposed upon | and yet he might repel the claim of the ward, by saying, he was a trustee, and acted with good faith, and therefore should not be charged; and the first guardian would defend himself by the settlement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-11\">But in this case, no settlement appears. One guardian demands it of the other, and calls for a bond for the balance : a bond is given, but no settlement is made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-12\">The consent of the appellant to be accountable by the scale, forms no part of the settlement, but is antecedent to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-13\">The Act of 1781 with respect to partial payments, is never applied to items in unliquidated, running accounts, and so it has been often settled in this Court. But certainly it can never apply in the case of a trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-14\"><em>Marshall, </em>in reply. \u2014 There is no doubt, but that the Chancellor may, upon an appeal, open the decree, and if necessary, direct a new settlement of the accounts ; he is in the constant practice of doing so, and I have never before knottm it questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>In <em>Humphrey </em>v. Smith, this Court reversed the <em>Chancellor's </em>decree, because a calculation had not been made by the master, which any person might have made in one minute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-3\">But be this as it may ; if the error appear in the decree of the County Court, or is <em>apparent upon theface of the account, </em>it will be sufficient to reverse the decree of the High Court of Chancery, although no exception was specially taken j for an exception is not necessary, where the error appears, either upon the face of the account, or in a special report The use of an exception is, to bring into view such objections to the report as do not appear upon the face of it</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-4\">In this case, the commissioners have stated specially the ground upon which the account is settled, and the Court are at liberty to say if they decided right or not</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-5\">But it is contended, that no settlement was made j we see a letter respecting a settlement, with an admission of the sum then due, an account, and a bond for the balance, in the possession, first of the guardian, and then of the ward. Suppose that the ward was not originally bound by the settlement; he is certainly-concluded by his subsequent consent to, and ratification of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">This consent is proved by his having possession of the bond after his arrival at age, and his letter to the testator, demanding a bond for the interest due on the 244/.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-7\">It is then said, that in cases of this sort, we are not entitled to a credit for payments at their nominal amount, and that the point has been so decided in this Court. If such have been the decisions, I atn a stranger to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-8\">The testator ceased to be guardian before depreciation began | <em>Thoroughgood </em>succeeded him in that office, which completely closed the accounts of the former; the balance then due, whether liquidated or not, was a debt to be paid \u00a7 no further items could be introduced into it but payments, and thes\u201de, when made were like all other payments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>It is objected, that <em>Walker </em>was a trustee; so he was until he ceased to be a guardian ; but whether he was or was not, it has been determined in this Court, in the case of <em>Salle </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>and <em>Granberry </em>v. <em>Granberry, </em>that payments made by an executor to the estate he represented, and entered on his books, should be credited at their nominal amount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\">We are then brought to consider, whether this right to a credit at the nominal amount has been abandoned. It is not true, as was contended, that the consent of the testator to scale preceded the settlement; but if it were, the principle of the settlement is thereby established, and if the settlement be set aside, it would be monstrous to bind the testator by his concessions in that letter, which were made in order to produce the settlement.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b264-7\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">Upon the appointment of <em>Thorough-good, </em>in 1776, as guardian of the appellee, the character of the appellant\u2019s testator as guardian ceased, and with it, his liability to pay and receive monies generally, on account of his ward. Consequently, any payment by him thereafter, to the succeeding guardian, should be considered as a payment on account of a debt admitted to be due. And the receipt for 300/., given by <em>Thoroughgood, </em>in <em>January </em>1780, which uses the terms, \u201c 300/. in part of your account with <em>T. </em>WTalke,\u201d strongly imports, that that money was received in part of a <em>debt </em>due from the testator to the appellee as his former guardian; of course, that payment, must, according to the second section of the Act of Assembly, directing the mode of adjusting and settling certain debts and contracts, and agreeably to prior decisions by this Court, be credited at its nominal amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">If the letter of the appellant\u2019s testator of <em>June </em>1786 can be construed into an admission that the payment of the 300/. should be subjected to the scale of depreciation, it was made in consequence of an offer of <em>.Thoroughgood, </em>in his letter of the same date, to accept a settlement <em>made by the said testator </em>from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>books, according to the tenor of that letter\u00a7 and the appellee, by bringing this suit, having departed from the settlement so made, or <em>expected to be made by the testator, </em>the admission, if it can be considered in that light, (for the expressions are extremely vague and indefinite as to that,) is no longer binding upon the representatives of the testator\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">I am therefore of opinion, that the decree is erroneous is not allowing the credit for the 300/., as its nominal amount\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">THE COURT gave the following opinion and decree, <em>viz :</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><em>u </em>By the appointment of <em>John Thoroughgood </em>to the guardianship of the appellee, the guardianship of the appellant\u2019s testator, as also his habit of receiving and disbursing moneys generally, oh account of the appellee, having ceased, the receipt thereafter of any money by the said <em>John </em>Thoroughgood, from the said preceding guardian, should be considered as a payment on account of a debt admitted to be due from him as guardian aforesaid j that by authority of the Act of the General Assembly passed in 1781, entitled <em>u </em>an Act directing the mode of adjusting and settling the paym\u00abnt of certain debts and contracts, and for other purposes/\u2019 and in conformity to former decisions by this Court, the payment of 300/., made the 3d of <em>January </em>1780, by the appellant\u2019s testator to the subsequent guardian, was not subject to the operation of the scale of depreciation \u00ed That there is error in the decree of the Hight Court of Chancery, permitting that payment to stand reduced, and that there is no error in the residue of the said decree, therefore, &amp;Co\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
