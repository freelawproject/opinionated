Upon the motion of the defendant in error, the forth-coming bond above stated was quash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ed, as being informal. The order of the Court was entered as follows: <em>viz, </em>\u201cOn the motion of <em>John </em>Chinn, &amp;c. executors of <em>Rawleigh Downman </em>deceased, against <em>Rawleigh </em>Downman, on a bond taken on an execution sued out of this Court by the said executors, against the said <em>Rawleigh </em>Downman, it is ordered, that the bond taken on an execution sued out of this Court by the said executors against <em>Rawleigh Downman </em>to <em>Richard Beale, </em>Sheriff of <em>Richmond </em>county, for the forth-coming,of property taken on the said execution, be quashed, it appearing to the Court that the same is insufficient.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\">To this order a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded by one of the Judges of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-8\"><em>Campbell, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-9\">Contended, that the Court had no right to quash a forth-coming bond, although it should be informally taken; that it was to have the force of a judgment, and was as completely out of the reach of the <em>same Court </em>to which it was returned, as the judgment of a preceding term would have been. But that if the Court might properly exercise this power, the second execution ought also to have been quashed, since it improvidently issued upon the original judgment, after a forth-coming bond had been taken and returned; and to prove this, he relied upon the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Dundass </em>decided in this Court, (see <em>ante, </em>vol. i. p. 95.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-10\"><em>Washington, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-11\">Contended, that the bond, being clearly defective, could no otherwise be got rid of, so as to authorise the plaintiff to proceed to obtain the effect of his original judgment, than by a motion to quash it: That in the case of <em>Hendricks Taylor </em>v. <em>Dundass, (ante, </em>p. 50,) this Court had affirmed the,\u00a1 judgment of the County Court, quashing a forth-coming bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-12\">As to the second execution, that was merely a ministerial act, and could only have been quashed by the Court from whence it issued, upon a motion regularly made for that purpose ; and if upon that motion, the Court had given an erroneous opinion, it might pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>perly have been corrected apon an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-4\">But upon this appeal, the Court is confined to the judgment of the District Court upon the motion which was made, and cannot notice the second execution, which is regularly no part of the record. This point was settled in the case of <em>Leftwich </em>v. <em>Stoval </em>(ante, vol. i. p. 303.) In the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Dundass, </em>a second execution issued without a previous motion having been made to quash the forth-coming bond, and the motion which produced the judgment in that case, was to quash the <em>second </em>execution\u00bb</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b253-5\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7U\">There is no doubt but that this bond is faulty in the following instances at least <em>% </em>1st That it is made payable, not to the creditor, but to the Sheriff. 2dly. The amount of the execution is not recited in it; and 3dly. The condition is to deliver the property, not at the time and place of sale, as it should have been, but when demanded. But it is objected, that the Court had no power over the bond, so as to quash it, though ever so faulty. The cases which were cited by the counsel for the defendant in error, and another also decided in this Court of <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Taylor, {ante, </em>vol. L p. 259,) furnish a complet\u00e9 answer to this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The order of the District Court, though right upon the main points, is rather too general, in not specifying the bond more particularly by its date, amount,</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">&amp;c.;. however, as it is spread upon the record, we must suppose, that it was that bond to which the motion and order related.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">As to the second execution, there is no doubt but that the Court ought to have quashed it, if a motion for that purpose had been made. But it does not appear that the Court were informed of its existence, and therefore we cannot say that they erred.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-9\">Carrington J. \u2014 Concurred in the same opinion.</judges>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Lyons J. \u2014 \u2014It seems to have been admitted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>counsel for the plaintiff, that this bond was faulty, but the power of the Court to quash it is denied. It would certainly be highly inconvenient, if ministerial acts like the present were without the control of that Court to which the officer belongs; and if the only remedy for the party aggrieved by his mistakes, were an action against the officer. I hold the law to be otherwise, and that the Court may properly correct the ministerial acts of its own officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">The proceedings in this case have certainly been very irregular; the Court ought to have quashed the second execution, if an application for that purpose had been made, because the forth-coming bond, whilst in force, was a satisfaction of the first judgment. The general course is to quash the execution, as well as the bond; but as no motion for this purpose was made, we cannot condemn the order which was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">Order affirmed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-15\">(1) <em>Glassock </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>1 Munf. 606. <em>Bronaugh\u2019s ex. </em>v. <em>Freeman, 2 </em>Munf. 266. <em>Lusk </em>v. <em>Ramsay, </em>3 Munf. 439<em>.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
