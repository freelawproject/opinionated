The Chancellor appointed commissioners to divide and allot the said property, which they did, allotting to <em>Charles </em>Carter, of Shirley, one fourth part of all the said lands, and comprehending in his share the 3,500 acres of land first above mentioned. On the report of the commissioners it appear-, ed, that the share so allotted to <em>Charles </em>Carter, or the greater part thereof, had been before that time sold to others by the defendant, <em>Robert </em>Carter, and was held in possession by a number of persons claiming under him; and the counsel for the said <em>Robert </em>consented, before the Court, that the fourth so incumbered should be decreed to the said Robert, who would be thus enabled to support his own conveyances; and. that the fourth allotted to hint should be decreed to the said <em>Charles. </em>This decree, however, was not final, as accounts remained unreported between the <em>parties; </em>and an affidavit on behalf of the said Robert, made by one <em>Benjamin </em>Dawson, (stating that his counsel, who had agreed to the exchange of lots as aforesaid, had done so by mistake, and without authority,) being introduced, the Chancellor rescinded so much of his decree as confirmed the said exchange, and decreed the fourth, part, including the lands in dispute, (according to the first allotment,) to <em>Charles </em>Carter, who thereupon brought his action of ejectment against the persons in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">On the trial of the cause, the plaintiff produced in evidence to the Jury the aforesaid patent of the 2d of <em>Marshy </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>1729; a copy of the indenture of the 4th of November* 1731; (the defendants having; agreed that the latter should-be considered of the <em>same authenticity as if it had been certy the clerk of the General Court p) </em>and also a record of the proceedings and decree in the suit in Chancery aforesaid, for the purpose of proving that the lands men* tioned in the said indenture had been partitioned between the parties mentioned in the said record, and. that the lands in dispute had been allotted tp the lessor of the plaintiff. \u201c The District Court,- upon an objection being \u201c made by the defendant\u2019s counsel, refused to permit \u201c the said record in Chancery as evidence against the \u201c defendants in this suit: it appearing in evidence to \u201c the Court, that the defendants, and those under whom \u201c they claim, had been in possession of part of the land \u201c mentioned in the said record, (being the lands in the \u201c declaration mentioned,) ever since the year 1762, under \u201c a deed of conveyance in fee-simple made by <em>Robert Car</em>ter, the defendant in the said suit in Chancery, to <em>John </em>\u201c Semple, that the said <em>John Semple </em>afterwards mortgaged \u201c the said premises in the declaration mentioned to <em>Philip </em>\u201c <em>Ludwell </em>Lee, which mortgage was foreclosed by a decree \u201c of the High Court of Chancery, and sold by virtue \u201c thereof in the year 1788, and purchased, and a title ac-: \u201c quired thereto by the defendants,' and those under whom \u201c they claim, at said sale to which opinion of the Court the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-4\">The defendants also objected to the admission of the above-mentioned <em>copy </em>of - the indenture as evidence, alleging that the <em>original </em>was not such an instrument as bylaw was directed to be recorded: but the Court overruled .the objection; whereupon they also filed exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">The Jury found a verdict for the <em>defendants; </em>and judgment being accordingly entered for <em>costs </em>against <em>Charles </em>Carter, the lessor of the plaintiff, he took an appeal to this Court; which having abated by his death, was revived by, <em>Robert Randolph </em>and <em>Carter </em>Berkeley, trustees appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>in his last will and testament to the uses therein mentioned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aiv\"><em>Warden </em>and <em>Call, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>Bo its </em>and <em>Edmund I.

That the deed of 1731 vested the title in <em>Robert Carter </em>as a <em>trustee </em>only; that there was no <em>adverse </em>possession until 1762; that <em>then, </em>the deed to <em>Semple, </em>being a deed of <em>bargain </em>and <em>sale, </em>did not convey an <em>adverse </em>possession; such a deed conveying no greater estate than the <em>bargainor </em>possesses ; that a tenant <em>in common </em>by such a deed can convey his own part only; that a <em>feoffment </em>has a different effect, because it operates a <em>disseisin, </em>by entry and <em>livery </em>of <em>seisin ; </em>that a <em>fine </em>or <em>recovery </em>is equivalent to a <em>feoffment </em>in this respect; but all other conveyances,by statute, or otherwise, do not operate a <em>disseisin,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which must be an actual <em>ouster; </em>for <em>a,-wrongful possession </em>may be without a <em>disseisin </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and even the taking possession Under a judgment in ejectment does not operate a <em>disseisin, </em>which always implies a <em>wrong </em>\u2014 -a <em>personal </em>injury.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> The statute of limitations therefore did not bar this ejectment; for it never-Tuns against a man, except when he is actually <em>disseised, </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Again, <em>Robert </em>Carter, by virtue of the deed of 1731, held po possession of more than his share as tenant in common, except as <em>trustee </em>for a special purpose; for that deed was a covenant to stand seised to the use of his partners and himself, and the statute transferred the uses into possession. Each tenant, under that deed, legally had .the <em>seisin </em>Of his own share; and <em>Robert Carter, </em>not being possessed in <em>severalty, </em>of the part which he sold to <em>Semple, </em>could not convey it to him by deed of <em>bargain and </em>sale.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> <em>Charles Carter, </em>therefore, claimed under the old deed as tenant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>. <em>common; </em>and <em>one </em>tenant in common may maintain ejectment against another, or against any other person, to recover his social possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-13\">2. The record of the suit in Chancery ought to have been admitted as <em>evidence; </em>because <em>Washington and </em>others, though not <em>parties </em>to that suit, were <em>privies; </em>since they derived their titles from <em>Robert </em>Carter, and might, if the decree had been in his favour, have used it against <em>Charles Carter </em>and the other complainants. The case of <em>Lee </em>v. Daniel, executor of <em>Cook,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>shews that judgments may be evidence against all who are <em>privies; </em>and it is a rule that, if a judgment between certain parties may be used as evidence against a man, he may avail himself of a judgment between the same parties, if it make in his favour.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-14\">' On the part of the appellees it was said, that it does not follow, because a bargain and sale conveys only the legal title of the bargainor, that it cannot operate a <em>disseisin. </em>The act \u201c providing that wrongful alienations of lands shall be \u201c void so far as they are wrongful,\u201d<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> declares that no canveyance shall carry more than the legal title of the person conveying. If, therefore, the doctrine contended for on the other side were correct, <em>no conveyance </em>could operate a <em>disseisin. </em>By the act \u201c for regulating conveyances,\u201d<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> almost all distinction between <em>bargain and sale </em>and <em>feoffment </em>is done away j and no distinction in practice exists between them; for, now, whenever a man sells his land, he makes a deed of bargain and sale, and delivers possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-15\">The statute of limitations, therefore, barred the plaintiff\u2019s claim. There was no <em>trust </em>in <em>Robert Carter </em>to pre- ' vent this. He was indeed a trustee until the deed of 1731; but, upon that deed, the statute executed the trust fay transferring the use. It was a deed of conveyance: and hence the recording of it was legal. If it was not a deed of conveyance, the record of it was unauthorised and void. All this is admitted on the other side. Yet it is said that <em>Robert Carter </em>continued to be a trustee of the land. The trust could' not be executed, and yet 'continue; ffor could.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>there be a trustee without an existing trust. Froto the first conversion of the profits to <em>Robert Carter\u2019s </em>own use, he became a <em>deforceant </em>of the estates of the other tenants in common. A <em>deforcement </em>by one tenant in common, consisting in his receiving all the rents for 20 years, claiming the whole and denying the. title of the other tenants, is evidence of an ouster, and will bar an ejectment on behalf of the ousted tenants.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> If <em>Robert Carter </em>had died after this deforcement, having peaceably received the profits five years, the descent would have <em>tolled </em>the entry of the other tenants and barred an ejectment. A descent was certainly cast before 1762; and more than 20 years had then elapsed; so that, on both grounds, the ejectment was barred before the sale to <em>Semple. </em>That sale gave a more decided character to the adverse possession, and constituted in every respect 'a <em>disseisin de facto. </em>It is not settled, however, that an <em>adverse </em>possession is necessary to bar an ejectment. The word \u201c adverse\u201d is applied, by all <em>the </em>books, only to the 20 years\u2019 possession of the <em>lessor of the plaintiff. </em>If the heir fails to enter on his inheritance for 20 years, he cannot enter to eject an occupant even of <em>one year </em>only. In every point of view, therefore, the possession being unconnected with a trust, and coupled with one or more descents, and an actual <em>disseisin, </em>and having continued more than 60 years, would not only bar .an <em>ejectment, </em>but a <em>writ of right.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-10\">On the main question whethfer the record from the Court of Chancery was'properly rejected or not, the counsel insisted, that itwas aprinciple of universal justice that amanshallnot be affected in his interests by a decree, against which he had no opportunity of being heard and of exhibiting testimony. A case could not well be conceived, in which all the reasons of this rule applied more strongly, than in the present. The rule that judgments or decrees are binding on. parties and privies, must be construed, according to rational principles, to mean, that, after a title is established by a judgment, it is evidence as to all persons deriving title <em>subsequently, </em>under any of the parties, but not as to persons deriving title <em>before -the suit ivas commenced, </em>(as in this case,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>from either of those who were afterwards parties. A contrary doctrine would lead to innumerable frauds, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It would seem that the counsel who offered the record was sensible that it could not be evidence against the title of the defendants ; for he limited the object of introducing it to proof of 'the <em>partition </em>and allotment, of <em>the </em>lands in controversy, to the lessor of the plaintiff. <em>No </em>partition could be binding on the appellees unless they wex-e parties to it. It was as necessary that they should be heard in the cause for partition, as it would have been for <em>Robert Carter </em>to have been heard, if the suit for partition had been brought before he sold the estate. This professed limitation of the object of the evidence was a mere pretext to get the decree before the Jury. If it was to affect the rights of the defendants in any way, it was inadmissible. . If it was to affect them in no way, it was impertinent to the inquiry, and for that-cause ivas properly rejected.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b365-11\"> 1 <em>Burr. </em>93. <em>Taylor, </em>lessee of <em>Atkins, v.

Upon the trial the x-ecord of the pax-tition made between the tenants in common under a decree of the High Court of Chancery, was offered to be -read in evidence by the plaintiff, but reject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ed by the Court, because it appeared to them that the defendants hacl been in possession of the premises ever since the year 1762,.under the conveyance from is?. <em>C. </em>jun. to <em>y. Semple.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">I have entertained very considerable doubts upon the only question of any importance arising in this cause; namely, the admissibility of the record of partition between <em>Robert </em>and <em>Charles </em>Carter, and the other tenants in common, upon the trial of this ejectment, inasmuch as neither the defend, ants, nor any person under whom they claim, except <em>Robert </em>Carter, were parties to the suit in Chancery for a partition of the lands held in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">In the first place, I had no doubt that the covenant to stand seised, to the use of the other parties to that covenant, in fee-simple, did, under the operation of the statute of uses, vest a legal estate, in fee-simple, in all the parties thereto, as tenants in common, of the whole undivided <em>Frying-Pan </em>tract of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Secondly, it appeared to me, that if, after partition made? a real action had been brought against either of the tenants in common, they might, by the common law, have <em>vouched Robert </em>Carter, jun. as heir to the covenantor, to <em>-warranty.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And, on the other hand, I had no doubt, that, if a real action had been brought against <em>John </em>Semple, or his heirs, they also might vouch the same <em>Robert Carter </em>to warranty, by virtue of his conveyance to <em>John Semple. </em>And this upon that principle of the common law which substituted a <em>voucher </em>in lieu of an <em>action.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And, inasmuch, as, in a contest between parties claiming under the same feoffor with warranty, whichever prevails, the warrantor is liable to the other upon his warranty; or, if he be dead, his heir is equally liable ; it seemed to me at first, that there was such a privity between the parties in this ejectment, as that the record of partition might be admitted as evidence in a controversy between them.- But I am satisfied, upon further consideration, that it ought not. For there, is no pri. vity between the present defendants and <em>Robert Carter </em>who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>sold the lands to <em>Semple. </em>They are neither the heirs, nor even assigns, of <em>Se?nple. </em>Their claim is founded upon the decree for the sale of the lands, upon the foreclosure of <em>Semple's </em>mortgage to <em>Philip L. Lee: </em>if they have a conveyance, it must be from the sheriff, by whom the decree was executed, pursuant\" to the directions of the statute.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> There is therefore no foundation to presume any privity between <em>Robert </em>Carter, and them. The record, therefore, was properly rejected, and the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b370-10\">judge Roake.</author>\n<p id=\"Aul\">I have seen no adjudged case upon the very point; but it would seem to be a just position, that a Verdict against an ancestor, in order to bind those claiming under him, must have taken place daring the. existence of his title. If this criterion be not adhered to, I sec nothing to prevent the ancestor and his heirs from binding those deriving title under him, at the most remote periods of time. This would produce innumerable frauds, and let in the transactions of insolvent persons. Besides-the spirit of the rule, that no man is to be bound by a verdict, unless- he or those under whom he claims, had the liberty to cross-examine, would perhaps, be violated; that spirit seems to require that the party to the <em>suit </em>in which the Verdict is rendered should have an equal interest with him against whom it is to be used. These positions seem equally to apply to decrees in equity: and in the case in question, <em>Robert Carter </em>was not equally interested with the appellees, in relation to the possession, at least, of the land in controversy. It Was, perhaps, unimportant to him Whether the appellees were dispossessed of this land, or not. In the <em>one </em>case, his warranty would bind him to remunerate them its value <em>; </em>and, in the other, he would have to yield other lands of equal value to the plaintiffs in the suit for partition. He therefore had not <em>the </em>same inducements with the appellees to defend the possession of <em>this </em>land: and consequently the decree in the suit for petition-was rightly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">I am of opinion that the judgment ought to be affirmed\u00bb</p>\n<author id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AbHG\">The only question that seems material for this Court to decide at present, is, whether the District Court erred in not permitting the record of the suit in Chancer}', brought by the appellant, and others, against <em>Robert </em>Carter, for a division of the <em>trust </em>estate, to go in evidence to the Jury, on the trial of the ejectment ?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">There is no general principle of law that seems better 'settled than that no one shall be injured or affected by the event of any suit in which he was not a <em>party; </em>the reasons of which are laid down in all the books, and are too obvious to need repeating here.
