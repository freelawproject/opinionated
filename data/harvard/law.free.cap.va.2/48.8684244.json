I am not in the habit of impugning acts of assembly, but I hope I shall be pardoned when I say, that the law subsequent to that which divided the County of Greenbrier, and constituted the County of Monroe, ought to be considered as void, so far as it arrested the collection of the County-levy of Greenbrier, or of that part which was laid for the purpose of defraying the expense of building a Court-house, and commanded the repayment of so much thereof, as had been collected from the persons whose residence was made part of the County of <em>Monroe. </em>It will not, it <em>cannot </em>be denied, that the County Court had a right to levy a sum on the inhabitants of their County for the purpose of erecting a Courthouse;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> that the sheriff, on giving bond to secure the forthcoming of the money, had a right to collect it; that the Court had a right <em>to </em>appoint trustees to whom the money, when collected, should be paid; to make it their duty to engage undertakers to execute the work, after a prescribed form, and for a fixed price, (within the sum levied,) and when it should be finished, to pay them with the money so levied. Every step of this progress contains a <em>vested right; </em>a right in the County Court to lay the levy; a right in the sheriff to collect it; a right in the trustees to demand and receive it from him, when collected; and a right in the undertakers to be paid the sum agreed on when the work should be done. In this way, the sheriff became, for the amount of his collection, debtor to the trustees; his bond became forfeited, if he did not pay it, on demand, the extent of which forfeiture became recoverable by (motion, after due notice; and the undertakers (the work being accomplished) had a right to their remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>against the trustees. All these rights had accrued before the law for dividing the County of <em>Greenbrier </em>was enacted, The part of the act above specified, (so far as it interferes with these rights,) is equally a <em>judicial </em>act, as if it had been a decision between <em>debtor </em>and <em>creditor; </em>and therefore infringes the fifth section of our bill of rights, as well as the third section of the Constitution of <em>Virginia. </em>The same act is also contrary to the tenth section of the first article of the Constitution of the <em>United </em>States, which says, that \u201c no \u201c state shall pass any bill of attainder, <em>ex post facto </em>law, or \u201c law impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-5\">Randolph, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APs5\">The appellant was not \u00e1 creditor, but a <em>receiver; </em>and the probability is, there was no <em>creditor </em>entitled to make a motion on the sheriff\u2019s bond;</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">The law saves the right of the sheriff as to the money he had collected, by the provision which it contains. We admit that a law, in opposition to the <em>constitution, </em>is void: but Mr. <em>Wickham </em>has not shewn that <em>any person </em>gained a <em>right </em>under the order of Court; and the act of assembly only directs its own <em>public </em>officer to pay back what he had collected as such. This, therefore, is not like a law affecting <em>private </em>contracts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-7\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxX\">The sheriff rested his defence on the act of assembly alone. His doing so may have prevented the trustees from shewing that they had disbursed their own money to the undertaker of the building; had thereby become creditors on the fund in the sheriff\u2019s hands, <em>levied, </em>or <em>directed to be levied </em>for that purpose; and were therefore entitled (as such creditors) to recover it of him by motion.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\"> <em>Rev.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b68-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Judge Tucker,</author>\n<p id=\"APfq\">after stating the case, in doing which he quoted, by way of explanation, the above-mentioned acts of <em>January </em>14, 1799, and <em>January </em>11, 1800, made the following observations :\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Mr.- Wickham,, for the appellants, contends, that the last mentioned act of assembly is void, as against the principles of the constitution of the Commonwealth, and contrary to that article of the federal constitution, which makes void all acts impairing the obligation of private contracts. But, as the record does not contain a copy of either of the orders of the Court of <em>Greenbrier </em>referred to in the notice, I shall not inquire into the force of that objection, nor enter into the <em>merits </em>of a case which I am not furnished with sufficient <em>data </em>to understand; especially, as it has been decided that this Court cannot award a <em>certiorari </em>to a <em>County </em>Court, to bring up any part of a record which may have' been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">By the act directing the mode of laying and collecting the County-levy,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the Justices of the County Court ar. authorised at certain Courts annually, \u201c to proceed to make \u201c up, in their minutes, an account of all <em>expenses incurred </em>\u201c by the said Court under authority of any law, chargeable \u201c on the County and <em>remaining </em>unpaid, stating therein the \u201c sums due, for what, and to whom due, and all credits \u201c owing to the said County. When a balance due from \u201c the County is thus ascertained, the Justices shall proceed <em>\u201c </em>to levy and assess on the titheable persons in their County \u201c the <em>amount of that </em>balance, in equal proportions. The \u201c sums due to the County, and the sum to be assessed on \u201c the titheables, being added together, shall then be <em>appro- </em>\u201c <em>priated by the </em>Court, so as to shew the right of <em>each </em>\u201c <em>County </em>creditor, and the amount of his demand.\u201d After this, the clerk is to furnish the sheriff with proper lists of the persons indebted or chargeable for levies, and also of the persons to whom the same ought to be paid, with the amount of their demands j which he is to collect and pay .accordingly. And, if he fails to account with and satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the County creditors, the respective sums levied for them, within six months, any creditor who may be injured may obtain judgment against him or his securities upon ten days notice. And, where he fails to <em>account with the </em>County, the Court thereof may enter judgment against him, upon the like notice, for whatever shall appear to be due from him.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">It would seem, from this view of the law, that the creditor hath nothing to do with the manner in which the sheriff is to proceed to <em>levy' </em>the money which he is to pa.y such creditor; nor can I suppose that the Court would understand the word <em>appropriate </em>so as to designate the particular titheables whose levies should be paid to particular creditors; for this might produce great injustice, by <em>appropriating </em>the levies of a number of <em>insolvent </em>persons to the payment of /l.\u2019s debt, while the debt of <em>B. </em>might be fully paid without difficulty. 1 therefore understand the law as constituting an <em>aggregate fund </em>out of the monies due to the County and the levy to be laid; and out of this <em>aggregate fund, </em>each creditor is to be paid liis specific demand. But, in case the sheriff fails to collect any part of the sum due the County or laid in the levy, the <em>Court arc to proceed </em>to punish him for his delinquency: but the <em>creditor </em>has nothing to do with it; the law, after a certain time, making the sheriff liable to the <em>creditor </em>for the sum <em>appropriated to him, </em>whether the sheriff has collected it or not. Now the object of the present motion is to recover from the sheriff the amount of the levies <em>due from those persons formerly </em>inhabitants of <em>Greenbrier, </em>who by the division of the County have fallen into <em>Monroe </em>County. But the <em>creditor </em>has nothing at all to do with the collection. If the sheriff has omitted to collect the money in that part of his district, the <em>Court, </em>and not the <em>creditor, </em>is to proceed against him. Upon these grounds, I am of opinion, that the judgment of the District Court, reversing that of the County Court, and overruling the plaintiff's motion, was correct, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b70-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"Al-\">This summary remedy lies only in favour of the County creditors themselves. It does not lie in favour of those who, as trustees, have contracted, or may contract, on behalf of tire County, with any individual. Not only the words of the act in question, but the general spirit of our laws, in relation to summary proceedings, forbids that a motion shall be allowed in favour of the <em>trustees; </em>to recover the money from whom the <em>actual creditors </em>may after-wards be driven <em>to </em>another and a tedious remedy. I think too that it ought to be shewn that the plaintiff was a creditor <em>at the time </em>of the levy; for the act does not seem to warrant the County Court in levying money <em>in advance </em>upon the people. It requires that, <em>at the time </em>of laying the levy, the aggregate of the sums due to the County, and levied upon the titheables, shall \u201cbe appropriated by the Court \u201c so as to shew the <em>right of each County </em>creditor, and the \u201c amount of his demand.\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This construction is strengthened by the right given to the County creditors by the ninth section of the same act to move against the sheriff, at the expiration of <em>six months </em>after the levy shall have been laid, for the amount of the respective sums levied <em>for </em>them. This construction of the act (as to this point) would seem also to exclude the <em>trustees </em>in the case in question; for the levy was made <em>in </em>October, 1798, and the order by which they were <em>directed to appropriate </em>the money in question was not made until November, 1799, more than twelve months after. I also concur in the construction that a particular creditor has not a right to select a particular part of the County to satisfy his demand.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag1l\">It was argued that the defence set up at the trial, in relation to the operation of the act <em>of. January </em>11, 1800, was the reason why the plaintiffs did not go on to complete their case by shewing that they were (or acted in behalf of) County creditors, within the meaning of the act. But this apology is not sufficient: and this Court will never give judgment in a summary way in favour of any plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>who do not bring themselves fully within the terms of the act under which they proceed. On this ground, then, (without touching or considering the constitutional question made in the argument,) X am of opinion, that the judgment of the District Court, reversing that of the County Court, is correct.</p>\n<judges id=\"b71-4\">Judge Fleming concurring, the judgment of the District Court was unanimously affirmed.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\"> Rev. <em>Code, </em>1 vol. p. 251. c. 134. sect. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\"><em> Ibid. </em>sects 8 and 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\"><em> Code, </em>1 vol. p. 251.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
