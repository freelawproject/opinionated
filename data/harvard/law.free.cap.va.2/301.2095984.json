Plea, setting forth sundry judgments obtained against the defendant, and \u201c that he hath fully administered all the goods of the testator which had come to his hands to be administered, and that he hath not, nor had, See. any goods, &amp;c. except the value of 133/. 3\u00ed. <em>3d. </em>which are not sufficient to satisfy the said judgments, Sec.

This verdict finds only that the truth of the issue is with the plaintiff, but'it does not ascertain the value of the assets unadministered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-3\">I shall not controvert the doctrine stated by Mr.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-4\"><em>Wickham, </em>with this qualification, that if the find assets sufficient to satisfy the debt, they need not find the precise amount of the assets. The reason of the rule is obvious, and will warrant this limitation of it. Now, in this case, the plaintiff having replied assets <em>sufficient </em>to satisfy the judgments mentioned in the plea, as well as the debt in question, and the jury having found the whole issue for the plaintiff, they have in fact found, that the defendant had assets sufficient in his hands. It was therefore unnecessary to ascertain the exact amount of the assets. The verdict is substantially right, and the Court will mould it into form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-6\"><em>Wickham. </em>\u2014 I do not think that the Court can, with the most liberal disposition to support this verdict, consider it a special finding, responsive to the issue; for if the defendant had but one penny more than sufficient to satisfy the judgments, it falsified the plea; and therefore it was incumbent upon the jury to find the issue in favour of the plaintiff. But it is agreed, that the plaintiff ought not to have a judgment for the whole debt, unless - the Court can be satisfied that there are assets sufficient to pay it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b393-7\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"ANF\">was of opinion, that the verdict ought to be set aside \u201c as being uncertain and insufficient in not finding on the issue, that the appellant had goods and chattels, which were of the decedent at the time of his death, in his hands to be administered, more than sufficient to satisfy the judgments in the appellant\u2019s plea set forth, whereof he could have satisfied the appellee\u2019s demand, or the value of the said goods and chattels, if not sufficient to satisfy the said demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Judgment reversed, verdict set aside, and the cause remanded.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\">(1) <em>Rogers' Adm. </em>v. <em>Chandler's Adm. </em>3 Munf. 66. <em>Eppes' </em>Adm. v. <em>Smith, Adm, </em>4 Munf. 466.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
