In 1820 a bill was filed by the vendor and his wife (who claimed to have inherited the land from her father) against the vendees and their assignee, asking specific execution of the contract. The bill also made defendant a nonresident, who, it was alleged, had formerly owned the land, and conveyed it to the father by a deed which was accidentally destroyed before it was placed on record. The assignee in his answer said, he had heard a report that the father mortgaged the land to secure a debt which was yet unpaid. He professed his readiness to pay the balance due from him to the vendees, upon receiving a title to the land, and a release of the mortgage, if there was one. The nonresident defendant, though proceeded against by publication, put in no answer. It was proved by a witness, that in 1794 the nonresident defendant conveyed the land to the father of the female complainant; that the deed was acknowledged before three witnesses, and delivered to one of them to have it recorded; and that it was accidentally burnt while in his possession. In 1830 a decree was made for specific execution. During all this time the vendees and their assignee, and the heirs of the latter, continued to hold possession of the land; none of them asked a rescission of the contract; and it did not appear that there was any such mortgage as was mentioned in the answer. Upon an appeal by the heirs of the assignee, Heud, 1. That as the conveyance to the father, though never recorded, and afterwards destroyed, was effectual against the grantor trr vest the legal title in the father, and the great lapse of time since that conveyance, in connexion with the uninterrupted possession of the father and those claiming under him, furnished a sufficient presumption against any claim on the part of the. grantor\u2019s creditors, the decree for specific execution was, under the circumstances, proper. 2. That as there was no record of the said conveyance, a commissioner should be directed to execute another deed from the grantor to the appellants. 3. That as the ancestor of the appellants was not bound to take the title until the existence and validity of the said conveyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>had been judicially ascertained, and as the burthen of establishing these facts devolved on the vendors, they should be decreed to pay the costs. <em>* J</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AAx4\">, \u201e . .

The commissioner reported the evidence of <em>James Dejarnetl, </em>that he was in possession of the land by purchase as early as 1770, and then held the original patent for the same; and the evidence of <em>James Montgomery, </em>that after <em>Dejarnelt </em>sold the land, he <em>(Montgomery) </em>saw the original patent in the hands of <em>Welch, </em>who then owned the land. The deposition of <em>Thomas Self </em>was also taken the 15th of May 1822.

And the court further decreed, that in case default should be made in such payment upon the execution and delivery of the said deed as aforesaid, the defendants, or such of them as might have the possession of the land, should deliver the possession thereof to the marshal of the court, and that the marshal, after having advertised the time and place of sale for four weeks in some newspaper printed in the town of <em>Lynchburg, </em>at the front door of the courthouses of <em>Halifax </em>and <em>Pittsylvania </em>counties on some court day, and at some public place near the premises at least ten days before the sale, should proceed upon the premises to sell by way of public auction, to the highest bidder for ready money, the land aforesaid, or so much thereof as should be sufficient to pay off and discharge the said principal money, interest and costs, and the expenses attending the said sale, and should pay the proceeds thereof, after defraying the expenses attending the same, into one of the banks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>at <em>Lynchburg </em>to the credit of the suit, subject to the future order of the court, and report his proceedings to the court.

Here there is reason to apprehend disturbance by <em>Roberts </em>or his heirs. <em>Self </em>has not proved any delivery of the deed by <em>Roberts, </em>or by his authority; and if he had, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>it is at least questionable whether a single witness would be sufficient to establish the fact, seeing that the deed could only be admitted to record upon proof by three witnesses. It must be considered a case of a clouclecI title, under which, if a sale be made, the land will be sacrificed; which a court of equity does not permit. <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Hancock &amp; others, </em>1 Rand. 72. Mere possibilities, it is true, constitute no objection to a specific execution; as where, from the length of time, it is impossible to discover in whom the legal title is. But when a considerable, a rational doubt exists, notwithstanding the court inclines to the opinion that a good title can be made, specific execution will not be decreed. <em>Stapylton </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>16 Ves. 272. The court never decrees such execution where the title is involved in difficulties. 1 Fonbl. Eq. 190. <em>Marlow </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 P. Wms. 198. <em>White </em>v. <em>Foljambe, </em>11 Ves. 337.

Here a conveyance should have been directed of the title of <em>Roberts, </em>or at least the plaintiffs should have been required to execute an indemnifying bond against any title outstanding in him or derived through him, and against the other defects alleged by the vendee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The decree is also erroneous in allowing interest on the purchase money from a date anterior to the execution of the conveyance by <em>Greenwood </em>and wife, and in allowing them their costs. It is moreover harsh in directing the land to be sold for ready money, upon four weeks notice. A reasonable time should have been allowed for paying the money, and the sale should have been upon a reasonable credit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-11\"><em>Patton </em>and <em>C. Johnson </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AefD\">No objection is made in the pleadings to going on and completing the contract, if a good title can be made. Now <em>Roberts </em>had a title which would have enabled him to sustain his right to this land against all the world, before his conveyance to <em>Cody. </em>And after that conveyance, the execution of which is clearly proved, the title of <em>Roberts </em>was fully vested in <em>Cody. </em>Had <em>Cody </em>brought a writ of right to recover the land against <em>Roberts, </em>and adduced in that case the same evidence that is exhibited here, it would have been abundantly sufficient to entitle him to recover. After such a lapse of time without any creditor of <em>Roberts </em>or subsequent purchaser from him being heard of, it must be presumed that the title is unexceptionable. This principle of presumption equally applies to the objection that the wives of two of the parlies who successively conveyed the land did not join in the conveyances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-12\">The sufficiency of the title is to be ascertained at the time of the decree, not at the time of suit brought. <em>Hepburn </em>v. <em>Auld, </em>5 Cranch 262.

The cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>of <em>Fleetwood </em>v. <em>Green, </em>15 Ves. 594. <em>Margravine of Anspach </em>v. <em>Noel, </em>1 Madd. C. R. 310. american edi. 172. <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Bradshaw and others, </em>2 Meriv. 492. and <em>Burnell </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Jac. &amp; Walk. 173. shew that where the Party resisting specific execution is in possession of the land, there will be a stronger disposition on the part of the court to compel specific execution (notwithstanding small objections to the title), and to leave the party to his remedy on the general warranty in his deed. <em>Buckle </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>18 Ves. 111. shews that remote and merely contingent objections to the title will not avail. Here the husband and wife have executed and tendered a deed conveying the land. And therefore the question suggested in <em>Howel </em>v. <em>George, </em>1 Madd. C. R. 1. whether specific performance of the husband\u2019s contract for the sale of the wife\u2019s land can be decreed, so as to require him to procure her to join in the conveyance, need not be considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-5\">As the vendee was in possession of the land, he was properly required to pay interest on the purchase money. The contract expressly provided a particular day for the last <em>payment; </em>and where that is the nature of the contract, and the parly has also had possession of the land, interest will go upon the purchase money from that day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-6\">There is nothing in the record from which it can be inferred that the discretion of the chancery court was improperly exercised in decreeing a sale for cash upon four weeks notice. Under the circumstances of this case, and after the delay of payment which had already occurred through the vendee\u2019s default, it would have been improper to allow further delay, especially when the sum to be raised was so inconsiderable. Moreover the case of <em>Manns </em>v. <em>Flinn\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>10 Leigh 93. shews that this is no ground for reversing the decree.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Allent, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AGS\">delivered the following as the opinion of tbe court:</p>\n<p id=\"AMU\">The court is of opinion, that it appears from the evidence that <em>Daniel Roberts </em>did convey the land in the bill and proceedings mentioned to <em>Redmon Cody, </em>the ancestor of the female appellee: that such conveyance, though never recorded, and afterwards lost or destroyed, was effectual as against the grantor to vest the legal title in said <em>Cody: </em>and that the great lapse of time since said conveyance, in connexion with the continued and uninterrupted possession of the land by <em>Cody </em>and those claiming under him, furnishes a sufficient presumption against any claim on the part of the creditors of said <em>Daniel Roberts. </em>The court is therefore of opinion, that as the appellants have continued to hold possession of the property, and have' not asked for a rescission of the contract, it was proper, under the circumstances of the case, to decree a specific performance of the contract; and that in this there was no error in the decree. But the court is further of opinion, that the ancestor of the appellants was not bound to take the title of the appellees until the existence and validity of the said conveyance from <em>Daniel Roberts </em>had been judicially ascertained ; that the burthen of establishing those facts devolved upon the appellees; and therefore that they should have been decreed to pay the costs. The court is further of opinion, that as there is no record of the conveyance from <em>Daniel Roberts, </em>a commissioner should have been directed to execute a deed from him to the appellants. The court is further of opinion, that under the authority of <em>Tibbs &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Matthews &amp;c. </em>decided in this court on the sixth day of May 1829,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it was wrong to decree personally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>against the appellants, who, as heirs of the vendee, were not liable to a personal decree. The decree should have been, that unless they paid the said debt and interest within a period to be prescribed, the land sh\u00b0uld be sold. And the court is further of opinion, that in a suit to subject lands in the hands of heirs to sale, for the equitable lien of the vendor for unpaid purchase money due from their ancestor, or for the debt of the ancestor, it is, in general, an improper exercise of discretion to decree an immediate sale without allowing any time for redemption, and to decree a sale for cash : and that if circumstances exist which render it expedient to sell forthwith and for cash, such circumstances should be disclosed by the record. In the case under consideration, nothing appears to call for or justify a departure from the general rule; and the court 'is therefore of opinion, that there was error in directing the marshal to lake possession of the land, and to sell forthwith and for ready money. It is therefore decreed, that so much of the said decree as conflicts with this opinion be reversed, and that the appellants recover against the appellees their costs here expended; that the said decree be affirmed for the residue; and that the cause be remanded, with instructions to be finally proceeded in according to the principles above declared.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> In <em>Tibbs </em>&amp;c. v. <em>Matthews &amp;c. </em>the court of appeals adjudged-the decree to be erroneous in this, that it was \u201cpersonal against the heirs, and not conditional (as it ought to have been) that un^ less they pay the money, the lands be sold\u201d &amp;e.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
