Whereupon the demandant, to establish a seisin in deed by a <em>pedis positio, </em>proves that the patentee under whom he claims came, in 1824 or 1825, to the county in which the land lies, and employed an agent to enter upon and survey the said land and various other tracts in the same county; that the said agent procured a surveyor and chain carriers immediately thereafter, who went upon the land in question, and surveyed and remarked the same for the patentee.

H. Smith </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsI\">There is no seisin found in the demandant, or any one else under whom he claims, unless the employment of an agent to survey the land may be construed into a seisin. It is, however, obvious that seisin cannot be inferred from such an act as surveying the land. Seisin and possession are identical ; see opinion of <em>Carr, </em>J. in <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp;c. of Petersburg, </em>3 Rand. 570. According to this authority, constructive seisin does not follow or attach to a junior grant. The constructive seisin of the land in controversy could only be in those claiming under the grant of the first of December 1773. The demandant, then, has to insist that he has actual seisin. And the subsequent survey cannot possibly by itself give actual seisin. The survey as found does not amount even to an entry. The <em>intent </em>to take possession did not exist. The <em>intent </em>was to ascertain the identity of the land. To constitute actual possession, the taking of <em>esplees </em>is necessary. There must be some improvement of the land, and an application of it to some use^of which it is susceptible, such as taking coal from a mine, or cutting timber from the land and using or disposing of it. And in every instance there must be the intent to take possession. The act and the intent necessary to constitute actual possession are both wanting in this case. In <em>Moss and others </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>2 Dana 274, 5. it is expressly decided that a survey is not seisin. On this subject the court is referred to <em>1 </em>Salk. 246. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Burtis, </em>9 Johns. 180. <em>Ellicott </em>v. <em>Pearl, </em>10 Peters 442. <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Burnet, </em>11 Peters 53. If, from the facts which appear, the jury had been authorized to infer seisin, still it would be a valid objection to their verdict that the fact has not been found. But the facts did not authorize the jury to find either actual or constructive seisin. And without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>one or the other, no writ of right can be maintained. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Cole &amp;c. 2 </em>Leigh 664.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-4\"><em>Cooke </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACe\">A writ of right only brings into controversy the mere rights of the parties to the suit, and a better subsisting adverse title in a third person is no defence to it. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Liter and others, </em>8 Cranch 233. The tenant <em>Dawson, </em>under this decision, could not avail himself of the outstanding and superior title of <em>Mercer, Wagoner </em>and <em>West. </em>But in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Watkins, 7 </em>Wheat. 27. it is said, that where the demandant relies for proof of seisin solely upon a constructive seisin in virtue of a patent from the state of vacant lands, the tenant may shew that the land has been previously granted by the state; for that disproves the demandant\u2019s constructive seisin. This doctrine however will not avail the tenant, because in this case the demandant did not rely solely on his constructive seisin. On the contrary he proved an actual seisin <em>per pedis positioned, </em>of the most solemn and notorious sort. <em>Taylor </em>had held title to the land in question, and many other tracts in <em>Kanawha, </em>from 1786 for nearly 40 years, without actual seisin or <em>pedis posilio. </em>He went to <em>Kanawha </em>in 1824 or early in 1825, to fortify his title by actual entries. In order to shew the full effect and legal extent of each entry, he surveyed each tract and re-marked its boundaries. He \u201cemployed an agent to enter upon and survey this tract.\u201d The agent procured a surveyor and chain carriers, who \u201c went upon the said tract of land, and surveyed and re-marked the same for the said <em>Thomas A. </em>Taylor.\u201d He found on the land a squatter, the tenant <em>Dawson, </em>who claimed no title to the land, and he did not turn him out. Why should he have turned <em>Dawson </em>out ? It could have answered no purpose. He could not have taken possession of the land in a more formal and solemn way than he did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>unless he had served express notice on all the neighbourhood, and uttered in their presence some form of words indicating his intention.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-3\"><em>Smith </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACkg\">The argument of the counsel on the other side leads to_ the conclusion that every junior grantee necessarily has seisin : for every junior grant is preceded by a survey. But it is impossible to construe an entry by an agent, with intent to identify the land by survey, into an actual possession, especially where there is an actual adverse possession. If <em>Dawson </em>was a mere tenant at sufferance, he was not the tenant of <em>Taylor </em>or of those holding under him, but the tenant of those who had the superior title, and his possession was therefore adverse to all the world but the true owner. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>9 Johns. 167. Moreover the case of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>7 Wheat. 30. shews (as does also the case of <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Cole &amp;c.) </em>that where seisin is to be made out by a <em>pedis positio, </em>a taking of the <em>esplees </em>or something equivalent thereto is essential.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b298-4\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A0O\">From the special verdict it appears that the land in controversy was embraced in two patents, and the demandant claimed under the junior grant. The tenant in possession is not found to claim under the elder grant, nor is any privity shewn to exist between him and those claiming under the first patent. Facts are found tending to shew a continued possession of the land by him: but in the view I have taken of the case, I deem it unnecessary to express any opinion upon the character of his possession, and shall consider the question as if he were a mere occupant without claim or colour of title. Every possession of land has the presumption of right in its favour, and until such presumption is destroyed by proof, the possession is adverse : and the actual occupation and enjoyment of land in the accustomed mode, without any recognition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>by the occupant of title in another, or disavowal of right in himself, would, in the absence of all proof to the contrary, raise the presumption that he held as owner. Where, however, no claim of right has been made, the law adjudges the possession to be in subservience to the legal owner <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>16 Johns. R. 293.); for he cannot claim the benefit of a legal presumption, who has shewn by his acts that no such presumption exists. But without dwelling on this branch of the case, involving, as it does, questions of deep interest to many individuals, it is sufficient here to say that the demandant by this proceeding admits the tenant, for the purposes of this action, to be tenant of the freehold. This seisin thus conceded is sufficient for the tenant, if he can establish that the demandant, or those under whom he claims, had no such seisin as is required to maintain a writ of right.</p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">The special verdict does not, in terms, find a seisin in the demandant or those under whom he claims. This perhaps would of itself be a sufficient objection to a judgment in favour of the demandant on this verdict. In <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>11 Wheaton 415. it appeared that the claim of the plaintiffs was founded on a bequest of slaves, and it was essential to a recovery at law that the assent of the executors should be proved. Chief justice <em>Marshall </em>said, that although, in the opinion of the court, there was sufficient evidence in the special verdict from which the jury might have found the fact, yet they had not found it, and the court, on a special verdict, could not intend it. In <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Cole &amp;c. 2 </em>Leigh 662. it is said that seisin cannot be presumed by the court, even if the jury had found facts from which they might have properly presumed it. But passing this objection, which, if nothing more appeared, might require a <em>venire facias de novo, </em>have the jury found any evidence of the fact, which would have justified the finding of seisin in the demandant ? If not,\u2014if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>facts found disprove such seisin, it would be useless to send the parties back for another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AKM\">The commonwealth, according to the uniform course of decision, cannot be disseised of the public domain. Her estate is divested by her grant, and vested in the patentee. Such grant confers title on the grantee, and therefore must confer seisin, one of the essential requisites of a complete title. Accordingly it has been uniformly held that a patent confers constructive seisin in deed, sufficient to enable the patentee to maintain his writ of right. <em>Clay </em>v. <em>White &amp;c. </em>1 Munf. 162. <em>Green v. Liter &amp;c. </em>8 Cranch 229. <em>Green </em>v. Watkins, 7 Wheaton 27. But seisin of some kind must be shewn, either the constructive seisin in deed by the operation of the grant, or seisin in deed by the possession of the land and the perception of the profits. When seisin of either kind is shewn in the demandant, according to the decision of the supreme court in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Liter &amp;c. </em>it is not competent for the tenant to defeat the action by evidence of a superior outstanding title in a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The special verdict in this case finds that the land was embraced in the elder patent to <em>Mercer </em>and others. That grant conferred upon the grantees the \u2018seisin of the commonwealth, and disproved the constructive seisin in deed in the demandant and those under whom he claimed. To sustain his action on his junior grant, he must prove that he had seisin in deed by the actual possession and perception of the profits. The land at the date of his grant was in the adverse seisin of those claiming under the senior patent; and as two claiming under different grants, and adverse to each other, cannot be seized of the same land at the same time, the junior patentee can only establish an actual seisin in himself by proving an ouster of those holding under the prior grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The only fact found tending to prove such ouster of the senior patentee and seisin by the demandant, is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>that in the year 1824 or 1825 the patentee visited the county of Kanawha, where the lands are situated, and employed an agent to enter upon and survey the tract of land in question, and various other tracts claimed by him in that county; and that the said agent immediately thereafter employed a surveyor and chain carriers, who went upon the said tract, and surveyed and re-marked the same for the patentee. ,Wbat acts of ownership will be sufficient to constitute an ouster of the senior patentee, and invest the junior patentee with actual seisin in deed, must in a great measure depend on the circumstances of each case. Where seisin of the latter kind is relied on, the rule is generally laid down that it must be evidenced by an actual occupation and taking of the <em>esflees. </em>Cases may be put (as of a barren rock) where there are no esplees: still there must be some application of the land to some purpose of which it is susceptible. It is not necessary that the land should be enclosed or built upon, or actually cultivated or cleared ; but to operate a disseisin of one having right, the entry should be made under the claim of title, with the intention of taking possession, and be accompanied with such visible acts of ownership as from their nature indicate a notorious claim of property in the land. The character of the acts necessary to give such seisin must necessarily vary with the situation of the land and the condition of the country. In a settled and cultivated region, an actual occupation and pernancy of the profits might be required ; whilst in the wilderness, a possession of a less definite character might suffice, if the jury should be satisfied that the property was not susceptible of a more strict occupation. However difficult it may be to lay down any precise rule adapted to every case, I am satisfied that the facts found in this verdict would not have warranted the jury in finding an ouster of the rightful owner and a seisin in the demandant. It has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>never been held that a subsequent entry and survey (acts which must precede a patent) of themselves worked a disseisin of the elder patentee. Here it does not appear with what intention the entry was made. The inference from the whole finding is, that the entry was made, not with the intent to take possession,\u2014to give notice to adverse claimants and the community of an actual, visible and exclusive possession of the land, but with the intent to ascertain the boundaries of land claimed by the party, and to preserve the evidence with a view to some future occupation or act of ownership. To give to such a transaction the effect of an actual ouster of the true owner, would be establishing a principle by which every proprietor of vacant lands might be disseised without his knowledge or the possibility of protecting himself. There is great reason for requiring strict and satisfactory proof of such a possession as is notorious and exclusive, when seisin so acquired is alone relied on to counteract the effect of evidence adduced by the tenant, of an outstanding better title in a third person. For, if the possession of the tenant is without claim or colour of title, his possession is in subservience to the legal owner; he is in fact a tenant at sufferance of the holder of the better title, and such a possession could not be divested but by an actual <em>pedis positio </em>and taking of the profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">I think the judgment should be reversed, and a judgment entered for the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The other judges concurring, judgment reversed with costs, and judgment entered for the tenant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
