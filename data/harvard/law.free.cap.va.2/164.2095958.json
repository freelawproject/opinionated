In that case the bill was not thrown into circulation, and is therefore in principle precisely like the present. The maker of a note may fill it up himself, or delegate the power of doing so to another. By delivering, or remitting it in blank, he shews his intention to confide so far in the person to whom it is given, as to authorise him to fill it up. How this doctrine would apply in the case of a bond I cannot say. Perhaps from the solemnity attending the making of a deed, it might be different, since it has no validity without a delivery.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ALt\">The Court being divided in opinion the judgment was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
