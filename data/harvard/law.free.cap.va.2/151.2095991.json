The appellants, who were the plaintiffs below, are the children of <em>Samuel </em>Brown, to whom <em>Wentworth </em>ivas administrator. He settled his accounts of that estate under an order of the County Court, admitting himself to be a debtor to the amount of 386/. 10a <em>Id, </em>After his death, his wife was appointed his administratrix, and at the same time, <em>Thomas Brown </em>was appointed guardian to the appellants. After the death of Mrs. <em>Went-worth, John Day </em>qualified as administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>See. of <em>Wentworth, </em>whose estate was by a decree of the County Court, in an amicable suit commenced for that purpose, divided amongst his children, one of whom was the w ife of <em>Thomas </em>Brown. On Went-<em>worth\u2019s </em>books is an entry made by <em>Day, </em>in the lifetime of Mrs. Wentworth, the administratrix, charging <em>Thomas Brown </em>with 386/. 9a lei., paid him as guardian of the plaintiffs on account of <em>Wentworths </em>estate. <em>Day </em>is dead, and his hand writing proved. <em>Thomas Brown </em>on his day book <em>debits </em>himself with 155/. 9a <em>Id., </em>received by him on account of his wards. But though all other entries from this- day book are posted on his ledger, the sum of 155/. 9a <em>Id., </em>is not carried to account there. It appears that an order was made by the County Court, directing a summons to issue to the said <em>Thomas </em>Brown, to settle his guardianship accounts, but nothing farther was ever done in the business. The defendant\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s report, which allowed this sum of 386/, 10a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>lcf., to the <em>debit </em>of <em>Thomas Broivn\u2019s </em>estate, with in* thereon from 1768, when the credit was entered by <em>Day, </em>being sustained by the High Court of Chancen; an appeal was prayed from the decree founded thereon to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aqd\"><em>RonM^ fa </em>the appeUant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-6\"><em>Day, </em>if living, would have been a good witness at the time he made the entry, and his evidence is not destroyed by his afterwards becoming the administrator. But if I am wrong in this, the law is well settled, that if a witness were once competent, and after-wards becomes interested, his hand waiting may be proved. In this case, the hand writing of <em>Day </em>being established, his entry ought to have been considered as evidence. Besides, if Brown, when summoned to settle his accounts, had done so, there would have been no necessity for resorting to this evidence, and consequently slighter proof should be received to charge him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-7\"><em>Marshall. </em>\u2014 The rule is, that the best evidence which the nature <em>of the case will </em>admit, shall be required, and not as Mr. <em>Ronold </em>supposes, the best evidence which it is <em>in the power of the party to produce. </em>This case from its nature admits of conclusive testimony. <em>Wentworth, </em>it is admitted, once had this money in his hands : \u2014 it is contended that he is discharged of it, and that <em>Brown </em>is chargeable because he was appointed the guardian, and in <em>Wentworths </em>books an entry was made by <em>Day, </em>of the money being paid over to <em>Brown. </em>Now this is a case where <em>Wentworth </em>might, and as a prudent man ought to have taken a receipt, and therefore the entry is not the best evidence which the nature of the case wmuld have admitted. <em>Went-worth </em>himself could not have been examined as a witness to discharge himself, and to charge another. Can his entry then be admitted ; or is the case stronger, because the entry is made by <em>Day? </em>The evidence of his hand writing proves only that he made the entry, but it does not establish the fact to which the entry relates. As to <em>Brown\u2019s </em>misconduct in not settling his guardianship acounts, he might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>punished for not,doing so ; but it does not authorise the establishment of a principle as to him, which is repugnant to the rules of evidence when applied to* ge\u00bb neral Cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-7\">Monoid, in reply .- \u2014 I do not contend that the entry &lt;bf the party himself would be evidence; but it is dent If made by a third person, and his hand writing proved. It is like the case of a book keeper, whose hand writing may be proved after his death, to estaWish entries, w ith which perhaps he was himself totally unacquainted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b205-8\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">delivered the following opinion and decree: <em>viz. </em>\u201c The Court is of opinion, that the exhibits stated in the record are not only corroborative of the entry made in Wentworth\u2019s books by <em>John Day, </em>the clerk, or agent of <em>Mary Wentworth </em>the administratrix ; but are abundantly sufficient independent of that entry, to charge <em>Thomas Brawn </em>with the whole 386/. 10i. <em>Id. </em>The demand against <em>Wentworth\u2019s </em>estate was ascertained by his administration account duly settled and recorded, so as not to admit of doubt or litigation s <em>Thomas Brown </em>the -same day, on which administration of that estate was obtained, is appointed guardian to <em>Samuel Brawn\u2019s </em>children, with a view, it would seem, to the;.receiving of this money before that estate was divided. There appears to have been so little doubt of the personal estate (of which there is no account) being sufficient to pay this, and all other demands, that <em>Brawn </em>himself, who married a daughter of Wentworth, with the husbands of the others. Immediately commenced an amicable suit in Chancery, to have a division of the lands and slaves; an order for such division is accordingly made and carried into execution, comprehending seventeen slaves, which at their stated value, amounted to much more than this demand of <em>Samuel Brown\u2019s </em>orphans, and were liable thereto, if the personal estate were not sufficient Hence it appears that this money either was received by <em>Thomas Brown </em>the guardian, or he was guilty of gross neglect of duty, either of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>would be a proper ground for charging him therewith. That he did receive it, is highly presumable fr om the circumstances before stated, and from that of his having entered in his memorandum book, the receipt of so considerable a part as 155/. 9s. <em>6d. </em>without having returned an account thereof to Court as his duty required, or even carrying it to account in his own books, either to the credit of a general account with <em>Samuel Brown's </em>estate, or to the credit of each individual child, although such accounts appear to be open on his books, and although it is stated that he had posted from the memorandum book all other entries made at the same time. That therefore his estate ought to be charged with the whole 386/. 10i. <em>Id. </em>as received in <em>May </em>1768, accountable to each child for one-third thereof, with interest. But since the accounts of disbursements for their maintainance appear to be inadequate to that purpose, and probably defective, and the interest of the money a very mode,rate allowance, the Court is of opinion, that the interest with each child shall commence from the time when he or she attained the age of twenty one years, or married, till which period the interest shall be set against the maintainance, and all the accounts of his disbursements for the latter discarded, unless the plain-tilts can make it appear before the commissioner, that they derived part of their maintainance from some other source than from their said guardian, in which case the charge of interest is to be made against him, and he to be allowed his accounts for maintainance. The decree is reversed with costs, and the cause to be remanded to have the accounts reformed, and a final decree made according to the principles of this decree.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
