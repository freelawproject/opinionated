The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b415-15\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AlK\">The errors assigned in the petition for a <em>supersedeas </em>in this case, are, that the name of <em>James </em>Ferguson one of the parties whose name is subscribed to the bond, is not mentioned in the obligatory part of a forthcoming bond given by Bartley, against whom an execution at the suit of <em>Tates </em>had issued; and that no <em>person </em>is named, to whom the property is to be delivered, the name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>of the high sheriff being left blank, in that part of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The first of these Omissions, I think, is amply compensated by the recital in the condition, that <em>Bartley </em>had tendered the above <em>bound James Ferguson </em>as his security, and by the delivery of the bond by <em>Ferguson, as his act and </em>deed, a circumstance not denied. The second, if not supplied by the name of the high sheriff mentioned in the former part of the condition, is fully supplied, I conceive, by the directions of the law, that such delivery is to be made to the sheriff, at the time and place appointed for the sale of the property, both which particulars are mentioned m the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Where a party,' against whom an execution issues, obtains an indulgence, upon certain conditions, the Court will not regard trifling errors which are often the effect of haste or inexperience in young deputy-sheriffs, with an eagle\u2019s eye, where the substantial justice of the case, or the positive and invariable rules of law, do not require them to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-9\">Judge Roane was m favour of affirming the judgments</judges>\n<author id=\"b416-10\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A4u\">The counsel for the plaintiffs in the<em>supersedeas </em>made two points in this case: 1st. Whether <em>Ferguson, </em>whose name is omitted in the penal part of the bond, but who is stated in the condition as the security, and who has signed and sealed it, be bound in law? If not-bound, 2dly. Whether the judgment, which is against <em>Bartley </em>and <em>Fergusoii </em>jointly, shall be reversed in <em>toto, </em>off in part only ?</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">With respect to the first point, it is laid down in the case of <em>Mathew </em>v. <em>Purchins,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that, if the meaning of the parties can be collected from the bond, it will be good. Again, the name of the obligor subscribed is sufficient, though there be a blank for his Christian name in the. bond.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> So I conceive it to be in the present case, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>there is a total blank for the security\u2019s name in the penalty of the bond; he being stated in the <em>condition </em>a security for the delivery of the property, tq which he put his'signature and seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">It is laid down in <em>Goddard's </em>case,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> that only three things are necessary to making a good obligation, to wit, writing on paper or parchment, sealing and delivery; and it hath since been adjudged not to be necessary that the obligor should sign or subscribe his name 5 and therefore, if the obligor be named <em>Erlin, </em>and he sign his name <em>Erlevin, </em>this variation is not material, because subscribing is no essential part of the deed, sealing being sufficient.(\u00bf) This point then being against the present plaintiff, it seems immaterial to consider the others; and the judgment of the District Court must be affirmed <em>in tota.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the judg-. ment <em>of </em>the General Court affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b416-12\">c) <em>Cro.
