That the bond, instead of being given to the <em>treasurer, </em>as expressly required by the act of 1781, under which it was taken,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> had been given to the Commonwealth. The bond not being in the record, as it ought to be in all actions of debt, reference must be had to the declaration, where the error sufficiently appears.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>If it be said that, although a <em>motion </em>could not be sustained on the bond, yet it would be good in an action at common law, on the authority of the case of <em>Johnstons </em>v. <em>Meriwether ;</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it may be answered that no decision has gone so far as to say, that where a bond ought to be given to an individual, it can be given to an <em>ideal </em>character, such as the Commonwealth, and an action be sustained upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-4\">2. That the Court of <em>Orange </em>County had no right to take a bond from the obligors as sureties of <em>Rowland Thomas late sheriff; </em>he being then out of office, as admitted by the declaration; and there being no law at <em>that </em>time, which authorised the appointment of a <em>collector; </em>or <em>at any other time, </em>except where the sheriff had failed to give bond and security for the due collection of the taxes; which was not shewn to have been the case here. The question then is, whether the sureties of a sheriff are bound by a bond not authorised by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-5\">3. That the breach assigned was too general. There was a variety of taxes, due for the year 1784, some of which were comprehended in the assignment of breaches, others not. Breaches must be so specially assigned as to enable the party to defend himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-6\">4. It is not stated in the record that the <em>sheriff </em>was bound at all, although the power of taking a bond for the collection of the revenue, can be exercised by the County Court in no other manner; than in conjunction with the sheriff himself. Is a bond good which is given by the <em>sureties, </em>unless the sheriff himself be bound ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-7\"><em>5. </em>The bond requires the taxes to be accounted for <em>according to law; </em>the breach assigned, as affording a cause of action, is, that <em>Rowland Thomas </em>did not pay them on <em>demand; </em>whereas there is a specified time for paying the taxes, and the demand might have been prior to that time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-8\">The <em>Attorney General </em>for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_Y\">The objections of Mr. <em>Randolph </em>are merely technical. If if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>could be demonstrated that this bond was not taken in conformity with the statute, still it would be a good bond at common law. It is the same case in principle with <em>Johnstons </em>v. <em>Meriwether,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Washington </em>v. <em>Smith,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Downman.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-9\">But the provisions of the law are <em>substantially </em>complied with; for, although, the bond is given to the Commonwealth, yet it is conditioned for the payment of the revenue to the <em>Treasurer.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-10\">As to the second objection, it has arisen from the misapprehension of a word, which was, perhaps, inaccurately-used. The term <em>late sheriff </em>was inserted in the declaration merely as descriptive of the person ; and has reference to the time when the declaration was filed. It is an usual expression. Thus we say <em>late </em>merchants and partners,. Numerous instances may be adduced, in which the form of pleading is, as here stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-11\">The third exception, that the breaches are too <em>generally </em>assigned, has already been settled by decisions of this Court-in the cases of <em>Branch and others </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>Gov. &amp;c.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> To these may be added the following <em>British </em>authorities: <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Field and others, executors of Crouch,</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> Salman </em>v. <em>Bradshaw,</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> Procter </em>v. <em>Burnet,</em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> Hughes </em>v. Richman,<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> Ld. <em>Arlington </em>v. <em>Merricke,</em><footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Cryps </em>v. <em>Baynton ;</em><footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in most of which cases it was held that a general assignment of breaches was sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-20\">In answer to the fourth objection, it may be proper to remark, that prior to the decision of this Court in the case of <em>Leftwich and others </em>v. <em>Berkeley, &amp;c.</em><footnotemark><em>(m)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I had not adverted to the propriety of shewing that the sheriff was dead, or that a judgment had been obtained against him. I had supposed, that as it was usual to get a judgment against the sheriff on <em>motion, </em>in the first instance, it differed the case of a sheriff from that of any other person. But, if we look into the case of <em>Leftwich and others </em>v. <em>Berkeley, &amp;c. </em>we shall find that it is expressly <em>charged in the </em>declaration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>that tbe sheriff <em>sealed </em>the bond; and that the Court grounded their opinion on that circumstance. I then adduced authorities to shew, that the party could not otherwise avail himself of the objection, but by plea in <em>abatement, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As this is a mere technical rule, contrary to the justice of the case, the Court will not carry it further than it has been by former decisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-4\">According to the authority last cited, the Court will presume the obligor to be dead, whose name is omitted in the declaration, in order to support the judgment: and this is a complete answer to the objection, that the bond appears to have been given by the sureties without the principal having executed it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-5\">The fifth exception is, that it is charged in the declaration, that the taxes were not paid on <em>demand. </em>This is the mode of declaring on all bonds. Few bonds are payable on demand, yet it is always stated in the declaration that they were to be paid by the defendant, when thereto required <em>; </em>yet the plaintiff is never required to prove a demand. The Court will presume after verdict, that enough appeared to the Jury to warrant it. As to the objection that there might have been a demand before the taxes were due, it cannot be presumed that the Court instructed the Jury improperly.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> See L.V. ed. 1785. c. 49. sect. 4. p, 153.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b477-12\"><em> </em>3 <em>Call, </em>523.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em> 3 Call, </em>523.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\"> 3 <em>Call, 13.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"Ao1\"> 1 <em>Call, </em>249.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b478-12\"> 2 <em>Call, 5 </em>0.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"b478-13\"> <em>Oct. 17th </em>1805, MS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"(f)\">\n<p id=\"b478-15\"> <em>Cro.

The Judges delivered their opinions,</p>\n<author id=\"b479-11\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AxqZ\">The errors insisted on are :</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">1. That the bond for the collection of the taxes is given to the Commonwealth, instead of the treasurer, as the act directs,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and, therefore void, under the decision in <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Lee, Governor, </em>&amp;c. 3 <em>Call, </em>421. But although the bond begins with an acknowledgment that the defendants are held and firmly <em>hound </em>to the <em>Commonwealth, </em>it proceeds to say that the penalty is to be paid <em>to the Treasurer for the use of the Commonwealth, </em>which brings it within the intention of the law. And though it was said that the <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>wealth </em>(being an <em>ideal </em>person) could not maintain an action upon it, the case of <em>Bibb </em>v. <em>Cauthorne,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>furnishes a precedent to the contrary. And that of <em>Winston </em>v. <em>the Commonwealth,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is a still stronger case ; for, there, the bond, which was for the forthcoming of property taken in execution at the suit of the Commonwealth, appears to have been taken to the <em>sheriff. </em>Yet the Commonwealth obtained a judgment on <em>motion </em>in the General Court, and this Court affirmed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">2. That the Court had no right to take such a bond from a late sheriff. In the first place, it does not appear, from this record, but that the party might have been sheriff, at the time of giving this bond; for the <em>declaration only </em>mentions <em>Winslow </em>as <em>late </em>sheriff of Orange, <em>deceased. </em>Of course, the word <em>late </em>may refer to the time of bringing the suit, or filing the declaration. 2d. The bond is not set out <em>inhmc verba; </em>and, in this case, is not <em>necessarily </em>a part of the record: being a bond with a collateral condition, and not for the payment of <em>money </em>only, in which case, it is, from necessity, in most cases a part of the record. 3d. The collection of the taxes due for the year 1784, having been postponed by two <em>acts,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a subsequent act passed in <em>November,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the purpose of enabling the sheriffs for <em>that </em>year to make the collection of <em>those </em>taxes, although their times <em>should have expired, </em>and declares that, where any sheriff had given bond, as by law directed, or should <em>thereafter </em>give such bond, he shall continue to collect the public taxes, for which he may be accountable, in the same manner as if his time <em>had not expired; </em>and be subject to the same penalties. Under these circumstances, such a bond as this is supposed to have been, seems to have been authorised by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">3. The breach is alleged to be assigned too generally. It is in the words of the condition. So it was in the case of <em>Johnstons </em>v. <em>Meriwether, </em>3 <em>Call, </em>523. and <em>Branch v. The Commonwealth, </em>2 <em>Call, </em>510. <em>send Branch </em>v. <em>Randolph, October </em>term, 1805; and so was the case of <em>Little's Administrators </em>v. <em>The </em>Commonwealth, decided yesterday.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>4. That it was not stated in the declaration that the sheriff was bound in the same bond. This was not necessary\u00b6 it appearing from the declaration that he is <em>dead. </em>The Court will presume that his name is in the bond., which is not spread upon the record, and which the defendants have not denied to be their act and deed. And this circumstance, viz. that <em>it appears </em>that the sheriff was <em>dead </em>before this suit was brought, seems to me to distinguish this case from <em>Leftwich </em>v. Berkeley, 1 <em>Hen. and Munf. 61. </em>There it appeared, there was another obligor not named a defendant, and not <em>appearing to be dead; </em>and, therefore, the judgment was reversed, because all the obligors who are alive must be sued <em>jointly, </em>or each of them <em>severally. </em>But, as all the surviving obligors are brought before the Court at once, I see no reason to consider it as an objection that they have not been severally sued. They might have pleaded severally, if they had a several defence. Having made none it is to be presumed they had none to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">5. The breach is laid that the taxes were not paid on <em>demand. </em>This might, for aught I know, have been shewn as a cause for a special demurrer. But the objection seems to me to be too late' when the party has wilfully stood out against the course of the Court, and, for the first time, comes into this Court to point out matters of error in point of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In pex-using the record, an objection occurred to me which was not noticed at the bar. The damages laid in the declaration are only 600l. The damages assessed in one of these suits are upwards of 900l. and in the other 1,900l. And I was, at first, inclined to think, that the same reason which restrains a plaintiff from recovering more damages than he demands in his declaration, in an action sounding merely in damages, would apply to these cases. But I find that this point occurred in <em>Johnstons </em>v. <em>Meriwe</em>ther, 3 Call., 524. and again in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Ellzey, </em>2 <em>Wash. </em>143. and, in both cases, was disregarded. My doubts are consequently changed into submission. Yet, I cannot help saying that such a practice has, in my opinion, a tendency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>to mislead a defendant, who may think it not worth while to defend a suit, where the damages are laid at 10l. only, but would, probably, be roused on receiving notice, that he might be subject to the payment of 2,000l.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">Upon the whole I think the judgments ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b482-14\">Judge <em>Roane.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_9\"><em>The </em>case of <em>Bibb </em>v. <em>Cauthorne,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Branch </em>v. Randolph, Governor, &amp;c.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> overrule the objection to this bond as standing in the name of the <em>Commonwealth, </em>instead of being payable to the <em>Treasurer; </em>if, indeed it be not <em>substantially </em>so payable, as appears by the <em>solvendum. </em>In the former case the bond was precisely like the present as to the point in question: in the latter the bond was payable to the <em>Governor </em>instead of the <em>Treasurer. </em>That bond was dated in <em>May, </em>1784, and was held good, notwithstanding that the act of 1781,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> speaks of the bond as being payable <em>to the Treasurer; </em>and that the act of <em>1792,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>first expressly made the sheriffs\u2019 bonds payable <em>to the Governor. </em>These decisions proceeded upon the ground that the acts of 1748, and 1755, making the sheriffs\u2019 bonds payable to the King, as also the ordinance of convention of 1776,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> were still in force, and governed the construction of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">As to the criticism upon the expression \u201c late sheriff,\u201d I will either take it to be an <em>averment </em>by the plaintiff in the declaration, as was argued by the <em>Attorney General, </em>and not as contained in the condition of the bond; or, if it even be in the condition, that he was appointed a <em>collector </em>of the taxes after his sheriffalty had expired, and that that expression was only used, as a <em>descriptio persones, </em>not varying, however, his quality as collector. It is clear that at that time collectors of the taxes were in several instances recognized by our laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">These are the objections which occur in this case. The objection on account of the generality of the breach was overruled yesterday in the case of <em>Little\u2019s Administrators, &amp;</em>c. v. <em>The Commonwealth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-17\">I am of opinion that both judgments be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>Judge </em>Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Adu\">The grounds of the opinion of the Court, in favour of affirming the judgments, having been so fully stated by tbe Judges who preceded me, it seems unnecessary fbr me to say more than that I am of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the judgments of tbe General Court affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b479-13\"> <em>November, </em>1781, c. 40. sect. 4. ed. 1785.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\"> 1 <em>Wash. </em>91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\"><em> </em>2 <em>Call, </em>290.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b480-11\"> Ch.7. and 15. passed in <em>May </em>of that year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\"><em> </em>Ch. 91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\"> 1 <em>Wash. </em>91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> <em>Oct. </em>1805.
