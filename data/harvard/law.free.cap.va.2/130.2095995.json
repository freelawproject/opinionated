The appellees brought an action of debt against the appellant in the District Court of Northumberland,, upon a penal bill for the payment of 73,000 pounds of sound merchantable tobacco, inspected in the year 1780, at Falmouth, Fredericksburgs or <em>Pori Royal </em>A memorandum was indorsed on the bill, signed by the appellees, in the following words, <em>viz, </em>\u201c Tobacco passed at <em>Hohs-hole </em>inspection will be received in discharge of the above bond <em>% </em>tobacco passed at any time within the twelve months on these warehouse to be taken/5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-3\">A conditional judgment being entered against the appellant and his <em>a </em>appearance bail, the latter set it aside, and pleaded payment/5 At a subsequent term, the'appellant withdrew the plea, and judgment by <em>nil dicit </em>was entered by the Clerk, for the payment of tobacco <em>generallys </em>with a stay of execution, but without specifying the particular warehouses, and without giving credit for sundry payments indorsed on the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-4\">The appellees at a subsequent term, petitioned the same Court for a writ of error <em>coram vobis, </em>and made an assignment of errors stating, \u201c that the Clerk had entered up the judgment for payment of tobacco <em>generally, </em>whereas it ought to have been for 73,000 pounds of sound merchantable tobacco, of the inspection of 1780, at Fredericksburg, Falmouth, or <em>Port Royal </em>warehouses/5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">The appellant pleaded in <em>millo est </em>erratum, and concluded with praying the Court to proceed to examine, as well the record and process aforesaid, as the matters aforesaid assigned for error, and that the judgment might be affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">To this plea there was a general replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">THE COURT' having inspected the record and proceedings, as also the original bill penal and indorsements thereon, and the original entry of the confession of judgment, reversed the same with costs, it not being rendered pursuant to the tenor of the penal bill, and the discounts indorsed thereon not being allowed. The Court then proceeded to give judgment, for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged bv the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of 48,927 pounds of sound merchantable tobacco, passed at <em>Frederickburg, Falmouth </em>and <em>Port Royal </em>warehouses, with interests and <em>costs, </em>&amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-9\">From this judgment <em>Gordon </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-10\"><em>Washington, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-11\">Writs of error <em>coram vobis </em>are unusual in this couutrv, but they are certainly useful, and the rules respecting them in <em>England </em>are not difficult to understand. They lie to correct misprisions of the Clerk, and errors in fact, or in the process and proceedings. But if the error be in th <em>&amp; judgment </em>of the Court, it can only be corrected by a superior tribunal. So if the error be <em>in fact, </em>it can be tried only by a jury. 2 <em>Lev. </em>38, 2 <em>Bac. Jib. </em>215, and the cases there cited. I object therefore, in the first place, that the trial was by the <em>Court, </em>upon inspection of the record, and not by a <em>jury. </em>The withdrawing of the plea, and the entry of the judgment generally, might have been done in consequence of an agreement variant from the tenor of the bill, and therefore it involved a fact properly triable by a jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-12\">But I rely principally, that the judgment which is given to correct a former one, is itself erroneous for the same reason that the former is alleged to have been so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-13\">It will not be. questioned I presume, but that the memorandum indorsed on the bill, is as much a part of the obligation, as if it had been inserted in the body of the instrument itself$ of course, the payment might be made of tobacco at <em>Habs-hole, </em>as well as at the other three warehouses. If the Court then were right in correcting the former judgment, so as to make it conform to the tenor of the bill, they were wrong in omitting the <em>Hobs-hole </em>inspection, since by doing so, the tenor of the obligation was not pursued ; so that at all events the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-14\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-15\">The error in this case is obviously clerical. The judgment is confessed generally, (as the record proves,) and the entering it up is the business of the Clerk, who having the bond for a guide, ought to have pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>sued the tenor of it The variance from it is certainly his mistake, and not that of the Court, as we all know, that the proceedings in a cause are never examined by the Court at the time when the orders are read and signed by the Judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-4\">It is contended that the trial ought to have been by jury. To this there are two answers 5 1st, that the error appears obviously from the record to be clerical, and therefore there could be no fact for the jury to try. Arid 2dly, the \u00a1dea <em>in millo est erratum </em>confessed the fact, and therefore it was unnecessary to try \u00cdL</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-5\">As to the objection stated to the last judgment, it Is not easy for this Court to decide that it is error. For it is impossible to say, whether the memorandum was made at the time the bill was executed qj not, or by whom it was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-6\">Wickham, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-7\">I admit, that if the error assigned be a matter of fact <em>dehors </em>the record, it is triable only by a jury. But in such a case, the parties must by their pleadings put the facts in issue. For if the defendant in error, instead of traversing the fact, tenders an issue <em>in laws </em>denying that there is error, he necessarily admits the facts alleged in the assignment to be true, as certainly, ns a demurrer does, in common cases, admit the truth of the allegations 00 the other side. Thus, if the error assigned be, that the defendant was an infant and \u00a1appeared by attorney, the opposite party may traverse the fact of infancy, ano have it tried by a <em>jury; </em>or he may admit the fact, and deny that it is error, and this is done by pleading <em>in millo est </em>erratum. So that upon the pleadings in the cause, the Court, and not the jury, were to decide the point in issue. But the truth is, that the error was merely clerical, and appears to be go upon the face of the record, and therefore it was properly amendable by the Court upon inspection. The Act of Assembly, <em>[Rev. </em>Laxos, p. 118, \u00a7 21,) has prescribed the mode in which the Clerk is to enter up judgments ia actions oa bonds ? that is to say, for the penalty, to be discharged by payment of the princii pal, interest, and costs. The confession in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>was general, but the Clerk has omitted to enter up judgment according to the rule above-mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqC\">I am inclined to think that the Court were right in not noticing the memorandum. It does not appear how, or when it was made. Besides, the obligor lost the election which it gave him of paying tobacco of the <em>Hobs-hole </em>inspection, by his not having made the payment within the twelve months.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-5\">Washington, in reply. \u2014 I admit that if the error stated had been one which was properly assignable, the plea would have confessed it. But if otherwise, the plea is considered as a demurrer. Cro. <em>Ja. </em>12. 29. 521. <em>Raym. </em>231. <em>Cro. Car. </em>421. But error in the judgment of the Court, as I observed in opening the cause, is not assignable, nor can it be corrected by the same Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-6\">The plea therefore confesses nothing. The error here is in the judgment of the Court. The words are, \u201c therefore it is considered by the <em>Court </em>that the plaintiff recover against the defendant,\u201d &amp;c. 8tc. This is called the mistake of the Clerk. It may be so, but it may not be so. The record states it as the mistake of the Court, and there are no facts appearing to induce a different conclusion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apn\">But I rely principally upon the other objection. The memorandum is signed by the obligees, and the bond continues in their possession. No question can exist but that a memorandum indorsed upon a deed is considered as a part of the deed, and consequently, if the amendment were properly made upon an inspection of the bond, it should have been wholly pursued, or not at all. The election given to the obligor, by the memorandum, is not restrained as to the time of' payment, but the age of the tobacco after inspection, Mr. <em>Wickhairfs </em>argument upon this point is therefore founded upon a mistaken construction of the memo-random.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-8\">Carrington J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbT\">This case, though depending upon a practice not common in this country, is by no means a difficult one. I have no doubt but that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>error complained of might have been corrected by the same Court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party, having preferred a writ of error <em>coram </em>vobis, had a right to proceed in that way, though a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">The plea of the defendant, concluding to the Court, and resting the defence upon the law of the case, is a complete answer to the objection made to the mode of trial. The error in this case appears on the face of the record tobe merely clerical, and consequently the Court had a right to amend it. But in correcting <em>two </em>errors, there are <em>three </em>committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">First. The election given to the obligor by the indorsement (which is clearly to be considered as part of the bond,) of paying tobacco of the <em>Hobs-hole </em>inspection, is omitted, as also the age of the tobacco, as specified in the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Secondly. There is an error in the calculation of the balance due, after discounting the payments indorsed on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Thirdly. In awarding costs to the appellees. For as the error was merely in the <em>officer of the </em>Court, which the injured party might have corrected upon motion, it is unjust that, because the plaintiff in error chose to pursue this method, the defendant should be burthened with the payment of the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Lyons J.&lt; \u2014 The only difficulty which I was under from the beginning, was, whether a writ of error <em>coram vobis, </em>in a case of this sort, was proper, since I have no sort of doubt, but that the error might have been corrected upon motion. However, I should not Incline for this reason to reverse the judgment! but I concur in opinion with the Judge who has gone before me, that the judgment itself is erroneous, and must be reversed. I recollect a case, (though I have forgotten the names of the parties) where upon an appeal from the County Court of Middlesex, to the District Court of <em>King and Queen, </em>a variance was suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>between the minutes and the record, and the Clerk being summoned to attend the District Court with his minute book, and the variance appearing, he was directed by the Court to amend the record, and this proceeding was sanctioned upon an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AJs\">The President. \u2014 The first objection stated by the appellant\u2019s counsel was, that an error in the judgment itself could not be corrected in the same Court. This was admitted to be law by the counsel on both sides. It was then contended, that the error complained of in this case was in the judgment of the Court. In form, it is so; and though the proceedings, as drawn up by the Clerk, are read over in Court, and <em>\u2019inhere there has been a trial, </em>the same are then corrected: yet this is not done where a <em>judgment is confessed, </em>as it was here: for in such case the Act of Assembly furnishes a rule by which the Clerk is to enter up his judgment. There is no doubt, but the Court may amend upon motion, where a mistake is committed by their Clerk, if there be, as in this case there was, something to amend by. Yet the party was at liberty to pursue the present mode if he chose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">As to the correcting judgment, it is clearly charge able with the three errors which have been mention ed. Upon the subject of costs I feel some difficulty. It is clear that the Court had a power to correct the error upon motion, and therefore it was unnecessary to apply for a writ of enor. The former practice (where notice is given of the motion to the adverse party) is upon every principle to be preferred; yet we should not for this reason quash the writ, since the party was at liberty to pursue either mode. Yet it would be unjust that <em>Gordon </em>should pay the costs unnecessarily incurred in correcting the mistakes of the Clerk. But I was somewhat perplexed as to the law respecting this subject, writs of error <em>coram vobis </em>being so unusual in this country as not to come fully within any of the acts relating to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">This case occurring in the year 1790, the Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>1792, Ch. 66, \u00a7 64, (see <em>Rev. </em>Laws, p. 87) cannot have any influence upon it. The District Court passed in 1788, Ch. 67, \u00a7 73, refers this subject to the law enabling the General Court to settle and adjust costs. Upon examining that law, (passed in the <em>May </em>session of 1783, Ch. 40, <em>Chan. Rev. </em>p. 207,) the General Court is authorised, in cases of appeal, writs of error, supersedeas, or certiorari, from the <em>Inferior </em>Courts, to award costs. This applies not to writs of error in <em>the same Court. </em>We then assimilated this to the cases of motions, where, by the same law, the costs are discretionary. Yet this discretion is to be exercised with reason; and as I am clear that it was unreasonable to award costs in this case, I am of opinion that the judgment is erroneous upon this point also.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Judgment reversed with costs, and entered for 146,000 pounds of tobacco, the debt in the declaration mentioned, and the costs of the appellee in the District Court expended to the time of entering the first judgment, but to be discharged by the payment of 49,085| pounds of sound merchantable tobacco inspected either at <em>Fredericksburg, Falmouth, Port Royal, ox Hobs-bole </em>warehouses, with interest, See. and the costs of the first judgment.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\">(1) <em>Wren </em>v. <em>Thompson &amp; Veitch, </em>4 Munf. 377. 388.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
