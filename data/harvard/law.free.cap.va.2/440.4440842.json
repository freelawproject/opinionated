On the trial, the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages to <em>$240.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-10\"><em>The </em>defendant then moved in arrest of judgment for the following reasons: 1st. Because the plaintiff, in his declaration, had set forth no cause of action. 2dly. Because, by the plaintiff\u2019s own shewing, he could not recover in this action; <em>trespass </em>and not <em>case </em>being <em>the </em>proper action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-11\">The Court gave judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-12\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8X\">contended, that stealing a deed of land, was not <em>larceny. For </em>this position he referred to 1 <em>Hawk. P. C. </em>c. 33, \u00a7 <em>22; 4 Black. Com. </em>234; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Westbeer, 2 </em>Stra. 1133. If this is correct, the proser cution for larceny, which the plaintiff alledges to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>instituted, was illegal and void, even on its face. Under these circumstances, an <em>action on the case </em>would not lie, hut <em>trespass </em>was the proper remedy. The distinction is, that whore a prosecution is instituted for an offence that is punishable in that mode of proceeding, the defendant may bring <em>case. </em>But, if a party is prosecuted for <em>felony, </em>for an act that does not amount, to <em>felony, </em>there his only remedy is <em>trespass. </em>These doctrines are completely justified by the opinion of Lord Mansfield, in the case of <em>Johnstone </em>v. <em>Sutton, 1 T. </em>R. 544; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Hughes, 2 </em>T. R. <em>255.</em></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AU5Q\"><em>May </em>15.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">The new clause in the. act of <em>Jeofails </em>does not apply to this case. 1 <em>Rev. </em>Code, 511, \u00a7 103. That clause went into operation on the 1st of January, 1830. The issue was joined in this case, in April, 1818. The trial, verdict. and motion in arrest, were all in September, 1819, and the judgment was rendered in April, 1820. So 1 hat the <em>verdict </em>was rendered under the old law: and the <em>judgment </em>only was rendered after the new one went into operation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AuU\">The President,</author>\n<p id=\"AqG\">delivered the opinion of the Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">This case is within the letter of the section of the act of <em>Jeofails, </em>applicable to it; the judgment having been rendered after that section took effect, though the verdict was before; and the Court is of opinion, that it is within the mischief intended to he provided against also. Damages equivalent to the injury complained of, can only he recovered, either in the action of trespass, or trespass on the case. A construction of the act of <em>Jeofails, </em>therefore, which will comprehend this case, cannot affect any substantial right of the defendant. He might have demurred io the declaration before the section of the act alluded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>went into operation, if his counsel had thought proper.Having failed t\u00f3 do so, and the merits having been as fairly tried in this.form of action, as if it had been trespass, and not tresPass on the case, the act of <em>Jeofails ought not to </em>receive a construction that would now permit him to avail himself of the advantage of a demurrer. It is not, therefore, material to decide, whether the plaintiff has mistaken his action or not. On that point, the Court is inclined to the opinion, that the proper action was trespass, and <em>not </em>trespass on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The judgment is to be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\"> Judge Coalter, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
