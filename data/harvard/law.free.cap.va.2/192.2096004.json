Upon the plea of not guilty, the jury found a verdict for the appellee. The appellant moved in arrest of judgment, and amongst other errors assigned the following, viz, \u201c that the price or value of the negro is not set forth in the declaration.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-13\">Judgment for the appellee, from which an appeal was granted to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-14\"><em>Williams, </em>for.the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-15\">It is essential in an action of trover and conversion, that the price should be stated in the declaration, 5 <em>Bac. </em>275. If so, it is not cured by the Act of <em>Jeofails. </em>It is true, that a mistake in setting forth a sum of money, quantity of merchandise, See. is cured, if the same be rightly stated in any part of the record; but this clause in the Act of <em>Jeofails </em>will not aid the total <em>omission </em>of price.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-16\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-17\">It is laid down in the case of <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Smith, Cro. Jac. </em>129, by three Judges against two, that at common law it was not necessary to state the price in an action of trover and conversion, and the reason given seems to be a sound one, <em>viz. </em>that <em>damages </em>are demanded, and not the thing <em>itself. </em>But if this were not so, it is certainly mere matter of form, and therefore cured by the act of <em>Jeofails. </em>It does not appear that the case cited from 5 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>275, was after verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-18\"><em>Williams, </em>in reply. \u2014 Another reason why the value should be stated in this country is, that the Court may see whether they can properly try the suit in that particular form of action; for if the value were below <em>6L </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the suit by the law of this State should be by <em>petition, ' \u2022</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b257-3\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAY\">It seems to be the better opinion, that a declaration in this action need not state the price of the thing converted, though this is necessary in the action of <em>detinue, </em>where the thing itself, or the value is to be recovered. In the former case* it is not the price which the plaintiff goes for, but damages for the conversion: and even where the price is laid, he may recover more or less, provided the damages do not exceed those laid in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The Court affirmed the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
