In 1786, <em>Littlepage, </em>assigned this bond to <em>Stockdell, </em>at which time, <em>Morris </em>was a creditor of <em>Stockdell </em>by bond, in a sum very little short of the amount of the one which he had given to <em>Littlepage. Stockdell, </em>proposed a discount of the two bonds to <em>Morris, </em>which the latter refused, in consequence of the pendency of a suit against him, <em>Littlepage </em>and others, by <em>Johnson, </em>in the state of <em>Kentucky, </em>claiming a conveyance of an <em>undivided moiety of the </em>2000 <em>acres of land, </em>instead of a <em>separate tract, </em>with the difference in value between such tract, and the first choice which <em>Morris, </em>by his contract with <em>Littlepage, </em>had a right to make. After this refusal, <em>Morris </em>instituted suit against <em>Stockdell </em>upon his bond, and recovered a judgment. <em>Stockdell </em>assigned <em>Morris\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Picket, </em>but whether before, or after the judgment obtained by <em>Morris, </em>does not certainly appear..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-9\"><em>Picket </em>instituted a suit upon this bond against Mor<em>ris, </em>in the County Court of <em>Henrico. </em>At the trial of that cause, the counsel of <em>Morris </em>offered <em>Stockdell\u2019s </em>bond as a discount, and moved the Court to instruct the. jury upon the law arising from the facts in evidence before them, or by other means to reserve the points for their future decision, and for this purpose, tendered a statement of the facts, requesting the Court to alter them if necessary, so as to reserve the case. The Court declined, or neglected, giving any opinion upon either point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-10\">The legality of the discount; the equity of <em>Morris </em>against the bond in question; and the subject of notice to <em>Picket </em>of both or either of those objections, were subjects discussed before the jury; and the Court refusing to interfere, they found a verdict for Picket, the plaintiff at Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The defendant <em>Morris </em>moved for a new trial, (this being the second trial of the cause,) but the Court were divided in opinion. ' Afterwards, a fifth magistrate, who had sat during the trial, came upon the bench, and the. motion was renewed, but was soon afterwards dropt. The defendant then exhibited a bill to the same Court praying for an injunction, at which time, <em>Picket </em>agreed to stay execution for a month, that the defendant might have an opportunity of applying to the <em>Chancellor </em>for an injunction, which he afterwards did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-4\"><em>Morris </em>filed his bill in the High Court of Chancery, praying to be relieved against this judgment, principally upon the ground, of the debt due to him from Stockdell, which had not been allowed him as a discount in the trial at Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">Picket, in his answer to this bill, states himself to have been a fair <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the bond in question, without notice of any disputes relative thereto, or of the appellee\u2019s right to any discounts. That he paid <em>Stockdell </em>for the said bond, in money certificates and other public securities, a sum exceeding the value of this bond, which excess created a debt from <em>Stockdell </em>to him, which has been considerably increased by other advances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-6\">Whether the County Court refused to grant the injunction applied for by Morris, or whether the motion was withdrawn in consequence of the offer made by <em>Picket, </em>of staying execution for a month, does not certainly appear from the record. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-7\">One witness proves, that the appellant applied to him to know what objection the appellee had to the payment of this bond; the witness informed him that the appellee had discounts against it, and also mentioned the dispute about the <em>Kentucky </em>land: upon which the appellant replied, \u201c that he would have nothing to do with the bond.\u201d The witness does not state whether this conversation took place before or after the assignment, but concludes from <em>Pickets </em>reply, that it was prior to it. It does not appear when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the assignment was made. The High Court of Chancery, upon a hearing of the cause* dissolved the injunction as to 36/. 13s. <em>Sd. </em>with interest thereupon from <em>August </em>1786, after deducting therefrom the costs of that Court, and decreed the injunction to stand and be p\u00e9rpetual as to the residue, and that <em>Morris </em>should assign to <em>Picket </em>the judgment obtained by him against <em>Stockdell. </em>The bill as to <em>Littlepage </em>was dismissed with costs. From this decree <em>Picket </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-6\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-7\">The first question which I shall consider is, whether the appellee could, at Law, have set up his judgment against <em>Stockdell, </em>as a discount against the appellant. 2dly, Whether he can resort to a Court of Equity for the relief sought by this bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-8\">1st. The assignee of a bond, by the law of this State, is bound to allow all just discounts against <em>himself, </em>or against the <em>obligee </em>before notice of the assignment. The discount offered by the appellee, is a judgment obtained against a <em>mesne assignee, </em>which I contend is not a case provided for by the Act of Assembly. <em>Morris\u2019s </em>bond, coming by assignment into the hands of <em>Stockdell, </em>could not be considered as being <em>ipso facto </em>discharged, in consequence of the latter being the debtor to the former to an equal amount. The reciprocal possession of each others bonds, did not amount to a <em>payment </em>of both, or of either. The one may be <em>discounted </em>against the other, unless the conduct of the parties hath prevented it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-9\">This is the difference between <em>actualpayment, </em>and off-setting mutual demands ; in the first, the bond is discharged by the silent operation of law; in the latter, both debts subsists, until <em>they are opposed </em>to each other ; for the parties may <em>xvave </em>the discount if they please.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-10\">In this case, <em>Morris </em>evinced his determination not. to discount, expressly, as '.veil as impliedly. He refused it <em>expressly, </em>when <em>Stockdell </em>applied to him for that purpose ; and impliedly, by bringing suit against <em>Stockdell </em>upon his bond, in which, if the discount had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>been offered, he must have been non-suited. And <em>StockdeU, </em>by assigning <em>Morris\u2019s </em>bond to Picket, evinced a similar disposition in himself not to discount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-3\">After this, will it be contended, that <em>Morris </em>can reclaim his right of discounting, and that too, against a <em>bona fide </em>assignee ? But suppose <em>Morris </em>was not deprived of this right by his own conduct, let us consider,</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-4\">2dly. Whether he can be relieved in this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-5\">Every point in this cause has once been before a Court of competent jurisdiction, and without a possible objection to the fairness of the trial, the jury have decided in favour of the appellant. If the County Court gave an erroneous opinion upon the points submitted to them, or if they erred in refusing to give any opinion, at all, the power of correction belonged exclusively to an <em>appellate </em>Court. But a Court of Equity has no jurisdiction in such a case. It cannot correct legal errors in an inferior Court, or rehear and rejudge the judgment of a Court of Law. If <em>Morris </em>was aggrieved by the judgment of the County Court, he might have excepted and appealed. If the justices refused to sanction the bill of exceptions by their signature, the Law marks out a plain redress for the injured party. But instead of pursuing those steps, the appellee voluntarily abandons them, and now seeks relief in a Court of Equity, <em>upon the very points </em>which had been fully discussed, and fairly decided upon in a Court of Law. If he can hope to succeed, it must not be by asserting <em>the Law </em>to be in his favor, for that has been determined against him by the proper tribunal, and therefore, the Law is with his antagonist,funtil that decision be reversed. He must then rely altogether upon his claim to <em>superior equity.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-6\">Let the pretensions of the two parties upon this ground be compared. <em>Picket </em>is a fair purchaser, for a valuable and full consideration, without notice of any objection upon the part of <em>Morris. </em>On the other hand, <em>Morris </em>had, by his own conduct, completely discharged the bond in question from the danger of ' being discounted against the debt due from <em>StockdeU </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>to him. He refused the discount, as one of the depo\u00bb sitions proves, for the unfair purpose of discharging his own bond in warrants, at a reduced price, and consequently for less than the real amount. He institutes suit against <em>Stockdell, </em>as an additional evidence of his having disclaimed the discount, after which, his bond is assigned. Can he now talk of equity, who, <em>by bis </em>own conduct, has been the cause of the very loss he is un willing to bear himself, and now seeks to throw upon <em>Picket? </em>If he had done at that time, what he now insists upon, the bond in question would long since have been cancelled, and deprived of its ability to deceive the world.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-9\">Perhaps an attempt may be made to excuse this conduct of <em>Morris, </em>on account of the equity against his bond, which is faintly relied upon in the bill. If this had been any thing more than a pretence, <em>Morris, </em>instead of waving the discount by bringing suit upon <em>StockdelPs </em>bond, would have instituted a suit in equity to be relieved against the payment of his bond, by which means, third persons would have been warned not to purchase it. But the decree of the <em>Chancellor, by </em>directing the difference between the two bonds to be paid by Morris, necessarily disallows his <em>claim </em>of equity on account of the <em>Kentucky </em>lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-10\">I say nothing about the bill of exceptions, because not being assigned, it contains no facts which this Court ought to regard.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-11\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-12\">I cannot agree that <em>Morris </em>has, by any part of his conduct, waved his right of discounting <em>StockdelPs </em>bond against his own, or that he is precluded from asserting that right, as well as his prior equity against this bond, in a Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-13\"><em>Morris </em>purchased from <em>Littlepage </em>his choice of two distinct tracts of land, of a thousand acres each. .He is afterwards sued in the State of <em>Kentucky, </em>by <em>Johnson, </em>who claims an undivided moiety of both tracts. Should he succeed, no two contracts can be more unlike, than the one made with <em>Littlepage, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that which would be thus forced upon him. The bond which he had given in part of the purchase money comes by assignment into the hands of <em>Stock-dell, </em>his debtor, charged with this equity against it, and therefore, when <em>Morris </em>was applied to by <em>Stock-dell </em>to discount one bond against the other, the former, very properly, objected. He was not bound to off-set a debt justly due to him, against one, which in equity he did not owe. Under this impression, <em>Morris </em>brought suit upon <em>StockdelPs </em>bond as he certainly had a right to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-3\">It cannot be denied, that <em>Morris </em>had originally an equity against Littlepage; but it was not necessary for him to disaffirm the contract, unless he pleased to do so ; for if the damages to which he was entitled should be equal to the debt due from him to <em>Little-page, </em>the one would discharge the other, and yet the contract remain valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-4\">The next question then is, whether <em>Morris </em>can, in a Court of Chancery, set up this equity, as well as the discount, against <em>Picket, </em>the assignee. As this point has been fully discussed in the case of <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>it will not be necessary to repeat those arguments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">But it is contended, that cross bonds do not <em>discharge </em>each other | that they only give <em>an electio?i to discount </em>the one against the others This position may be very questionable. The words of the law are general enough to make any discount, a payment. But if this be not the case, <em>Morris </em>may oiler <em>StockdelPs </em>bond as a discount against <em>Picket, </em>because it would have been a good one against <em>Stockdell </em>The time when the discount may be made is not limited by the law, and therefore, may properly be offered when <em>payment is </em>demanded. 1\u2019he conduct of the parties in the mean time cannot defeat this right to discount, unless it amount to an <em>express </em>waver. I have endeavoured to prove, that the refusal of <em>Moms </em>did not amount to a waver. On the other hand, he retains <em>StockdelPs </em>bond in his possession, and as soon as he <em>xvas properly called upon </em>by <em>Pickets </em>suit to make his elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>tionj whether to discount or not, he then offered <em>Stock-dell\u2019s </em>debt as an off-set. The institution of the suit upon <em>Stockdell\u2019s </em>bond, was not an implied waver; by giving to the debt the security and dignity of a judgment, he did not thereby render it unfit to be made an off-set.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-9\">But it is contended, that however the general question may be decided, a discount against a <em>mesne assignee </em>cannot be set up against the plaintiff in the action. I can see no good reason for this distinction; if it be correct, it is apparent that the most palpable injustice must follow. The obligor, knowing that his bond has come by assignment into the possession of a particular person, goes on to sell him property, or to make payments.; will it be contended, that a subsequent assignment of the bond, will discharge it of those discounts which had once fairly attached upon it?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-10\">If we must give to the law a construction so strict as to produce this effect, it will follow, from the same mode of interpretation, that the negotiability of a bond is at an end after one assignment, and, of course, that <em>Picket </em>could not recover at Law. The words of the law are, \u201c that any person or persons may assign <em>; </em>\u2014 \u201d which if taken strictly, will only apply to <em>obligee </em>or <em>obligees. </em>But if, under a liberal construction of the law, assignees may assign, the proviso as to <em>discounts </em>must be so far extended in its interpretation, as to be commensurate with the <em>right to assign.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-11\">The next question is, whether we can be assisted in a Court of Equity, after what has happened in the trial at Law ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-12\">It is objected, that the errors which the Court committed, were-only examinable by a Court of appellate jurisdiction. But in the case of <em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Wyld,, (ante, </em>p. 36,) this Court determined, that the <em>Chancellor </em>might relieve against a mere error in the Court of Law. In that case, the Court improperly refused to i admit certain testimony which was offered; the party aggrieved by that decision might have excepted and appealed, but he did not. Your honours determined, that the inferior Court were wrong in refusing the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>dence, and that the party who was injured by the mis* take of his counsel, in not excepting, might seek re-. lief in equity. But this is a much stronger case than that. We do not complain of an erroneous opinion given by the Court, but that they refused to give any opinion at all when applied to for that purpose. Instead of instructing the jury as to the law, they left a question of nicety and difficulty to be decided upon by them. If the jury undertook to determine upon a question which involved equitable matter, and were wrong in their opinion, surely their decision does not oust the Court of Chancery of its jurisdiction over the subject. It is obvious, that the counsel for <em>Morris </em>were misled, and the jury confounded by an inquiry into <em>Morris\u2019s equity </em>against the bond, and <em>Picket\u2019s knowledge of u before the assignment; </em>whereas the single point to which the attention of the jury ought to have been directed, was, the propriety of <em>discounting the bond due from </em>Stockdell. As to the notice, the jury had nothing to do with it; it was a merely equitable question. The defendant was prevented from obtaining a new trial, from a mere accident, which it was not in his power to control. It is every days practice, for the <em>Chancellor </em>to relieve against an injury, resulting from a mistake of counsel; as where he neglects to offer discounts, and the like.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-3\">Having, I trust, established the jurisdiction of the Court of Equity, I will proceed to examine the facts in this cause, and apply them to the principles which I have endeavoured to maintain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-4\">If <em>Stockdell </em>had been the plaintiff at Law, no question would exist as to. our right to relief against him. It will also be conceded, that whether the equity goes along with the bond into the hands of an assignee, or not, he is liable, if he had notice of it before he has paid the consideration money. Nay, if he received it at a time when it was in his power to save himself, he will be considered as a purchaser with notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-5\">If Mr. <em>Picket </em>can be in a. better situation than <em>Stock-dell </em>would have been, he must not only be a purchaser without notice, but he must prove, that he gave a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>full bona fide </em>consideration, and that he has paid the <em>whole </em>of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-9\">I say, he must have paid a full consideration j for if the assignor of a bond be liable to the assignee in case he cannot receive payment from the obligor, and less is paid for the bond than its real nominal 'amount, it is usurious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-10\">I admit, that the answer of <em>Picket </em>contains strong general averments, that he paid the whole consideration before notice of <em>Morris\u2019s </em>equity. But this general assertion is qualified by other parts of the answer; and when he is called upon to state the exact consideration paid for the bond, he refuses to do so, and contents himself with a round declaration that it was <em>adequate. </em>In opposition, to this evasive denial of those material points, there is one witness who thinks he gave notice to <em>Picket </em>of the equity of Morris, before the assignment was made. Independent of this, it appears by the answer, that long after the assignment was made, and when it is not denied that <em>Picket </em>had notice, he went on to increase the debt due from <em>Stock-</em>dell., instead of saving himself and <em>Morris </em>with <em>Stock-dell\u2019s </em>property in his hands, which it was in his power to have done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-11\">There is then the testimony of one witness, opposed to the answer. Let us see if there be not circumstances in aid of the former, sufficient to outweigh the latter. In the first place, the inquiry which the witness states Mr. <em>Picket </em>to have made would have been more naturally thought of before, than <em>after he had paid his money. </em>2dly. The silence which the answer observes as to the date of the assignment. 3dly. The appellant\u2019s having property of <em>Stockdell\u2019s </em>so long afterwards in his possession. 4thly. The judgment which <em>Morris </em>had obtained against <em>Stockdell </em>in the very town in which <em>Picket </em>resided, which, as to the discount, is strong presumptive notice. The judgment specially bound the very subject in which <em>Picket </em>was dealing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-12\">Randolph, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-13\"><em>Morris </em>has a two fold equity against <em>Picket; </em>1st. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>bis right to discount against <em>Stockdell, </em>and 2dly, his equity against <em>Littlepage </em>on account of the <em>Kentucky </em>land, I shall not notice the first point here, as the subject has been fully discussed in the case of <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Rose. </em>But I will make this observation as to the fact of notice; that where an answer is to prevail against the testimony of a single witness, it should be plain, candid, and clear of every appearance of con. cealment. This answer denies that the defendant knew of any <em>disputes </em>about the bond, instead of being responsive to the interrogatory, whether he knew of any <em>objections </em>to it by <em>Morris ?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-5\">The question then which is now to be considered is, whether <em>Picket </em>is liable to the <em>discount </em>claimed by <em>Morris ? </em>It is admitted that <em>Morris </em>knew of his bond having passed into the hands of <em>Stockdell; </em>he had therefore a right to keep up <em>Stockdell\u2019s </em>bond, for the purpose of a discount</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">If <em>Morris </em>had once a right to oppose <em>Stockdell\u2019s </em>claim, it should he shewn by what means he has lost it It is said, that tie has waved the right; first, by an express refusal; and secondly, by implication. The reason which induced the refusal to discount was entirely justifiable. He had no objection to the discount in case he was really indebted to <em>Stockdell </em>But the fact was otherwise; the bond which he held was charged with an equity against it, which might have destroyed its force altogether.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">As to the implied waver of his right to discount, I would ask whether the debt due from <em>Stockdell </em>was less binding, because the dignity of it was increased?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-8\">Or will it be contended, that a judgment cannot be set off against a bond, as well as one bond against another ? The only proper time at which <em>Morris </em>could make an election which could be obligatory upon him, was when <em>Stockdell, </em>or his assignee, should bring suit, and when that opportunity did occur, it was made in favour of the discount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-9\">But it is contended, that the Act of Assembly does not apply to discounts against <em>mesne assignees. </em>The word <em>plaintiff, </em>which is used by the Legislature, oh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>viously expresses the same thing as <em>assignee </em>would have done; and if this latter word had been used, it would have run through the whole string of assignees, however numerous they might be. The reason of allowing discounts being to avoid multiplicity of suits, it applies as well to <em>mesne </em>assignees, as to the one, in whom the right to the debt ultimately rests.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-3\">The <em>next </em>question respects the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery. <em>Morris, </em>as I before observed, had a two-fold equity; one, which might properly have been decided upon at Law; but the other, which respected the <em>Kentucky </em>land, was a question, which belonged exclusively to the Court of Chancery. If the latter had been the only ground of the application to that Court, no one could have denied its jurisdiction. But it is well known, that if that Court will entertain the suit at all, it will decide the whole case, though involving points properly determinable at Law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjZ\">Discounts are not less a subject of equitable jurisdiction, because they may also be determined at Law. Until the Statute, the parties were driven into that Court to obtain the benefit of discounts, and the jurisdiction is not ousted by its being concurrent with the Courts of Law. Independent of these considerations, there was not only mistake, but accident, in this case. The counsel were evidently led off from the true point of discussion, into an enquiry about notice, which was entirely unimportant; and from this cause it probably was, that they neglected to file exceptions to the opinion of the Court. It was <em>accident </em>alone which prevented a new trial from being granted upon the first application, and the offer of <em>Picket </em>to wait a month, until <em>Morris </em>could have an opportunity of obtaining an injunction, allured the latter from his purpose of renewing the motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-5\">Marshall, in reply. \u2014 Whether the equity attached to a bond follows it into the hands of the assignee or not, is a question I mean not to argue, because, I consider it to be unimportant in this cause. If <em>JLi'tlepage </em>himself had been plaintiff, he could not have been opposed by this equitable objection. The only evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>of this equity is,- the answer of Littlepage, a bill filed In <em>Kentucky </em>concerning this land, and a paper signed by Johnson, who contests the right of <em>Morris </em>to a fulfilment of <em>Littlepage*s </em>contract. But none of these papers can be considered as evidence of the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-3\">If then <em>Morris </em>had in reality no equity against this bond, his refusal to discount was an absolute waver of his right It is said that there is no time limited, within which the election to discount, or to wave it, is to be made, and that he might use it at the trial. I do not contend that he was bound to make it sooner; but if he expressly refuse\u2019 before the trial to make it, and In consequence of his doing so, his bond is assigned away to a fair purchaser, he is bound by it, and cannot afterwards reclaim his right to discount. The reason assigned by <em>Morris </em>for his refusal was not real, but a mere subterfuge, used for the purpose of enabling him to purchase up his own bond for less than its value, and therefore it cannot qualify that which I term an <em>express </em>waver.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-4\">I do not say that the bringing suit upon <em>StockdelPs </em>bond was of itself a waver, or that the judgment could not be made an off-set; but it is <em>evidence </em>of his mind upon the subject, that the discount was not to take place; for if it were, <em>Morris </em>must have been non-suited, as the bond due from him to <em>Stockdell, </em>amounted to a greater sum than what was due to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">I have contended, that by the literal words of the Act, the defendant cannot set up a discount against an intermediate assignee <em>% </em>to which it is answered, that If the law be thus strictly interpreted, a bond can be assigned but once. I cannot clearly comprehend the justness of this conclusion, for it is plain from the words of the law, that any person or persons having the legal title may assign, which must mean more than one assignment</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">If payments be made, or if property be sold to an' Intermediate assignee, this would be an <em>actual discharge </em>of so much of the bond, and might be given in evidence without the aid of the proviso <em>\\ </em>but this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>is very different from a <em>discount, </em>which could not be made were it not for this law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-8\">If <em>Morris </em>could not have set up the discount at Law, there is an end of the cause. But if he could, he cannot now resort to a Court of Equity to get the benefit of it. The whole case has once been tried and decided by a competent jurisdiction. I contend, that the same question cannot be re-examined and re-judged in any but an appellate Court. I am now speaking of the <em>discount </em>alone. The case of <em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Wyld </em>does not sustain the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery as now contended for. In that case, material testimony was not permitted to go to the jury, and of course, the <em>tvhole case </em>was not before them, nor decided upon by them. This Court declared, that if the whole evidence had been laid before the jury, the decision would have been otherwise. In this case, nothing was kept back; the question which we are litigating here, is the very same which was contested and decided by the jury, with the very same evidence which is exhibited to this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-9\">It is said, that the counsel and jury were entangled with a question which was unimportant, and by that means they were seduced from the true point in the cause. This is mere conjecture, and is not warranted by any part of the record. But if it were, I do not agree that the mismanagement of counsel, or the misconceptions of the jury, will give jurisdiction to a Court of Equity over a subject which has been fully examined and decided upon by a jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-10\">It is said that the Court of Chancery had an original jurisdiction as to discounts, which is not ousted by the Statute. This is admitted; and it then follows, that the Courts of Law and Equity have concurrent jurisdiction upon that subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-11\">It will, I presume, be admitted, that those Courts have also concurrent jurisdiction in matters of account ; but because this is the case, will it be contended, that if a suit be brought at Law upon an account, and a decision be there had, the very same subject may be re-examined in a Court of Equity? As well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>might a Court of Law re-judge a case decided upon in Equity, under the plea of concurrent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-3\">As to all the other pretences for giving jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery, they are mere conclusions of the counsel-, without being warranted by the record^ such are the supposed blunders of the counsel in discussing the Equity instead of the Law of the case \u00a7 in their being dazzled by <em>Picket's </em>offer of waiting a month, and being thereby put off from their first intention of moving for a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\">It'is contended, that <em>Picket </em>had notice of <em>Morris's </em>discount. This is not proved; but if it were, and if he also knew that <em>Morris </em>had <em>rejected the </em>discount, he certainly would not have been bound to admit it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">Neither is there any evidence that <em>Picket </em>had it in his power to save himself; or that there was any thing like usury in the transaction. These are points not stated in the bill, and therefore could not be noticed by the Court, even if they were proved by the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">As to <em>Morris's </em>judgment, it could not be even im- \u2022 plied notice to <em>Picket, </em>who was not privy to, or bound by it. But there is the strongest reason to believe, that the judgment was obtained after the assignment 5 for if it had been otherwise, it is highly probable, that <em>Stockdell </em>would have offered <em>Morris's </em>bond as an off-set.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">The Court desired this cause to be spoken to again, upon the point of jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-8\"><em>Diwal, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\">The conduct of the Court, in refusing to seal the bill of exceptions, prevented <em>Morris </em>from appealing, and produced an injury, against which a Com\u00ed \"of Equity may relieve. I admit, that the Statute points out a mode of proceeding where the Court refuse to seal a bill of exceptions; but it does not follow from thence, that Equity may not exercise a concurrent jurisdiction over the subject, and prevent the injustice which must result from an unfair trial, dr one, where the parties have not been <em>fully </em>heard, and where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>judgment is apparently wrong. 3 <em>Morg. Ess. </em>291, proves, that a Court of Equity will interfere, if the jury be misdirected. So if the Court refuse to direct the jury, and they find an inequitable verdict, the <em>Chancellor </em>may with propriety interfere. After many-new trials have been granted at Law, this Court will for the furtherance of justice grant another. 3 <em>Morg. Ess. </em>91.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-9\"><em>Wickham. </em>\u2014 I think that the jurisdiction of the Court of Equity in this case may be maintained, as well upon the general principle and constitution of that \u2019 Court, as upon the decisions of this Court on similar cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-10\">If a want of jurisdiction appear upon the face of the record in proceedings at common law, the judgment may be arrested, or reversed. But in Chancery causes, the jurisdiction must be specially objected to by plea. \u2022 It may be said perhaps, that this bill gives jurisdiction to the Court, and that therefore no plea to the jurisdiction could have been properly put in. But since all the material allegations in the bill are proved, the Court must retain its jurisdiction, if the bill gave it; if it did not, then it ought to have been objected to by plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-11\">If the appellant had meant to oppose the relief prayed for, because of the judgment at Law, he should have pleaded .it-in bar, and by answer denied the equity stated in the bill. The County Court when called upon to instruct the jury as to the evidence, and to determine svhether the discount which was offered by <em>Morris </em>was legal or not, refused to give any opinion at all, improperly submitting to the decision of the jury a legal question, which it was the duty of the' Court to have determined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-12\">The case of <em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Wyld </em>comes fully up to this. The question in that cause was, whether the referees had valued the house in specie or in paper money. The original valuation could not be found, and therefore the referees were examined upon that point, who declared, that they had a specie valuation in view. The whole case turned upon their evidence, and <em>Wyld </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>was prepared with testimony to prove, that the valuers had made declarations on the subject, the reverse of what they then deposed. But the County Court, before whom the cause was tried, refused to suffer the witnesses to be examined. This Court determined that they were wrong in that opinion, and that where the decision of the inferior Court was manifestly erroneous, the omission of counsel to file a bill of exceptions should not bar the jurisdiction of the Chancery. The <em>Chancellor </em>said, that if this evidence had been heard, the verdict might have been different. Bui the ground of the injunction could have been no other than the error committed by the Court, in refusing the examination of the witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-3\">If we refer to <em>British </em>decisions, they will abundantly prove, that Equity may grant relief, although the matter has been decided at Law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-4\">In the case of <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Stamper, </em>2 <em>Vern. </em>146, the defendant in Equity pleaded the verdict and judgment at Law, and that the defendant had insisted upon the same matter at Law, where it was ruled against him, and demurred. But this was not thought sufficient to bar the relief prayed for, and the plea was overruled. So in the case of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>2 <em>Vern, </em>146, the ground of the bill was, that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had, by mistake, and contrary to instructions, pleaded a general, instead of a <em>special, plene </em>adminis<em>iravit. </em>The Court relieved against this mistake, although the bill did not state that the discovery was made before the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-5\">If such be the decisions in <em>England, </em>there is a much stronger reason why a Court ,of Equity should be more liberal in granting relief in this country, in cases which have been decided in the <em>County Courts. </em>The want of legal knowledge in those Courts, and the loose manner in which business is generally conducted there, will frequently produce improper and unjust decisions of cases, which, in many instances, could only be remedied in a Court of Equity. A distinction of this soft is even warranted by <em>English </em>cases. In <em>Finch Ch, Cas. </em>472, we find that relief was granted against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the judgment of an inferior Court, on account of im- \u00ab proper conduct, and a distinction is taken between the decisions of <em>such Courts </em>and those of the <em>Superior Courts.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-9\">Another ground of jurisdiction .is the mistake of the jury. . The only question was, if the debt had been paid: and if the Court had determined as they should have done, that the discount offered by the appellee was proper, the verdict must have been different from what it was; yet this opinion of the Court was withheld. The jury were led to believe, that the material point in the cause was, whether <em>Picket </em>was a purchaser, with or without notice, and not being satisfied that he was the former, they found for him. I know, that in <em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Wyld </em>it was said by the Court, that if the whole evidence had been left to the jury, the decision would have been otherwise. But it will be noticed, that in this case the error committed, by the jury was in the <em>law </em>of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-10\">\u2022 A Court of Equity will relieve against an award, if there be an evident error on the face of it, or if the arbitrators have mistaken the law of the case. A verdict is not more solemn nor more obligatory upon the parties, than an award. This Court have gone into the recesses of a jury room, to get evidence of the irregularity and mistake upon which the verdict was given. <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Street, (ante, </em>vol. i. p. 79) In <em>M'Rae </em>v. <em>Woods, (ante, </em>p. 80) the jury considered the plaintiff as entitled to half the ticket; but from the evidence, it was clear that if he were entitled to any part, it could not be to more than a fourth; yet this Court sustained the decree of the <em>Chancellor, </em>which awarded a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-11\">It may be contended, that <em>Morris\u2019s </em>attorney might have renewed his motion for a new trial. There is some obscurity upon this subject, and it can only be cleared up by supposing that his counsel was led off from his purpose of doing so,'by <em>Picket\u2019s, </em>offer to stay execution until he could apply for an. injunction. It appears, that after a fifth magistrate came upon the bench, the. motion was renewed, and then abandoned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>But to make the most of this, it was a mistake of counsel, against which this Court may relieve.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-3\"><em>Randolphs </em>\u2014 Let us consider this as an original case in the Court of Chancery; that <em>Morris </em>had there filed his bill against <em>Picket, </em>calling upon him to surrender the bond, on the ground of his original equity against it, or because of the discount; or if the ground of the bill had been that <em>Picket </em>might have saved himself out of <em>P\u2019OckdelPs </em>property, and had failed to do so; in ail these cases, the Court of Equity would have had complete jurisdiction. So it would, if the bill had called upon <em>Picket </em>to discover how much he had paid for the bond. For if <em>Stockdell </em>could have sought relief against an unconscionable or usurious bargain, (which will not be denied,) it is equally dear that <em>Morris </em>possessed the same right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-5\">What then is to bar us from this equitable relief after a decision at Law ? If a verdict be rendered after a <em>full </em>and <em>fair trial </em>upon the law of the case, I admit, that the interference of the Court of Chancery would be improper. But if the cause be mixed with a question of equity^ where the jurisdiction is concurrent, as in cases of fraud,discounts, and the like, and a wrong decision has been given, Chancery will interfere and relieve, although the same points have been pressed at Law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-6\">A Court of Equity will entertain a suit in the case of a lost bond, although there is also a remedy at Law. 3 <em>Term </em>Hep. 151.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-8\">The case of <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Bridgman, Prec, Ch. </em>233, establishes this principle j that where there is concurrent jurisdiction, though the party at Law attempted to avail himself of a point proper for the determination of that Court, and failed, yet he might seek relief in Equity. Now, although the whole case in <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Bridgman </em>was not submitted to the jury, and therefore an attempt may be made to distinguish that case from the present, yet it is obvious, that the ground of the decision was not the failure to produce the judgment, but the fraud which v, as examinable in Equity as well as at Law. The <em>Chancellor </em>sustained the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>upon the ground of a concurrent, and not of an appeilate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-8\"><em>Marshall. </em>\u2014 -The principle which I have endeavoured to maintain is this; that when the <em>whole question </em>has been completely before the jury, accompanied by no circumstance which could prevent a full and fair decision of the case, by that body, there is no remedy but in an appellate Court. If the party apply for relief to a Court of Equity, he must rely upon other ground than legal errors in the decision complained of. Let all the cases which have been cited be examined, and it will be found in each of them, that the <em>whole </em>case was not decided upon by the jury. In 2 <em>M.org. Ess. </em>291, the jury did not decide upon the discounts. 3 <em>Morg. Ess. </em>is no ways applicable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-9\">In the case of <em>Kent </em>v. Bridgman, there was an equity which was not determined at Law; there was a fraud practised and proved, but still the party could not recover at Law, without a copy of the judgment; of course, the subject of the fraud was not tried at all, and the jury were directed to find for the plaintiff, because the judgment was not produced. This is precisely within the rule I have stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-10\">It is then contended, that if it were intended to object to the jurisdiction, it should have been done by plea. This is founded, I suppose, upon the Act of' .1787, which declares, that after answer filed, and no plea in abatement to the jurisdiction of the Court, no exception for want of jurisdiction shall ever after-wards be made, &amp;c\u201e</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-11\">The construction of this law must necessarily be restrained to cases, where <em>the bill shews a right in the. plaintiff to recover. </em>For where the plaintiff has no right at all, and if he be barred by a judgment at Law, it is not necessary, nor would it be proper, to plead to the jurisdiction. Such a plea admits the right of the plaintiff, but denies the power of the Court to decide upon it. Thus, if a suit in Chancery be brought upon a bond; the plaintifi having a right to recover, the defendant must apprise him in an early stage of the cause, that he means to object to the jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the Court. But if, by the plaintifPs own shewing or otherwise, it appears that the bond has been paid off, _ or that he had brought a suit at Law upon it, and a i verdict and judgment had passed against him, would a Court of Equity be bound to decree in his favour, because there existed an objection to its jurisdiction, which had not been taken advantage of by plea ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-3\">It is said, that the defendant should have pleaded the judgment in bar. But this is not necessary, where the same matter is stated in the answer, and is also relied upon in bar; or if (as in the present case,) the plaintiff himself states the judgment in his bill. In <em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Wyld, </em>the whole case was confessedly not before the.jury; for the Court would not permit them to hear all the testimony which was offered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-4\">In the case cited from <em>Finchs Ch. </em>Cas. 472, the Court had no right to decide at all, for want of jurisdiction, so that in fact there was no judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-5\">In 2 Fern. 146, there was a secret equity, of which the defendant could not avail himself at Law; for the Court was not at liberty to inquire into the legal error, whilst the question was depending in a superior Court. In the case now before the Court, there is no equity unmixed with law, since the discount might have been made at Law. In the case last cited, the mistake was not triable at Law, and of course, it was not inquired into, nor decided upon, by the jury. The case of <em>Bosanquet </em>v. Dashwood, <em>Talb. </em>90, was a suit to be relieved against an usurious contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-6\">If the jury mistook the law as to the discount, it does not from thence follow that a Court of Equity can interfere; for if so, every error of the Common Law Courts may be re-examined and re-judged in this Court. In the case of <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Street </em>this Court did not set aside the verdict because it was wrong, but because a part of the jury had been imposed upon by the others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-7\">As to the power which it is said <em>Picket </em>had to save himself, there is no proof of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-8\">I am at a loss to comprehend the distinction which is taken between cases of a merely legal nature, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>such as are mixed with equity. I admit, that in the latter case, the two Courts have concurrent jurisdiction ; but if the whole subject be decided in the Court of Law, Equity can no more re-examine it, than the Courts of Law in a similar case could re-examine a decree of the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-9\">I admit, that a suit may be brought either at Law or in Chancery, where a bond is lost. But if it be decided in either Court, the other cannot interfere.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-10\">Roane, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL6H\">Wherever a case is fully and fairly tried in a Court of Law, the decision is binding upon the parties, and a re-examination of the cause in a Court of Equity is certainly improper. The parties, by submitting to the decision of that tribunal, must be governed by it, whether it be right or wrong. But this principle will extend to no case, where there has not been a fair trial, as well as a full discussion of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">In this case, the appellee, at the trial in the County Court, offered the bond of <em>Stockdell, </em>as a discount against the demand, which ought certainly to have been allowed. For I cannot consider any part of <em>Morris\u2019s </em>conduct as amounting to a waver of his legal right to insist upon the off-set. His refusal at one time to admit the discount, is satisfactorily accounted for. He had strong reasons for believing that he might oppose the payment of his bond to <em>Stockdell, </em>by the equity growing out of the original contract for which that bond was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">It appears that the counsel for <em>Morris </em>moved the Court to instruct the jury, that the discount was proper ; this they refused to do, as well as to recommend a special verdict. In consequence of this improper conduct in the Court, the jury found a verdict most obviously against the very right of the case. For I hold it most clear, that either party has a right to demand the opinion of the Court, upon questions of law which may arise during the trial of a cause. Their superintendence in explainingand deciding legal questions, is essential to the proper administration of jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tice, and ought to be exercised, when either party require their interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">The second motion which was made for a new trial, was not over-ruled by the Court, but for some reason or other, which does not certainly appear, it was abandoned by the defendant. Although there is no testimony in the caus\u00e9 leading to a suspicion that <em>Picket\u2019s </em>offer to,stay execution until an injunction could be applied for, proceeded from an improper motive in him, yet it is highly probable, that it tended to divert Morris, from his purpose of persevering in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">I think the decree ought t\u00f3 be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Carrington J. \u2014 It would perhaps seem strange, that a Court of Equity should not possess the power of relieving against a judgment at Law, obviously unjust, and against the right of the cause. In cases of fraud, surprise, accident, trust, and the like, where that Court has complete jurisdiction, it is within its peculiar province to grant relief, where the parties cannot obtain it at Law. It is true, that the party asking for its interposition must shew himself entitled to equity superior to that of the person who has unconscientiously obtained the advantage at Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">I admit, that the Courts of Law and Equity should be confined within their proper spheres, and that the line which separates their respective jurisdictions should be carefully guarded. With equal jealousy would I watch over and .preserve from violation the trial by <em>jury. </em>But it is not less important, that the <em>Court </em>should exercise those functions which properly belong to them. To the former, belong the uncontroled power of deciding upon facts, and even uoon the law, if it be submitted to them. The province of the latter, is to determine upon \u00a1hose legal points which come properly before them. It is therefore the duty of the Court to inst\u00a1 ;ct the jun upon the law, when they are required to do so, or to reserve the point if either party desire it. If the opinion of the Cor-t be wrong, there is then a way to get it corrected. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the opinion be right, and yet the jury disregard it, the Court may preserve its privilege by setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Can it be contended, that this cause was fully and fail ly tried, when the only important part of the appellee\u2019s case was not decided upon by the jury- ? When the Court refused to state to the jury the law as it respected the discount, they as effectually excluded it from the consideration of the jury, as if they had done it in express terms; for though it was laid before the jury, yet it was a question proper for the decision of the Court, and their refusal to give that decision, kept it out of the view of the jury as the verdict evidently proves. The jury were then mistaken in the law, and being involved in unimportant discussions upon points no way relative to the ' cause, they were allured from the only one which was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Independent of this, it is clear that the parties were surprised into the abandonment of their first intention of moving for a new trial, by the offer of <em>Picket </em>to stay executic n until an injunction could be applied for. It cannot be questioned, but that Equity may relieve against the mistakes of a jury, as if they miscalculate, or omit to allow discounts to which the party injured can prove himself entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">I think that the case of <em>Ambler </em>v. Wyld, is not distinguishable in principle from this. That cause was determined before a Court of competent jurisdiction, but it was determined improperly. The party aggrieved might have appealed, but he did not; yet this Court decided, that Equity might relieve him against this <em>erroneous judgment of a Court of Law. </em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">In this case, it is apparent, that there was a struggle for a general verdict, and that the law and right of the case was stifled in the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">I think the decree right, and that it should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">Lyons J. \u2014 There have been three questions made in this cause; the 1st, has been decided in the case of <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Rose. </em>The 2d is, whether the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>Morris </em>has not deprived him of the discount, of which he now endeavours to avail himself, iidly, Whether, if he be entitled to the discount, he can have the benefit of it after the verdict and judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\">Upon the 2d point, it is contended, that Morris, having once refused to admit the discount, he has thereby waved his right to assert it against a <em>bona fide </em>assignee\u00bb How far an unqualified refusal might have bound him, It is unnecessary to decide, because I am clear that his conduct did not amount to that. Whether the equity under which he sheltered his refusal to\" discount was well founded or not, is not material; it was evidently the cause of his refusal, and it cannot, from the circumstances which attended it, be considered as a mere pretext to avoid the discount. There was at the time, a suit depending in the state of <em>Kentucky, </em>the event of which he could not possibly foreteii. This is sufficient to repel the presumption of an intention to wave. Under these circumstances, it w as a fraud in <em>Stockdell </em>to assign the bond without giving notice of the discount which <em>Morris </em>had against it. Whatever may be the equity of Picket, that of <em>Morris </em>was prior, and equal to It, besides which, he had a <em>legal right </em>to set up his discount. But in fact, <em>Picket </em>must be considered as standing in the shoes of Stockdell, since it was his duty to have inquired of <em>Morris </em>respecting the bond, before he took the assignment of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">There can be no doubt then of <em>Morrises </em>right to relief, unless he be barred of it by the verdict and judgment at Law, which brings me to the consideration of the third point.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">If what I have before stated be correct, it is clear that <em>Morris </em>has a sufficient discount against the claim of Picket, both at Law and in Equity. But it is contended, that he cannot now obtain the benefit of the discount, because he has lost the opportunity which he once had of availing himself of it at Law. But I would ask, when it was, that this opportunity presented itself? At the trial of the cause at Law, he claimed the discount and it was rejected. Considering the question as a legal one, he prayed the opinion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Court upon It, or if they doubted, that they would recommend a special verdict; they refused todo either. He then tendered a bill of exceptions, which they would not sign. He was equally unsuccessful in obtaining a new trial. What more could he have done? The Superior Court could not relieve him, because nothing was spread upon the record which could avail him there. If behadapplied for a <em>mandamus., </em>or pursued any other method of obtaining relief, save the one he did, an execution might have issued, and he must have experienced in the mean time the effect of an unjust and inequitable verdict. And is it possible that a right thus clearly established, should be destitute of a correspondent remedy ? I thought it was the peculiar province of a Court of Chancery to afford relief, in cases where competent remedy could not be afforded some where else.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">I admit, that in this case the party had complete remedy at law; and if the cause had been fully and fairly decided there, equity would not have, interfered. But this was not the' case. The refusal of the Court to decide upon the points which were properly submit-ed to them, prevented a just determination upon the only important question in the cause; and their subsequent refusal to seal the bill of exceptions, shut out the parties from the proper tribunal to have corrected them. Suppose the jury should obstinately decide against the opinion of the Court upon a point of law, or should disregard their recommendation to find a special verdict; there could be no relief in a Court of Law, against two improper verdicts, as a second new trial could not be awarded. Wou\u2019d it not be monstrous to say, that in such cases a Court of Equity could not afford relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The <em>Chancellor </em>was not bound to grant a new trial, because being in possession of the whole case, there was nothing to prevent a final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">The case of <em>Burrows </em>v. Jemino, 2 <em>Str. Rep. </em>733, the <em>Chancellor </em>relieved against a judgment, upon a point, which he whs of opinion the Court of Law ought <em>to </em>have decided In favour of the plaintiff in Equity; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>he observed, e&lt; that ocher Judges might have been of a different opinion.55</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Wyld, </em>is nearly parallel with this; for in that case, as in this, the mischief complained of arose from the error of the Court. Bui there is this difference between them, which renders this a stronger case ; in that, the party might have appealed j in this, he could not, .because the bill of exceptions was not sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">This is certainly a hard case upon Picket, but he who trusts most, must submit to bear the consequences of his misplaced confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Decree affirmed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\">(1) <em>Terrel </em>v.
