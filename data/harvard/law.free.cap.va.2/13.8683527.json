An appeal was taken to the District Court, where the judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>affirmed; and from that Court to the Court of Appeals, where that judgment of affirmance was itself affirmed.</summary>\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b29-14\"><em>In the Fall Vacation, </em>1807.</p><p id=\"b29-16\"><em>If, by </em>a mistake of the sheriff, a writ be served on a wrong person; butsuch personinakes no defence <em>at lain; </em>suffers judgment to go against him by default ; executionhaving issued, gives a forthcoming bond; and, after-wards,delays the plaintiff by appealing from a judgment on that bond; be is nofentitied to relief in equity.</p><p id=\"b30-10\">The testimony did not vary the case; and, at the <em>September </em>Term, 1806, this Court dissolved the injunction, and, in March, 1807, dismissed the bill with costs upon a hearing.</p><p id=\"b30-11\">, The Chancellor was not applied to for an appeal, which (as he has since informed the Reporters) he would have refused.
