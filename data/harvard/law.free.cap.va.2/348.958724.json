In 1819, two of these children, <em>Jacob </em>and <em>George Kerns, </em>sold their interest in the real estate of their father to <em>John Dillard, </em>and took from him two bonds, each for 184 dollars 16 cents, one payable on the 1st of January 1820, and the other on the same day in 1821, with <em>Benjamin Moore </em>as <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">The land was sold by <em>Sharp, </em>the administrator with the will annexed of <em>Michael Kerns, </em>in 1831, and then <em>Jacob Kerns </em>and <em>George Kerns </em>filed their bill in the County Court of <em>Bedford, </em>against <em>Dillard, Moore, </em>and <em>Sharp, </em>as administrator with the will annexed of <em>Michael Kerns, </em>alleging that <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Moore </em>had removed from the Commonwealth; but these two bonds were yet due; and claiming to have a lien upon the interest in the real estate of their father, sold by them to <em>Dillard, </em>and asking the Court to restrain the defendant <em>Sharp </em>from paying over the proceeds of the land to <em>Dillard, </em>and that he be decreed to pay it over to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-11\">The defendant <em>Sharp </em>answered, admitting the facts stated in the bill, and admitting that he then had in his hands the sum of 58 dollars 35 cents, payable to the owner of each of the interests sold to <em>Dillard ; </em>and saying that if the plaintiffs were entitled <em>to </em>receive it, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>was ready to pay it. But he insisted that <em>John Dillard </em>was indebted to him in the sum of 108 dollars 50 cents, with interest from 1822, by bond; that the plain tiffs had no lien upon the money in his hands; and that he was entitled, and did claim to apply the money in his hands to the payment of the debt due from <em>Dillard </em>to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\">The only evidence in the record, is the two bonds from <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Moore </em>to <em>Jacob </em>and <em>George Kerns, </em>and the bond from <em>Dillard </em>to <em>Sharp.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">Whilst the cause was pending in the County Court, <em>George Kerns </em>died, and it was revived in the name of his executors; and then, in February 1838, it was removed to the Superior Court of Law and Chancery for <em>Bedford </em>county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-7\">At the May term of the Court for 1839, a decree was made, directing the defendant <em>Sharp </em>to pay over to the plaintiffs the sum of 116 dollars 70 cents, with interest from the 28th of March 1838, till paid, first deducting his costs expended in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\">From this decree, <em>Sharp </em>obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-9\"><em>Grattan, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABmI\"><em>Michael Kerns </em>having by his will directed his land to be sold, it is to be considered as money. And having been sold, the proceeds are personal estate, and not subject to the vendor\u2019s lien. But if they would have been so subject, the parties released the lien by taking other independent security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-11\">The suit is not a foreign attachment; and no lien can be claimed on that ground. The case is therefore the naked case of a creditor at large coming into a Court of Equity to subject the property of his debtor.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-12\">No counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b369-13\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"A18\">reversed the decree of the Court below, and dismissed the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
