He left a large estate, real and personal, and was considerably indebted. His will, written by himself, was dated the 29th of March 1844, and contained a single clause, which, omitting the introduction, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-7\">\u201c In the utmost confidence in my beloved wife, I leave to her all my wordly goods, to sell or keep for distribution amongst our dear children, as she may think proper. My whole estate, real and personal, are left in fee simple to her, only requesting her to make an equal distribution amongst our <em>heirs; </em>and desiring her to do for some of my faithful servants, whatever she may think will most conduce to their welfare, without regard to the interest of my heirs. Of course I wish first of all, that all my debts shall be paid. This is my only will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-8\">\u201c <em>R. </em>Harrison.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-9\">This will was duly admitted to record in the County Court of <em>Goochland; </em>and <em>Mrs. Harrison </em>qualified in that Court, as administratrix with the will annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-10\">Some doubt having arisen as to the true construction of this will, the children of <em>Randolph </em>Harrison, (the infants by their next friend,) filed their bill in the Superior Court of Law and Chancery for the County of Goochland, against <em>Mrs. Harrison </em>in her own right and as administratrix with the will annexed of <em>Randolph Harrison </em>deceased, in which they ask that their interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>under the will of their father may be ascertained and fixed by the decree of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Au\"><em>Mrs. Harrison </em>answered the bill, claiming that, under the will of her husband <em>Randolph Harrison, </em>she was entitled in absolute fee to the whole estate. The cause came on by consent to be heard at the September Term of the Court for 1844; when the Court, being of opinion that by the will of <em>Randolph Harrison </em>the whole estate was given to <em>Mrs. Harrison, </em>dismissed the bill. From this decree, the Plaintiffs obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-8\"><em>Taylor, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC\">The question involved in this cause, is the true construction of the will of <em>Randolph Harrison. </em>For the Appellants it is contended, that the widow holds the whole estate in trust for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-9\">We contend, that she takes the whole estate, free from any trust, except for the payment of debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-10\">In construing this will, it is not now to be questioned that the intention of the testator is to prevail. What, then, was his intent ? The two clauses of the will are, obviously, intended to convey the same idea; and the second is employed to express clearly, what the writer was apprehensive he had not made sufficiently explicit in the first. The second being, therefore, explanatory of the first, is to be taken as expressing his intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-11\">It is not disputed, that this second clause of the will gives the whole estate to the widow; and the only question, therefore, is, whether the words, <em>\u201c </em>only requesting,\u201d &amp;c. raise a trust for the heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-12\">The doctrine of the English Courts, relied upon by the other side, that words of recommendation, hope, request, &amp;c., where the object and the subject are certain, will raise a trust, has been regretted in that Country. It has been said, again and again, that the first case in which this doctrine was established, did not expound, but made the will. <em>Meridith </em>v. <em>Hineage, </em>2 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 271; <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>Id. 266; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>At</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>kyns, </em>1 Ves. &amp; Beame 313. And it may be said with equal truth here, and in this case, that the application of the doctrine to this will, will operate with as much inanq ag compietely defeat the intention of the tesmtor, as it did in the first case decided,</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-8\">. But however frequently this doctrine may have been acted on in <em>England, </em>I am not aware of any decision, in the Courts of the <em>United States, </em>in which it has been followed; and as the English decisions are not obligatory upon us, and as these decisions have been regretted, even by the Judges who have felt themselves constrained to follow them; I submit that this Court will not now adopt this doctrine, the manifest effect of which is to defeat the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-9\">But, it is not in all cases, where words of recommendation or request are used, that a trust will be implied. The subject and the object, it is admitted, must 'be certain. And the authorities shew, that though the words used may be precatory in form, they must be imperative in fact; and indicate the intention of the testator that the recommendation or request shall be complied with. 2 Roper on Leg. 373; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 328, \u00a7 1068, 1069, 1070; Powell on Devises, 209, note 3, 21 Law Libr. 208. Does this will, then, indicate that <em>Mrs. Harrison </em>shall have no option as to the giving the property to the children ? The testator expresses his warm affection for, and his full confidence in, his wife; he gives her his whole estate, real and personal, in fee simple; and then adds, <em>\u201c only </em>requesting her to make an equal distribution among our heirs.\u201d The word \u201c only\u201d is an important and operative word in the sentence. Not commanding, not directing, <em>only </em>requesting, &amp;c. We command, or we direct, in relation to our property; we request, in relation to the property of others; and when the testator will not command or direct, but only requests, it is impossible that this request can be considered imperative ; and the implication of a trust must be excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>But, not only is the direction not imperative, the subject is uncertain. The provision for the slaves is uncertain as to the amount. It is referred, entirely, to Mrs. <em>Harri</em>son, to select the objects, and apply the subject to their use. No limit is affixed to the amount which may be <em>J </em>appropriated to the slaves; and the testator is even careful to direct that the interest of his heirs shall not interfere with her discretion on this subject. It is impossible that a Court of Equity can fix the amount thus to be applied. The allowance which may be enough to-day, may be too little to-morrow. The objects of the bounty are referred to the knowledge and the conscience of his widow; and the mistress who knows them, is authorized, by the master who knew them, to provide for their wants. With this uncertain provision for the slaves, the subject which the children would take must, of necessity, be uncertain; and the trust, therefore, will not be raised. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Rippon, 5 </em>Mad. R. 434.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-10\">But, if the Court shall be of opinion that there is a trust for the children, then, I submit that upon the true construction of the will, the widow has a life estate in the property, with a power of sale. The testator requests her to divide the estate among \u201cour heirs.\u201d The persons taking must be heirs of both; and they cannot be ascertained until her death. <em>Nem,o est hceres viventis.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-11\"><em>Grattan, </em>for the Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGG4\">The circumstances of this case are peculiar. It is a controversy (though an amicable one) between a mother and her children. Some of these children are infants; and their interests in this large estate are now to be finally settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-12\">The first clause of this will, unquestionably, creates an express trust. The property is given to <em>Mrs. Harrison, </em>to sell or keep, for distribution among their children. If it was intended to give it to her absolutely, then, there was no necessity to say a word about her selling, or keeping it. She had full authority to do so, without an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>express provision to that effect. The words must have meaning, and none can be given them, which will not constitute a trust <em>\u2022 </em>to create which, no technical words are necessary. Lewin on Trusts, <em>24 </em>Law Libr. 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAh\">The second clause of the will is, obviously, not intended to repeal or annul the first, but to make it more explicit. The testator explains, first, what property he intends to dispose of: secondly, what estate he intends to pass to his widow. He does not manifest any change of intention towards his children, but only expresses the wish that the property may be equally divided among them; and he surely did not intend to take away the power to sell or to keep, at the discretion of his widow. The word \u201cheirs,\u201d in the second clause, must mean children, because there can be no heirs of two jointly; and if the heirs of each separately, then her heirs may be different from his. Take the two clauses together, and we have an estate in fee in the wife, in trust for the children, with a power to sell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">It is, therefore, scarcely necessary to go into an enquiry as to the force of the words \u201conly requesting.\u201d The doctrine in relation to the operation of precatory words, is clearly stated in <em>Pierson </em>v. Garnet, 2 Bro. C. C. 38, and <em>Malim </em>v. Keighley, 2 Ves. jr. 333. In this last case, the Master of the Rolls says: \u201c Wherever any person gives property, and points out the object, the property, and the way in which it shall go, that does create a trust, unless he shews clearly, that his desire expressed is to be controlled by the party; and that he shall have an option to defeat it. The word \u2018 recommend\u2019 proves desire, and does not prove discretion. If a testator shews his desire that a thing shall be done, unless there are plain express words or necessary implication, that he does not mean to take away the discretion, but intends to leave it to be defeated, the party shall be considered as acting under a trust.\u201d This doctrine has been sustained in <em>Macey </em>v. <em>Shurmer, </em>1 Atk. 389; <em>Harding </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Glyn, </em>1 Atk. 469; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Atkyns, </em>17 Ves. 255; <em>S. C. </em>19 Ves. 299; <em>S. C. </em>11 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 83; <em>Forbes </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>3 Meriv. 436; <em>Eade </em>v. <em>Eade, </em>5 Mad. R. 118; <em>Horwood </em>v. <em>West, </em>1 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 198; <em>Prevost </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>2 Mad. R. 581; <em>Cary v. Cary, 2 </em>Sch. &amp; Lef. 189; <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Parry, </em>7 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 299; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>15 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 317, though the same case is decided contra, 14 Id. 684; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>18 Ves. 475; <em>Tibbits </em>v. <em>Tibbits, </em>4 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 148; <em>Lawless </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>10 Id. 453 ; <em>Cruwys </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>9 Ves. 319; <em>Podmore </em>v. <em>Gunning, </em>7 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 505; <em>Stubbs </em>v. <em>Sargon, </em>14 Id. 507. These cases, all of them, recognise and enforce the doctrine. The Counsel on the other side has cited some authorities to shew that dissatisfaction with the doctrine has been expressed. All these authorities admit it; nor indeed can a case be found, where the subject and the object were certain, that the doctrine has not been sustained; except the old case of <em>Cunliffe </em>v. <em>Cunliffe, </em>which has been overruled times without number.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-11\">There are, indeed, a few cases, in which it was held that there was no trust; as <em>Harland </em>v. <em>Trigg, </em>1 Bro. C. C. 142; <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>Id. 179; <em>Pushman </em>v. <em>Filliter, </em>3 Ves. 7; <em>Lechmere </em>v. <em>Lavie, </em>7 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 329; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>14 Id. 684. But these cases recognise the doctrine; and they were only taken from its influence, by the want of certainty in the object or the subject of the bequest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-15\">The cases above cited, shew that the doctrine applies, where the estate is given in fee to the first taker, in the strongest terms; where the strongest confidence is expressed ; where the devisee is a wife, a mother, or a son ; and where it is expressly given to their sole and separate use. It has been the established doctrine from the time of <em>Hobart </em>to the present day; and it has been sustained by the most eminent Chancellors that ever sat in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>England. </em>If this doctrine is not law, what principle of the English law is law here ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag\">The principle is a sound one. In enquiring what is , . , , , the will of the testator, we are not to look merely to the forms of speech which he may employ, but to the obvious meaning; and whether that meaning be conveyed in the language of command, or direction, or request, or hope, or confidence, it is equally the will of the testator. The questions to be considered are, does the testator intend and expect his expressed wishes to be carried out ? Would his wishes be thwarted, if his request or hope was not attended to ? If we answer these questions affirmatively, then, whatever the form of words by which he expresses his wish, that wish is his will; and his will is the object and the end of the enquiry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-7\">What, then, was <em>Randolph Harrison\u2019s </em>will, as expressed in this paper ? I have already considered the words in the first clause, to sell or keep for distribution, &amp;c. The second clause also shews his wishes as to the manner in which his property shall be disposed of. The request is express that it may be equally divided among his children; and there is nothing here to shew that he relied for the accomplishment of this wish, upon the disposition of <em>Mrs. Harrison </em>to effect it. As said by the Master of the Rolls in <em>Malim </em>v. Keighley, this must appear positively; the presumption is against it. But in this case the proofs accord with the presumption. He directs that <em>Mrs. Harris\u00f3n </em>shall provide for some of his faithful slaves, \u201c without regard to the interest of his heirs.\u201d If he was giving the whole estate to her, what interest had his heirs ? He should have said, without regard to her interest. But he said the interest of his heirs; thereby shewing that he intended and expected that the request which he expressed, should be complied with. And I put the question: If the widow should give away the whole of the estate to strangers, can any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>one deny that it would defeat the testator\u2019s manifest intention?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-4\">But it is said that the subject is uncertain, by reason of the provision for the slaves. If this be so, then there is a resulting trust for the appellants, as heirs. Powell on Devises, 21 Law Libr. 204; <em>Wood </em>v. Cox, <em>supra; Stubbs </em>v. <em>Sargon, supra; Fowler </em>v. <em>Garlike, </em>4 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 403; <em>Morice </em>v. <em>Bishop of </em>Durham, 9 Ves. 399; <em>Leslie </em>v. Devonshire, 2 Bro. C. C. 189; <em>Vezey </em>v. Jamson, 1 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 36.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">Does the provision for the slaves, render the subject given to the children uncertain ? No more certainty is necessary in these cases of implied trust, than where the trust is express. The cases before cited prove this proposition, especially <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Cary.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-11\">Considering the provision for the slaves as a charge, if the property belongs to the widow, she is, certainly, not bound to comply with it. There is no person to demand an execution of it; and there is no amount directed to be paid. If the trust for the children is (independent of this provision,) valid, she is, for the same reasons, no more bound as trustee than in her own right, to execute this provision. As trustee, she cannot do it voluntarily, if she is not legally bound. An executor cannot pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations, or where the consideration is gaming; nor can he execute a general charitable trust. See the cases last cited, and <em>Gibbs </em>v. Rumsey, 2 Ves. &amp; B. 294.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-12\">The provision for the slaves, considered as a trust, is void. Both the object and the subject are uncertain. But the fact that this trust is void, .does not avoid the previous trust in favour of the children. They are not connected with, or dependent on, each other; and it has been decided, that, of the trusts of the same property, created by the same will, one may be good, and another void. <em>Pushman </em>v. <em>Filliter, </em>3 Ves. 7; <em>Eade </em>v. Eade, <em>5 </em>Mad. R. 118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The Counsel on the other side has cited <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Rippon, </em>5 Mad. it. 434. That case cannot rule this. There, the Court did not refuse to imply a trust in favour ^ children, because the legatee was directed to consider the church and the poor: but because the be- # A ' nefit intended to the children was uncertain. As to the children, the subject was uncertain; as to the church and the poor, both the subject and object were uncertain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-9\">But it is said, that if the will creates a trust, it also gives the estate to the widow for life. There is nothing on the face of the will indicating the gift of a life estate to the widow. It is said, indeed, that the trust is for the heirs of the testator and the widow; and as <em>nemo est hceres viventis, </em>the <em>cestuis que trust </em>cannot be known during her life. I have already shewn, I hope, that the word \u201c heirs\u201d means children, in this place ; and the argument therefore fails. I need not cite authorities to shew, that the interest passing by the will to the children, vested on the death of the testator; and as the will fixes no time for the distribution of the estate, and certainly does not expressly postpone it, the estate of the children must vest in possession at the time it vests in interest.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b21-13\"> He was related to the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b30-10\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ak\">I think it clear that by the will in question, the testator intended to confer upon his wife the ownership of his whole estate, real and personal; but not for her exclusive benefit. There is an express declaration of a trust in favour of the children of the marriage, by which they are entitled to distribution of the estate amongst them; a distribution, however, not immediate or unqualified, but subject to a power and discretion on the part of the wife, the effect of which is to limit the trust; and to enable her, at her own election, to enjoy the whole subject during her life for her own benefit. The scheme of the testator\u2019s testamentary dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>position evidently was to place his wife in his own stead, so far as regards the enjoyment of the property during her life, and the equal distribution of it amongst their children; confiding to her the like parental discretion which if living it would be his province to exercise, in making advancements to them from time to time suitable to their condition and wants; and in the ultimate allotment to them of their respective portions of the residue of the estate. The discretion is broad, but not unlimited. It authorizes her to sell the property for payment of debts, or more convenient enjoyment, advancement or <em>division; </em>or to keep it for the like purposes in kind: but it gives her no power to bestow it upon strangers, or to dispose of it unequally amongst the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">The effect of the construction contended for on the part of the children, is to entitle them to immediate distribution of the whole property, so as to deprive the widow of all discretion in regard to the periods for allotment to the children of their respective portions of the estate: and leave her destitute of all provision for her comfort and maintenance. And this, in that view, we must take to have been the testator\u2019s intent; for we cannot suppose that he contemplated her breaking through the dispositions of the will, for the purpose of obtaining the means of subsistence provided for her by law. Thus (upon that construction) while expressing for his wife the utmost love and confidence, devising to her in terms his whole estate in fee simple, and confiding to her the distribution of it amongst their children, we are to hold the testator\u2019s intent to have been to leave her penniless. Such a construction is impossible. It is against the whole spirit of the will, and unwarranted even by its letter. The distribution contemplated by the testator was a distribution not at his own death, but at that of his wife, or earlier at her option; with a perfect discretion in her as to the times, manner, amount and proportions, subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>only to the requirement of ultimate completeness and equality in the division.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">The construction contended for on the part of the w^ow^ by which she would hold absolutely for her own uge anq benefit the whole estate, real and personal, with the power of disposing of it according to her own mere will and pleasure, so as to leave the testator\u2019s children destitute, and enrich strangers to his blood and affections, I regard as equally unfounded. It is true, by one clause of the will the testator leaves to his wife all his worldly goods, doubtless meaning all his estate, real and personal; but in the same clause the purpose expressed is, \u201c to sell or beep for distribution amongst our dear children.\u201d This was surely the declaration of a trust in their favour. And though by the next clause the devise to her is of all his estate, real and personal, in fee simple, yet it is accompanied with a request, \u201c to make an equal distribution amongst our heirs.\u201d The only foundation of the widow\u2019s claim to absolute and unqualified, ownership, is the language of discretion in the first mentioned clause, and of request in the second. But the words of discretion in the first, \u201c as she may think proper,\u201d have reference to the executing, and not the defeating of the trust; and the words of request in the second, \u201conly requesting her to make an equal distribution amongst our heirs,\u201d serve but to shew that her ownership was limited merely for the purposes of the trust, and that the testator desired the distribution required by the trust should be equal. The second clause is an explanatory repetition of the first, and in no wise does it impair the trust, or enlarge the ownership of the widow to the detriment thereof. The two taken together shew it was the testator\u2019s intention that his wife should succeed him to a qualified ownership of his estate; and that their common offspring should be the joint and equal \u201c heirs\u201d or distributees of both; with a parental discretion in her to accelerate, in the whole, or in part, the periods of enjoyment by the children respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The doetrine of precatory bequests is not necessary to sustain, though it may serve to strengthen, the foregoing view of the case. Let us suppose, instead of the express declaration of trust in the first mentioned clause, the language of request had been employed therein, as well as in the second. The whole will from the end of the preamble would then have read thus: \u201cIn the utmost confidence in my beloved wife, I leave to her all my worldly goods, <em>and request her </em>to sell or keep the same for distribution amongst our dear children as she may think proper. My whole estate real and personal are left in fee simple to her, only requesting her to make an equal distribution amongst our heirs; and desiring her to do for some of my faithful servants whatever she may think will most conduce to their welfare, without regard to the interest of my heirs. Of course, I wish, first of all, that all my debts shall be paid. This is my only will.\u201d How then would the doctrine of precatory bequests have borne upon the construction of the will ?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">That doctrine (applicable to cases where there is such a testamentary disposition of property to one as is susceptible of a trust in behalf of others) is founded upon the cardinal rule in the construction of wills, that the testator\u2019s intent, when ascertained, is to be carried out, by whatever words conveyed. Hence it has come to be well settled, in such cases, that in order to effectuate the testator\u2019s intention, words of request, recommendation, or hope, may be treated as imperative ; and shall be so treated where the objects of the precatory language are certain, and the subjects contemplated are also certain ; unless a clear discretion or choice to act or not to act, be given, or the prior dispositions of the property import absolute or uncontrollable beneficial ownership. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 1068 to 1070; 2 Rop. on Leg. ch. 21, \u00a7 6; Lewin on Trusts, ch. 5, &lt;\u00a7, 2, p. 77, 81, 24 Law Libr. ; Jeremy Eq. Jurisd. Book I, ch. 1, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 2, p. 99, 102. Exceptions have been taken by some Judges and writers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>this treatment of precatory words; while, as thus limited, they recognize the doctrine as established by authority. It seems to me to be well justified by principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">Where a testamentary benefit contemplated is direct and primary, it is obvious that there is no room for a distinction between the force of peremptory and precatory words. Thus in the devise of an estate, or a tenement, or the bequest of a horse, or a sum of money, the effect is the same whether the testator employs the language of gift, grant or conveyance, or that of request, recommendation or even advice, however awkward or inappropriate any of the latter might in some cases seem. The difficulty arises where there is first a devise or bequest of the property to one, with the addition of words of request, recommendation or hope in behalf of others ; and it consists in the question whether the testator\u2019s intent is decisive in their favour, or merely suggestive or advisory to the first taker. Now, to make that question turn upon the precise intrinsic import of the very words employed, upon the supposition advanced by some, that the testator always understands clearly their true force and meaning, would involve us in verbal criticisms, and chain us down to a literal interpretation; with what success in ascertaining the testator\u2019s intention, common sense, the best and safest guide in such matters, will readily answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">A testator\u2019s desires in regard to the disposition of his property, to be collected from his will, ought not to be the less obeyed because he has confided the execution of them to another, unless it appears that he designs to subject his own wishes and expectations to the caprice or inclination of the person so entrusted. This idea is quaintly, but comprehensively and forcibly, expressed by Lord <em>Alvanly, </em>Master of the Rolls, in <em>Malim </em>v. Keighley, 2 Ves. jr. 335, where he says: <em>\u201c </em>Wherever any person gives property, and points out the object, the property and the way it shall go, that does create a trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>unless he shews clearly that his desire expressed is to be controlled by the party, and that he shall have an option to defeat it.\u201d If this were not so, I cannot doubt that the confidence of testators would often be abused, and their testamentary plans defeated. The present case may be tested by the mere question, emphatically and vividly put by the Appellants\u2019 Counsel: If the widow should give away the whole of the estate to strangers, can any one deny that it would defeat the testator\u2019s manifest intention ? The question gives the answer, and that answer is decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">In the application of the doctrine of precatory bequests, to this case, it cannot be doubted that the objects are positively certain, to wit, the children of the marriage. But it is urged that the subject is rendered uncertain by the clause in regard to the slaves, by which the testator expresses his desire that his wife shall do for some of his faithful servants whatever she may think will most conduce to their welfare, without regard to the interest of his heirs. Now, this provision, regarded as a trust, is a mere null^q it being altogether uncertain, as well in respect to the individuals, as the nature and extent of the benefit contemplated. Regarded as a power given to the wife, it is not an enlargement of her <em>estate; </em>but a charge upon, and at the same time a recognition of, the trust in favour of the children. It occasions no uncertainty as to the existence of an interest in them, but only as to the value of that interest. The power is limited to a great extent, not only by its terms, but by its very nature; and the unreasonable exercise, or abuse of it, would doubtless be restrained, by judicial authority. The uncertainty to which the authorities refer, goes to the whole subject, and bears upon the question of intention. It arises sometimes out of the vagueness of the benefit contemplated, but most usually out of the unqualified enjoyment, or unbounded discretion given by the previous dispositions of the will, so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>to render it altogether uncertain whether any thing will he left for the operation of a trust; and which, therefore, it cannot be presumed the testator intended to create. To this extent, the cases go, and no further.</p>\n<p id=\"AYE\">^he result of the foregoing views of the case is, that the widow is invested with the legal title to the whole of the testator\u2019s estate, real and personal, with the beneficial ownership thereof during her life, but in trust for the children of the marriage, at her death, subject to her powers of sale, distribution and advancement above indicated, and to her optional benefactions in behalf of some of the testator\u2019s faithful slaves by the will authorized.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b36-5\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A7D\">concurred in the opinion of <em>Baldwin, </em>ex-</p>\n<p id=\"A6b\">cept that he was of opinion the provision for the slaves was void.</p>\n<author id=\"b36-6\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ami\">was inclined to the opinion that the adjudged cases favoured the conclusion that the widow, while she had under the will, full discretion to sell and apply any part of the estate for the purpose of paying debts, took under it no beneficial interest in the residue left after the payment of debts, but was trustee thereof for the children, with power to make advancements to them at discretion : so, however, as ultimately to make the shares of each substantially equal. He, however, readily deferred to the opinions of his brethren, and acquiesced in the decree that was to be entered as the decree of the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"b36-7\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ag9\">If a testator has complete dominion over his property, and may throw it into the sea, if he so wills, I can see no reason why he may not give it absolutely to his wife. That the testator so intended in this case, I think there can be no doubt, if language can express ideas. That he did not intend she should give it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>a stranger I admit. The answer to that suggestion is, that he did not believe she would give it to any but their children. Such was his confidence in her affection for them, that he intended to place her in the situation he himself occupied as to his property and children : to give to her the control of both. The will is very short, and I think, too plain for criticism. It may be an imprudent <em>will; </em>but we cannot make wills, but construe them according to the language in which they are expressed. <em>Cujus est dare ejus est disponere. </em>I think none of the English cases cited by the bar, would justify the creating a trust for the children in a case like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">I think the decree ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The decree of the Court was as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The court is of opinion, that by the last will and testament of <em>Randolph Harrison </em>deceased, in the proceedings mentioned, his widow, <em>Henningham C. Harrison, </em>the appellee, is invested, subject to the payment of his debts, with the legal title to the whole of his estate, real and personal, and the beneficial ownership thereof during her natural life, but in trust at her death for the children of their intermarriage, who take a vested remainder therein in fee simple, to be enjoyed at her death, or earlier at her election; and that by said will she has authority to make distribution of said estate, real and personal, amongst, or advancements therefrom to, said children, with full discretion on her part as to the periods, amount and proportions, subject to the requirement of ultimate completeness and equality in the division, and to her optional benefactions in behalf of some of the testator\u2019s faithful slaves by the will authorized <em>; </em>and further, that she has power by said will to make sale of all or any of said estate, real or personal, for payment of the testator\u2019s debts, or more convenient enjoyment, advancement or division, or to keep the same for the like purposes in kind, at her discretion. The Court is, therefore, of opi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>nion, that the said decree of the said Circuit Superior Court is erroneous in declaringThat the appellee, by said will, took the whole of the testator\u2019s estate, real and personai sUkject to the payment of his debts, in absolute property, and that the appellants have no interest therein, and in making that declaration the ground of dismissing the bill of the appellants; whereas the only proper ground for such dismission was that the appellants have shewn no right to present relief: Wherefore it is decreed and ordered, that said decree of said Circuit Superior Court be reversed and annulled, with costs to the appellants. And this Court, proceeding to render such decree as said Circuit Superior Court ought to have rendered, it is declared that the rights of the parties are as above set forth: Therefore it is decreed and ordered, that the bill of the appellants be dismissed, but without costs, and without prejudice to their rights as aforesaid, or to such remedies as may hereafter accrue to them to enforce the same, and the due execution of the aforesaid trust.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
