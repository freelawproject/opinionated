What is <em>due diligence, </em>is a question proper for the determination of the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b289-11\">The assignor of a promissory note was liable to the assignee before the Statute of <em>Ann, </em>in case payment was not made by the maker, when demanded.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-16\">This was an action on the case brought by the appellees against the appellant, in the District Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Williamsburg. </em>The declaration contained three counts., The first stated that the testator Mackie, being in^ebted to pla'nt&gt;ffs in the sura of 1000/., for money laid out and advanced for his use, and being possessed of a bond of one <em>M, </em>to that amount, a conversation was had between them, See., whereupon it was agreed, that <em>Mackie </em>should assign over the said bond to the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs should receive the same, and should demand payment of the said bond from the said <em>My </em>and on failure to pay, that they should bring suit upon the said bond, and should prosecute the same in a reasonable time to judgment and execution, and that the said <em>Mackie </em>should be discharged from the sum of money then due as aforesaid ; but in case all or any part of the said bond should be undischarged on demand, and suit as-aforesaid should be prosecuted and judgment obtained and execution should thereupon be sued out, and on return thereof there should not be wherewith to satisfy the same, that then the said <em>Mackie </em>should make good the whole, or such part of the said bond as should then remain due : that in consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 promise to perform their part of the said agreement, the defendant promised to perform his part of the agreement. That the plaintiffs did demand payment of the said bond according to the tenor of the said agreement, of which they received 100/., in part thereof, and no more, and on refusal to pay the balance, they had in a reasonable time brought, suit upon the said bond, recovered a judgment, and sued out an execution in due form of law, on which execution, it was returned, that there were not effects wherewith to satisfy the said debt, and that the plaintiffs have discharged the said <em>Mackie </em>from the debt first due. 2d. count, that the said <em>Mackie </em>being indebted to the plaintiffs in another sum of 1000/., did in consideration that the plaintiffs would release him from the said debt, assign to them another bond for the same amount due from one <em>M, </em>which assignment was made according to the Act of Assembly in that case nrtEtde, See., whereby the defendant became liable on default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>of the said M, to pay the plaintiffs all such sums of money as. should remain due on the said bond ; the breach is, that the said bond except 100i. is yet due, and that the plaintiffs are unable to recover the same, and the defendant being so answerable, did assume to pay the plaintiffs the balance of the said bond yet due. 3d count for money had and received to the use of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-4\">Upon the pleas of <em>non </em>assumpsit, and the Act of Limitations, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the Court, <em>\u201c </em>whether an action can be maintained against the indorsor of a bond, or his executors, without any special undertaking on his part to insure the payment thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">Judgment for the plaintiffs in the District Court, from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-6\">Washington, argued the cause for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\">I am not concerned in this cause; but as it involves a question which may arise in another case before the Court, in which I am engaged, I will beg leave now to state my sentiments upon the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-8\">I shall consider the question generally, whether the assignor of a bond, without a special contract, is liable, in case of inability in the obligor to pay ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-9\">The material grounds of the action of <em>assumpsit </em>arising from an implication of law are, 1st, To recover back money paid under a mistake, or through deceit. 2dly, To recover money paid for a consideration which happens to fail. 3dly, To recover money paid to one acting under a void authority. 4thly, For money obtained by extortion, ike. 5thly, For money embezzled, of which a person has been defrauded by cheating, and 6thly, For money received on a judgment which is afterwards reversed. If the present question can be brought within the principle of any of these cases, it must be the second.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-10\">. I shall here make a concession, which will at once shew the full extent of the application which, I suppose, may be made of the principle authorised under this head. If the assignor have no interest in the thing assigned, as if he be not entitled to the bond, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>if the same hath been before satisfied, whether with, or without his knowledge; I will not question his liability in this form of action; for in either of those cases, there is a <em>total failure of the consideration. </em>He receives a consideration upon the avowed sale of something, namely a debt due, when in fact, there is no debt due at all, or if due, he has no title whatever to receive, or to dispose of it. So, if a man sell any other chattel, to which he has no title, this action will lie to recover back the money paid for it, upon the principle, that the consideration had failed. The reason is, that in all sales of personal property, there is an implied contract on the part of the vendor, that he has a right to make the sale, and for a breach of this implied contract <em>assumpsit </em>to recover back what was paid will lie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">But the implied contract goes no farther. If the assignor have a title to the debt of which the bond is the evidence, there is at the time, an existing, and valid consideration given. A future diminution or loss of the debt, can never upon any principle relate back to the contract, so as to destroy it, any more, than the subsequent death of a horse would, or the burning of a house in the possession of the vendee. I will go farther, and admit, that if the assignor be guilty of fraud, as by mistating the circumstances of the obligor, or even by concealing them, (if known to him,) he might be liable : not because the consideration had failed, but on account of the fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-11\">There is certainly no ground to create an implied <em>assumpsit </em>that the assignor will pay, if the obligor cannot. An implication of this sort must be a necessary one, or such as grows essentially out of the justice of the case. If the consideration fail, it is a just and natural implication that the money shall be repaid ; but if it turn out to be less valuable than the vendee or assignee supposed, (the vendor being clear of fraud,) it is only an unfortunate speculation, which the vendee must bear. Such an implication is inadmissible on another ground ; because it being in the power of the parties to stipulate for such a responsibility, their si<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>lence on the subject is strong evidence that it was not intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-3\">Bonds are as much articles of traffic as any other personal property; their value depends upon the ability of the obligors of pay, and of the assignee to wait for his money. They never command their nominal amount. Consequently, in bargains of this kind, the purchaser will inform himself of all those, circumstances which may enable him to decide upon the value of the bond ; if he deceive himself, he has no person to blame. If the obligor be able to pay at the time of the assignment, but from an unexpected accident become afterwards disabled, ought the loss to fall upon the assignor, who, if he had retained the bond, might in some way have got satisfied ? If the assignor can be made liable under an implied <em>assump</em>sit, in case the obligor cannot, with equal propriety, would he be liable in case the obligor <em>would not </em>pay, and this would assimilate the case of bonds to bills of exchange, without the custom which regulates this liability in the latter case, as I shall presently shew.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-4\">There is a much stronger reason, why the assignor of a debt not legally transferable, should in such an event be made liable, than in a case of this sort; for in that, it might with some plausibility be contended, that since the debt couldnot be sold, or transferred, the assignment, which must be construed to mean something, could only mean <em>that the assignee should receive the money. </em>But the assignment of a bond being necessary to transfer a <em>legal right to the </em>money, its use is apparent, and leaves no room for presumption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">I have thought proper to consider this question upon common law principles, before I notice those cases which may seem to have an influence upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">As there are two instances, in which the assignor of a negotiable paper may be made liable in default of payment, they must be noticed and examined; these are the cases of bills of exchange, and of promissory notes. The right of recovery in the first is created, not by the common law, but by the <em>custom of merchants </em>\u2014 the commonlaw only provides the remedy. An implied contract between the assignee and the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>signor is created by the <em>law of merchants, </em>which when once established, brings the case within those common law principles where the action of <em>assumpsit </em>is warranted. By the very act of drawing, a man, <em>by the mercantile law, </em>is understood impliedly to engage, not only with the payee, but with every subsequent holder, that the drawee is to be found at the place at which he is described to be, that if the bill be duly presented, he will accept it, and when due, that he will pay it, if presented in proper time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-8\">In default of any of these particulars, his implied contract is broken; and if the holder perform the implied conditions on his part, the drawer is liable. But what law, what custom has sanctioned the presumption of a like implied contract in the case of bonds? And without such a supposed engagement, there is no common law principle to warrant a recovery. The law of merchants is in commercial matters, what municipal Jaw is in the common transactions amongst men. We cannot fairly reason from cases governed entirely by that law, to others not under its influence. As to promissory notes, the right of recovery against the indorser is expressly given by the Statute of 3d and 4th <em>Ann. </em>c. 9, and from this provision, an invincible argument is to be drawn in favour of my, position ; for if in a commercial country, like <em>England, </em>it was necessary for the Legislature to provide a remedy against the indorser of a promissory note, it is obvious that no such right existed-at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-9\">Another, and a stil! stronger argument to prove the same conclusion is furnished by our laws. The Act of 1748, in express terms, provides a remedy against the drawer or indorser of a bill of exchange; \u2014 authorizes the assignment of bonds and notes of hand; and yet is silent as to the liability of the assignor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-10\">The same subject is taken up in the revision of the laws, but a few years past; the importance of this sort of negociation was better understood; the Statute of <em>Ann </em>was before the Legislature; to prove that Legislative aid was necessary to produce this liability, and yet no such provision was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-11\">I hold it that Legislative interference is necessary; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>that if bonds are in this respect to be likened to bills of exchange, some system should be established similar to that <em>enacted </em>(if I may use the expression) by the law of merchants. For I would ask, upon what conditions, and at what time is this responsibility to commence? When does the action accrue? Is a demand and a refusal sufficient? Must there be a judgment and execution; must there be an actual insolvency in the obligor, proved, or will a return of <em>nulla bona </em>suffice?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-3\">If the Court determine that the assignor is liable, there will be a necessity, to complete the system, that all these points be fixed; for else, the difficulties which attend this question will be rather increased than diminished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-4\">The mercantile law respecting bills of exchange is perfect upon this subject; the drawer or indorser is liable, but upon certain conditions; the bill must be duly presented, then protested, and afterwards, notice thereof given immediately to the persons who are to be charged, which gives them an opportunity to save themselves. If we adopt the same principle, it behoves us to borrow the same regulations; and the question is, if this be the work of a legislative, or of a judicial body? I think it cannot belong to the latter.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-5\">Wickham, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-6\">The Act of Assembly, by authorizing the assignment of bonds, does in effect put them upon the footing of other negotiable papers, except in one particular instance, which is specially provided for; I mean the right of the obligor to discount against the assignee payments made to the obligee before notice of the assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-7\">It is admitted, that in the case of a bill of exchange, the indorser is liable; but it is contended, that this is by the. custom of merchants. I believe no case can be produced to support this idea. For in the action against the drawer, it is not necessary to set out the custom, as it is in an action against the acceptor, 3 <em>Bac. Ab* </em>614, The custom of merchants regulates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the steps necessary for the holder to pursue, and an-conditions which, if not performed, may <em>defeat </em>his right to recover. But the <em>right itself </em>is founded jn common law principles. The indorser sells to the indorsee, <em>the </em>money, of which the bond is but the evidence, and impliedly undertakes that it shall be paid; if not, that then he will make it good. The assignment, <em>like </em>an order drawn, is evidence of so much due from the assignor, in case the money is not paid by the obligor, or drawee. The assignment of a bond is in the nature of an order drawn by the creditor upon his debtor, directing him to pay to the assignee the contents of the bond, with this single difference; that if it had been an independent order, not transferring at the same time a right to the <em>evidence </em>of the debt, as well as to the debt itself, a <em>demand </em>upon the drawee <em>and his </em>refusal, would entitle the payee to recover of the drawer; for without acceptance, the payee could maintain no action against the drawee. But the assignment of the bond itself, conveying not only a right to the debt, but a legal right to <em>sue, </em>the assignee ought to pursue the obligor as far as he can, before he resorts back to the assignor, because such would naturally be the understanding of the parties at the time of the transfer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\">When bonds are indorsed for valuable consideration, it is always to be presumed, that a precedent debt was intended to be thereby discharged. That they may sometimes be sold, I shall not dispute, but there are so many cogent reasons against such a traffic, that it is never to be presumed, unless the contrary appear. A bond is but the evidence, or representative of <em>money, </em>and therefore may properly discharge a preexisting debt. This was undoubtedly the use which the Legislature supposed\" would be made of bonds, when assignments of them were permitted. It was never contemplated, that they were to become a subject of speculation. If a bond be assigned in consideration of a precedent debt, it will be admitted that the debt is not thereby discharged, without a special agreement for that purpose. The reason of this will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>apply with considerable force, even to the case of bonds actually sold. It is <em>thq payment </em>of the money, not the bare assignment, which forms the considera\u00bb tion in either case; if the money be not paid, the consideration fails, as completely as if no such debt had in truth existed. Where is the difference to the assignee? ' The question in substance is always the same, namely, has the assignee received the consideration for which he paid his money? For unless he has, the vendor cannot <em>ex oequo et bono </em>retain w'hat he has received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-3\">This case is assimilated, (though I think not very aptly,) to that of the sale of personal property. But admit the likeness for a moment, and the argument on the other side will not be thereby strengthened. One man then sells to another a horse, or so many bushels of wheat in the possession of a third person, and sends an order for the delivery; the person on whom the order is drawn, has the property actually in possession, but afterwards sells it, destroys it, or refuses to deliver it up. Will not the vendor be liable, upon his implied contract, not only that the property was his, and in existence, but also that the holder would deliver it on demand? Such is the nature of an assignment of a bond, which in truth is the mere transfer of so much money of the assignor\u2019s lying in the hands of the obligor; it is not the sale of the paper and wax, for that might have been sold without the aid of the Legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-4\">. No argument of weight can be drawn from the Statute of <em>Ann, </em>the professed object of which was to assimilate promissory notes to bills of exchange; to ascertain the time, and terms of the indorser\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">The argument, that an implied agreement on the pqjt of the assignor, cannot be presumed, because the parties might have expressed it, proves too much; for it would defeat such an implication, in cases where it is admitted to exist; such as the implied warranty upon the sale of personal property; and in cases, where the consideration happening to fail, a promise to repay the money is implied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>As to the difficulties apprehended by the counsel for the appellant, they are not insurmountable. It is not necessary for the Court to specify, at what period, or upon what conditions, the remedy against the assignor may be pursued. It is sufficient, if it be laid down, that <em>due diligence </em>to recover the money from the obligor must be used, and what is <em>due </em>diligence, must always be a fact fit for the determination of a jury, upon the whole evidence submitted to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-10\">Randolph, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-11\">I shall endeavour to shew, that the liability of the assignor is founded in common law principles. The examples of implied <em>assumpsits </em>mentioned by Mr. <em>Washington </em>are entirely correct, but I cannot perceive why they were enumerated, unless for the purpose of diverting our attention from a <em>general </em>principle, not coming literally within either of those mentioned by him, but which must decide this question. This principle is laid down by Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in the case of <em>Moses </em>v. <em>M-Far lane, </em>2 <em>Burr. </em>1008, in answer to an objection against the defendants being obliged to refund money, which he had improperly recovered in an adversary suit. I will quote his words: \u201cIf the defendant be under an obligation, from the ties of natural justice, to refund, the law implies a debt, and gives this action, founded in the equity of the plaintiff\u2019s case, <em>as it were upon a </em>contract.\u201d Again, he lays it down, that this action will lie, if in conscience and justice the defendant ought not to keep the <em>money. </em>Now for the application of the principle : if the debt had not been due to the assignor, it is admitted that he would have been liable. Why? Because the consideration having failed, the assignor <em>ex cequo et bono </em>ought not to keep what he had received, and he is presumed to have contracted to refund it. But is the situation of the assignee better, or is his equity less cogent, if the obligor be unable to pay? In both cases, he loses the thing purchased, and paid for, <em>and consequently, </em>in both, the consideration has failed. Nor is the situation of the assignor made worse, so as to create in him an equity, strong enough to repel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>that of the assignee; for the debt might as well have been lost in the hands of the former, as of the latter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-3\">The only difference between the assignment of bonds in <em>England, </em>and in this country, is, that in the former, the right to <em>sue </em>in the name of the assignee is not transferred, and therefore it is accompanied with a pov. er of attorney. If the money cannot be recovered, it is not questioned but that the assignor is liable, whether he <em>sold the </em>claim, or <em>paid it away in discharge of a precedent debt. </em>And why is he not equally liable, where by the assignment he puts it in the power of the assignee to use his own name, instead of that of the assignor?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-4\">It is supposed that we must seek to shelter ourselves under the likeness which bonds, when assigned, bear to bills or statutary notes. I disclaim the comparison, and shall consider this case as standing upon the same ground as notes of hand did before the Statute of <em>Ann. </em>It is not true that the right of recovery against the indorser was created by that Statute ; for prior thereto the assignee had only to demand the money from the drawer of the note, and on refusal he was at liberty instantly to sue the indorser, <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>1 <em>Ld. Ray. </em>443. It may possibly be said, that notes were within the custom of merchants as well as bills | but this is not the case, <em>Kyd on Bills, </em>12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">I do not consider it necessary that a suit should be brought at all against the obligor; for if upon demand he refuse to pay, the assignee may pursue his remedy against the assignor, as in the case of promissory notes at common law. It is like the case of a covenant to make a good title to lands, where, if it be not in the power of the vendor to do it, the vendee may sue immediately upon the covenant, without waiting the issue of a previous suit to try the title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">Many difficulties have been suggested, and thrown into our way, which, though they may embarrass us, can never change well established principles. I will attempt to answer them, though it is certainly not necessary. What is the degree of diligence which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>assignee is to use, in demanding, or, (if a suit be nein suing for the money? The answer is, that the jury will always determine that question upon the circumstances of each case; there are a variety of instances in which the law has determined what is convenient time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-6\">It is asked, can all the assignors be sued, separately or together? I think they cannot. There is a privity of contract between the assignor and his immediate assignee, and consequently, the latter can go no farther back. It is like the case of a warranty, where the covenant can extend only to the parties immediately contracting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">Washington, in reply. \u2014 -The argument, that the plaintiff may recover where the defendant has received money, which <em>ex aequo et bono </em>he ought not to retain, may prove any thing, or nothing, in this case. In the application of it, the counsel are compelled first to beg the question. Is the assignor bound in conscience to refund? If the consideration has <em>failed, </em>he is; but if a <em>real consideration were given, </em>he is not. It is contended, that the consideration has failed, and so it would have done, if it had been a sale of a horse, which instantly after died. If the thing sold had a real existence, and the vendor had a right to sell, the subsequent loss of the debt could no more bind the conscience of the assignor, than it would that of the vendor of a horse in the case supposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-8\">The assignment is resembled to an order upon the obligor to pay. The likeness might be more easily discerned, if it were the case of a paper <em>not negotiable? </em>for then, it could only be construed as a direction how the money should be paid. But being assignable, the obligee sells his right to the bond, in the same manner as he might dispose of his right to any personal chattel whatever; the implied contract is the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-9\">The case of <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>as reported in <em>Salk. </em>127 \u2014 12 <em>Mod. </em>24.4, and <em>Holt\u2019s Rep. </em>117, appears to have been that of a bill of exchange. So that nothing can be thence inferred to do away the strong presump tion to be drawn from the Statute of <em>Ann, </em>namely., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>that legislative aid was necessary to subject the endorser.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b301-3\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABX\">This is an action on the case, brought by the assignee of a bond, to recover of his immediate assignor, compensation on account of the non-payment of the bond by the obligor. The first count states a special agreement of the assignor to be liable on failure of payment. The second states the liability, as a legal inference from the assignment for valuable consideration, and the non-payment by the obligor. The third count is for money had and received. But the case as stated by the jury, allows no ground to presume a special agreement, and therefore, we must decide this as a general question. That question is, whether an action can be maintained against the assignor of a bond, without a particular undertaking on his part to insure the payment ? That due diligence was used by the appellees to recover the money from the obligor, is admitted by the verdict, and therefore, this circumstance will be considered as forming a part of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In the cases of bills of exchange, it is admitted on all hands, that an action will lie against the drawer or indorser, if payment be not made by the dra-.vee; but it is contended, by the counsel for the appellant, that this arises out of the custom of merchants. As against the acceptor, the argument is correct. He undertakes to pay the debt of another, and consequently, can only be charged in a special action on the case, founded upon the custom of merchants. But against the drawer, or indorser, <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will lie, because the draft in itself imports a debt to be due. Promissory notes stand in the same situation, the indorser being considered as a drawer. It is on account of the privity between the indorsee and the indorser, that this action may be maintained. The action is not founded on the bill or note, but upon the implied undertaking, and the bill or note, is evidence only of that undertaking. These principles owe their existence, not to the custom of merchants, but to the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"AWIC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Let us pursue these principles, and they will give light to the further \u2019nvestigation of this question, The case of promissory notes will be an important guide, aiJ\u00bf therefore it will be proper to see how they stood previous to the Statute which it is supposed created the liability of the indorser of them. <em>Lambert v. Oakes, </em>is most correctly reported in <em>Ld. Raym. </em>443, as the observations made by <em>Kyd </em>in his treaties on bills of exchange, page 109, incontestably prove. This case was decided antecedent to the Statute of <em>Ann, </em>and was consequently governed by the principles of the common law. It was there determined by lord <em>Holt, </em>that the indorsee of a promissory note might recover against the indorser, if paj merit of the note had been demanded and refused. It would seem as if this case decided the question. Bonds in <em>England </em>are not assignable, and therefore stand in the same situation as notes of hand did at the time when this case was determined. I can see no reason why the assignor of a bond should not be liable in the same manner, even in that country, though I do not at present recollect any such case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In this country, the assignee of a bond acquires. a legal right to bring suit upon it, and to receive the money, discharged from any controul of the assignor over the subject; it is therefore bis duty to bring suit. The assignment does in itself import a debt due to the assignee; and.there is the same privity of contract between the two parties, as exists in the cases of bills and notes. They are all governed by the same common law principle, and conseouently <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will lie in this country against the assignor of a bond, in the same manner as it will in <em>England </em>against the indorser of a bill or note. The object of our law was not to defeat this common law remedy, but merely to give a right to the assignee to sue in his own name, which otherwise he could not have done\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"ALoE\">The same common law principle will extend much farther than the case now before the Court. I have no doubt but that it will reach the case of a transfer of a bond without an assignment, and that the tons<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>feree having used due diligence to recover the money, may maintain an action against the person from whom he obtained it, for money had and received; the assignor can defend himself only by an express stipulation to the contrary. In the case of bills transferred'by delivery only, it is laid down in 1 Ld. <em>liaym. </em>442, that the person making the transfer ceases to be a party to the bill; that it is a sale, and the seller not bound to refund, if the bill be not paid. But <em>Kyd </em>in his treatise on bills of exchange, page 60, very properly observes, \u201c that this is only true in the case of a demand by a subsequent party, when several have intervened between him and the person against whom the demand is made ; it can never apply as between the immediate parties to the transfer; for though the person who has given she money for the bill or note cannot recover against the person who received it, as indorser, he may recover in an action for money had and received for his use,jas the tvanferer must be understood to undertake for the bill being duly paid.5\u2019 This is certainly sound doctrine. I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Carrington J. \u2014 Independent of those principles of the common law which create, on the part of the assignor of a bond, an implied undertaking to pay, if the obligor does not, the general understanding of those who enter into negociations of this sort would be sufficient to. make the assignor liable. The assignee purchases principally upon the credit of the person from whom he receives the bond. He is not always acquainted with the obligor, or with his circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The difficulties which were mentioned at the bar are not insurmountable. Whether due diligence had been used by the assignee to recover against the obligor, would necessarily be a matter in issue between the parties, and would upon all the circumstances of the case be decided by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">As to the extent of the assignor\u2019s liability, I think it can only reach the sum actually received, in case the obligor is able to prove it. If he cannot do this, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>to be presumed that he received an equal sum with due upon the bond. If incautiously, the consideration actually received be not stated in the assignment, and it can no otherwise be proved, a Court of Equity is open to the assignor, and he may there seek a discovery of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">As to the lengths which it behoves the assignee to go in pursuit of the obligor before he can resort to the assignor, it is unnecessary to lay down any general rule; it may suffice to say, that in the present case, he went far enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Lyons J. \u2014 There is in this case, but a single question propounded by the jury ; which is, can the assignee of a bond maintain an action against the assignor, without a special undertaking by the latter to insure the payment ? No facts, or circumstances, are stated, from which it can be presumed that the assignment was conditional, or that it was such, as in any manner to discharge the assignor from all recourse against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">To get at the real point in this and similar questions, we should first settle, what is the essence of the contract which the parties enter into? what is it that is disposed of by the one, and acquired by the other ?</p>\n<p id=\"AD-m\">In the sale of lands, the vendee purchases soil, not parchment. If it be a bill of exchange, a note of hand, or bond, it is <em>money </em>in the hands of a third person, which is given in exchange by the person to whom it belongs, for another sum of money, or for something else which he deems equally valuable, <em>Tht paper, </em>is only the evidence of his right, and in itself has no intrinsic worth. In this case, we are to presume, that a full consideration was given, which could not have been for the paper and wax, but for the money, which the bond imports to belong to the assignor. If a full consideration had not been paid, that might have been a circumstance, from which the jury might have inferred a special agreement on the part of the assignee, to take the bond vvithout recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The right of the assignee to resort back to him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>whom he acquired the bond, is bottomed upon principles of common law. There is an implied agreement by the assignor, that the money which he sells, and for which he receives an equivalent, shall be received by the purchaser, as much so, as if any personal property whatever were the subject of the contract. There is no reason why an implied warranty should not exist in the sale of bonds, as well as in the sale of other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">If this.right then existed antecedent to the Apt of 1748, which made bonds assignable, how is it affected by that law ? New rights are acquired under it, and the inconveniencies of the common law', which obliged the assignee to use the name of the assignor, are removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">But this is obviously intended for the benefit of the assignee, and cannot be construed, consistently with the spirit of the law, to deprive him of pre existing rights. The Legislature could not mean to provide him with a new remedy, and at the same time to lessen the security which he before enjoyed, nor does such a consequence grow out of the law. It was strongly insisted upon at the bar, that such a conclusion was fairly to be made, because a remedy against the assignor was not given. The answer to this is, that it was not necessary 5. and since it is not expressly-taken away, it still continues to exist as it did before the Statute was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that the assignor is liable, unless there be soipe special circumstances to shew that it was not so intended by the parties, at the time the assignment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Judgment affirmed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">(1) <em>M' Williams </em>v. <em>Smith, Wood </em>v. <em>Luttrel, ex.
