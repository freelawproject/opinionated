And it is not competent for a Court of Equity to enjoin a judgment obtained against him for the purchase money, on the ground of defect of title to the property at the time of the purchase.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\">In 1839, a suit was instituted in the Superior Court of Law and Chancery for the county of <em>Harrison, </em>by one of the heirs of <em>Patsy Threlkeld, </em>against the other heirs, some of whom were infants, asking for the sale of a small tract of land to which they were jointly entitled, on the ground that the share of each was not worth more than 300 dollars ; and that the land could not be divided without injury to the parties interested. The other heirs answered, (the infants by a guardian <em>ad li</em>tem,) concurring in the prayer for a sale of the land; and the cause coming on to be heard, the Court appointed a commissioner to make the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">The commissioner afterwards reported that he had sold the land to <em>John C. Campbell, </em>for 629 dollars; and had taken his three bonds for 209 dollars 66| cents each, payable in six, twelve, and eighteen months from their date. This report was confirmed by the Court, and another commissioner was directed to collect the purchase money as it fell due, and divide it among the parties entitled, according to their respective interests.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-7\"><em>Campbell, </em>the purchaser, paid the first two bonds, and a part of the third; but failing to pay the balance, a suit was instituted against him, upon the bond, and a judgment obtained; and then he obtained from one of the Judges of the General Court an injunction to restrain the enforcement of the judgment, on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the title to the land was defective, and there was a lien upon it to a small amount for purchase money due from a former purchaser of a part of the land, of which he had no notice at the time of the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-4\">The heirs of <em>Patsy Threlkeld, </em>answered, expressing their ignorance as to any defects in the title to the land; and stating that their ancestor, as well as themselves, and <em>Campbell, </em>had never been disturbed in their possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">The cause came on for hearing on the 9th day of June 1843, when the Court made a decree, that upon the defendants, or some one for them, executing and filing with the clerk of the Court, bond with good security in the penalty of 100 dollars, payable to the complainant, and conditioned to indemnify and save him harmless from all incumbrances upon, and all defects in the title to the tract of land in the bill mentioned, the injunction awarded the plaintiif, should be and stand dissolved as an act of that day, but without damages; and that the complainant should be allowed his costs, to be retained out of the unpaid purchase money in his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">From this decree, the defendants obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-11\"><em>Lee, </em>for the appellants, and <em>William Harrison, </em>for the appellee, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b219-12\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AuB\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">The Court is of opinion, that the appellee having purchased the land in the proceedings mentioned at a judicial sale thereof, could only have obtained relief, if to any entitled, because of the matters stated in his bill, by resisting the confirmation of said sale in the cause wherein the decree directing it was <em>rendered; </em>and that it was not competent for the said Circuit Superior Court to give him relief by way of injunction to a judgment on a bond executed by him to the commissioner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Court, on the ground of any <em>defects of title </em>to the property existing at the time of his said purchase. The Court is therefore of opinion, that the said Circuit Superior Court erred in not dissolving, wholly and unconditionally, the injunction which had been granted to the appellee. Wherefore it is decreed and ordered, that the said decree of said Circuit Superior Court be reversed and annulled, with costs to appellants. And this Court proceeding to render such decree as the said Circuit Superior Court ought to have rendered, it is further decreed and ordered, that said injunction be wholly and unconditionally dissolved, and the plaintiff\u2019s bill dismissed; and that the defendants recover against him their costs by them about their defence in the said Circuit Superior Court expended.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
