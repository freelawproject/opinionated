The draught of a new will was presented by <em>Ferguson </em>to <em>John </em>Cogbill, who read it more than once, and approved of it-Some difficulty arising with respect to a mortgage or deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of trust which <em>John Cogbill </em>had upon the lands of his brether <em>Jesse </em>Cogbill, of which nothing had been said in the will; he requested Mr. <em>Ferguson </em>to write a release to the heirs of <em>Jesse Cogbill; </em>and as soon as that should be done, he would execute his will. This release was to be written on a separate piece of paper. <em>Ferguson wrote </em>the release and shewed it to the testator: he read it, and approved of the contents ; but, being interlined, he asked <em>Ferguson to </em>copy it. Before a copy was made, <em>Cogbill </em>sent for the release : <em>Fergus'on </em>completed the copy and carried it to him, but found him in a state of delirium, from which he never recovered; but when he requested the will and release to be written, he was in good health, and perfectly in his senses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-4\">The <em>instructions </em>for a will were delivered to <em>Ferguson </em>by <em>Cogbill </em>(as before stated) about seven or eight months before his death; the <em>draught of the nerv will </em>was prepared and put into his hands about two months before that event j and, about a fortnight preceding it, <em>Ferguson </em>called to see him, when he asked if the release was finished. On being answered in the negative, he expressed an anxiety that it should be done, that he might sign the will. When <em>Ferguson </em>wrote the draught of a new will, he retained the paper or memorandum, (the subject of this controversy,) which was never out of his possession till after <em>John CogbilPs </em>death. <em>' </em>The original will and draught were delivered to <em>Cogbill; </em>during whose last illness, <em>Ferguson </em>meeting with a friend of the deceased, <em>(Edward </em>Archer,) at his house, (whom <em>Cogbill </em>had sent for, as the witness understood,) and finding his papers lying in a trunk and closet, exposed to his negroes, of whom only his family consisted,' <em>Ferguson </em>took the original will out of a small red trunk, and the draught from the top of a book in the closet, and delivered them to Archer, to preserve, and that <em>Cogbill </em>might execute the draught if he got well enough. <em>Cogbill </em>'dying without having executed the draught, <em>Archer </em>returned these papers to <em>Ferguson </em>after <em>CogbilPs </em>death, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>be put into the hands of an attorney. He accordingly delivered them to <em>Archibald AT Rae, </em>Esquire, by whom they were exhibited to <em>Chesterfield </em>County Court, where the witness was examined concerning them. He was positive as to the identity of the papers, which he has never seen since, and undertands that the draught has been lost. <em>Ferguson, </em>on further examination, stated, that, after writing the formal parts of the will according to the original, and omitting that part which related to <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill, </em>he pursued the words of the paper or memorandum <em>verbatim.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\"><em>Edward Archer </em>was sent for by <em>Cogbill, </em>and was at his house about ten or fourteen days before his death, when he said that he expected <em>Ferguson </em>there with the release; that-he was anxious to.sign the <em>release </em>first, and then he would sign his <em>will; </em>that <em>Ferguson </em>had written his will, and that he was satisfied with it; but that he wished first to release the mortgage for the benefit of <em>Jesse CogbilPs estate. </em>This witness proved that the memorandum was wholly in the hand-writing of <em>Cogbill, </em>(as did several others,) and confirmed the statement of <em>Ferguson </em>as to the delivery of the original will and draught to him, during the last illness of <em>Cogbill, </em>for preservation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-8\"><em>Archibald MiRae, </em>who was counsel for <em>Sally Nelson Cogbill, </em>in the County Court of <em>Chesterfield, </em>stated that h\u00ab received the original will, the memorandum, and draught of a new will, from <em>Ferguson ; </em>that the draught was said to have been written conformably to the original will and memorandum, which last was particularly insisted on, as a good codicil to the original will, and sufficient to pass the personal estate; that all the papers were sent up from the bar to the Court; but the draught being considered as mere waste paper, no attention was paid to it, and he had never seen it since ; but had understood that it had been Tost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\" <em>Hill Cogbill, </em>(one of the appellants from the County Court, and who stood as an appellee in this Court in consequence of an omission by the clerk of the District Court to record in his <em>order-book </em>th'e dismission of th\u00e9 appeal aS to him, although it was entered on the <em>minutes,j </em>being called as a witness\u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-8\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJe\"><em>objected to the </em>introduction of this witness, because, being a party in the cause, he was liable for costs; and,- if he were received as a witness^ he would come to relieve himself. Besides, he was one of the persons entitled to the lapsed devise, in case the memorandum should not be established as a codicil. It is true the record says, that <em>Hill Cogbill </em>released all his interest in the personal estate mentioned in the codicil\u2022 but he is <em>not a legatee </em>in the codicil, and, therefore, had no interest to release under it.

As to the other objection, that he is a party in the suit, it is not a fact. By his own voluntary act, in open Court, and with the assent of the other appellants, the appeal was dismissed as to him in the District Court. The dismission was without any costs; but, even if it had been <em>with costs, </em>he might have paid them, and then there could have been no question as to his admissibility,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-10\"><em>Wiokham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdEY\">There are two grounds, on which <em>Hill Cogbill </em>is <em>not </em>a competent witness. <em>First, </em>He is a party appellee, and liable for costs. He cannot, by his own act, release himself from those costs. <em>We </em>must make the release, before he can be exonerated. <em>Secondly. </em>He is disqualified in point of interest. Even if no costs were reeoyerable, he would, not be a competent witness, being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>party in the cause. <em>We </em>claim the legacy, which would, otherwise, be lapsed by the death of <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill </em>in the life-time of the testator, under the <em>codicil: he </em>claims as <em>distributee. Hill CoghilPs </em>offering to be a witness for the other appellees, is like the case of two joint-partners coming into Court, and the one offering to be a witness for the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-6\">The District Court having adjourned, <em>Hay </em>suggested the propriety of continuing the cause, in order that that Court might at the- next term, correct the error in the entry, and make the <em>order-book </em>to conform to the <em>minutes; </em>\u00a9r, that a <em>certiorari </em>might be immediately awarded to bring up a more complete record, and to correct the error ef the clerk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-7\">This was opposed on the other side, on the ground that the case of <em>Vaughan and Field </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>had fully settled the point that a District Court, at a subsequent term, had no power to alter or amend the records in the <em>order-</em>book, even from the minutes.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Judge Tucker, expressed no positive opinion as to the propriety of continuing the cause, for the purpose of introducing the amendment in the order-book of the District Court; though he seemed not fully satisfied with the decision in the case of <em>Vaughan and Field </em>v. <em>Freeland; </em>but he was of op nion, that a <em>certiorari </em>might be awarded, to bring up both the minute-book and order-book, for the purpose of correcting the error of the clerk, in omitting part of the entry in his minute-book in his order-book. He thought, that by depositing a sufficient sum of money to cover the costs, the witness might be admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-8\">Judge Roane was clearly of opinion that the order-;, book was alone to be relied <em>on; </em>which was <em>conclusive </em>to shew that <em>Hill Cogbill </em>was not a competent witness. There are two grounds of'objection to his admissibility: his being liable to costs, as being a party in the cause, and his interest, as a distributee, in setting aside the codicil. If we go by the minute-book of the clerk of the District Court, there will be one result; if by the order-book, another. In the former it appears that the appeal was dismissed as to him; but in the latter, he is still continued a party, and so remains in this Court. It has been decided in the case of <em>Vaughan and Field </em>v. Freeland, and correctly decided, that the <em>order-book </em>is alone to be looked into, as containing the records of the proceedings of the District Courts; and the distinction was then properly taken between the records of a County Court, which are drawn up by the clerk in his office, from the minutes taken in Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>and the records of a District Court, which are drawn up during the time, read in open Court, and signed on the next day by the Judge, We must look for <em>certainty </em>in the records some <em>where; </em>and where can we so readily expect to find it, as in the order-book, deliberately signed by the Judge? Does it appear to us that this gentleman is a party in the cause? He certainly <em>is aparty appellee; </em>for we have no proper <em>data </em>to go by, to assure us that he has ever been discharged in the District Court. The question then occurs, whether a <em>party </em>on the record can be a <em>witness. </em>Although he may release his own <em>interest </em>in the controversy, he cannot by his own act get rid of his liability for the costs, to his adversa* ry, and, therefore, cannot be a competent witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-4\">Judge Fleming was of the same opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\"><em>The Court gave the counsel for the appellees time, until the next day, to look into the </em>authorities, <em>to see whether, in any case, a person in the situation of </em>Hill Cogbill, <em>had been restored to his competency so ds to be introduced as a witness in the cause.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\"><em>Randolph, </em>as to the competency of <em>Hill Cogbill </em>as a witness, contended that he might now qualify himself. Suppose, in the County Court, instead of entering himself a party, he had disclaimed all interest in the subject in controversy, could there have been any doubt as to his competency? When the case was carried to the District \u2022Court, it assumed the shape of an original cause. He might then have released all claim as <em>distributee; </em>and he may equally do it in this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-7\">This is not a stronger case than that of a member of a corporation releasing all his right to the corporate <em>body; </em>which will make him a good witness in a case, in which the corporation is a party, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-8\">But the great question is, how far <em>Hill Cogbill's </em>being liable to costs, will disqualify him from being a witness. This is not like the case of an action at law, where certain par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ties <em>must </em>necessarily join, and continue parties throughout' the controversy. In a contest about wills, any person supposing himself interested, may apply and become a party at any time. When <em>Hill Cogbill </em>releases to all the other appellees, <em>he </em>is no longer a party, and <em>they </em>take upon themselves the payment of the costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-4\">So a person, who is bail, cannot- be a witness for the principal ; but when it is necessary to make use of his testimony, the constant course is, to substitute other bail, and then he is restored to his competency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-5\">So <em>Hill </em>Cogbill, in this case, may deposit all the money for the costs, which will be the best substitute for his personal responsibility. But it may be asked, is he not <em>purchasing </em>a right, to give evidence ? The answer is, that the other parties pay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUKS\">Call, in opposition to the introduction of the witness. The doctrine contended for on the other side, would be subversive of every rule of evidence. What is the state of the case ? <em>Hill </em>Cogbill, who was a party in the contest before the County Court,' is offered as a witness : he was a party appellant to the District Court; and now stands as a party appellee before this Court; It is said, however, that he <em>might </em>have qualified himself to be a witness in the County Court; yet he does an act which wholly puts it out \u00a9f his power. By taking an appeal, he destroys his capacity, if it ever did exist. But he may release! To whom?' To the other appellants. Can they release to us? The costs belong to us; and, by what act, can the other appellants release <em>our </em>costs ? It is said, too, that in the District Court, the cause commenced <em>de novo. </em>But had not the costs attached on the appeal from the County Court ? He could be released but by <em>us. </em>Who, but ourselves, could accept a release for our costs ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-7\">But money may be deposited sufficient <em>to </em>discharge the costs! Will you suffer the witness to be bribed to give testimony? Here is a man liable tp costs; and yet. he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>introduced as a witness, and told by the other appellees, \u25a0if }'0U will swear for us, we will discharge you from all costs. Could this be done, <em>out of Court, </em>without destroying the credibility of the witness If not, will its being done <em>in Court </em>alter the case ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-4\">But it is said that a person who is bail may be a witness for the principal, on his giving other bail! That is quite a different case. The moment new bail is substituted, the old is discharged. The case of a <em>corporator </em>releasing to the corporate body, has, also, no resemblance to the present. In suits by or against a corporation, individuals never pay'costs: they are paid out of the aggregate funds of the corporation. But the usual course is, to <em>disfranchise </em>the corporator, whom it is intended to introduce as a witness, and then he stands as an indifferent person.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-12\"><em>Hay, </em>in favour of introducing the witness: In this case, a man dismisses his appeal, and ceases to be a party: the dismission is entered, at the time, by the proper officer; but because he has committed an error in transcribing that entry, the man is to be excluded from giving testimony!</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-13\">The decisions in <em>Vaughan and Field </em>v. Freeland,, seems to settle the law on this point; but that is but a solitary decision. I shall not contend that, when the law has once, been solemnly settled, the point ought again to be stirred; but such serious inconveniences will result from an adherence to that decision, that I submit to the Court, whether it ought not to be <em>reconsidered. </em>No inconvenience whatever, would arise from the proposed amendment; because it would only make the record speak the truth: it would be introducing an amendment, where there is something by which the amendment may be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-14\">But if the case of <em>Vaughan and Field </em>v. Freeland, be a binding authority, I must consider <em>Hill Cogbill </em>as <em>legally </em>a party before this Court. The objection to his testimony is, that he is liable for costs. Unfortunately, we prevailed, in the District Court; lor, if we had been appellants to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Court the appeal might be dismissed as to him. Now, if a sum money be deposited with the clerk, which, according to all reasonable calculation, would be sufficient to pay-three times the amount of the costs, has he any interest? Does it not remove every possible objection to his competency? How can this be considered <em>bribery; </em>when no money is paid into <em>his hands ? </em>He stands perfectly indifferent.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\"> <em>Vaughan and Field, </em>executors of <em>Field, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Freeland </em>and others. <em>(Order-book, </em>no. 5. p. 261.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\"><em>Field, </em>surviving executor, &amp;c. of <em>Field, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Freeland </em>and others. <em>(order-book, </em>no. <em>5. </em>p. 277. 3d <em>May, </em>1806, MS.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">This was, in fact, the same cause, which assumed a different style ia consequence of the death of <em>Vaughan, </em>a party in the appeal It was originally an action on the case upon <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for goods, wares, and merchandizes, brought in the District Court, held at <em>Brunswick </em>Court-House, by the surviving partners of <em>Freeland, Lenox, &amp; Co. </em>against <em>Vaughan and Field, </em>executors of <em>Field, &amp;c. </em>surviving partner of <em>Field and Murray. </em>The plaintiffs declared on an assumpsit of the <em>testator; </em>thp defendants pleaded \u201c non assumpsit and the act of limitations;\u201d upon which issue was joined.

If there were no other objection than'the first, I should be of opinion that by releasing all his interest, he might be a competent witness. With respect to the second ground, there is more difficulty. That <em>Hill Cogbill </em>was <em>originally </em>a party, is not controverted; that he now <em>appears </em>as a party . cannot be denied. But is there no mode by which he may become disinterested as to the costs, and be restored to his competency? I mentioned yesterday, that by depositing a sufficient sum of money to cover the costs, I thought every objection to the admissibility of the witness might be removed. Of the correctness of this opinion, however, I am not certain. But what if the other appellees were to come jn and offer security for costs, and, in consideration of <em>Hill CogbilPs </em>releasing all his interest as distributee, in the event of the codicil\u2019s being rejected by this Court, they release him from the payment of-all the costs? Would not this make him a disinterested witness ? He was of opinion that <em>Hill Cogbill </em>might be admitted as a witness, if he should release all his interest in the residuum of <em>John Oogbilps </em>estate, in the event that the codicil should be rejected bv this Court; and if the other appellees should, on their parts, give security for all costs, in Court, for which they may be liable, and also release <em>Hill Cogbill </em>from all demands for contribution in this case.</p>\n<author id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Judge <em>Roane.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AG-t\">I do consider this case as depending before an Appellate Court; and not as an original cause. The only difference between this, and'other appeals is, that, in this case, we hear <em>viva voce </em>testimony; in others, all the evidence is in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">There can be no doubt but the witness may release , his interest as to the subject in controversy; but the only difficulty with me, is, whether his liability to pay costs does not disqualify him. If he can be introduced he must get rid of the objection in one of three ways : <em>First. </em>He must himself pay down a sum of money, fully equal to the costs: er, <em>Secondly. </em>His co-appellees must release him from the payment of costs, and give other security for that purpose; or, <em>Thirdly. </em>The costs must be paid down by the other appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">It will not be contended that the witness himself should pay down the costs. That course would be liable to this objection; that it would not only discover too much forwardness on his part, and too warm an interest in the subject, hut still he would not be <em>disinterested; </em>for, in that event, the money would come back to him, if his co-appellees should succeed in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The next question is, whether his co-appellees, by releasing him from the payment of costs, and by giving <em>other </em>security, can introduce him as a competent witness. If any case precisely similar had occurred, I presume it would have been cited: none such has been adduced. But there is an authority which seems to negative the position that a party can be restored to his competency by a release from the costs. The case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>The Governors, </em>&amp;c. of <em>St. Mary Magdalen Bermondsey, </em>&amp;c.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> seems to establish the position, that, if a person be liable for costs in <em>the first instance </em>as a <em>party, </em>(even though he be only a trustee, and is to be reimbursed such costs out of a particular fund,) he is rendered incompetent, and can, by no act, be qualified as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In the <em>third </em>view of the case, it has been said, that if thetaoney he actually paid down by the other appellees who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>wish to make use of the testimony of <em>Hill </em>Cogbill., <em>he </em>would thereby be restored to his competency. I' find it laid down <em>generally </em>that a <em>party in a cause </em>cannot be a witness.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> I have not been able to find any instance in which a man who stood as plaintiff <em>in his own </em>right, was admitted to give evidence in the cause, orto produce the substitution asked for in the present case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b500-16\">C\u00e1ll., for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"ARr\">In the argument of this case, I shall contend, that the memorandum is, in itself, a good will.. If, however, the Court shall differ with me on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>point, I shall next contend that the new will written by Ferguson, was a good will j and being lost, the memorandum is to be received as a substitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>With respect to paying down the money, by the other . appellees; has such a thing ever been done ? does that get rid of the objection that he is still a party upon record ? and wherein does it differ from the <em>Bermondsey </em>case, but that the fund is perhaps safer ? If such a practice ever had occurred, the presumption is, that adjudged cases might have been adduced; but none are cited. Shall the Court arrest the progress of the business, and request the clerk to make out a statement of the sum <em>supposed </em>to be necessary to secure the payment of the costs ? The delay and inconvenience attendant on this mode of proceeding, would, of itself, be a strong objection to it. Unless, then, we lose sight of those land-marks which have hitherto guided us ; unless we <em>assist </em>the parties to obviate the objection, by passing an opinion as to the sum adequate to cover the costs; unless we do what was never done before, theobjection on this score remains in force. On these several grounds, I am of opinion, that <em>Hill Cogbill </em>cannot be introduced as a witness.</p>\n<author id=\"b500-14\">judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"ABGq\">From the reasons which have been so fully stated by the Judge who has preceded me, it appears that <em>Hill Cogbill </em>is an incompetent witness); and the opinion of a majority of the Court is that he cannot be admitted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\"> <em>3 East, </em>7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em> 2 Bac.

On that ground nuncupative wills were first established; and it is on that principle that we contend for the position just advanced.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The authorities cited expressly prove, that if a paper be in the hand-writing of the testator, purporting to be a disposition of his personal estate, or even if it be written by another pursuant to his instructions, and there be proof of those facts, it is a good will, though his name neither appear on the face of the instrument, nor be subscribed to it.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The <em>animus </em>testandi, in the present case, clearly appears. When the testator gave the memorandum to <em>Ferguson, </em>it was for the express purpose of drawing his will conformably to his instructions. The memorandum contained a reasonable disposition of his estate, and was intended to prevent the effect of the lapsed legacy, in consequence of the death of <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill. </em>Again; the paper purports to be his last will: it appoints certain persons as executors of <em>his last will, </em>&amp;c. which is full proof of his intention to devise; so that, if his name had appeared in any part of the instrument, it would have been a complete will to all intents and purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Another reason for considering this paper as a good will, is, that the delivery, by the testator, to Ferguson, was a due publication. There is no technical form of publication. Any act which shews that the testator meant it to be hiswill, is sufficient. Toller, in the page just cited,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> says, that the presence of witnesses to the publication of a will of personal estate is not essential to its validity. There is additional evidence that this paper contained the last, will and testament of <em>John Cogbill; </em>he told Archer, (another witness,) that <em>Ferguson </em>had written his will, with which he was perfectly satisfied; and <em>Ferguson </em>proves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>that the will, as written, strictly conformed with the intentions of the testator declared in the memorandum. Even if a man writes his will, and locks it up in his scrutoire and no person sees it till after his death, still it is his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">But, if this paper be not a <em>will, </em>it contains <em>notes for a will; </em>and that will be considered sufficient, even if the will be not afterwards approved of; for they are evidences of the testator\u2019s mind. <em>Richardson on </em>Wills, p. 26. This authority is express, that if the notes be sensible and substantive, so as to be intelligible, they are a complete will. To the same point is <em>Dyer, </em>72. pl. 2. <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Sackville, </em>1 <em>Anderson, 34. Swinb. on Wills, </em>6. <em>Godolph. 14, 15. </em>These authorities clearly prove, that, if <em>notes </em>only be taken for a will, they will amount to a complete disposition of the property, if they be reduced to form during the life-time of the testator. If notes taken by <em>another </em>be sufficient, how much stronger is the case, when they are made by the testator himself! The act of Assembly <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> has no influence on the case. It only prescribes the form of wills of <em>real </em>estate; but, as to <em>personal, </em>they are left as at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">2. If, however, the Court should be of a different opinion as to the points already made, the other cannot fail\u2014 that the new will written by <em>Ferguson </em>was a good will, and the memorandum is to be taken as a substitute, that will having been lost, (a) This will was approved by the testator, both in the presence of <em>Ferguson </em>and <em>Archer; </em>and his failure to sign it is sufficiently accounted for: he wished first to release a debt due from his brother\u2019s estate, for the bexxefit of his representatives. Nor is there any evidence of a chaxxge of intention, either as to this will or the* memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The draught of the new will having been lost, the next best evidence which can be adduced ought to be adopted that is, the memorandum. If a bill in <em>Chancery </em>were brought to set up this lost will,- there cai'x be no doubt, on principle, but -it would be established. But we contexxd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>that a Court of <em>probate </em>ought to receive it, and admit it, or a substitute, to record, whenever the Court can be satisfied that the substitute is a true representation of the original. The practice in <em>England </em>is, to receive proof o\u00ed a <em>copy </em>of a will made abroad, and to grant probate of it; although there is no act of parliament which says that a <em>copy </em>is sufficient. So, if a will be lost, (from whatever cause,) the Court of probate will receive a substitute, and admit it to record, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">But I presume it will be said, that <em>Ferguson </em>struct out some little expletives which he had inserted himself in the memorandum; on which circumstance an argument may be founded. To which it will be a sufficient answer, that if the will was good at the time of <em>CogbilVs </em>death, no act of <em>Ferguson's </em>could destroy its validity.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b503-10\">Hay, for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"A1M2\">(after stating the case, and animadverting with great severity on the conduct of <em>Ferguson </em>and Archer, in discovering such unusual activity in endeavouring to establish the memorandum as a codicil to the will of <em>John Cogbill; </em>in consulting counsel on it; in taking possession of the testator\u2019s papers before his death, and withholding them from his executors; in the great tardiness manifested by <em>Ferguson </em>in preparing the release; in his altering the memorandum, after he had inserted certain <em>words in </em>it in the presence of Cogbill, which might technically be called a <em>forgery ; </em>and, finally, in his retaining the memorandum after he had written the draught of a new will,) proceeded to discuss the propositions of Mr. <em>Call.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">As to Mr. <em>CalPs </em>first point, that the memorandum is a good will; we say, that <em>John Cogbill </em>died without any other will than the <em>first. </em>Mr. <em>Call, </em>howxver, says that he left three.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">The memorandum is not a good will, because <em>John Cogbill </em>did not <em>intend </em>this paper should be his will. This is a plain matter of fact, to be gathered from the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of the witnesses, and the intention of the <em>testator; </em>and, if we can shew that <em>Cogbill </em>did not mean to make it his will, the Court will not admit it to record as such. <em>John Cog-bill </em>wrote a paper, and gave it to <em>Ferguson, not as his will, </em>but as a <em>memorandum to write a.will by. </em>Is there any principle of common sense which says, that a <em>paper to draw a will </em>by, is a <em>will. </em>If Mr. <em>Call </em>had viewed this case through <em>that </em>medium, and not through the spectacle of books, he would have been less confident of the truth of his first position.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">But, says Mr. Call, mere <em>notes </em>for a will are sufficient. Admitting this to be true, it does not apply to the present; case ; for <em>Ferguson </em>says there was another paper, containing the oral instructions, which he afterwards reduced to writing; and the paper now produced does not contain <em>all </em>the instructions of <em>Cogbill. Richardson on Wills </em>(p. 26.) does not prove that mere notes for a will are a will itself. <em>Dyer </em>(p. 72.) is a confused case: it is referred to in <em>Swinburne., </em>Godo<em>lphin, </em>Anderson, and other old books cited by Mr. <em>Call, </em>and the facts differently stated in nearly all of them. These .old books are but of little authority, and seldom cited in <em>Westminster-Hall. </em>In opposition to these cases, I will refer to <em>Rowel on Devises, </em>27. 7 <em>Bac. Abr. Gwil. </em>edit. 317. tit. \u201c Wills,\u201d&amp;c. let.(p). div. 2. <em>Richardson on Wills, 5. Swinb. </em>6. 521. and <em>toller, </em>3. 57. (new edit.) all of which prove, that a will is an act of more solemnity than has been ascribed to it by Mr. Call; and, if it appear, that the testator <em>contemplated </em>a change in his will, or only left imperfect draughts for a will, it is not sufficient to constitute a will. In the case befor\u00e9 us, <em>Cogbill </em>determined not to subscribe <em>any will, </em>until the <em>release </em>should be executed. Will the Court, then, say, that a particular paper shall be . his will, when he determined to make no will, until a certain occurrence should have taken place ?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\"><em>Modern </em>determinations with respect to wills, seem to be approaching the standard of common sense, much more nearly than the old. In <em>Coles </em>v. Trecothick,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and <em>Mai </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>theius v. Warner,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is held, that a paper, to be a good will, even, of personal estate, must be a <em>complete definite rule or law for settling the estate of the testator: </em>nothing must remain to <em>be </em>done\u00bb This last case seems to cut up, by the roots, all the old doctrines on this subject. The same idea is expressed by Lord <em>Mansfield </em>in the case of Right, <em>&amp;c. </em>v. <em>Price, </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>All these authorities go to shew, that, when the testator meant to do something more, and left the instrument incomplete, it ought not to be established as his will. In <em>Roberts on the Statute of Frauds, </em>448. 453. there is much doctrine on this subject; all going to prove, that the former decisions establishing loose papers as wills, were exploded. Under the authority of this book, even if the <em>lost </em>will were here, it could not be considered the will of the testator. But, with respect to the memorandum, there can be no question. <em>John Cogbill </em>never <em>intended </em>it as his will. After he gave it to Ferguson, he never heard of it. Probably he thought <em>Ferguson </em>had destroyed it. Yet it is contended, that a paper which the testator never thought of as his will, shall be established as such! So far from recognizing this memorandum as his will, he never spoke of it: he always spoke of the <em>draught </em>as his will, which he was anxious to sign as soon as the release could be prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Another circumstance is conclusive. In lieu of the memorandum, <em>Cogbill </em>had received the <em>draught of a newwili </em>from <em>Ferguson. </em>He <em>intended </em>to execute this as his will, upon the happening of a certain event: that event never happened. Would it not be <em>monstrous </em>to say, that that paper <em>shall be </em>his will, when he determined it never should be, till the release should be executed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">If the testator <em>intended </em>this memorandum to be his will, (as contended for by Mr. <em>Calif </em>why did he not sign it at once ? The circumstance, that he named <em>some </em>executors, has no weight; because he obviously left the paper incomplete, concluding it with an <em>et atiera, </em>as if he intended to add something more.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>As to Mr. <em>Call\u2019s </em>second proposition, that, the draught having been lost, the memorandum may be proved as a substitute, it is perfectly immaterial whether it be correct or notl The only question before the Court below, related to the memorandum. How can a question be presented to this Court as to the draught, unless it be in the shape of an original proposition ? This Court cannot take <em>original </em>cognizance of any case. It is a Court of <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction, not a Court of <em>prohate; </em>and can only say, whether the District Court did right or wrong, as to the question which was submitted. No precedent can be adduced, in .this country, where the substance of a will, which has been lost or destroyed, has been proved by witnesses, and entered of record. All that can be done is, for a Court of Equity to grant relief by setting up the lost will, if, from the circumstances, it should be proper. No argument is to be drawn from the laws of England, with respect to the probate of wills ; because they are so entirely dissimilar to those of this State. Our statute-book, throughout, contemplates the production of the <em>original </em>will, and not of a <em>copy.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even if the <em>lost will </em>were before a Court of probate, it could not be admitted to record, according to the principles laid down by Swinburne, p. 450. because it could not be proved by persons free from all exception. But neither the <em>memorandum </em>nor the <em>draught </em>is the will of <em>John </em>Cogbill, because he positively refused to execute the latter till a release should be prepared, and signed by him.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b506-8\">Randolph, on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AkP\">The first position to be examined is, whether the <em>memorandum </em>be a good <em>will. Se</em>condly, whether, if not, the <em>draught </em>of a will, which has been lost, can be established by the instituting proof of the <em>substance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Thp law, though always rigid as to the disposition of <em>land, </em>was originally careless in bequests of <em>personal property. </em>But the Judges, of late, have established modes of proof far more guarded than <em>formerly; </em>and, in the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>guage of <em>Roberts,ft) </em>we may say, \u201c that later determina- \u201c tions at Doctors\u2019 <em>Commons </em>seem tending to establish a \u201c more discriminating doctrine.\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">As to the position, that the memorandum is a good will in itself, two preliminary remarks are necessary. <em>First. </em>It is not enough, in order to make this a good codicil in itself, that <em>John Cogbill </em>might <em>generally </em>have professed an intention of devising, as in that <em>instrument; </em>but the <em>voluntas testandi </em>must have existed in his mind <em>quoad this particular paper.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The writer must intend the paper to stand as written.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> <em>Secondly. </em>Parol evidence is admissible to shew whether that instrument should ever come into existence in that actual form. In the same case of <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Warner,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the counsel for the will admit, that, in ambiguous cases, it may be necessary to resort to evidence, not of intention and design, but of what the testator himself conceived he had done by that paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">But we do not rely on parol evidence alone. There are internal evidences that the testator did not intend this paper to stand as his will. If that identical paper was not intended as the will of <em>Cogbill, </em>it is not in the power of the Court to make it so. When did he intend it as his will 1 Not when the original will was written by <em>Ferguson, </em>in whom he confided. If he had intended it as his complete will, would he not have perfected it by signing and publishing ? Would he not have made some disposition of the remainder of his estate, and said something as to the mortgage due from the estate of his brother <em>Jesse Cogbill P </em>This memorandum was not intended as a <em>will, </em>but only a <em>projet </em>of a will. It is incomplete \u2014 a blank left for executors \u2014 and concludes abruptly with an <em>&amp;c. </em>His <em>calling </em>it a will is immaterial. The case of <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Warner </em>furnishes much stronger ground, and yet the will was held not to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">It is perfectly clear, that both <em>Cogbill </em>and <em>Ferguson </em>were acquainted with the mode of perfecting a will. Knowing that the memorandum was void as to <em>real </em>estate, it is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>fair presumption that they considered it void as to <em>personal estate also. </em>But it appears, from the evidence of <em>Fer</em>guson., that <em>Cogbill </em>did not consider this memorandum as a codicil. It was furnished <em>to write a -will by, </em>and was to form a <em>part </em>of his will when certain acts were done. His leading object -was to release the mortgage on the estate of his brother <em>Jesse Cogbill. By </em>examining the memorandum it will be found, that, if it be established as a codicil, that great object will be defeated. The testator had originally inserted words in the memorandum, which would have had nearly the effect intended of releasing the mortgage to <em>Jesse Cogbill\u2019s </em>heirs. He afterwards erased them, in order to <em>execute a release. </em>His not having done so, shews that his intention is incompletely expressed. In none of the cases cited by Mr. <em>Call </em>is there this <em>strong </em>circumstance, that there was a <em>condition </em>annexed, without the performance of which the testator did not intend the paper to be his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In <em>Shepherd\u2019s Touchstone, </em>p. 408. there is a case which establishes the principle for which I contend. There a notary was directed by the testator, to write a will of his land to <em>J. </em>S. with a <em>condition; </em>and the notary wrote the will to <em>J. S. </em>but the testator died before he could write the condition ; and the whole will was held to be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The memorandum, in the case before us, was declared by the testator as the <em>basis of a new will. </em>The witness explicitly states that he <em>did not consider it a codicil, </em>but only a <em>memorandum, to write a new will by. Cogbill </em>repeatedly declared that he would not sign the draught of a will, until he had previously signed the <em>release. </em>As an evidence of the estimation in which he held these papers, the original will was put in a trunk in a place of safety, but the draught was thrown into a closet. Death, by accident, often gives validity to a paper incomplete in itself; but it never makes a paper absolute, when it was not so intended by the testator till a certain <em>condition </em>should be performed. He concluded by referring to <em>Roberts on the Stat. of Frauds, </em>33r. 453.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AXW\">The argument of Mr. <em>Randolph </em>is founded on the <em>assumption </em>of a position which is the main subject of controversy between us. , He says, that the testator never intended the memorandum as the <em>identical paper </em>which should be his will. Admitted: but on all questions of wills of <em>personal </em>estate, the only inquiry is, whether the testator \u00a1intended to dispose of his property in a <em>particular way. </em>It is unimportant whether he expressed that intention on any <em>particular paper. </em>It is admitted, too, that there are strong prejudices against any disposition of an estate without the solemnity of writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Much has been said to impeach the credibility of two of the witnesses ; but they are more important to the appellees than to ourselves. Suppose we had exhibited this paper, and proved the hand-writing of the testator, could there have been any doubt but it would have been established as a good codicil, as to the <em>personal estate f </em>All that was wanting was that internal evidence which the paper itself affords. <em>Reject </em>the testimony of those two witnesses, and the will is proved beyond a doubt: it is proved by the evidence of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">But, it is said, the paper is incomplete in itself; there is, an <em>et emtera </em>at the conclusion! So there are in many sections of <em>Littleton: </em>yet the law has always been considered as fully stated by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">The signature of the testator is only necessary in wills of <em>real estate. </em>It is remarkable that all the laws respecting wills <em>o\u00ed personal estate </em>are merely <em>prohibitory. </em>In no instance do they enlarge the rights of the parties; but leave them as they stood before.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">It is asked why <em>Ferguson </em>took the papers from the house <em>o\u00ed CogbilP. </em>Why should he not? It was the house of a <em>bachelor; </em>none but negroes were about it, and persons interested in destroying the papers. But why give them to <em>Archer ? </em>For the same reason which induced him to take them; to preserve them. Mr. <em>Archer </em>was a respectable .man, and a friend of the testator. But why consult coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>sel ? As the friend of orphans. Why should <em>Ferguson </em>attend the counsel ? For a very plain reason; that the counsel might know what he could prove. But, <em>technically, Ferguson </em>has been guilty of <em>forgery ! </em>He certainly shewed more <em>delicacy </em>than necessary, from a mistaken apprehension of the law. But in point of morality the act might be proper or not, according to the motives with which it was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">But it is said to be strange that we should Contend that all those papers constitute one will! Why should we not ? If a man leave <em>twenty </em>testamentary papers relating <em>to personal </em>estate, all may be proved; and, as far as they are consistent, they shall stand. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">In considering this question, I shall rely upon what has before been stated by Mr. Call, that the <em>animus testandi </em>is all that is necessary. I shall inquire, not whether the ttestator meant <em>this particular paper </em>to be his will, but whether he, having the <em>animus </em>testandi, meant <em>this disposition of his property. </em>This paper is merely an evidence of his intentions. \u201c <em>Non jus esse in </em>tabulis\u00ab\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">A will or testament is defined by Sir <em>William Blackstone </em>to be, \u201c the legal declaration of a man\u2019s intentions, which \u201c he wills to be performed after his death.\u201d The <em>form </em>of the will is the mere effect of positive institutions. The true inquiry is, whether it be the <em>declaration </em>of a will. This brings us to the question, what solemnities are required by law. All the authorities shew that a <em>declaration </em>is sufficient as to <em>personal </em>estate, whether further formalities were required or not; for <em>utile per inutile non vitiatur; that which is good in itself shall not be rendered invalid by the omission of a circumstance which is unnecessary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">The case in Richardson, 26. is cited in 7 <em>Bac. Abr, </em>338, 339. <em>Gwil. </em>edit, and is an express authority in our favour. Dyer, and Godolphin, and Swinburne, are said to be old books of litde authority in <em>Westminster-Hall; </em>that the case in <em>Dyer </em>is confused; and that <em>Godolphin </em>and <em>Swinburne </em>copy from him. <em>Dyer </em>is a book of great authority; so much so, that it is quoted in almost every page of Ld. <em>Coke. </em>There is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>peculiar propriety in going back to the <em>old authorities </em>for an exposition of the law with respect to wills of <em>personal estate; </em>because, since the statute of frauds requiring certain requisites in the disposition of lands by will, almost every question turns upon those circumstances. <em>Powell </em>has been referred to, to shew that <em>Dyer </em>has been overruled; but, if we look at <em>Powell, </em>p. 26, 27. we shall find that the authority of <em>Dyer </em>has not been denied; two anonymous cases from <em>Leonard </em>are indeed contradicted by the cases of <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Edmunds,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>William </em>v. <em>Edmunds;</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but this was because the cases in <em>Leonard </em>related to <em>lands, </em>and the testator had given <em>no directions </em>about writing his will: his words were <em>officiously </em>committed to writing without his authority. Mr. <em>Hay </em>refers to 7 <em>Bac. Abr. Gwil. </em>edit. 317. as an authority in point. This case is stated more fully in 8 <em>Vin. Abr. </em>118, 119. pl. 16. as in MS. under the name of <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Ramdsden ; </em>but it has no application to the case before the Court: it went entirely on the distinction that the testator, after drawing up his own will, sent it to counsel to be <em>advised </em>of the legality of it; but, not having published it after receiving it back, it was held to be no will. But if it had been sent, with <em>directions to write or copy it, </em>it would have been a good will. <em>Ln that case, </em>the will was drawn for the <em>consideration </em>of counsel; <em>in this, </em>it was drawn <em>after counsel had been consulted. </em>The next authority referred to by Mr. <em>Hay, </em>is <em>Swinburne, </em>page 6. figure (14). If he had read a little further, he would have seen , that, for the <em>most part, </em>testaments, so far as they are perfected, are good. Iiow often does it happen, that a will, though not good as to <em>real estate, </em>when the testator meant to do something more, yet is good a.s to <em>personal. </em>In page 521. of <em>Swinburne, </em>Mr. <em>Llay </em>says there is an authority in his favour. How is this authority to be understood? Clearly as a <em>draught </em>for future consideration, as will appearfrom perusingthe next preceding page, 519. figures (9) and (10). Great reliance is placed on the circumstance that <em>Cogbill </em>did not intend to sign his will, until the release could be prepared and executed. No doubt he intended a fe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>lease : but for whom ? Not for the persons now before the Court, but for the descendants of <em>Jesse Cogbill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">But the verbal directions respecting the outstanding debts, are not inserted in the will! What does this prove ? take it either way. It might be proyed now in the Court of <em>Chesterfield. </em>By affirming the decree of that Court, it does not preclude the parties interested from proving that fact. That disposition may well consist with the one made by the paper written by <em>Ferguson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">But the testator intended some further formalities! and the omission of them, it is said, destroys the will. That is the very point upon which we are at issue. While we admit that he did; yet all the authorities are against the position contended for on the other side. Toller, page 3. and <em>Roberts on </em>Frauds, page 405. are cited and relied on. While it will readily be admitted that those are authors of great talents, yet no person will say that their mere <em>opinions </em>are <em>authorities. </em>Whatever doctrines are to be found on this point in .those writers are <em>inferences </em>and <em>erroneous inferences </em>from the authorities cited by them. The doctrine to be found in page 3. of the <em>new edition </em>of Toller, is not inserted in the <em>first. </em>Probably he copied it into the second edition, from <em>Roberts; </em>they both cite the same cases, all of which are referred to in <em>Limbery </em>v. <em>Mason,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and support the doctrines for which we contend. The passage in <em>Roberts </em>relied on by Mr. <em>Hay, </em>contains merely the author\u2019s <em>opinions. </em>Cases are <em>said </em>to have been decided, but <em>when, </em>or <em>where </em>is not shewn, nor are any of the circumstances stated. In a subsequent page of the same writer, (p. 453.) if his book be considered as an authority, the doctrine for which we contend is expressly recognized. The case of <em>Coles </em>v. Trecothick,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> turns wholly upon the question whether, in that case, there should be a specific performance of an agreement. Not a word about a will exists in the whole case; and yet a mere <em>dictum </em>thrown out by the Judge by way of illustration, in a case to which it had no reference, has be,en quoted as a point decided in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>I come now to the only authority which seems, in any point, to support the doctrines contended for on the other side; the case of <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Warner.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If that case be taken altogether, I would not wish a stronger one in our favour. It shews that <em>Roberts </em>had totally misapprehended the law on the subject. There are <em>three </em>points in which that case differs wholly from this : 1st. It was only the <em>plan </em>of a will, and so indorsed by the testator; and he never did give the plan to any person to write a will by: 2dly. Four years afterwards, he wrote a different paper, abrogating all former wills: 3dly. There was parol evidence, witness after witness, to prove that he had changed his intentions; and one witness proved that he had seen a subsequent will to this, making a different disposition of his estate. But is that the case with us? No. If such a will as the one now before this Court, had been the subject of controversy in that case, can there be any doubt but it would have been considered a good will ?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The case of <em>Right </em>v. <em>Price,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>has no application to this. That case only decided the point, that there must be a <em>mental </em>as well as a <em>corporeal </em>presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The memorandum, it is understood, is alone to be considered before this Court; but we contend that the parties will not be barred from producing the draught to Chester<em>field </em>Court, hereafter, and proving it; and, as far as that shall be consistent with the memorandum, both shall stand.

H. </em>Cogbill, in whose favour a similar bequest had been, made in his first will, <em>Ferguson </em>swears that this razure was made by Cogbill, before he received the memorandum from him, and that he <em>verbally </em>directed him, that the outstanding debts before bequeathed to <em>Cogbill </em>should go to <em>Armistead </em>Hill, He likewise swore <em>(as I understood him) </em>that he prepared a will agreeably to <em>CogbilPs </em>instructions, that-is to say, comprising all the legacies contained in the first will, (except the one to <em>T. N. Cogbill, </em>who was now dead,) those in the written memorandum prepared in <em>CogbilPs </em>own hand-Writing, and the <em>verbal </em>directions respecting the outstanding debts, of which he says he took a memorandum in writing, in <em>CogbilPs </em>presence, That he deliver* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ed the draught of the will to Cogbill, who read.it over more than once, as he believes, and approved of it; but did not sign it, as he wished to release his brother <em>Jesse CogbilPs </em>\u00a9state from a considerable debt due by mortgage, and requested <em>Ferguson </em>to prepare a release for that purpose, on a separate paper, which he would execute, and <em>then </em>sign his will. <em>Ferguson </em>prepared a rough draft of a release, and shewed it to Cogbill, but being interlined, <em>Cogbill </em>requested him to copy it over again, which he did. From the time of receiving the instructions to that of <em>CogbilPs </em>death was several months ; and the draught of the will was prepared and delivered to him about two months before that event: about a fortnight preceding it, <em>Ferguson </em>called at his house, when <em>Cogbill </em>asked if he had finished thes release. <em>Ferguson </em>said that he had not 5 <em>Cogbill </em>then said he wished he would, as he was anxious to sign his will. In his last illness he sent to <em>Ferguson </em>for the release; he went to his house, but found him in a delirious state, and incapable of executing the release, or the will s and he died without doing either. On further examination <em>Ferguson </em>said, that in writing the will he pursued the words of the memorandum verbatim, as far as they went. That where <em>Cogbill </em>was ill, finding his papers lying about in an insecure manner, he took the first will, and the draught of the second, and gave them to Mr. <em>Archer </em>to take <em>cate of, </em>that <em>Cogbill </em>might execute the will if he should get well enough to do it. That <em>Archer </em>returned the papers to him after <em>CogbilPs </em>death, and then he delivered them to Mr. <em>MlRae </em>to be exhibited in <em>Chesterfield </em>Court, where the witness saw them, and was examined respecting them. That he has never seen them since, and understands the draught is lost; that the memorandum in <em>CogbilPs </em>handwriting was never out of his possession until <em>CogbilPs </em>death. Mr. <em>MiRae </em>confirms the production of the draught at <em>Chesterfield </em>Court, and says that he understands it has since been lost; being thrown about, and thought of no consequence. The County Court established the first will, and admitted the memorandam in <em>CogbilPs </em>hand-writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>to record, as a codicil to it; but paid no regard, as far as appears, to the draught prepared by <em>Ferguson. </em>On an appeal to the District Court, as to so much of the proceedings in the County Court, as related to the memorandum, admitted to record as a codicil, that Court reversed the order of the County Court, and rejected the paper as a codicil; from this there is an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">This cause has been very elaborately argued on both sides, and the reasons both for and against the judgment, of the District Court are so strong, that I have found myself at a loss to decide which ought to preponderate. That this memorandum wholly written by the deceased in his deliberate moments, is an evidence of his intention to dispose of his estate, in the manner therein mentioned, cannot be doubted. But that it does not amount to such evidence as the law requires to effectuate the testator\u2019s intention is fully manifest from this circumstance, that although it expresses an intention to dispose of the lands therein mentioned, yet not being signed by him, it does not furnish that <em>conclusive </em>evidence of such intention which the law will not dispense with. But it is said, though not effectual as a devise of lands, it is perfect and complete as a will of personal property. I am not altogether certain of that; being without name, or date, and in part erased, and even unfinished, it could not be established without the aid of parol testimony, not only as to the hand-writing, but as to the <em>subject </em>of which it speaks. Suppose, for example, tire testator had not any slaves of the same names with those mentioned in this paper; if this were proved to the Court, would they consider it as his will, or that of some other person for whom he had been requested to prepare one. Parol testimony and circuArstances must be resorted to, to satisfy the mind of a Court, that a paper in <em>this </em>form is the last will and testament of any person whatsoever; even of him, in whose hand-writing it is found. If then the paper \u2022needs .the aid of parol testimony and circumstances to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>port it, may it not also be defeated by evidence of the same kind? The evidence, in the present case, is not that the deceased <em>John Coghill </em>shewed this paper to <em>Ferguson as his </em>will, or delivered it to him for safe keeping <em>as such ; </em>but that he delivered it to him accompanied by <em>another </em>paper, and <em>verbal </em>instructions, as a memorandum, from which to draw a will, which the testator, <em>at the time of giving these instructions meant to execute </em>as his will; but which when, prepared, and shewn to him, and perused by him, <em>he did not execute. </em>He certainly, when he delivered this paper to <em>Ferguson </em>did not mean it to be a <em>codicil </em>to his <em>former </em>will; but it was given as a memorandum, or instruction only, by which to prepare another will as to that part of his estate therein mentioned. It was not a whole, but a <em>part </em>only of a <em>project </em>of a will <em>to be </em>prepared; he did not give <em>authenticity </em>to it, as his will, but as the ground-work, upon which a more <em>formal </em>paper, containing a variety of other provisions, should be prepared, in order <em>to be thereafter executed </em>by him with all due solemnities. This paper then at the time he delivered it to Ferguson, was not his will, nor a codicil to his former will; but something else. It matters not, I conceive, by what other name, or description it is called, if it were not one or the other of these, at the <em>time </em>of the <em>delivery thereof </em>to <em>Ferguson. </em>Its effect as <em>either </em>must depend upon what it was at <em>that moment. </em>That it was of no importance in the eyes of Mr. Coghill, appears from this, that <em>Ferguson </em>never returned it to him so long as he lived. He gave him his former will, and the draught which he had prepared for a new one. <em>Coghill </em>seems to have thought no more about it. It was a perfect derelict; <em>CogbilPs </em>attention never was turned to it after he received the draught; but his attention was engrossed by the desire of executing that <em>after he should have done an </em>act, which if not done before the execution of the will, must operate as a <em>revocation </em>of it in part. He had resolved upon this act (as would seem from <em>Ferguson's </em>memorandum, though I lay no stress upon it, as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>was not particularly interrogated upon that point) after <em>Ferguson </em>received his instructions from him respecting the mortgage debt, due from his brother\u2019s estate. His anxiety to execute the release, and to sign his will as prepared by Ferguson, <em>manifest a conviction in his own mind </em>thathe had done <em>nothing </em>since the death of <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill, </em>which did, or could amount to a disposition of <em>the </em>property formerly devised and bequeathed to him. I rely on this circumstance to prove that he died <em>intestate </em>as to that property ; unless his approbation of the draught which <em>Ferguson </em>had prepared by his direction should amount to a publication of <em>that </em>will: but that question is not now before us; I shall, therefore, say no more concerning it.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the paper now before the Court was not <em>prepared </em>or <em>intended </em>by Mr. <em>Cog-bill </em>as a will, <em>of </em>itself, or as a codicil to his former will; nor was it delivered by him' to <em>Ferguson </em>to keep, as either the <em>one </em>or the <em>other: </em>consequently that it never received from him any authentic character, which might in any event denominate it a testamentary paper, and that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed. In dissenting from the opinions of the majority of the Court, I. feel that degree of distrust of my own, which nothing but a sense of duty could overcome.</p>\n<author id=\"b518-8\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AP-o\">On the 9th of <em>November, </em>1805, <em>John Cogbill </em>made his last will and testament, duly executed before six witnesses. He therein gives to <em>Sally Hill, </em>daughter of his brother <em>Jesse Cogbill, </em>seven negroes, some horses and cattle, and a bed and furniture. He gives to. his nephew <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill, </em>son of his brother <em>Jesse Cogbill, </em>the plantation on which he lived, 15 negroes, 5 horses, 23 cattle, 10 sheep, all his stock of hogs, household and kitchen furniture, (except the bed given to <em>Sally Hill,) </em>plantation utensils, <em>all his outstanding debts, </em>and all the remainder of his estate both real and personal; his said nephew paying all his just debts. In the event of his said. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>niece and nephew dying without issue of their bodies lawfully begotten, he gives these interests over to <em>Jesse Cog-bill </em>and <em>John </em>Cogbill, (sons of his brother <em>George </em>Cogbill,) as may be particularly seen by reference to the will itself, <em>James Ferguson </em>is a witness to, and was, probably, the drawer of this <em>will; </em>and seems to have been privy to, and consulted on, the affairs of the testator throughout. <em>Thomas N. Cogbill, Armistead </em>Hill, (the husband of <em>Sally Hill?) </em>and <em>Charles </em>Graves, are appointed executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\"><em>Thomas N. Cogbill </em>having died some time after, and the dispositions to him being, of course, at an end, the testator contemplated a change in his will. His intentions on this subject were stated orally to, and committed to writing by, Ferguson, upon a paper now produced, with a view of consulting Mr. Gregory, (a lawyer,) touching the legality-of the limitations therein contained. The paper is very rough and imperfect; but the disposition purported therein is in substance as follows. He lends to <em>Sally Cogbill, </em>widow of <em>Thomas N. Cogbill, </em>the plantation, negroes, stock, furniture, and plantation utensils before given to <em>Thomas N. </em>Cogbill, during her widowhood, and \u201c after the death\u201d of <em>Sally Cogbill, </em>widow, &amp;c. he gives to her daughter, <em>Sally N. Cogbill, </em>the interests aforesaid. He gives to <em>Sally Hill, 7 </em>negroes, 2 horses, <em>all his outstanding debts, </em>except the deed of trust of his brother <em>Jesse </em>Cogbill, and the remainder of his cattle. He also gives her, in case she has a living heir, one half of the trust deed aforesaid, and the other half thereof to <em>Sally N. </em>Cogbill, his grand-niece, with proviso that she shall also have the other half, in the event of <em>Sally Hill\u2019s </em>dying without living issue ; and, in case of <em>Sally N. Cogbill\u2019s </em>death without lawful issue, then her mother to have the whole, and <em>Armistead Hill to </em>pay his debts, out of the legacy given to his wife. <em>Charles </em>Graves., <em>Sally Cogbill; </em>and <em>Armistead Hill, </em>are named, in this paper, as his executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">On this paper is an indorsement, by <em>Ferguson, </em>(at what time made is not particularly shewn,) that a release was to be prepared in favour of <em>Jesse Cogbil\u2019s </em>heirs, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>amount of the deed of trust; and that, in the will to be written by him for the testator, the clause respecting the deed of trust was to be omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"AsxZ\">After the writing of this paper, and about 7 or 8 months before the death of the testator, he delivered to Ferguson, his will of November, 1805 aforesaid, and the memorandum or paper which is now in question <em>to write a will by.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_K\">That memorandum, die subject of the present controversy, is without date or signature, but is wholly in the hand-writing of the testator, and sensibly and <em>fairly </em>written, except as to an obliteration hereafter more particularly noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"AqPL\">In it he lends to <em>Sally Cogbill., </em>as long as she remains <em>Thomas Nelson CogbilPs </em>widow, the plantation, negroes, stock, furniture, and plantation utensils, before given to him. He then gives to <em>Sally Nelson Cogbill, </em>(the daughter of <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill </em>and <em>Sally </em>Cogbill,) and her heirs and assigns forever, (and in case of her dying without issue of' her body, lawfully begotten,) to her mother and <em>Sally </em>Hill, equally to be divided, all the interests afore-\u2019 said. In the draught of this paper, after the specification of those interests, diese words, \u201c <em>together with all my </em>out- \u201c <em>standing debts, and all and every remainder of my </em>estate, \u201c <em>both real and personal, of every kind </em>whatsoever,\u201d had been added and obliterated, by drawing a pen through them. Two expletory words, entirely unimportant to the sense, were also interlined by <em>Ferguson, </em>with the assent of <em>John Cogbill, </em>and afterwards erased by <em>Ferguson, </em>for sonic reason which cannot affect the question now before us. The conclusion of this paper is in these words : \u201c Lastly, \u201c I do nominate Capt. <em>Charles Graves, Armistead Hill, </em>and \u201c--, executors to this my last will,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">It is evident that <em>tha first </em>paper, written by <em>Ferguson, </em>as aforesaid, was intended as a <em>rough sketch </em>of the whole will of the testator, comprehending the codicil made necessary by <em>Thomas Nelson CogbilPs </em>death; and that the <em>last </em>paper, (the one now in question,) was merely intended as a <em>supplement </em>to the <em>will; </em>by which, <em>together with </em>the ori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ginal will of <em>November, </em>1803, the draught, herein after more particularly noticed, was to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">I have deemed it proper to state, thus particularly, the general contents of these several papers, to shew that <em>Sally Hill </em>and <em>Thomas Nelson </em>Cogbill, and, after <em>Thomas Nelson CogbilPs </em>death, his wife and daughter, were always the principal objects of the testator\u2019s bounty; and that whatever fluctuations arose in his mind, after the death of <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill, </em>respecting the outstanding debts, and principally the important debt due from his brother <em>Jesse Cog-bill, </em>it was his uniform intention, not only to continue to the daughter of <em>Thomas Nelson </em>Cogbill, the general provision intended for her father, but also to give <em>that </em>debt, in some shape, to these the objects of his preference: to speak more particularly, it was his intention at the time of giving the oral instructions to <em>Ferguson, </em>(which were by him reduced to writing, as aforesaid,) to give all his outstanding debts, and a moiety of the trust-deed debt, to his niece <em>Sally Hill, </em>her husband paying all his debts; and the other moiety of the trust-debt, aforesaid, to his grand niece <em>Sally Nelson </em>Cogbill, (the daughter of <em>Thomas Nelson </em>Cogbill,) with remainder over, &amp;c. This intention, (as far as it relates to that trust debt,) was not abandoned by him up to the time of his death, as appears by the <em>testimony </em>in the <em>cause; </em>but he intended to effectuate it in another form, viz. by a release : his intention as to his <em>other outstanding debts, </em>(which were probably not considerable,) was indeed not kept up in the paper or memorandum now in question, nor is it <em>proved </em>that they were <em>then </em>intended to be bequeathed to any person.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">When we consider the changes which, from a variety of causes, generally take place in the minds of testators, respecting the disposal of their estates, up to the time of their deaths, it will rather excite admiration that the intentions of this testator were so steadily retained for a long course of time, than that, in this trivial particular, they were altered: and it is certainly a strong circumstance, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>determining upon the validity of a will, that the provisions thereof are not only in unison with all the testator\u2019s subsequent as well as previous testamentary papers, but also with his uniform wishes and declarations upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">In the present case the complaint is, not that the testator meant (by signing a release) to vary the disposition of his estate made by this paper, as <em>far as it goes, </em>with reference to his uniformly avowed intention; but that he did not also bequeath away a <em>further </em>interest, which he had certainly before intended to give to the present appellants ; that he did not execute <em>another </em>codicil, which he intended to execute <em>in the form of a release, </em>disposing of an interest omitted to be bequeathed in this, and which, from the testimony, he certainly intended for the appellants; and that, whereas he had before intended to bequeath to <em>ihe?n </em>the <em>residue </em>of his outstanding debts, he had changed his intention in relation thereto in favour of the <em>appellees, </em>by <em>(quoad </em>hoc) dying intestate. These are complaints which come with a very ill grace from the <em>appellees : </em>the appellants, on the other hand, may justly claim that the will of the testator may be permitted to operate as far as it is perfected, while they have cause to regret, that for want of a due execution of the paper in question, (or its counterpart, the will prepared by Ferguson,) according to our statute, they have lost the land certainly intended for them, as also the trust debt in question, for want of the intended execution of the release in their fayour, as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In determining the character of the paper in question, it will be necessary to have a very particular reference to the whole context and phraseology thereof. It will be found to be a very well-drawn codicil, with perhaps more <em>form </em>than is usual, and was even competent to have passed the <em>lands </em>thereby devised, had it been duly signed and published by the testator. It is of no importance that it wants a preamble, or has a <em>blank </em>left for the name of an executor. This last circumstance probably arose from the testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u00bflot having definitively concluded, at that time, what person to substitute as an executor in lieu of <em>Thomas Nelson Cog-\u00bfill, </em>then deceased. The word \u201c lastly,\u201d too, in the conelusion of the paper, denotes that the intentions of the testator, with relation to the subjects of that paper, were <em>final; </em>and the \u201c <em>et </em>cestera,\u201d which concludes the paper, is undoubtedly in lieu of mere formal and supererogatory Words, declaring all former wills, conflicting with it, to be revoked, &amp;c. Unless it is contended that no will can be established which has an interlineation, erasure or obliteration in it, I presume that the before mentioned obliteration, in this case, touching the outstanding debts, (and which, it is proved, was made before it was delivered to <em>Ferguson </em>to write a will by,) cannot be objected; and the two unimportant and expletory words, (now erased,) were added by the express desire of the testator, and are, therefore, as if they had been written by him. The subsequent act of <em>Ferguson </em>in erasing those words from the paper, certainly cannot affect the question before Us.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">This paper, thus adequate <em>per se, </em>at the time, to pass the personal estate, as a codicil, and wanting only a signature to become competent to pass the land; this paper, containing the <em>final </em>settlement of the testator\u2019s mind, touching the disposition of the interests therein devised and bequeathed; thus corrected by the obliteration aforesaid, respecting the outstanding debts, the most important part whereof, it is <em>proved, </em>(and thus the obliteration is well accounted for,) he meant to bequeath to the <em>same </em>legatees fey a <em>subsequent </em>release or codicil; this paper, which the testator erroneously <em>supposed, </em>or supposed through abundant caution, wanted <em>form, </em>was delivered to his friend <em>Ferguson </em>to receive that <em>form, </em>from his pen. It would have been a happy circumstance, (so far as it is desirable that the <em>will </em>of testators respecting the disposition of their property, should, unhesitatingly, be suffered to take effect; so far as it is highly to be desired that litigation should be prevented and avoided,) if* instead of this unnecessaiy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>step, (the having it condensed with the original will and cast into form,) the testator had signed the paper in question, and deposited it in his <em>desk; </em>\u00a9r, if you please, in that trunk, or closet, in which its counterpart was found at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">This paper was delivered to Ferguson, <em>together with </em>the executed will of November, <em>180S; </em>thereby appreciating the character of the former paper by the <em>dignity </em>of the latter. The two papers were delivered to <em>Ferguson </em>to \u201c draw a \u201c will byor, in other words, to throw the whole into what was deemed by him a proper form; and the paper-now in question was written by the testator, (who had applied to <em>Ferguson </em>to write his will for him,) in consequence of <em>Ferguson\u2019s </em>telling him it would be best, in order to prevent mistakes, \u201c to put his <em>wishes </em>upon the subject \u201c into writing.\u201d The paper was not, therefore, a mere plan <em>ox projet </em>of a will, depending upon the unsettled will or caprice of the writer, but contained his deliberate and settled intention respecting the disposition of his estate. It was not thrown aside, (as was the case of the paper in question in <em>Warner and </em>Matthews, a case to be more particularly noticed hereafter,) among useless and ordinary papers, but was delivered to his most confidential friend, together with another (perhaps his <em>most </em>important) paper, for the purpose of being cast into <em>form ; </em>and although the very paper now in question was permitted by the testator to be <em>retained </em>by this friend, after the draught of the will was rendered to him by Ferguson, (undoubtedly because he expected, that, by executing the draught, the <em>original </em>would become of no consequence,) yet his appreciation of that <em>original </em>may be estimated by his appreciation of its counterpart, which he deposited in, perhaps, one of the most secure places he possessed. It is certain that, on this ground, as well as on that of its <em>final </em>character, (as far as it goes,) this paper will stand a very advantageous comparison with the cases of <em>notes for </em>wills, with which the books abound; as will be, hereafter, more particularly noticed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>These papers were delivered, to <em>Ferguson </em>\u201c to draw a will \u00a3\u00a3 byand \u00abalthough he says that he did not consider the paper <em>as a will, </em>\u201c but only as a memorandum to write a S\u00a3 will by(an opinion taken up by the witness, not only from the <em>popular </em>acceptation upon this subject, but because the paper, embracing also lands, and not being executed according to the statute, was, <em>as to </em>them, in truth, <em>\u25a0no will/) </em>it is evident, from the whole tenor of his testimony, that he thought himself <em>as little at </em>liberty, in the draught of the will which he made, to depart from <em>this paper </em>as from the <em>original </em>will itself. He tells us, that that draught was (I presume with the exception of <em>form) </em>a <em>verbatim </em>copy of the <em>two </em>papers; and Mr. <em>M\u2018Rae </em>also tells us, he had <em>compared them together </em>and found them to agree, but cannot say that this agreement was entirely <em>verbatim. </em>This exact correspondence shews, in a strong point of view, the sense of this witness, (the drawer,) touching the character of this paper, and that, although he did not consider it as \u201c the will\u201d of the testator, for the reasons just assigned, that it nevertheless contained <em>his final wishes respecting the disposition of his property, </em>as far as it went. The testimony of <em>Archer </em>is also very strong in relation to the testator\u2019s satisfaction with the draughted will, which is a substantial, and perhaps even a <em>literal </em>counterpart of the paper in question. It is to be regretted, that <em>Ferguson </em>did not, in due time, render to the testator a <em>fair </em>copy of the release requested; for then the draughted will would have been signed, in relation to the whole property <em>therein </em>devised and bequeathed, and the release would also have operated as a codicil, in respect of <em>entirely another interest; </em>and thus the whole intention of the testator would have been accomplished. It is evident, however, that, although the testator wished to execute the two papers <em>at the same time, </em>(not expecting to be surprised by death in the mean time, he being proved to have been in good health,) the <em>former </em>was not at all dependent upon the <em>latter, </em>nor was the execution of the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>a necessary condition upon which the execution of the <em>former </em>was to turn. They were entirely independent and distinct transactions, and related to separate and distinct interests. This wish of the testator to sign both papers <em>at the .same </em>time, well accounts, however, for the delay in signing the draughted will, up to the time of his death; and thus, in aid of the other abundant testimony in the cause, powerfully repels the presumption of a change of intention, generally inferable from a long delay in signing a will after it has been prepared. With respect to wills, perseverance, rather than mutation of intention, is the general principle: a <em>long </em>delay of signature, however, is, in general, a circumstance from which to argue a change of intention: but, when that delay is well accounted for, (as in this case,) the general principle remains unshaken, and, in making a construction, will have its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">I will now have a more particular reference to a few authorities touching the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">This paper, or codicil, as relative to the disposal of lands, is justly abandoned by the counsel for the appellants. A will of <em>lands </em>is different from a will of <em>personal estate : </em>it must be executed according to the directions of the statute, being considered as a <em>statutory mode of </em>conveyance.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> With respect to a will of lands, therefore, the <em>identity </em>of the paper, with reference to its actual execution as a will, is important, and the <em>very </em>paper exhibited as the will of the testator must have been executed by him, as and for his last will and testament. Even in this case, however, it is not essential that the paper established should be the identical one <em>intended </em>for his last will; nothing being more clear than that a will of lands duly executed remains in force until revoked by another will also duly executed: an approbation of, and intention to execute <em>another </em>will, is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">A testament of <em>personal goods, </em>however, is said to stand upon a different foundation. A testament is defined to be, \u201c the <em>legal declaration </em>of a party\u2019s intentions, which he \u201c <em>wills </em>to be performed after his death.\u201d<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> In ascertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ing the \u201c legality\u201d of this declaration, we have reference to no statute, but to the principles of the <em>civil law </em>as recognized and adopted, touching this subject, in this country and in Englund.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In ascertaining what is the will of a testator touching his personal estate, we have recourse to no <em>formulae </em>of any act or statute, but to the just and fair construction of the document exhibited as containing it, under all its concomitant circumstances, as far as they can legally and properly be given in evidence, and as regulated by well-established decisions upon the subject. The only <em>desiderata </em>on occasions of this sort, are, that the intention of the testator be settled and final, as far as it goes, and, (in order to avoid peijuries, and the <em>misconceptions </em>of witnesses,) that that intention be declared by a <em>writing </em>made or adopted by the testator. This doctrine of our law finds a strong analogy in the policy adopted by the act of frauds in relation to other cases. Thus far, to <em>prevent these mis</em>chiefs, the rule of decision ought to go; but there is no necessity to extend <em>it any further. To extend the </em>caution any further, while it is not required by any statute, would unnecessarily, (with reference to the <em>reason </em>of the rule,) operate as an abridgment of the right of disposition guarantied to every citizen. A case, (to be presently noticed,) on the grounds of decision in relation to <em>notes </em>for a will, contained under <em>initial letters </em>and <em>unfinished words </em>only, will exhibit an excellent commentary upon this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The decisions upon this subject inform us, that a testament, though not signed by the testator, and although written by another person, if according to his directions and approved by him, is binding, and this although no witnesses are present at its publication.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> As to the <em>identity </em>of the paper, with reference to the pne intended to be the last executed, the numerous cases in \"which notes for wills have been established, shew <em>that </em>to be unimportant. Upon this point of identity, I conceive there is no difference between a devise of lands and a will of personal estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Whilej in both cases, it is necessary that the will <em>submitted </em>to the Court be executed, or adopted, as the case may be, according to the law as applying to the different instruments, (that is, that the former be <em>signed, </em>or executed, pursuant to the statute, while the latter need only be sanctioned <em>as the will, </em>and be <em>evidenced </em>by writing,) it is not necessary, in either case, that the will submitted was the last that was <em>intended </em>to be executed. In both cases, the will submitted is to prevail, unless a posterior will was not only <em>contemplated, </em>but actually executed, <em>prout </em>the different laws relating to the several subjects. In the case of a will of personalty, such a will remains in force, (under our statute,) until legally revoked by another will <em>in writing, </em>conforming in other respects to the law as established on the subject. The question is, therefore, not whether the will submitted for probate is the last will the testator <em>intended </em>to execute, but whether, being once sanctioned as a will, it has been nullified by any subsequent act or testament.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">With respect to the <em>draughted will, </em>now lost, but which is proved to have been <em>totidem verbis, </em>with the codicil in question, that paper is proved also to have received the sanction of the testator. In sanctioning <em>that paper, </em>if precisely agreeing with this, the testator also sanctioned <em>this </em>paper, as and for his will and testament; and, <em>e converso, </em>the reception of <em>this </em>will equally sanction <em>that, </em>if it shall ever be produced, and were in fact, as it is described to have been, by the witnesses.' The codicil now before us, standing by itself, is amply sufficient, and is no how impugned but by the testimony of witnesses: but that testimony must be taken altogether: and so taken, that will, as now understood, was no <em>revocation </em>of this codicil j but only a <em>duplicate </em>or <em>republication </em>of it. I shall presently have occasion to cite some authorities which establish this position beyond all controversy. But <em>that </em>will is not now before us, sitting as a Court of Probate; and however admissible it may be to receive testimony respecting <em>its </em>con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>tents, </em>in order to fortify <em>this </em>will, by shewing that the disposition purported by <em>this </em>will, continued to be that intended by the testator, even up to the time of his death, it is certainly irregular to resort to such testimony, (even li it were entirely different from what it is,) to overthrow the will before us; thereby <em>invading </em>the province of <em>another forum, </em>(the Chancery, to whom it belongs to set up that trill as a <em>lost </em>will, and, in that proceeding, to estimate the <em>credibility </em>and weight of the testimony respecting its contents ;) and of <em>this </em>forum, (the Court of Probate,) if the <em>xvill itself </em>shall ever hereafter be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Referring, particularly, to the cases cited in the argument in which <em>notes for wills </em>have been established, and in which this objection respecting <em>identity </em>certainly existed, and did not prevail; I will briefly cite a few authorities on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In 7 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>338. it is held, that where <em>A. </em>being ill desired <em>B. </em>to make her will, who wrote down only <em>names </em>and <em>initial letters </em>to this <em>effect, </em>viz. \u201c To <em>Tho. West, 200l. </em>\u201c to <em>Jo. Dev. 100l, </em>to <em>Rob. Cro. </em>50l.\u201d &amp;c. which being more than her estate amounted to, <em>B. </em>made an alteration in the second column, by <em>subtracting </em>parts of the sums bequeathed, and then told <em>A. </em>the sense of the proposed devises, and <em>A. </em>was heard to declare that \u201c all was well,\u201d thereby indicating her satisfaction therewith; <em>B. </em>went to a scrivener to have the devises drawn out <em>at length, </em>and <em>in form, </em>and, before he returned, the testatrix died; the Judge below pronounced in favour of <em>this </em>will; but, upon appeal to the delegates, the decision was reversed. It was reversed, however, only on the ground, that the bequests not being written <em>at length, </em>the will was not <em>substantive </em>in itself, but to take <em>its sense </em>from the interpretation of the witnesses ; that it was, in effect, a <em>nuncupative </em>will, and, <em>as such, </em>not having the requisite number of witnesses, was void. <em>The ground of this reversal </em>proves the truth of the doctrine I contend for. If the imperfect notes for a will in this case had been written at length so as to obviate the objection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>danger of perjury, and of mistakes arising from the mislaterpretation' of the witnesses, no objection on account of form, or of its not being the the <em>identical </em>paper intended to have been ultimately signed as the will, would have prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\">In the case of <em>Habberfield </em>v. <em>Browning, </em>cited in <em>4 </em>Vesey, jun. 200. and also in <em>Roberts on Frauds, </em>p. <em>451. </em>where a woman having considerable real and personal paoperty, <em>wrote a very ignorant </em>letter <em>to </em>her attorney, giving him an account how she would dispose of her estate, and added, \u201c Please not to put this <em>rigmaroll </em>in till I send it correct; \u201c this only by way of <em>memorandum, </em>in case I should go off \u201c suddenlyshe lived three or four months after, but took no further steps relating thereto: the Court of Delegates reversed the sentence of Sir <em>George Hay, rejecting </em>this will, and <em>established </em>it. It was established, although it was objected that this was only a <em>conditional </em>paper, depend* ing on the testatrix\u2019s \u201c going off suddenly,\u201d and although a change of intention might be inferable, (and was not rebutted by counter-testimony,) from the lapse of time between the writing of the letter and the death of the writer.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">If not bound down by the established law on this subject, I might myself perhaps have <em>boggled </em>a little at these decisions: but I do not find that they have been overruled; and they certainly very far outgo the case at bar; not only in dispensing with form, but' in admitting to probate as wills, writings far less final and perfect than the paper before us.</p>\n<p id=\"A-no\">I infer, therefore, incontestably, that there may be a \u201c legal declaration of a person\u2019s intentions respecting what \u201c he <em>wills </em>to be performed touching the disposition of his \u201c goods after his death,\u201d notwithstanding the paper containing such declaration was neither written by himself, nor is the very paper he intended in future to execute or adopt as his will, and which he would probably have executed, had not a premature death prevented. All that is requisite is, (and, here, the maxim, \u201c <em>non jus esse in </em>tabulis,\u201d seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to apply,) that his <em>zvill </em>touching the subject be settled, and that it be <em>declared </em>by a writing made by him, or with his consent and by his direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The case of <em>Matthews v. </em>Warner, 4 <em>Ves. 187. </em>has been relied upon, in opposition to the probate of this paper. In that case, the paper in question was indorsed and entitled} a \u201c <em>plan </em>for a- willwhence might be inferred that it was a mere <em>projet; </em>it was not delivered to any friend or scrivener, to be cast into form ; but, on the contrary, was kept by the writer, <em>unpublished </em>as his will, for more than five years, whence a <em>change of intention </em>was inferable; such change was also actually shewn to have taken place? not only by the existence of a posterior <em>unfinished </em>and repugnant will, made four years after, but by very many cfe<em>clarations </em>of the testator; and indeed the deplorable state of insanity, into which one of the principal legatees had fallen, (who was also very opulent,) made it highly improper, (and it was often so declared by the testator,) that the first will should remain in force. Besides; this will was found loose in his office, among many unimportant and <em>official </em>papers, whereas the <em>unfinished </em>will was found <em>in his private bureau. </em>Under these circumstances, it seems to me, I confess, highly improper, that that paper should have been established: and yet it was established, (on appeal,) by the delegates <em>; </em>thus manifesting, in a remarkable degree, (and that at a modern period, (in 1798,) the overruling liberality of the <em>English </em>Courts, in favour of testamentary dispositions of chattels. It is true a commission of review was granted, as to this decision; but I am not informed, by the books, what ultimately became of the case. It is true also, that the Chancellor, in giving his opinion for granting the commission of review, delivered sentiments rather less liberal touching the subject, than those which had prevailed in the Court of Delegates. Every thing he said, however, is to be referred to the actual case depending before him; and the principal grounds of his dissent from the judgment in question were, the <em>place </em>where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>paper was found, and the other circumstances before inenti\u00b0ned? shewing, that this, <em>at the time of the death of the </em>testator, \u201c was no will, but only a <em>projet </em>of a will; that It \u201c was not a complete definite rule and law for settling his \u201cfortune.\u201d This case,, therefore, is entirely misconceived, when it is supposed to obstruct the probate of the paper now in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><em>Roberts on Frauds </em>has been cited to shew that greater strictness is now required in relation to <em>informal </em>wills, than formerly. I am not acquainted with the merit of this work, but will join issue in recurring to his authority. In p. 453. he says, (as his opinion of the modern doctrine on this subject,) \u201c that it is not every scrap of paper that a man \u201c writes in contemplation of death that will be received as \u201c testamentary, but it must appear, (and <em>that from the paper </em>\u201c <em>itself </em>and not from <em>extrinsic </em>evidence,) that the writer \u201c intended it to operate as it stood, when written, without \u201c contemplating any further act to be done to give it per- \u201c fection and full authenticity; and this intention every \u201c such paper, if it contains dispositions of personal estate, <em>\u201c </em>prospectively to the <em>decease of the </em>party, will be held to \u201c import, unless <em>by its mode of expression </em>or manner of \u201c execution, it discloses a <em>suspended </em>intention in the party \u201c framing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Applying this doctrine to the case in hand, the paper before us is in itself <em>complete </em>as to the interests thereby embraced ; and it is only by <em>extrinsic </em>evidence that it is shewn, not that the testator meant to vary his dispositions of <em>these </em>Interests, but that he intended to dispose <em>also </em>of other and additional interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In 9 <em>Ves. </em>244. <em>Coles </em>v. Trecothick, although the point came only collaterally before the Court, the doctrine is also recognized, that, to sustain the objection of the incompleteness of a will, it must appear <em>upon the face of the will </em>that something more was intended to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">With respect to the distinction between a will <em>unfinished </em>\u2022as to a particular disposition, and one finished as to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>disposition, but incomplete as to, or not embracing, other subjects of interest, <em>Swinb. </em>519. is full up to the point. He says, that \u201c when a testator, after he has begun his will, \u201c doth put off or defer finishing thereof until another time, \u201c and in the mean time dieth, See. yet,, concerning those \u201c things <em>already </em>disposed, the testament is not void by <em>our </em>\u201c law, but, otherwise, by die <em>rigour </em>of the <em>civil </em>law; and u that <em>much less </em>is that testament void where the testator, K having declared his <em>whole </em>will, and intending to do no \u201c more at present-, reserveth <em>somewhat </em>to be done at ano- \u201c ther time, and in the mean time dieth; for that, <em>even by </em>\u201c <em>the civil </em>law, in this case the testament is perfect.\u201d The last branch of this position finds an entire correspondence in the actual case depending before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The same writer says, (p. 522.) that, where a draught of a will is found in the testator\u2019s hand-writing, though not signed nor delivered before witnesses, if it seems perfect, AS IF IT DOES NOT BREAK OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE, &amp;c. and if it is found among papers of value, &amp;c. (and, I presume, where delivered to a confidential friend,) by these circumstances the paper seems to be rather a <em>testament </em>than a <em>draught </em>only. This doctrine applies fully to the case before us; except as to the <em>identity </em>of the paper; a circumstance believed to have been already shewn to be entirely unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">With respect to the draught of the will, now stated to be lost, <em>I decide nothing. </em>As to the case before us, that paper is entirely <em>in nubibus. </em>Whenever <em>it, </em>or any other will or codicil, (even the <em>rough copy </em>of the <em>release </em>intended to be executed,) shall be legally <em>set up, or </em>exhibited for probate, the proper tribunal will determine upon its effect and validity. All I need say at present respecting it, (and in this I am justified by the testimony delivered in this case,) is, that if it <em>differs </em>not from the paper in question, it is no revocation of it, but merely a <em>duplicate </em>or republication ; and therefore shall not obstruct its probate. And this also is the case, if it were, even proved to be <em>different, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>unless the particulars of the diversity were set out, so that the Court might see that it amounted to a revocation. In <em>Swinb. </em>525. it is said, that a second testament does not re-, voke a former one, when it doth not dissent therefrom, but <em>agreeable therewith </em>in all points: and in <em>Harwood </em>v. Goodright, <em>Cowp. </em>93. (a very strong case upon this subject,) it is said by the Court, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201c that, properly \u201c speaking, <em>another </em>will cannot exist without there being a \u201c difference, because, if it be exactly the same, it is no more \u201c than a <em>duplicate </em>or <em>republication </em>of the first willit is also held, in the same case, that if the other and <em>different </em>will be found to have been executed, but the Jury do not find <em>wherein the difference </em>consists, the Court cannot infer a <em>revocation </em>of the former will. As to the effect of this second (and lost) will, considered as a <em>duplicate </em>or <em>republication </em>of the former, if it should ever appear and be established, the only difference, with reference to the paper now in .question, would be, that it would be construed to speak with regard to the property <em>held at the date of the </em>republication.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The effect of the republication of a devise of <em>lands </em>might be important; (I speak now without reference to the alteration by our act upon this subject; see <em>Rev. </em>Code, 1 vol. 160. see also the case of <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Al</em>len, 3 Call, 289. upon the construction thereof;) as it might pass lands purchased after the date of the <em>former </em>will, which, without such republication, would not have passed; the principle being that a devise of lands is an <em>appointment </em>to a particular devisee, and is considered as a <em>conveyance ; </em>\u201c whereas, as to personal estate, the law of <em>England </em>has \u201c adopted the rules of the <em>Roman </em>testament, which was an \u201c institution of <em>an heir Cowp. </em>90. <em>Harwood </em>v. <em>Goodright; </em>and, in this view of the case, it would seem that the will <em>republished </em>would have an equal and co-extensive effect, as to chattels, with that by which such <em>republication </em>was effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">I have thus considered this case, as it were, in a double aspect: 1st. Upon the idea that the draught of the will., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>supposed to be lost, had never received the testator\u2019s sanetion, or legally <em>become his will; </em>and 2dly. On the ground that it had, and was now before us, being such, and only such, as it is proved by the witnesses to have been. In the first view, the case is very clear for this codicil: and, in the last, the result is not changed; for, upon the testimony, that draught, agreeing substantially, if not literally, with the paper before us, is not <em>another </em>will, and operates no <em>revocation </em>of this will. I have already said, that if it should hereafter appear, and be found <em>different </em>from this codicil, nothing done by us, in relation to the latter, can affect or impair its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">I conclude by expressing it as my opinion, that the judgment of the District Court ought to be reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b535-6\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AVm\">The sole question before the Court is, whether the paper in the hand-writing of <em>John </em>Cogbill, which was by the County Court of Chesterfield., admitted, and ordered to be recorded, as a codicil., to his will, and rejected by the District Court of Richmond, ought now to be established as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In considering this question it may not be amiss to take a short retrospective view of the situation, circumstances and connexions of the testator, previous to the time of his writing the paper in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">It appears, that being possessed of a considerable estate, both real and personal, and having neither wife nor child, but several nephews and nieces, descendants of his brothers, <em>Jesse </em>Cogbill, and <em>George </em>Cogbill, he, on the 9th of November, 1805, duly made and published his last will and testament, written with his own hand, which has been admitted to record, and is now before this Court : in which will he manifested a great partiality for the children of his deceased brother <em>Jesse </em>Cogbill, by giving them the whole of his estate, chargeable only with the payment of his debts. A few months after the date of this will, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>favourite nephew, <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill </em>(to whom he ha\u00e1 given specifically, the greater part of his estate, and made him his residuary legatee and one of his executors,) depaxtec^ this life? leaving a widow, <em>Sally </em>Cogbill, and an only daughter, named <em>Sally Nelson Cogbill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Upon this unfortunate event in the family, the testator thought it expedient to make another will; and for that purpose, gave verbal instructions to his friend <em>James Fer</em>guson, (whom he requested to write the will) with respect to the alterations to be made, in consequence of the death of his favourite nephew ; which instructions <em>Ferguson, </em>in the course of his testimony, said he immediately committed to writing; which writing was produced by him on his second examination, and is now in Court, with an indorsement on the back of it, \u201c to prepare a rc- \u201c lease from <em>John Cogbill </em>to the heirs of <em>Jesse </em>Cogbill, for a the amount of the within deed of trust, and in the will to \u201c be written, omit the whole clause respecting the deed \u201c trust. Ask Mr. <em>Gregory </em>in what manner the said release \u201c ought to be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">This memorandum is supposed to have been taken from one on the back of a deed of <em>trust </em>(in the course of the evidence called a mortgage) from <em>Jesse </em>Cogbill, to secure a debt due from him to the testator. Some time after <em>Ferguson </em>had committed to writing the oral instructions of <em>John Cogbill </em>(but how long after does not appear) the latter (about seven or eight months before his death) put into the hands of <em>Ferguson </em>his will, executed before the death of <em>Thomas N. </em>Cogbill, together with the paper, now the subject of controversy ; and requested him to prepare a will from the two papers ; which <em>Ferguson </em>says he accordingly did, and presented it to the testator, who after twice reading, approved of it, but postponed publishing it as his will, until he should execute a release, to exonerate the estate of his deceased brother, <em>Jesse </em>Cogbill, from the effect of the said mortgage, or deed of trust..</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">This part of the evidence is corroborated by the testimony of <em>Edward Archer ; </em>but it seems that the writing s* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>prepared and approved by <em>John Cogbill </em>as his last will, though never executed is now lost, and cannot be produred j which brings me to the consideration of the paper now in contest between the parties ; in doing which I shall view it, first, as a paper found in the house of the testator at the time of his death, or in possession of his friend, stand? ing alone on its own authenticity ; and, secondly, with the evidence that has been adduced in explanation and support of it ; in doing which, however, I cannot lose sight of the original will of the testator, nor of the motives that induced him to alter it, it has been already noticed that the deceased <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill </em>was his greatest favourite, his principal legatee, and had been appointed one of his executors : it is natural to suppose then, that upon his death the testator must have contemplated an alteration of his will : it is natural to suppose too, tha|: the family of his deceased nephew and friend, would be the primary objects of his bounty : we accordingly find by the paper in contro? versy, written wholly with the testator\u2019s own hand, that he lent to the widow of <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill, so </em>long as she should remain his widow, the land, negroes, and almost the whole of the estate, before specifically devised to him in fee ; with the remainder of the land and negroes, so lent, to her daughter, <em>Salley Nelson </em>Cogbill, by her deceased husband, <em>Thomas Nelson </em>Cogbill, to her and her heirs forever, and in default of issue of her body lawfully begotten, the said estate to be equally divided between <em>Salley </em>Cogbill, her mother, and his niece, <em>Salley </em>Hill., daughter of his deceased brother, <em>Jesse </em>Cogbill, and sister of <em>Thomas Nelson Cogbill </em>deceased, to them and their heirs forever. And what gives the greater validity to this paper, in my mind, is, that it is written in technical language, and concludes with the following words : \u201c Lastly, I do nominate \u201c and appoint <em>Capt. Charles </em>Graves, <em>Armistead </em>Bill, and \u201c executors of this my last will.\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Those two men, <em>Charles </em>Graves, and <em>Armistead </em>Hill, are executors named in the will that has been admitted to re- ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>cord; and <em>Thomas N. Cogbill </em>was a third executor named in that will, but- he being- dead, a blank was left for the name of another in his stead, if the testator should think proper to fill it up.</p>\n<p id=\"A74\">It is laid down in 2 <em>Blackstone\u2019s </em>Commentaries, 501, 2. that a testament of chattels, written in the testator\u2019s own hand, though it has neither his name nor seal to it, nor witnesses present at its publication, is good, provided sufficient proof can be had that it is his hand-writing ; and though written in another man\u2019s hand, and never signed by the testator, yet if proved to be according to his instructions and approved by him, it hath been held a good testament of the personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"AGT\">A written will when it is written with the testator\u2019s own hand proves itself, and therefore needs not the help of witnesses to prove it ; for if a man\u2019s will be found written fair and perfect with his own hand, after his death, although it be not subscribed with his name or sealed with his seal, or have any witnesses to it, if it be known or can <em>be </em>proved to be his hand, it is held to be a good testament, and a sufficient proof of itself. 5 <em>Bac.

But since the stat. of the 29th of <em>Charles </em>II. and our act of Assembly, it would be good only as to personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">From these authorities, and many more that might <em>be </em>cited, and from the peculiar circumstances of the case before us, I have no doubt but the paper in question, standing on its own authenticity, without the aid of oral testimony, is sufficient as a codicil to pass all the personal estate' it embraces.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ2\">Having shewn, I conceive, that this paper, standing alon\u00e9 is of sufficient efficacy, as a codicil, to pass the personal estate therein mentioned ; let us see whether there has been any evidence adduced to destroy or impair its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Th\u00e9 only witnesses examined in this Court (except those to prove the hand-writing of the testator) were <em>James </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Ferguson, Edward Archer, </em>and <em>Archibald FFCrae. </em>The testimony of <em>Ferguson </em>has been already noticed so far as it went to prove, that the paper in question, together with the former will of <em>John Cogbill </em>(which since his death has been admitted to record) was by the testator, about <em>7 </em>or 8 months before his death, put into the witness\u2019s hands with a request, that he would prepare a will from the two papers, which he accordingly did, and some time after presented it to the testator, who approved of it, but postponed executing it as his will,' until he should execute a release of a mortgage he had, on part of the estate of his brother, <em>Jesse Cogbill, </em>deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">There appears in the paper in question, an erasure of several lines, which the witness said was done by the testator himself: the words erased, or attempted to have been erased, however, still remain legible, and are as follow : \u201c together with all my outstanding debts, and all \u201c and every remainder of my estate, both real and personal \u201c of every kind whatsoever.\u201d Although those words still appear legible, they are so far erased as to convince ms that the testator intended to strike them out of the pap er.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The witness also said, that after the papers were delivered to him, he interlined, or added two words, to make a sentence more perfect and grammatical ; but that he had since the death of the testator, erased those words so inter - lined or added <em>; </em>and that the paper now remains precisely as it was, when delivered to him by the testator ; and that in writing the will approved of, but not published by the testator, he inserted the words, <em>verbatim, </em>as they now stand on the paper in controversy. That he had, at the request of the testator, written a release of the mortgage, which he shewed him ; he approved of it and desired him to copy it, which he did, and the testator sent to him for it. That he was at <em>John Cogbill's </em>when he was dying, took possession of the papers, and delivered them to <em>Edward Archer, </em>from whom he again received them and delivered them to <em>Archibald AFCrae, </em>as counsel for the appellants, who exhibited them in <em>Chesterfield </em>Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The witness, On being interrogated by <em>Mr. Hay, </em>further said, that a few days before the testator\u2019s death, he received a verbal message from him, to go and sfee him, and understood froin the messenger, that it was tb write a codicil to his will, but before he went to his house, he was too far spent to do any business. The witness said something further, but spoke so low and indistinctly that I, hearing but iinperfectly, could not understand what he siiid.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\">The testimony of <em>Edward Archer </em>is the same in substance as that of <em>Ferguson, </em>so far as it i-espects the testator\u2019s approving the will that had bee\u00f1 written by the latter, and his postponing the publishing it, until after the release- should have been executed ; and also with respfect to what happened at the testator\u2019s house, about the time of his death ; and the putting the will and other papers into the hands of <em>Mr. M\u2018Crae ; </em>who says that he received them as counsel for the appellants, from the hands of <em>Mr. Ferguson, </em>and exhibited them to the County Court of <em>Chesterfield; </em>but what became of the paper, prepared by <em>Ferguson </em>as the will of the testator, does not appear from any of the-testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">That paper being lost then, and it being in evidence that it was written in the very words of the paper iri controversy, as it now appears before the Court, and as when delivered to <em>Ferguson </em>by the testator, who approved of the draft taken from it, word for word ; and postponed executing it only on account of a release of th\u00e9 mortgage not having been signed, it seems to me that the paper now before us ought to be admitted as a codicil to the testator\u2019s will ; because it was deliberately prepared by himself, and written wholly with his own hand : But great stress was laid in the argum\u00e9nt, on the circumstance of <em>Ferguson\u2019s </em>having received \u00e1 message from the testator, a few days before his death, to write a codicil to his will. To this objection a sufficient answer may be given from Swinburne, 519, 20. where it is laid down that, although there may be imperfection of will respecting the whole testament, because the testator cannot finish the whole according to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>purpose ; yet in respect of that which is done there is no imperfection of will (the perfect is not to be hurt by the imperfect.) And although testators whilst their wills and testaments are in making do, many times, add and diminish, and alter divers things ; yet who is able to say, that concerning this or that particular legacy already given, the testator would have made any addition, diminution or alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">If this reasoning be sound, on general principles, how much more forcibly does it apply in the present case, where the whole of the paper appears in the testator\u2019s own handwriting. I am of opinion, upon the whole, that the judgment of the District Court ia erroneous, and ought to he reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">By a majority of the Court, the judgment of the District Court was reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed <em>; </em>whereby the memorandum was established as a good codicil of personal estate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b526-10\"><em> 2 Bl.
