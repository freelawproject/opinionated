The preamble of the law professes to mak&amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>continental bills of credit a <em>legal </em>tender, and to render them <em>equally current </em>with state bills in the discharge \u25a0of debts, or in the purchase of property. The second section relates exclusively to this subject. The third section confessedly relates to <em>state bills </em>only, when speaking of their currency. \u25a0 It might perhaps be seriously questioned, whether the clause of forfeiture upon a tender and refusal can be extended to <em>continental bills; </em>for since the second section fulfils completely what the preamble promises respecting the currency of the continental bills, and their capacity to become the subject of a legal tender, and the third section respects <em>state bills </em>alone, until the clause of forfeiture is introduced, it may fairly be contended, that the words &lt;! if any persons after &amp;c. shall refuse to receive any of <em>the said </em>bills&amp;c. refer to <em>state </em>bills, the immediate antecedent to those words. There would have been nothing unnatural in this discrimination, which should make <em>continental bills </em>only a <em>tender at common </em>law, and fortify the state bills with the additional aid of forfeitures upon those who should refuse to receive them. But if I should be wrong in this construction of the Act, I shall still endeavour to shew, that the refusal of <em>Warder </em>to accept the continental bills which were tendered by <em>Copper </em>did not produce a forfeiture of the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">If the third section extends. to <em>continental bills </em>it comprehends emissions subsequent, as well as those which were <em>prior </em>to the passage of the law. The intention of the law was to give them currency, and to create the fullest confidence in the ultimate goodness of the continental and state money. If, to secure these Important objects, it was thoughtnecessary to denounce the heavy punishment of forfeiture upon those who refused to receive the paper money, the same reason applied with equal force to <em>all the </em>emissions. To discriminate was to defeat the very object of the law. To leave <em>subsequent </em>emissions, crippled for the want of a similar provision, was but half doing the work. If this law does not apply to subsequent emissions as to tender and forfeiture, it does not make those emissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>current, </em>because the <em>same money </em>which is made <em>cur rent, </em>is declared to be a <em>legal tender; </em>and if this be the case, the subsequent emissions of continental bills were for sixteen months not current in that State. But this cannot be contended for, and therefore, the conclusion must be, that the law was meant to include subsequent as well as prior emissions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-7\">After this, the Legislature passed a law in <em>March 1777, </em>directing an emission of 200,000/., and declaring it only a <em>legal tender at common law. </em>This was the first moment, when the Legislature appears to have felt the injustice of the tender law. The legal scale of depreciation had then arrived at two for one; and we all remember, that the actual state of depreciation was greater than that at which the Legislatures of the States, or Congress, afterwards rated it. But when it was afterwards discovered, that tender laws, armed with all the terrors of forfeiture, could not sustain the value of the paper money, or stop the progress of its depreciation, the iniquity of the measure was no longer to be countenanced by arguments of policy. And in <em>May </em>1778, when depreciation had got to five for one, an Act passed, the third section of which declared, \u201c that <em>all bills </em>of credit emitted and made current by resolves of the continental Congress, should pass current in the payment of all debts, in as full and as effectual a manner as the 200,000/. which had been emitted in <em>March; </em>and that the refusal to receive them should subject the parties so refusing, to the same fines, forfeitures, and penalties, as such persons were subject to for refusing any of the said emissions of <em>March.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-8\">It would seem, that this law had entirely rooted out of the code any thing like a tender, other than such as might be made at common law, and had virtually repealed so much of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, as punished the refusal with a forfeiture of the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-9\">But I am aware of the argument which is relied upon by the counsel for the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-10\">It will be contended that the Act of <em>May </em>1778 applies only to emissions of continental bills <em>since </em>Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>ary </em>1777, which it is supposed were not provided for by that Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-5\">I am at a loss for a rule to warrant such a construe-don. The words of the section which I have quoted are as general as they can be: they speak of \u201c <em>all the bills of credit </em>emitted and made current by resolves of Congress.\u201d I cannot perceive a reason for restraining their operation to <em>particular emissions, </em>since, if the Legislature had intended such a discrimination, nothing could have been more easy than to have expressed it in plain language.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-6\">We have in this very law, satisfactory proof, that When the Legislature mean to restrain their expressions, they know how to do it; for in speaking of counterfeits they confine them to the emissions <em>subsequent </em>to <em>January </em>1777, If the same emissions were intended by ihe ihird clause, why did they use a different language?</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-7\">I can never admit the propriety of a constructive exposition of a Statute, where the words are free from ambiguity; it is seldom a safe guide, and can never be tolerated, but when there is no other mode of reaching the intention of the Legislature. For a judge to say, that <em>only some of the bills of credit </em>emitted by Congress shall be a tender as at common law, when the Legislature have declared that <em>all </em>shall, seems to be taking an unwarrantable liberty with the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-8\">The strongest reasons present themselves to my mind against such a construction. For why should the Legislature discriminate between bills emitted on the 28th, and those emitted on the 30th of <em>January </em>? In <em>May, </em>the depreciation of both were equal; it was not more wicked to compel the creditor to receive the one than the other. Policy no more required this extraordinary interference in favour of the prior than of the subsequent emissions. But it would be still more wonderful to discriminate between <em>continental </em>and <em>state bills; </em>to afford what was considered as a protection to the former, whilst it was withdrawn from the latter, This would be to presume a very unna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tural preference in the Legislature to continental over their own money. In short, if the distinction contended for is to be supported, it will be incumbent upon the appellees\u2019 counsel to adduce strong and irresistible reasons for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-5\">Randolph, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-6\">I beg leave to observe in addition to what has been said, that I shall question the' power of a <em>Virginia </em>Court to enforce the penal laws of <em>Pennsylvania </em>or of any other State. I admit, that in <em>civil </em>cases, the Courts of one country will execute the judgments, or legislative acts of another; but the law in question is highly penal; and is besides so far local, that it only prevents the right of recovery in the <em>Courts of that </em>State, but does not <em>abolish the debt. </em>The principle which is stated in the case of <em>James </em>v. Allen, 1 <em>Dallas\u2019s Rep. </em>188, applies with double force to' the present; which depends upon the <em>penal laws </em>of a foreign country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-7\">I shall also insist, that if the third section of the Act of <em>Januojry </em>1777, comprehends <em>continental </em>bills, the requisites of the Act as to making the tender, were not complied with by Copper. The debt in question was due to three persons, not associated together as partners in trade, but as joint tenants. The words of the law are, <em>l( </em>if any person or persons shall refuse,\u201d from which I understand, that to produce a forfeiture, the tender should have been made to all three, since if any one had received the money, it would have avoided the forfeiture; and because <em>one </em>refused, are the whole to lose the rights which belonged to them ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-8\">In some cases, the act of one, is (by a fiction) presumed to be the act of others, though not concerned directly or indirectly in it; but this never happens, where such a fiction is necessary for the enforcing of a penalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adh\">But at all events, the part of <em>J. Warder </em>only (to whom the tender was made) was forfeited, for it is laid down in <em>Co. Litt. </em>186, that a forfeiture by one joint tenant extends only to his own interest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Lee, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-3\">This debt was contracted in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and _ therefore, if it hath been discharged by the laws of that State, it can never be recovered in this. <em>Bro. C. C. </em>376. The case of <em>James </em>v. <em>Allen </em>does not oppose this doctrine. It is in no respect analogous; the insolvent law of <em>New Jersey </em>did not <em>extinguish </em>or <em>discharge </em>the demand of the plaintiff; the debt still remained, and followed the person of the defendant, although that person had been <em>discharged from impri</em>sonment. It was therefore no bar to an action for a claim yet existing in another State. In this case, if I should be correct in the construction of the <em>Pennsylvania </em>laws, the debt itself was absolutely discharged. It is also to be remarked, that in the case of <em>James </em>v. <em>\u25a0Allen, </em>the jurisdiction of <em>Pennsylvania </em>had attached upon <em>Allen </em>before his discharge in <em>New Jersey. </em>Besides, by the agreement made in this cause, the judgment of the Court is to be founded upon the <em>laws of that State. </em>The words of the Act \u201c that the creditor should be for ever barred from suing in any Court of that State,\u201d were <em>tautologous; </em>for if the debt was discharged and forfeited by the tender and refusal, no action could have been maintained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-4\">I come now to the construction of those laws which must decide this question. The ground-work of the argument for the appellants is, that no discrimination between the prior and subsequent emissions of Congress, or between continental and State bills was intended. This is mere conjecture, unwarranted, as I conceive, by any thing growing out of the laws themselves. To discriminate between the different kinds of paper money was usual in all the States. That the Legislatures had such a power is not questioned; and if they exercised it, it is immaterial what were the motives which led to it. There were two modes of raising money in the <em>United States, viz. </em>by emissions and by loans. It was reasonable to expect, that when redemption should take place, it would be regulated by the value of the money when it was emitted. This has actually been practised by Congress as to loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>office certificates; and if this rule was a just one in the re-payment of money borrowed from individuals, it was equally so as to money paid by the <em>United States </em>to individuals, for articles furnished or services performed to the public. I premise this, for the purpose of shewing, that in the contemplation of men, the different periods at which emissions were made, was important ; and it furnishes a strong reason for the discrimination, which I contend upon the just construction of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, was intended between the emissions of continental, bills prior to that time, and such as might afterwards be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-8\">The Legislature in this very law discriminate between the different sorts of their own paper money; for the third section does not include <em>all the State money </em>which was then current. At this time the different States entertained considerable jealousies with respect to Congress, and it was hardly to be expected, that they would be so forward in passing laws to support their money, as to furnish it with these extraordinary aids before it was created.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-9\">It is contended, that the third section of this law does not comprehend continental bills. The Court will consider the whole law together, without regarding the mode in which the entire subject is subdivided into sections. The preamble declares the great necessity there was for making continental and State bills a tender in all payments, and that they should be <em>alike </em>taken in discharge of debts. In pointing out the means of producing this <em>likeness, </em>the subject is arranged into different sections; but surely this cannot change, or affect the spirit and intention of the law. \u201c Said bills,in the third section, must refer to the bills which had before been mentioned, and declared a legal tender; and those were <em>continental </em>as well as <em>State.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-10\">The Act of <em>March </em>1777 does not in any part of it relate to that of <em>January 1777', </em>the sixth section refers to the 200,000/., and to no other State money, and as It is admitted, that this clause speaks only of a tender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ateommon law, the Legislature again discriminate between the different kinds of their <em>own money.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-3\">Thus the laws stood at the time the Act of <em>May </em>1778 was passed 5 at this period, there were emissions of continental bills in circulation, which had been made since <em>January </em>1777, and which of course, having not been noticed in that law, required the aid of the Legislature to make them a tender; for this purpose only could the third section of that law have been intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-4\">It is contended that this law virtually repeals the third section of the Act of <em>January </em>1777. Upon what rule of law is this argument founded ? I have always supposed, that if, there be two <em>affirmative </em>Statutes, between which there is no collision, that the one does not repeal the other. A constructive repeal is never to be admitted, if, by a fair interpretation of both Statutes, they may consist together, and both be rendered effectual. Now, there is no inconsistency in confining the operation of the <em>last law </em>to emissions <em>subsequent </em>to <em>January </em>1777, and the <em>first </em>to emissions <em>prior </em>to that period. \u201c All the bills of credit,\u201d in the third section, will then mean, <em>all such as have not been before provided for by the Legislature. </em>Or if these words be so broad that they must include the emissions prior to January, there may be another construction given to them, without forcing us upon the dangerous experiment (for such it must always be unless warranted by absolute necessity,) of repealing laws by implication. It was doubtful whether continental bills of credit were a tender at common law, unless declared to be so by an express Statute. A declaration of this sort was even thought necessary as to the 200,000/. of State bills. Now, though the Act <em>q\u00ed January 1777 </em>had made a tender and refusal under certain restrictions a forfeiture of the debt, yet it might have been doubted, whether this had made continental bills of <em>prior </em>emissions, a tender at <em>common law. </em>The intention therefore of the third section of the Act of <em>May </em>1778, if it refers to all the emissions of continen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tal bills, might have been to make the whole of them a tender at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-9\">All the reasoning on the other side, to prove that the Legislature could not have intended a discrimination between the different emissions of continental bills, is answered by the laws themselves ; for it must be admitted, that a tender and refusal of the State money, emitted by resolves of the late Assemblies, and on loan, prior to February 1777, produced a forfeiture of the debt, which was not the case with the emission of <em>March </em>1777, and if so, what reason can be urged against a similar discrimination between continental bills ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-10\">On the other hand, if the Act of <em>May </em>1778 repeals the third section of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, great injustice would follow. It would operate as an <em>ex post facto </em>law, as to those, who, after <em>January </em>1777, may have sold their estates on credit, under an expectation of being able with the money to discharge the debt they owed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-11\">The case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hocker, </em>1 <em>Dallas\u2019s </em>Rep. 406, decided in the Supreme Court of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>is decisive upon this point, and will be regarded by this Court as an authority entitled to its respect; I will not say it is binding upon this Court. But since we are discussing a question which grows out of <em>Pennsylvania </em>Statutes, and it is admitted that if this very case had been decided in that Court, it would have <em>bound </em>this, a decision of a similar question in that Court will be adopted here, unless it be obviously wrong. Much more will it be adhered to, when the single question is, the construction oflaws attended with considerable ambiguity. Extraneous circumstances are often called in to aid the interpretation of a doubtful Statute, and the lights drawn from thence must have been more clear to a <em>Pennsylvania </em>Court, than they can be to the Courts of any other State. Having said thus much for the decision, which is complete upon the very point in discussion, I have only to add, that this book is considered as authority in the <em>Pennsylvania </em>Courts, and as such will be respected in this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>It is contended, that this Court will not execute the penal laws of other States ; be s\u00ed so. But there is a wide difference between an action instituted to <em>enforce </em>a penalty, and a <em>defence </em>which goes to <em>avoid the payment of a </em>debt, extinguished by the operation of existing laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-3\">It is said, that the tender ought to have been made to all the obligees. When the Legislature speak of a <em>tender properly made, </em>they use a technical term, which for its explanation must be referred to the common law ; the consequences only are statu tary. Now we all know, that at common law, a tender to one of three joint obligees is sufficient, and a refusal by one, suspends the interest as to all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-4\">It is admitted by Mr. <em>Randolph, </em>that a tender to one would be a discharge as to the interest of that one; if so, all must be discharged, because that one could not join in the action if his interest were gone, and it is clear, that the other two could not maintain the action whilst the other was alive. In cases of joint debts or duties, the act of one is the act of all; payment to one is payment to all, and so too is the refusal of one, the refusal of all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-5\"><em>Randolph. </em>\u2014 I shall consider this question under three heads.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-6\">1. If the Act of <em>January </em>1777 be penal, as I shall endeavour to prove it is, it ought not to be executed now, and here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\">2. Under the just construction of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, continental bills are not comprehended in the third section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-8\">3. If comprehended, the forfeiture there contemplated, is done away by the subsequent laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-9\">1. The principle, that the Courts of one country will not execute the penal laws of another, is not denied. But it is said that the attempt made by the defendant is not to <em>enforce a </em>penalty, but to <em>avoid the payment of a debt </em>discharged by force of a Statute. Substantially, it is the same thing. Suppose, that instead of abolishing the debt, a penalty equal to the same amount had been denounced, in case of tender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>and refusal. What difference would there be between attempt to enforce this penalty, and a defence, which claims the benefit of a forfeiture of the whole debt. In both cases there is a penalty; in both the Court is called upon to give it effect. . Suppose the punishment denounced upon the refusing creditor had been attainder or outlawry; would this Court have sustained such a plea in bar of <em>Warder\u2019s </em>suit? It surely would not</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\">This is a personal action, and in its nature transitory; it is not fixed to the soil of Pennsylvania, but may be sued for any where. Suppose the creditors and debtors had been citizens of <em>Virginia, </em>and being in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>the tender and refusal had there taken place. It is clear that it could not have been pleaded as a bar to this suit, although Mr. <em>Lee\u2019s </em>argument would lead to a different conclusion. I admit, that <em>Warder\u2019s remedy </em>was gone in a <em>Pennsylvania </em>Court, but his <em>right </em>was not extinguished ; for if it were, why does this Act give the debtor a remedy to recover his bond from the creditor ? It could be for no other reason, than because the Legislature supposed there remained a latent right which might be asserted in some other country. If I am correct in this, the case of <em>James </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>(so far as that, or any other decision of a <em>Pennsylvania </em>Court can be considered as authority here,) is in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">It is contended, that the clause of the law which ousts the right to sue in the Courts of <em>Pennsylvania </em>was tautologous. If so, there is nothing else in the law which would give to a tender and refusal any other effect than a tender at common law. The agreement made at the trial of this cause refers not only to the <em>Pennsylvania </em>Acts of Assembly, but leaves the case open to the operation of general law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">The case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hocker </em>is considered as conclusive. As authority, I deny it. It is the decision of a Court, which, though supreme in name, is but subordinate in fact. The judgments of that Court were subject to revision in a Superior Court, and this very case may have been reversed for any thing that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>know to the contrary ; for the decision was made iti 1789, and there are no reparrs of cases in the High . Court of Errors and Appeals since the year 1788. Neither can I agree, that that Court had more lights, or was from its situation more competent to decide upon the construction of a <em>Pennsylvania </em>Statute, than this, or any other Court of equal ability would be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-3\">I come 2dly, to the construction of the Act of <em>January </em>1777. The second section of the law does no more than establish the currency of the continental bills. It is contended, that the third section is connected with, and operates upon the second. That two distinct sections of a Statute, which is to be <em>liberally </em>construed, maybe connected and melted together, I do not deny. But it is otherwise in laws which impose <em>penalties and forfeitures. </em>Suppose, that instead of the forfeiture spoken of in the third section, it had been fine and imprisonment; would not the Court have been tied down to a strict construction ? And would it have been proper to go out of one section into another, for the purpose of hunting after penalties ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-4\">The 3d section begins by declaring, \u201c that State bills shall be considered as a legal tender, and shall be received in payment of debts according to the sum specified in <em>said bills P </em>What bills ? Why surely <em>State bills, </em>because the value of continental bills had been fixed by the second section. When the law goes on to speak of a refusal of <em>said bills, </em>it must necessarily apply to <em>State bills, </em>which were clearly meant before, and were alluded to in the same clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-5\">For this discrimination, (which I think was intended,) a sufficient reason may be assigned. The State bills had been issued under the <em>regal government, </em>and fortified by taxes for their redemption ; this u?as not the case with the <em>continental </em>money. The superior value of fhe State money was afterwards acknowledged by the Legislature, when they passed a law to prevent that money from being locked up, and preserved on account of its supposed value over other State money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">But if the third section does extend to continental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>bills, I insist, that the requisites of the law have not been complied with. I object that the tender was made to one of the obligees only ; it is answered, that at common law, a tender to one is a tender to all, and that so it must be under this Statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-8\">I admit the principle, if the bond be in the posses\u00bb sion of the obligee to whom the tender is made; but I deny the conclusion, even if this fact appeared. Where a tender and refusal is to produce a forfeiture of the debt, the act of one is not binding upon all. If it be, I am at a loss to understand the meaning of the words \u201c person or persons\u2019\u2019 connected with what follows, \u201c that he, she, or they, shall be barred from suing,\u2019* See. I admit that payment to one, would be payment to all, for that would be a <em>satisfaction </em>of the debt; payment could not be made to all. But where a forfeiture was to be the consequence of a refusal, the tender ought to have been made to all, because if one refused, another might not, and thereby the forfeiture might have been saved. It is said, that if one be barred, the others cannot sue. This is not admitted. If one obligee be outlawed or attainted, the others may sue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-9\">The next law which I shall consider is, that which passed on the 23d of <em>March </em>1778, page 115 of the <em>Pennsylvania </em>laws, and which, though not stated in the pleadings, may be referred to under the agreement. At this time, there were three sorts of State money current in <em>Pennsylvania: </em>1st. the emissions by resolves of the late Assemblies, during the proprietary government; 2d, emissions on loans by the Act of Assembly of the 26th of <em>February </em>1773, which was also during the former government; and 3dly, the emission of the 20th of <em>March </em>1777.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-10\">The two first classes are called in by the law under consideration, and are to be exchanged for the emissions of the third class. Of course, there was no State money remaining in circulation except the 200,000/., and none which could be tendered under the Act of <em>January </em>1777. Would it not be wonderful then, that the Legislature should leave the continental bills un - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>der the operation of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, strengthened and supported by forfeitures, and permit their. own to languish under the less efficient qualities of a tender at common law ? The Legislature supposing, that continental money was assisted only by the second section of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, do, by the joint operation of this law; and that of <em>March </em>1777, place all the State money upon the same footing with the continental. And having done this, the Act of <em>January 1777, </em>was no longer necessary, and is repealed by that part of the law now under consideration, which repeals, \u201c each and every <em>of the Acts of General Assembly, </em>by which the State money issued by the legislative authority of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>under the authority of the crown of <em>Great Britain, </em>or any part thereof, <em>had been made </em>current.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-3\">3d. point,- \u2014 But if this be not the operation of those laws, and if the third section of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, does refer to the second, then I contend, that the Act of <em>May </em>1778, does completely repeal so much of it as makes a tender and refusal of any continental money a forfeiture of the debt. The words of the laiv &amp;re general; if a discrimination between prior and subsequent emissions had been intended, it could easily have been expressed. The fourth clause is a proof that the Legislature knew how to limit their expressions to posterior emissions when they wished to do so. But if, as I have before contended, the Act of <em>March </em>1778, repealed that of <em>January </em>1777, then we perceive a sufficient reason for the general expression used in the Act of <em>May </em>1778.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b383-4\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhS\">This contract having been made in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>without a view to a performance in any other State, the agreement made upon the trial of the cause referring to those laws, was an act of supererogation, and entirely unnecessary 5 for it is clear, that the laws of that country where a contract is made must govern the fate of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The rule which I have just mentioned is laid down in the case of <em>Robinson </em>v. Bland, 2 Burr. 1679. and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>well explained and illustrated in <em>Eonblanque\u2019s </em>excel\u00bb lent <em>Treatise of </em>Equity, 2 vol. page 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\"><em>It </em>is true, that the laws of one country, have not in themselves an <em>extra territorialforce </em>in any other; but by the general assent of nations, they are always <em>regarded </em>in contracts formed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">A distinction however is attempted in this case, under the idea, that this is a <em>penal laxo, </em>and that the Courts of one country will never execute the penal laws of another. The principle is true, but inapplicable. The Law of 1777, points out a mode of <em>discharging debts </em>different from that which is customary; it may produce an injury, but it is not therefore penal. The case cited from <em>Bro. C. C. </em>376, is in principle like this. <em>Payment </em>in depreciated paper money, was a penalty, (under this interpretation o\u00ed the word,) in <em>South Carolina ; </em>beyond what existed in <em>England; </em>yet the <em>lex loci </em>prevailed. The only difference between that and this case is, that in that, the loss was partial, in this total, but the principle is precisely the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">We are now to inquire, how the law of <em>Pennsylvania </em>stands upon this subject. The Act of <em>January </em>1777, in the preamble declares, \u201c that the emissions of continental and State bills ought to be <em>alike </em>taken in discharge of debts,\u201d &amp;c. To effect this, it was necessary to make them <em>alike in all those qualities, </em>which were any ways connected with the payment of debts. If <em>received by the creditor, </em>they were alike a discharge of so much of the debt. But if a <em>tender </em>and <em>refusal </em>of <em>continental </em>money was not a discharge of the debt, it was not <em>alike taken </em>with State money, because if State money had been tendered and refused, the debt would have been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The third section declares \u201c that the State money,\u201d there described, \u201c shall <em>in like manner </em>be a legal <em>tender, </em>and be received in payment of all debts as aforesaid,\u201d &amp;c. Now' the two descriptions of money would not be alike in their tenderable qualities, if the refusal of one discharged a debt, and the other did not. So that, if the words \u201c said bills\u201d in the next sentence, do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>not refer to continental bills, yet by assigning certain qualities to State bills, they at once attach to continental bills, which it is declared are to be <em>alike taken 'in discharge of </em>debts, <em>and to be in like manner a legal tender.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\">But the sixth section of the law clears the question of all doubt as to the operation of the third clause, upon continental bills. It declares, 6e that where any person stands bound to pay sterling money, the creditor shall receive <em>continental bills </em>of credit, or State bills, in payment thereof at a particular rate, <em>if tendered as aforesaid., and on refusal thereof shall be deemed and taken to be within the meaning of this Act in cases of refusal of the bills of credit in tender as aforesaid.\u201d </em>And there can be no doubt, but that the clear scope of the law was to assimilate continental to State bills in their tenderable quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The next question is, was this Act in force at the time the tender was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">It is argued by the appellants counsel, that the-generality of the expressions in the third section of the Act of <em>May </em>1778, operated a virtual repeal of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, so far as it related to a tender and refusal of continental bills, producing a forfeiture of the debt. It is contended, that the Legislature began then to acknowledge the injustice of the Act of <em>January 1777. </em>Yet in <em>March </em>1778, when it was equally discernable, the Legislature only repeal the law as to State bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Every rule of construction is- opposed to the argument of the appellants counsel-upon the operation of the third clause of the Act of <em>May </em>1778. The Court will never favour the repeal of a law by implication. 4 <em>Bac, Ab. </em>638.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">If there be two affirmative Statutes upon the same subject, the one does not repeal the other, if both may consist together, and we ought to seek for such a construction as will reconcile them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The words <em>all the bills of </em>credit, must be confined to such as had not been before provided for consistently with the intention of the Legislature; and these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>were, the emissions subsequent to the 29th of Janau<em>ry </em>1777. By this interpretation of the words, all the laws are reconciled, and we avoid the necessity of an implied repeal, which, if it had been intended, we ought reasonably to suppose it would have been expressed. The words, \u201c all the bills of credit,\u201d in the case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hooker, </em>were not considered as producing the effect which has been contended for; and though I do not consider myself bound by that decision, yet the authority of it is entitled to respect and fortifies my construction of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Upon the whole, I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Carrington J. \u2014 The only question arises out of the construction of the laws of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>which must assuredly govern this contract, as it was formed in that State, and discharged there, if it be discharged at all. I have read with attention, and have considered all the laws of that State upon this subject, and I entirely concur with the Judge who has precededme, in the construction and operation of them. The appellee having conformed to the Law of <em>January </em>1777, he must enjoy such benefits as that law gave him, unless he was deprived of them by subsequent laws. In <em>March </em>1778, the Legislature called in those emissions which had been made a legal tender by the Act of <em>January </em>1777, and a refusal of which, was declared to be a forfeiture of the debt; but they do not expressly, or by implication, repeal that law, except as to such emissions. The Legislature so far from discovering a disposition to relax at this early period, emitted more money as late as <em>April </em>1781, and declared it a legal tender. The first law which operated a repeal of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, passed in 1781.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">It is contended, that the Act of <em>May </em>1778 virtually repealed it. If the two laws may be reconciled, a constructive repeal is inadmissible, and that they may be, has been already demonstrated by the Judge who has given his opinion. The case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hocker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>is expressly in point, and accords entirely with my sentiments upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">The operation of the Act <em>of Janaury </em>1777, upon this case, has been denied, under an idea, that it is penal, and consequently, not to be enforced by the Courts of this State. But the appellee in this case is not in pursuit of a penalty, and does not ask the <em>aid of the Court to enforce </em>it. He <em>protects himself </em>from the claim of the appellants, by pleading a discharge by the laws of another State having competent power over the subject. I confess that the opinion of Judge Shippen, in the case of <em>James </em>v. Allen, appears an extraordinary one to me: I cannot discover, how the demand in that case could be considered as local. The judgment in <em>New Jersey </em>did, in my mind, completely extinguish the original <em>claim; </em>for suppose the debt had been due by bond, the bond would of course ha\\re been filed in the cause, and though an action of debt might have been maintained upon the judgment yet surely it could not have been upon the original debt, which was merged in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">As a <em>payment </em>to one is a payment to all the joint obligees, so it is clear, that a <em>tender </em>to one is a tender to all; for if this were not the case, it would be almost impossible to make a valid tender, where there were many obligees.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">As to the hardships of this case, we have nothing to do with it. The State has got two thirds of the money, and it would be equally hard, if not more so upon the debtor, if he were now obliged to pay the whole again.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The President. \u2014 -Though very much indisposed, I will endeavour to state the grounds of the opinion which I am to give. The question is, whether the tender and refusal in the present case, produced a forfeiture of the debt according to the laws of <em>Penn</em>sylvania, or whether it operated only as a tender at common law, to stop the interest until again demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">But before I consider the case upon its merits, I will endeavour to clear it of some preliminary objections. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>made by the counsel. The first was, that the Act of <em>1111, </em>should not be regarded by us, because it is penal, so far as it relates to the tender and forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">It seems to be admitted on all hands, that in cases of contracts, the laws of a foreign country where the contract was made, must govern. The same principle applies, though with no greater force, to the di\u00f1e\u00bb ent States of <em>America ; </em>for though they form a confederated government, yet the several States retain their individual sovereignties, and, with respect to their municipal laws, are to each other foreign.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">But this is called a penal law. It may deserve very hard names, but it cannot be called penal. It is not for us to justify the morality of the law, but to understand clearly the legislative will and to execute it. If the law had subjected the creditor to a penalty for his refusing to receive the money, and the <em>debtor were now prosecuting him to recover it, </em>the principle contended for, which I admit to be correct, would then apply. But it is <em>the creditor -who </em>sues, and the defendant pleads a discharge of the debt which is the foundation of the action, under the laws of that country, where the contract was made. It is no more penal, than the Act of Limitations, the Bankrupt Laws, or the like. The decision in the case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hocker </em>is upon the very point, and is complete. Being however a single case, and subject to revision, it has not the authority of a determination of the supreme judiciary of that State, and would not perhaps be considered even there as absolutely binding j but it may with propriety be referred to for illustration, and as such, is entitled to the respect of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AdA\">Upon the merits. The first objection made by the appellant\u2019s counsel is, that the third section of the Act of <em>January </em>1777, must be confined to <em>state bills only; </em>that the words \u201c said bills\u201d refer to them as the next antecedent. However this may be according to the strict rules of grammatical construction, it is not the correct rule of interpreting a Statute. To get at the meaning of the Legislature, we are not confined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>to the order of the sentences, but must take into view the whole law. The Legislature have said enough . to shew that their intention was to place continental and State bills upon the same ground. The second section makes the former current, and receivable in payments and discharge of debts. The third declares, that State bills shall in <em>like </em>manner be a legal tender, and be received in payment. Then follows the effect of a tender and refusal, and the words, \u201c any of the said bills\u201d comprehends each class <em>before mentioned, </em>and cannot be confined to any one of them. It is to be remarked, that in the thirteenth and fourteenth sections of the same law, the former of which declares the penalties for refusing, and the latter for counterfeiting the money, the same expression (\u201c any of the said bills\u201d) is used. Although the subject is divided into sections, I have no doubt but that the spirit, as well as the just exposition of the words of the law, comprehends continental as well as State bills, in the clause which respects the forfeiture. The reason for dividing the subject into sections, is obvious; the second describes <em>at what rate continental dollars </em>should be estimated in <em>shillings </em>and pence, which was not necessary as to <em>State bills.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">We are next to inquire, if this law be repealed expressly, or by implication ? The Act of <em>March </em>1777, directs an emission of 200,000/., and declares it a legal tender. It was of course, a tender only at <em>common law. </em>The tenth section of this law declares, \u00a3t that <em>all bills </em>emitted before the 1st of July, 1759, shall not pass in payment of any debt or demand, except for taxes, See.\u201d but not a word is said respecting <em>continental bills; </em>yet it was contended at the bar, that the words <em>all bills </em>operates a repeal of the Act of <em>January. </em>The rule is, that where there are two affirmative Statutes, if they do not conflict with each other, the latter does not repeal the former. Repeals by implication are never favoured by Courts. Whatever apparent inconsistencies may appear in the declarations of the legislative will, yet it is not decent to\" presume that they would change their mind upon the</p>\n<p id=\"AQi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>subject, without saying so in express terms. But if the two laws are absolutely in opposition to each other, then, since the latter will prevail, the former must of. necessity, be considered as being altered. If however there be different subjects for the two laws to operate upon, there is no inconsistency, and consequently no necessity for presuming an appeal. Now apply these principles to the present case. Continental and State bills were the subject of the first law; that law may still subsist in all its force as to the former, without in the least conflicting with the Act of <em>March </em>1777, which is confined to State bills. The same observations apply to the Act of <em>March </em>1778; it applies to <em>state bills </em>altogether, and was intended to destroy the preference, which the regal money had obtained over that emitted by the State. In the same . manner is the Act of <em>May </em>1778 to be interpreted, which speaks expressly of continental bills. There tv ere emissions prior, and others subsequent, to <em>January </em>1777. The former wer\u00e9 provided for by that Act; the latter were not. This law then may with propriety, and with great reason be applied to the subsequent emissions, by which the necessity of an implied repeal of the first law is avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">But it is contended, that if the Act of <em>January </em>1777, was in force in <em>March </em>1780, the tender was' not made conformably with the requisites of that law; that it ought to have been made to all the obligees. As a payment to one is a payment to all, it as certainly follows, that a tender to one is a tender to all. So a release by one, binds the whole. There were four days of grace allowed, in which time the obligee, to whom the tender was made, might have consulted with the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Upon the whole, I concur with the rest of the Court, that the debt in question was discharged by the tender and refusal, and therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
