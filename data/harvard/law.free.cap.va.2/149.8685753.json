Whereupon the counsel for the plaintiffs moved the Court to instruct the Jury, <em>that no native American Indian brought into Virginia since the year </em>1691, could,, <em>under any </em>circumstances, <em>be lawfully made a slave ; </em>\u201c but the Court refused so to instruct the \u201c Jury, declaring the law tobe, that since the year 1705, no \u201c <em>American Indian </em>could, under any circumstances, be \u201c made a slave; but that from the year 1679 until the year \u201c 1705, <em>Indian </em>prisoners taken in war, might be free pur- \u201c chase to the soldier taking them ; and that from the \u201c year 1682, until the year 1705, <em>Indians </em>sold by neigh- \u201c bouring <em>Indians </em>as slaves, might by law be here held as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u201c such, and that during that interval all servants imported <em>\u201c </em>an&lt;^ brought into this country by sea and land, who were \u201c not Christians in their native country, (except <em>Turks </em>and w <em>Moors </em>in amity with Great-Britain, and others that could \u00ab make due proof of their being free in <em>England </em>or in any \u201c other Christian country before they were shipped for ex- \u201c portation,) were accounted, and were, by law, slaves.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"At5\">To which opinion the plaintiffs by their counsel excepted.

But as the question depended upon <em>manuscript </em>acts of assembly, and property to a very considerable amount was involved in the decision, the Court took time till the present term in order to obtain from the library at Monticello, the copy of a similar act, which was understood to be in the collection of the President of the <em>United States.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">On the part of the appellants it was stated, by Mr. <em>Tay</em>lor, that the only point made in the Court below, was, whether <em>Indians, </em>could, under any circumstances, be lawfully made slaves since the year 1691. That Court decided from a view of the act of 1705, without knowing that the manuscript now produced had an existence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-7\">The whole question depends upon an inspection of this manuscript. If the Court shall be of opinion that the manuscript is genuine, of which there can be no doubt from the internal evidences of its <em>antiquity </em>and authenticity, there is an end of the question ; the act of 1691, being in the very words of the act of 1705, must equally restrict the right of making slaves of <em>Indians.</em><footnotemark><em>(1)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Hay, </em>for the appellees, doubted the authenticity of the law. lie thought it strange that the oldest Judges in.the country should agree that the act of 1705, restricted the right of making slaves of Indians, if one of the same im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>port had existed as early as 1691. But the manuscript act might never have received the royal assent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-9\">Even under tire law of 1705, authorising a free trade with Indians, he had always thought the decision of the Court, in <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Dick </em>and <em>Pat,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>erroneous ; and wished to know whether this Court would now permit him. to controvert that decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-10\">Judge Tucker had no objection to hearing Mr. <em>Hay </em>on the point touching the authenticity of the manuscript act ; but with respect to the decision of the Court, in the case of <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Dick </em>and <em>Pat, </em>the same principle having been settled so long ago by the General Court,<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and many of the Judges transferred to this Court, where the same decisions have been made, he considered it the law of <em>the </em>land confirmed by successive adjudications. He could not, therefore, agree, notwithstanding his respect for the counsel, to hear an argument upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-11\">Judge Roane was willing to hear Mr. <em>Hay </em>at any time as to the authenticity of the law ; but could not agree that solemn decisions of the Court should be stirred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-12\">Judge Fleming was of the same opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-13\"><em>George K.

In short, he considered it a mere matter of inspection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\">Hay, as to the authenticity of the manuscript volume, argued that it had no stamp of official authority, but rather appeared to be the book of a private person. He asked if the Court was prepared to say that a paper which had no evidence of authenticity, except its ancient appearance, should be regarded as the law of the land, when the oldest Judges never knew or thought of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">He understood the opinion of the Court to be, that the book was to be tested by inspection. It was an historical fact that <em>Peter Beverley </em>was appointed clerk in 1688 : and if his signature be examined in several parts of the book subsequent to that period, it will be found, that it could not all be written by him, unless he accustomed himself to write different hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">An argument against the <em>authority </em>of the paper adblitting it to be <em>authentic, </em>was, that there is no evidence that these laws ever received the Loyal assent; and according to the usages of those times, a law was of no validity till that was obtained. He admitted that in more modern times, the legislature undertook to pass laws without any suspending clause. But these were cases, in which the King was npt disposed to interfere, though he had a negative on all the laws passed by the colonial government In page 33 of the MS (1662) it will be found that Sir <em>William, Berkeley </em>was requested by the Legislature of <em>Vir</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>ginia to </em>procure the King\u2019s assent to the laws passed at the preceding session. At a subsequent <em>period,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the negative of the King was admitted. Mr. Jefferson, in his notes on Virginia,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> speaking of the colonial government says, that their laws were of no force till ratified in a general quarter Court of the Company in <em>England : </em>and that the powers of the Company were afterwards suspended by King <em>James, </em>who took the government into his own hands. In the same <em>author,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it will be seen that one of the articles of the convention made in 1651, between the colony and the commissioners, under Cromwell, provided that the Grand Assembly <em>as formerly </em>should convene and transact the affairs of <em>Virginia, </em>&amp;c. which was, that the laws were of no force till they obtained the approbation of the King. In the preamble to our state constitution is a recognition of the fact, that the King had a negative upon the laws under the colonial government. In the Chancellor\u2019s revisal, <footnotemark>(<em>d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it appears that certain acts were suspended till the King\u2019s approbation was known,<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>If wc look into this MS collection, we shall find no suspending clause to any of the acts. Probably they were passed on subjects of little moment, and acted on imrnediately ; or they might have been sent to the King and Council; or, perhaps, not sent at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Now it appears, that even after the contest about the stamp act, a law on the subject of estrays,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> was suspended till the King\u2019s approbation should be obtained : and can it be believed that, in 1691, the legislature would have ventured to pass a law without a suspending clause if it bad not been the known usage of the country that the law was of no avail without the King\u2019s sanction ? We have already seen that in 1681, the Legislature of <em>Virginia </em>passed a law concerning manufactures, which was immediately annulled by the King. At this period, too, it appears that there was -the best understanding between tbe government of <em>Virginia </em>and that of England.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-10\">Another reason why this act never conld have been law, is, that it was never jnserted in any subsequent collection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-11\">The act of 1787,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> for supplying the defect of evidence of the Royal assent only respected laws which <em>had </em>a suspending clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Judge Tucker.

Since the fore, going argument was delivered, the Reporters have discovered in a MSI journal of the proceedings of the Council, in their legislative capacity, a joint address and representation from the Council and House of Burgesses to the King, and separate addresses from each branch of the Legislature to the Governor, agreed to on the 15th and, 16th of <em>April, </em>1752, which exhibit a more satisfactory view of the sentiments of the people of <em>Virginia </em>on those topics than any paper hitherto presented to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">The occasion which gave rise to this controversy was the following : In 1748, the Legislature made a revisal of their laws, which were duly enacted by the Governor, Council, and Burgesses, and transmitted tq the King. <em>Fifty-semen </em>of those revised acts received the Royal assent, and <em>ten </em>were repealed by an order of the King in Council, bearing date at <em>St. James\u2019s, </em>the 31st of <em>October, </em>1751. (See MS journal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Council of <em>Virginia, </em>of <em>April </em>15th, 1752, and the last page of the edition of the laws of 1732, where those <em>ten </em>acts aVe recited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The grievances of which the legislature complained, were, that the lavra repealed by proclamation were not only of great public utility, but that, according to standing instructions to the Governor, \u201cno law could \u201c be re-enacted in the colony, to which the assent of the King or any \u201c of liis predecessors had once been refused, without express leave foi* \u201c that purpose first obtained, upon a full representation to the King and <em>\u201c </em>his commissioners of trade and plantations, of the reason and neces- \u201c sily of passing suchlaw and that by the mere act of <em>giving the Royal assent </em>to fifty-seven of those laws, which from their own nature must require frequent alterations and amendments, it deprived the legislature Of the power of revising, altering, or amending any of them-, without inserting a suspending clause in each act.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">They express their ideas of the King\u2019s prerogative in matters of legislation, in these forcible terms : \u201c That as we conceive, according to <em>\u201c </em>the ancient constitution and usage of this colony, all laws enacted \u201c here for the public peace, welfare and good 'government thereof, and \u201c not repugnant to the laws and statutes of <em>Great-Britain, </em>have always ** been taken and held to be in full force, until your Majesty\u2019s disallow-C! anee thereof is notified here, and that the same may be revised, alter- \u201c eel and amended from time to time, as our exigencies may require. <em>\u201c </em>But that when a law enacted here hath once received your Majesty\u2019s \u201c approbation, and hath been confirmed, finally enacted and ratified, the \u201c same cannot by the Legislature here be revised, altered, oramended, K without a clause therein to suspend the execution thereof till your \u201c Majesty\u2019s pleasure, shall be known therein, even though our neces* \u201csitiesfor an immediate revisal, alteration, or amendment be ever so \u201c pressing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The representation concludes, by praying that the King would signify to his Governor here, that it was not his intention to <em>\u201c </em>fix those confirm- \u201c ed laws so unalterably upon the colony, but that they might be altered \u201c or amended from time to time as the circumstances of the country <em>\u201c </em>might require <em>; </em>provided that they should not be repugnant to the \u201c laws and statutes of <em>Great-Britain, </em>\u201c <em>always having a due regard not to \u201c enact any laws to take effect immediately, that the King had instructed \u201c his Governor not to pass without a suspending clause till the Royal assent </em>\u201c <em>might he had thereto\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Whatever might have been the original <em>chartered </em>lights of the colony, or the <em>limits </em>of the King\u2019s prerogative, it seems that he had in the above instance, at least <em>assumed </em>the power of giving the Royal assent to laws, which, according to the <em>\u201c </em>ancient constitution and usage of the colony,\u201d as understood by the Legislature, required no such sanction. Thus imposingon future Legislatures, even consistently with their own construction of the constitution, the necessity of annexing suspending clauses to alt such acts whenever afterwards it should be found expedient to alter or amend them. It appears, too, <em>from the same </em>representation and addresses that the King' had been in the habit of repealing, by proclamation, some laws enacted by the colonial assembly, and of instructing his Governors not to pass others, without clauses suspending their operation till the Royal assent should be obtained. These facts are not recognised, in the preamble to the state constitution, as the exercise of <em>right?? </em>but complained of as a perversion of the government into a \u201c detesta- \u201c ble and insupportable tyranny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">If the legislative exposition of the ancient constitution of <em>Virginia, </em>as, given in the above extract, be correct, it would at once furnish a reason for submitting the acts of 1662 to the King for his confirmation ; because these acts were evidently a <em>revi sal, </em>and the original laws from which they were selected had probably once received the Royal assent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\"><em> Chan, Rev. </em>p. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-9\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\"><em> </em>2 <em>Burk\u2019s </em>Hist. <em>Virg. 313.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-10\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\"><em> Rev.

Since the last term, Mr. <em>Hening </em>has been furnished with a copy of the same act taken from Mr. <em>Jefferson\u2019s </em>MSS which agrees with the others, with the addition of the words \u201c <em>at all,\u201d </em>repeated before the word \u201c places,\u201d in the enacting clause of the first section, (corresponding verbatim with the enacting clause of the act of 1705,) and with the further unimportant variation of the particle \u201c <em>a\u201d </em>instead of \u201c <em>the\u201d </em>before the word \u201c license,\u201d in the second section. I am therefore confirmed in my former opinion, that the act of 1691, is to be considered as the law of the land: and consequently that the judgment of the District Court is erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"AjGc\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"A2I\">Upon the first appearance of the manuscript volume of laws found in the clerk\u2019s office of North<em>umberland </em>County, bearing every mark of antiquity and authenticity, I had, <em>privately, but little </em>doubt that it was one of those copies which, at the period of its date, were furnished in manuscript for each county, and for which a fee of <em>300 </em>lbs of tobacco is provided in the acts contained in the edition of <em>Purvis, </em>p. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">At that time, it appears by an examination of the old records of the Council, there were only about <em>twenty </em>or <em>twenty-two </em>counties in the colony; and it is admitted that there were then no printing presses in <em>America, </em>and that our laws, about that period, existed only in manuscript.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Considering the destruction naturally incident to books and papers of this kind during a period of <em>one hundred and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>eighteen years; </em>and that, after these laws had undergone several revis\u00e1is, the owners of them, would in general be careless of their preservation, it could not reasonably be presumed that <em>many </em>copies (out of twenty-two) would still be found in existence. It has always been admitted that the original rolls themselves of the laws of this period have been destroyed by lire, or by the enemy.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">As, however, this was but a <em>single </em>copy : as the act now in question was unknown to the Court of Appeals, and to the General Court, in the several cases in which this subject has heretofore been drawn in question ; and particularly, as its existence was unknown to our late venerable President, (Mr. Pendleton,) whose age and observation gave him great opportunities of information upon this subject; I was unwilling to decide the case, unless it were absolutely necessary, upon this <em>single </em>copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">A perusal of President Jeeeersoh\u2019s letter to Mr. Wythe, upon the subject of our ancient laws, sometime ago published in the Gazettes, inducing me to expect that this act would <em>probably </em>be corroborated and supported by another copy in the possession of the President, it occurred to me proper to request, (in which the Court readily acquiesced,) that a copy from the act in his possession should be obtained. The cause accordingly laid over until this term, and a copy has been obtained from the President, which is now before us. That copy precisely corresponds with the act in the MS copy obtained from <em>Northumberland, </em>except in the omission, in the latter, of two trivial and tautologous words : and precisely agrees with the act of 1705,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> even in respect of those words. This circumstance entirely corresponds with the information said to have been received from the President, 'that <em>his </em>copy is believed to have been owned by one of the revisors, of our acts at some former period, and is supposed to Ixive been one of the very copies from which such revisal was made. The confirmation which is derived as to the authenticity of the <em>first </em>copy of the law, by the production of the <em>latter, </em>is further strengthened by the consideration, that the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>copies are understood to have been procured from different and <em>distant </em>parts of the country ; from whence the idea is excluded, that one of them could have been copied from the <em>other.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">I can therefore no longer doubt but that this act was passed by the Legislature in 1691: and as its enacting clause agrees precisely with the 12th section of the act of 1705, at which time our acts underwent a revisal, and therefore, the presumption is, that the clause then inserted was not a <em>nexo </em>clause, I am of opinion, that that clause was merely a continuation and re-enaction of the pre-existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">As to the objection that the Royal assent is not shewn to have been given to this act, it is answered, not only by the consideration that the records of those times were burnt, and none of the people of those times are living to supply an inferior kind of evidence upon this point; but also by the improbability that the legislature would have inserted in their revisal, an act which had not been duly perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">As to the objection of the want of promulgation of this act, it is true, that, latterly, it had sunk into oblivion, having been superseded and continued by a posterior act; but prior to the act of 1705, it was promulgated like all our other acts ; a copy was deposited in the clerk\u2019s office of each County for the free perusal of the people. I am therefore of opinion, that the instruction of .the District Judge was erroneous, and ought to have conformed to the ideas now stated.</p>\n<author id=\"b176-10\">Judge Fleming</author>\n<p id=\"AMn\">observed that the MS act of 1691 appeared to be so well authenticated that no doubt was left on his mind that it was the law of the land, and continued so from 1691, till it was re-enacted in the revisal of 1705.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The opinion of the Court was, that the judgment of the District Court was \u201c erroneous in this, in the Court\u2019s re- \u201c fusing to instruct the Jury that no native <em>American </em>In* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\" <em>diem </em>brought into <em>Virginia </em>since the year 1691, could,- \u201c under any circumstances, be lawfully made a slave, and \u201c in declaring the law to be otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Judgment reversed, a new trial granted, with instructions conformably to the above opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b173-16\"> 1 <em>Hening </em>&amp; <em>Munford, </em>138.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"><em> </em>Ed. <em>1752, </em>c. 52. sect; 12. p. 80.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
