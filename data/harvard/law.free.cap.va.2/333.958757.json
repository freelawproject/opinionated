A <em>bona fide </em>vendee of personal property having gotten possession thereof before the issuing of an execution against the vendor, his title is good against the creditor, though after such possession by the vendee, he employs the vendor as his agent to sell the property; and the vendor is in possession as the agent of the vendee at the time the execution issues, and is levied upon it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-8\">3. It is error in the Court to instruct the jury upon the sufficiency of evidence to maintain the issue.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-9\">This was an action brought upon an indemnifying bond in the name of M\u2019Kinley, high sheriff of <em>Ohio </em>county, for the use of <em>Thomas Berry, </em>against <em>Charles Ensell </em>and others, obligors in the bond. The defendants pleaded conditions performed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-10\">On the trial, the cause turned upon the question, whether the property taken under an execution against <em>Jesse W. Berry </em>was the property of the said <em>Jesse W., </em>or belonged to the plaintiff. Many witnesses were examined, and among others <em>Jesse W. Berry, </em>who stated, that previous to the 16th of May 1838, he was carrying on business as a shoe merchant in the City of <em>Wheeling ; </em>that on that day he sold out his stock to the plaintiff <em>Thomas Berry, </em>for 2800 dollars; that the accounts and books were all transferred into the name of <em>Thomas Berry, </em>who employed the said <em>Jesse W. </em>to act for him in the store, at 20 dollars per month. The witness was to act under the direction of <em>Thomas Berry, </em>to buy and sell, which, at that time, was the only business. That when he sold out to <em>Thomas Berry, </em>the sign over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>door was \u201c <em>Jesse W. Bet'ry, </em>Boot and Shoe Store.\u201d This sign was afterwards taken down; and in June or July another was put up in the name of <em>Thomas Berry. </em>Other witnesses fixed the time of putting up the new gjgn to about the first of July.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b353-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>1845. <em>July </em>Term.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>It was also in proof, that in January 1839, <em>Thomas Berry </em>rented a house, to which the goods were removed, and where the business was carried on ; and that he employed workmen to make shoes in the establishment. The business being under the management of <em>Jesse W. </em>Berry, the execution was levied upon the goods in the store, in March 1839, as his goods; and the bond sued upon was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">Upon the trial of the cause, the defendants, by their counsel, moved the Court to instruct the jury that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-6\">(No. 1.) \u201cIf after a sale of personal property, absolute in its terms, the vendor remains in possession, with all the visible and outward signs of ownership, using and disposing of the property as of his own, for any indefinite time, such possession is inconsistent with the terms of sale, and renders such sale fraudulent, and therefore void as to creditors; and although such sale may be fair and <em>bona fide </em>as between vendor and vendee, in fact, yet said vendee cannot, thereafter, set up the said sale against any creditor of said vendor, who was so at the time of such sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-7\">Which instruction the Court declined to give as asked for, but told the jury, that the first part of the instruction down to the word \u201c creditors,\u201d was correct as a general proposition; and that instead of the residue of the said instruction, the Court would instruct them, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">(No. 2.) \u201c If the jury are satisfied that the bill of sale of the 16th of May, of the goods in controversy, was <em>bona fide, </em>without any intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors, or secret trust for the use of <em>Jesse W. Berry; </em>and find that they were not delivered to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>said <em>Thomas Berry at </em>the time of sale, and that possession did not accompany and follow the bill of sale, but that possession continued and remained in <em>Jesse W. Berry; </em>but that the said <em>Thomas Berry </em>did afterwards, and before the suing the execution in this case, take and hold possession of the said goods, and so continued to the time of the levy, that then the relator\u2019s title to the goods would be valid. But if the jury believe from the evidence, that there was not a sale and delivery of the goods, on the said 16th of May, but that the same, if bargained and sold on that day, were not then delivered, and that possession did not then accompany and follow the bill of sale, but that the same continued and remained in the said <em>Jesse W. Berry </em>until the change of the sign in July 1838, in the manner stated by the witness <em>Hawkins </em>and <em>others; </em>and that there is no other evidence satisfying them of any delivery of possession to the said <em>Thomas </em>Berry, and of the said <em>Berry\u2019s </em>afterwards so taking and holding the said goods, but the said change of sign by the said <em>Jesse W. Berry </em>as aforesaid, and the keeping the accounts by the said <em>Jesse </em>in the name of <em>Thomas Berry, </em>and the acts of the said <em>Thomas Berry, </em>in hiring the journeymen aforesaid, and in renting the house of <em>Porter, </em>to which the goods were removed by the said <em>Jesse, </em>then the Court is of opinion, that such change of sign merely, and such keeping of the accounts, such hiring of the journeymen, and renting of the house, if believed by the jury, are not of themselves sufficient proof of delivery and transfer of possession to the said <em>Thomas Berry; </em>but the jury will consider such change of sign, and the circumstances under which it was made, the said keeping the accounts, and the said acts of <em>Thomas Berry </em>in hiring, renting, &amp;c. with the evidence in the cause, and give them weight as they think they deserve upon the question whether there was a previous sale and delivery to said <em>Thomas Berry.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Thereupon the plaintiff asked the Court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnA\">(No. 3.) \u201c Upon the trial of said cause evidence was offered to prove that <em>Jesse W. Berry </em>remained in the possession of the said chattels after the sale, and to the time of the levy by the sheriff; and further upon the trial of said cause, evidence was offered to shew that the said <em>Thomas Berry </em>took, and had, and held the possession of said chattels from the time of his purchase to the time of the levy by the sheriff; and that said <em>Jesse W. Berry </em>was employed by the month at wages, to attend to and carry on the shoe shop, as his clerk, agent and foreman.\u201d Whereupon the plaintiff moved the Court to instruct the jury, that \u201c if the jury should believe that the sale and purchase was <em>bona Jide, </em>and not fraudulent, and that the said <em>Thomas </em>had possessed himself of the said chattels, and had the shoe store and shop containing said chattels carried on for himself, and that said <em>Jesse W. Berry </em>was his said agent, clerk and foreman, and as such agent, clerk and foreman, for the said <em>Thomas </em>Berry, and not for himself, had possession thereof, that then such possession of the said <em>Jesse W. Berry </em>was the possession of the said <em>Thomas Berry.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">Which instruction the Court did not give in the words asked for. But said he would give it substantially, as follows, to wit :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2n\">(No. 4.) \u201cIf the jury believe that the sale and purchase of the goods, on the 16th of May, was <em>bona </em>fide, and not fraudulent, not made to delay, hinder and defraud creditors, nor on a secret trust for the use of the vendor, and that the said goods were then and there delivered to the said <em>Thomas Berry </em>in pursuance of said sale; that the said <em>Thomas </em>was fully possessed of said goods, by said delivery, and afterwards engaged the said <em>Jesse W. Berry </em>by agreement with him as agent or clerk, at wages of 20 dollars per month, to take the said goods and to sell the same, in carrying on the shoe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>store in the way of making and selling shoes, boots, &amp;c. in the name of the said Thomas, and for his use and benefit; and that the said sale and delivery to <em>Thomas Berry, </em>and said contract with the said <em>Jesse </em>were not fraudulent, colourable and collusive, but in good faith; and that <em>Jesse, </em>afterwards, and up to the time of suing execution in this case, held possession of said goods openly and visibly in the name of <em>Thomas Berry, </em>only, and for his use and benefit, and with the usual marks of ownership, and possession, in the said <em>Thomas, only; </em>he himself appearing openly and visibly, and <em>bona fide, </em>as clerk or agent only of said <em>Thomas, </em>then such possession of said <em>Jesse </em>should be deemed the possession of said <em>ThomasP</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-4\">To all which instructions of the Court, and the not giving the one asked for by the plaintiffs, in the terms asked for, the plaintiff by his counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">Thereupon the jury found a verdict for the defendants, and the Court having given judgment upon it, the plaintiff obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-11\"><em>Jacob, </em>for the appellant, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b357-12\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AAP\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">The Court is of opinion, that so much of the instruction of the Court below as is embraced by the first paragraph of the instruction No. <em>2, is </em>free from any just exception. That paragraph is in these words: \u201cIf the jury are satisfied that the bill of sale of the 16th of May, of the goods in controversy, was <em>bona fide, </em>without any intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors, or secret trust for <em>Jesse W. Berry; </em>and find they were not delivered to the said <em>Thomas Berry </em>at the time of sale, and that possession continued and remained in <em>Jesse W. Berry, </em>but that <em>Thomas Berry </em>did, afterwards, and before the suing of the execution in this case, take and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>hold possession of said goods, and so continued to the time of the levy, that then the relator\u2019s title to the goods would be valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABu0\">The Court is further of opinion, that on the facts supPosed by the residue of the instruction to be in proof, to wit: that the sale aforesaid was made on the 16th of May, but that there was not an actual delivery at that time to <em>Thomas Berry, </em>but the possession thereof continued in <em>Jesse W. Berry, </em>and that there was no other evidence satisfying the jury of a delivery to <em>Thomas Berry, </em>or of <em>Thomas Berry\u2019s </em>taking and holding the said goods, but the change of sign to, and the keeping of the accounts in the name of <em>Thomas Berry, </em>and the hiring of journeymen, and renting a storehouse by <em>Thomas Berry, </em>and the removal of the goods to the storehouse so rented by <em>Thomas Berry, </em>the Court below erred in instructing the jury, that such facts were not of themselves sufficient proof of delivery and transfer of possession to said <em>Thomas Berry; </em>but the jury should consider said facts of changing the sign, and in the mode of keeping the accounts, and acts of <em>Thomas Berry </em>in hiring, renting, &amp;c. with the evidence in the cause, and give them the weight they should deserve on the question whether there was a previous sale and delivery to said <em>Thomas Berry. </em>The Court is of opinion that the sufficiency of the said facts, combined with the other evidence in the cause, to prove the actual possession by <em>Thomas Berry </em>of the goods at any time before the emanation of the execution, and continuance of that possession to the time of the levy of the execution, was proper for, and ought to have been submitted to the decision of the <em>jury; </em>and furthermore, that the last member of said instruction improperly limited the function and operation of those facts combined with the other evidence, to <em>their </em>bearing on the question whether there was a previous sale and delivery to said <em>Thomas Berry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The Court is further of opinion, that the Court below erred in the modification made by the instruction No. 4, of the instruction No. 3, moved by the plaintiff in that Court, in this, that by the said modification it is made a prerequisite to the authorization of the jury to consider the possession of <em>Jesse W. Berry </em>as the agent of <em>Thomas Berry, </em>the possession of said <em>Thomas, </em>that the jury should believe that at the time of the sale on the 16th of May, the goods were then and there delivered to the said <em>Thomas </em>in pursuance of the sale, and that said <em>Thomas </em>thereafter engaged the said <em>Jesse, </em>as agent or cleric to take and sell the goods, carrying on the store, &amp;c. in the name of said <em>Thomas, </em>and for his <em>use; </em>and that the said. <em>Jesse, </em>afterwards, and up to the time of suing out the execution, held the goods openly and visibly in the name of said <em>Thom,as </em>only, and for his use and benefit <em>bona fide </em>as clerk or agent only of said <em>Thomas. </em>The Court is of opinion, that <em>Jesse W. Berry's </em>possession might justly have been considered that of <em>Thomas </em>if at any time after the sale and before the emanation of the execution, the said <em>Thomas </em>acquired the possession, and <em>Jesse </em>thereafter held or got possession as the agent or clerk of the said <em>Thomas, </em>and in that character conducted the store in the name of <em>Thomas, </em>and for his benefit ; and such possession having once existed after the sale and before the emanation of the execution, it was not necessary to have been continued to the emanation of the execution to enable the said <em>Thomas </em>to claim that the intermediate possession by the said <em>Jesse </em>as his agent or clerk was the possession of the said <em>Thomas ; </em>nor was the continuance of <em>Jesse W. Berry's </em>possession as agent or clerk of <em>Thomas </em>down to the time of the emanation of the execution, necessary to such a consummation of the sale and delivery to <em>Thomas, </em>(provided the transactions between him and <em>Jesse </em>were <em>bona fide, </em>and free from any fraudulent intent or object,) as would protect the goods from the execution. And the Court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>of opinion, that the said judgment is erroneous. It is therefore considered by the Court, that the said judgment be reversed and annulled, and the verdict of the jury be set aside; and that the defendants in error pay to. the plaintiff in error the costs by him expended in the prosecution of his writ of <em>supersedeas </em>in this Court. And the cause is remanded to the said Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery for a new trial to be had therein, on which the instructions of the Court (should instructions be sought by the parties) are to conform to the foregoing opinion and judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
