The general issue was pleaded, and at the trial, the defendant tendered a bill of exceptions, which was sealed, stating, that the plaintiffs to maintain their action, offered in evidence, a copy of a judgment obtained by the said <em>Josiah Hunley </em>-against <em>Thomas Mumford, </em>and the execution issued thereon, with a return indorsed, signed by iff. Roach, Deputy Sheriff, \u201c that the same was satisfiedalso a certi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ficate, that the defendant\u2019s testator had duly qualified . as Sheriff, and that the said <em>M. Roach </em>had also been _ admitted as his Deputy. That the defendant moved to nonsuit the plaintiffs, which the Court refused to direct. That he then moved, that the judgment, execution,, and certificate, above stated, might not be permitted to go in evidence to the jury; but in this also , he was over-ruled. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, upon which judgment was accordingly rendered. This judgment being afterwards reversed by the District Court of <em>Petersburg, </em>a <em>supersedeas </em>was applied for, and awarded by one of the Judges of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-3\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-4\">By the bill of exceptions, it appears that this action was brought to recover money levied under an execution, by Roach, the <em>Deputy Sheriff </em>of <em>Christopher Hudson, </em>and the question is, if a <em>general indebitatus as- , </em>in such a case, lie against the <em>High sumpsit </em>will <em>Sheriff?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-5\">It is clear, that an action of debt might have been supported; and the general rule is, that wherever debt will lie, <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will, unless a specialty be the ground of the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\">This is a simple contract debt, though the proof of it depended partly on a judgment. The case is not altered on account of the bond given by the Sheriff for the due execution of his office; for although an action of debt might have been brought upon that bond, yet another action will lie to recover the money levied under this execution, as for so much received to the plaintiff\u2019s use. Neither is it important that the money was received by the <em>Deputy Sheriff, </em>for in the eye of the law it was received by the <em>High Sheriff.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-7\"><em>Campbell, </em>foi; the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-8\">If there be any authorities to prove that debt would lie against the Sheriff in a case of this sort, I should wish them to be produced: I know of none such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-9\">I admit that great liberality is extended to the action on the case for money had and received; but it is laid under certain restraints, even by the great patron of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>this action, so as to prevent a defendant from being surprised at the trial, by the want of notice of the real nature of the demand. This can seldom happen where the defendant is charged with the consequences of his own acts, for then he is supposed to be conusant of all the circumstances attending them, and he ought to be prepared to explain and to justify them. But it is otherwise where the charge respects the acts of a third person; for although, as between him and the defendant, there may exist a privity created by a legal fiction, yet the latter may be as much a stranger to the transactions of such third person, as if no such connection had subsisted; and the law will not permit a fiction to work an injury to any person. The Deputy is liable in an action of this sort, either in his individual or in his official capacity; the High Sheriff is only answerable in the latter character, and in that character therefore he ought to have been sued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-7\"><em>Wickham. </em>\u2014 I admit that an officer is not chargeable for a <em>misfeasance </em>in himself, or in his deputy, \u2022 in an action of debt, or of assumpsit. But this action is for a <em>non feasance </em>in failing to pay a sum of money levied for the appellant\u2019s use. As to the inconvenience which it is supposed the defendant may be subjected to, from a want of notice of the real ground of complaint, if it be an objection in this case, it is one which applies to this form of action in almost every other case. The Court will not permit the defendant to be surprised at the trial; it is in their power to prevent it by setting aside the verdict. But it does not appear in this case, that the appellee was surprised; on the contrary, it is clear that he knew for what he was sued, because it is stated in the bill of exceptions, that he produced the Sheriff\u2019s bond in evidence. The case of <em>Moses </em>v. <em>M\u2018Farlane, </em>2 <em>Burr. </em>1005, was much stronger than this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-8\">The Deputy is in fact the servant of the Sheriff, and his receipt is the receipt of the Sheriff; every thing is done in the name of the latter. As well might a merchant oppose an action of this sort by saying, that the money was received not by him, but by his clerk . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Even if the Deputy be liable, it does not prove that the High Sheriff is not; but I doubt if the action would , lie against the Deputy. The case of <em>White </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>(an\u00ede, vol.i. p. 159,) seems to be a strong authority to prove that it would not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-3\">In the case of <em>Speake </em>v. <em>Richards, Hob. </em>206, it was determined, that debt would lie against the Sheriff for money levied by him under an execution, upon the ground of an implied contract; and this is the foundation of the action of <em>indebitatus </em>assumpsit. In the case of <em>Cochram </em>v. <em>Welby, </em>1 <em>Mod. </em>245, it is said, that <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will lie against the Sheriff for money levied upon a <em>fieri facias.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-4\">It may occasion much surprise, that so few cases are to be found upon this subject; but the practice in <em>England </em>is to order the Sheriff to bring the money into Court, and if he fail to do so, an attachment <em>issues against him. </em>So in this country it is most usual to proceed against him by motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-5\"><em>Campbell. </em>\u2014 Although strictly speaking, the Sheriff is liable for the acts of his Deputy, yet no answer is thereby furnished to the objection, that the declaration should be so formed as to apprise him of the real ground of the action. If debt had been brought, the whole case must have been stated : if <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>be preferred, the declaration should be special.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-6\">It will not be denied, but that a record (which the Sheriff\u2019s return certainly is) is the foundation of this action, and where this is the case, the record should be certainly and truly alleged, 1 <em>Esp. </em>238. \u201c <em>Arul tiel </em>record\u201d is a good plea to an action of debt on a judgment. So to debt for an escape, <em>lb. </em>270. Where money is levied on a <em>fieri </em>facias, but the writ is not returned, <em>nil'debet </em>is a good plea; otherwise if it be returned, <em>lb. </em>But if the Sheriff may be sued in this form of action, he would thereby lose the opportunity of denying that there w'as any such record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-7\"><em>Wickham,- </em>\u2014 Trespass <em>vi et armis </em>will lie against the Sheriff, for a <em>tort </em>committed by the Deputy, and yet the declaration states it as the act of the Sheriff. The surprise is as great in that, as in this case, and yet no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>objection to the action on that account was ever of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzH_\">It is contended, that if <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will lie-\u201cthe declaration ought to be special; but no case is cited in support of this doctrine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-5\">In 1 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>166, it is laid down, that if the Sheriff levy money on a <em>fieri facias, </em>the plaintiff may have <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>against him for money had and received. It is clear that the author does not mean a <em>special indebitatus assumpsit, </em>or he would have expressed himself so; for when this sort of action is spoken of w ithout any qualification, a <em>general </em>action is always intended. In an <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for work and labour, the kind of work need not be mentioned. <em>Comb. </em>430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq-O\">The case of <em>Ackworth </em>v. <em>Kempe, </em>1 <em>Dougl. </em>40, though not exactly in point, runs parallel with this in principle. The principle I contend for is, that the Sheriff is not only liable for the acts of the Deputy, but that they are in the view of the law <em>the acts of the Sheriff. </em>So too, in the case of <em>Saunderson </em>v. Baker, &amp;c. 3 <em>Wils. </em>309, the Deputy committed the trespass, and yet the action was against the Sheriff, not for a <em>tort </em>done by the Deputy, but by the Sheriff himself, In the case of <em>Woodgate </em>v. <em>Knatchbull, </em>2 <em>Term </em>Rep. 148, the action was brought upon a penal Statute against the Sheriff, for taking higher fees than the law permitted; the receipt was given by the Deputy, and it was objected that the Sheriff was not liable, though the deputy might be: but it was otherwise determined, an&lt;^ uPon principle that the act of the bailiff was the act of the Sheriff. In <em>Cowp. Rep. </em>403, it is laid down, that the Deputy is unknown to the plaintiff, and that the action can only be brought against the principal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b234-7\">Lyons J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay5\">The great objection is, that the action is founded on a record, which is not stated in the declaration; can any case be produced where a judgment upon such a declaration has been sustained?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\"><em>Campbell. </em>\u2014 Wherever <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>brought, even upon a foreign judgment, the judgment is set forth in the declaration. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Whittall, Doug. </em>4, <em>n</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><em>Wickham. </em>\u2014 I contend that a general <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>is always in the same form. The case cited by Mr. <em>Campbell </em>is not of an action for money had and received; the <em>judgment </em>is no evidence of money received to the use of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">I admit that if a record be the ground of the action, it must be declared upon; but it is otherwise if it be but inducement. In this case the receipt of the money fo <em>tt </em>\"5 the <em>gist </em>of the action, and that is a thing in pais\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"AqCQ\"><em>Campbell. </em>\u2014 If the cause of the action grows out of a record, it must be stated; if it be necessary to state it, it cannot be avoided by changing the form of action, 1 <em>Esp. </em>238\u00bb Action of debt lies against the Sheriff, if he return that he has levied the money, for it is matter of record, <em>Palm. </em>148. If the money be levied upon a fierifacias, and the writ be returned, the Sheriff cannot plead <em>nil </em>debet, for the return is matter of record, and not of fact, 1 <em>Esp. </em>270; the return itself is sufficient to charge the Sheriff, without other evidence. These cases shew, that the return, which is a matter of record, forms the <em>gist </em>of the action, and that the receipt is but inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\"><em>Indebitatus assumpsit </em>is not always general; the declaration not only does, but in many cases ought to contain a specification of the charge. The case of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Whittall </em>proves this; and if it were necessary to be special in an action founded on a <em>foreign </em>judgment, the argument is a fortiori, in the case of a judgment rendered in our ov n Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\"><em>Wickham. </em>\u2014 The plaintiff might have recovered in this action, merely upon proving the receipt of the money by virtue of the execution, though the writ had not been returned; and if so, it follows necessarily that the receipt is the ground of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The case from <em>Espin. </em>270, only show's, that if the plaintiff in the declaration <em>sets forth the return of the </em>execution, the Sheriff is estopped to deny the receipt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>acknowledged on record; but it does not prove that the return must be set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">I admit that declarations of <em>indebitatus asumpsit </em>generally, are as various in their forms as declarations i debt; but <em>indebitatus assumpsit for money had and </em>received. admits but of one form. The case of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Whittall </em>was not an <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money had and received ; such an action would have been improper, as the judgment was not evidence of money received by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Roane J. \u2014 The declaration is this action containing a general count for money had and received, seems at first view to be a novelty, when used in a case like the present. On an examination and search into precedents, none have been found, which can warrant so general a declaration as this, in an action against a Sheriff for money levied by his Deputy upon an execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">There is no doubt, but that the receipt of the Deputy is sufficient to charge the Sheriff, and that it is to be considered in law, as if the money had been actually received by the Sheriff; but the question with me is, whether a <em>general count for money had and received </em>is a proper form of action in which to try the point, or whether the declaration should not have set out the particular grounds of the <em>assumpsit? </em>Such a specification would not vary the action; it would still remain an action of <em>indebitatus </em>assumpsit, founded upon a general implied promise, though the particular grounds on which such promise arose, would be set out, and a recovery in that case might be pleaded in bar of an action of debt for' the same cause. Such a specification would not convert the action into an <em>assumpsit </em>upon a special undertaking. Thus, in the case of <em>Crawford </em>v. Whittall, the action was <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>upon an implied promise, and yet a foreign judgment was set out as the ground of the promise ; many instances similar to this might be mentioned, if it were necessary. The utmost that the books say upon this subject is, that <em>indebitatus as</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>sumpsit </em>will lie against a Sheriff for money levied on <em>\u00bf.fieri facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">Until <em>Slade\u2019s </em>Case, a notion prevailed, that on a simple contract for a sum certain, an adtion of <em>assumpsit </em>would not lie, and' the decision in the above case goes to a denial of that opinion; but this does not bind us to sustain a general count f\u00f3r money had and received, in a case like the present, of which I find no precedent;</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Great encomiums have been passed upon the action for money had and received, by able Judges; but I am satisfied, that the generality of the count in that action may often tend to surprise a defendant; I shall therefore not incline to extend it beyond the limits within which it is now confined. |</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">If the Sheriff in this case, had been sued for the same cause in an action of debt, the,,return and proceedings must have been set out; if an action had been brought upon his bond of office, the particular charges would have been specified in the assignment of breaches: if a motion had been male against him for the money, the notice must have particularised the charge. Why then shall we not restrain the plain&gt;tiff to a mode of declaring, which is always in his power, which is equally as favourable to him, and more so to the defendant than the present, and is analogous, (as it respects notice of the ground of complaint,) to the above mentioned modes of proceeding?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">However conusant a man in his private character is supposed to be of his own transactions, and of those of his agents, it appears to me reasonable, that a <em>public officer </em>should have notice, when lie is charged in his official character, of the nature of that charge. In this country, the Deputy Sheriffs ate competent to most of the duties of the office, without the co-operation, or sanction of their principles; It is therefore highly reasonable, that the Sheriff should be previously notified of the particular acts of his Deputy, for which he is to be made responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Being of opinion that this Court has the power (which has been heretofore beneficially exercised by Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of Law,) to mould and fashion declarations and pleadings, so as to answer more effectually the ends for which they werefinvented, and there being no series of decisions, (if a single one,) sustaining a general count in cases like the present, I must say, that I think this declaration insufficient upon the evidence exhibited in the cause, and appearing in the record ; that the judgment of the District Court, revel sing that of the County Ceurt on account of the generality of the declaration, U right, and as far as it goes should be affirmed. But a new trial ought to have been awarded, with liberty to the plaintiff to give such testimony as might correspond with, and support the declaration. The judgment of the District Court ought therefore to be reversed and remanded, with a direction to award a new trial, with such directions as above-mentioned, and not to allow the evidence which was excepted fo, to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Fleming \u2014There is no doubt, but that <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will lie against the High Sheriff in a case like the present, and if the particular grounds of the charge had been specified in this declaration, it would in my \u00bfpinion have been unobjectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">. The action on the case for money had and receivC ed is a beneficial remedy, and may loe rendered more so by restraining it within proper limits. But it would defeat the great object of pleading, if we were to countenance this action in the latitude contended for. The case should be truly and fairly stated, that the defendant may not be surprised at the trial by a want of no-; tice of the real cause of action, and also that he may be enabled to plead the judgment in that action, in bar of any other suit, which might be brought against him for the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The defendant is the executor of the Sheriff, and is called upon to answer for the acts of the Deputy; how is it possible that he could, from this declaration, acquire information respecting a transaction, to which we must suppose him so entirely a stranger ? If the case had been properly stated, he might have defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ed himself by shewing there was no such record. If the Sheriff be obliged to answer for the misconduct of his Deputy, he ought to be enabf\u00e1d to recover over against the Deputy, and to shew <em>upon the record, </em>on what account the judgment against him had been rendered ; this could not have been done in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">That <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will lie ^gainst the Sheriff\u2019 for money received by his Deputy'upon an execution, is not denied; but the declaration may properly contain a specification of the charge, and in my opinion ought to do so. The case of <em>Woodford </em>v. <em>Deacon, Cro. Jac. </em>206, is not so strong as this, and yet judgment was reversed on account of the generality of the declaration. Upon the whole, I concur with the Judge who has preceded me, in the judgment which this Court ought to render.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Lyons J. \u2014 That this is a beneficial action to both parties, seems to be agreed by every one. It is also agreed, that an action of <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will lie against a Sheriff, to recover money received upon an execution by his Deputy. But unless the form of the action in such a case be laid under certain'restrictions, 'ifr would very illy merit the encomiums which have been passed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The great object of pleading is, to apprise the opposite party of the real subject of dispute ; without it, they may be entrapped at the trial, and real injustice may be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">, I can find no precedent in England, or in this country, to warrant so general a declaration as the present. It is true, that the reported cases do not furnish us with the forms of the pleadings ; but it is to be inferred from them, that the declarations in cases of this sort were special. In the case of <em>Woodford </em>v. <em>Deacon, Cro. Jac. </em>206, it appears, that the practice had been to declare generally ; but the Court in that case corrected it, assigning as a reason, that the declaration did not shew- fur hat cause the action grew due.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Being unshackled by precedents, I consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Court as at perfect liberty to modify this action, so as to promote the great object of pleading. I do not say' that the declaration should contain a special state of \u2022the case ; but the defendant should have been apprised that he was sued for money received in his <em>official capacity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The following opinion was entered, <em>viz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u201c This Court being of opinion, that in all actions against Sheriffs hr money had and received by them, by virtue of their office, the nature of the debt or demand should be \u00a1o far stated.in the declaration, as to distinguish themfrom private debts and contracts, in order to prevent surprise, bv giving notice to the defendants of the causes of action, that they may be ready to answer [he same, and the plaintiffs not having stated in the declaration filed in this suit, that the money had and received by the defendant\u2019s testator was so received by him by virtue of any execution or of his office of Sheriff, there is error in the judgment of the County Court, in the Court\u2019s allowing the copies of the records in the proceedings mentioned to go as evidence to the jury ; and that there is no error in the judgment of the District Court reversing the. judgment o\u00ed the said County Court on that account, but that there is error in the judgment of the said District Court, in not setting aside the verdict in the said County Court, and awarding a new trial in the said cause, with directions not to permit the copies aforesaid to go as evidence to the jury, therefore,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Both judgments reversed and a new trial awarded, &amp;c.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-11\">(1) <em>Chichester v.
