The case was this :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">Tucker and Coles purchased sundry parcels of land of <em>Edmund B. Norvell, </em>executor of <em>Thomas Norvell, </em>deceased, and <em>Jinn Norvell, </em>his widow. In the deed which was executed for the purpose, the land is described as <em>\u201c </em>all the land lying upon <em>Pig- </em>and <em>Staunton </em>Rivers, in the counties of Bedford and Pittsylvania, and all the title, whether legal or equitable, thereto, which the said Thomas Norvell acquired, by deed from Wilson Allen and Edmund W. Rootes. \u201d Tucker purchased three undivided fourth parts of the said land, and Coles purchased one undivided fourth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\">The negociation which ended in the foregoing conveyance, was commenced in the life-time of Thomas Norvell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>by a letter from Tucker to him, proposing to purchase the ian(j. an\u00bf T. Norvell having died before the letter was answered, his executor, Edmund Norvell, replied to it, informing Tucker that the land was for sale; that Jesse Burton of Campbell county, was fully empowered to sell, to whom he refers him for particulars; and apprising him that, there is a suit in the Court of Appeals respecting the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\">In another letter, E. Norvell informs Tucker, that he is still disposed to sell, and that he would be glad to hear from him, \u2018 \u2018 stating the price and terms on which he is willing to purchase.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">A written agreement was entered into on the 6th of January, 1818, .between the executor, E. Norvell, and Tucker, by which it is stipulated that the former has sold to the latter \u201ca tract of land lying on <em>Pig </em>and <em>Staunton </em>Rivers, in the counties of Bedford and Pittsylvania, <em>containing, by estimation, ten or twelve thousand acres;\u201d </em>and Tucker agrees to pay for the said land, twenty-seven thousand five hundred dollars; payable one third on the 1st of January, 1819; another third on the 1st of January, 1820; and the remaining third on the 1st of January, 1821; with a deed of trust on the land, to secure the payments. Norvell only stipulates to convey the interest vested in T. Norvell, and to warrant the title against all persons claiming under the said Thomas Norvell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">. Coles, though not a party to the written agreement, was a partner in the purchase to the amount of one fourth, as has been mentioned above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">Three days after <em>this contract, the deed </em>was executed to Tucker and Coles, in their respective proportions, as before described; and they thereupon executed their bonds; Tucker giving three bonds, with Coles his security, for three fourths; and Coles giving three, with Tucker his security, for one fourth. They also executed a deed of trust, according to the conditions of the agreement. These bonds and deeds of trust were afterwards assigned to the appellee, Cocke.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Tucker paid two of the bonds; but, having had a survey of the land, which induced him to believe that there was a deficiency in the quantity, he applied to Cocke to make a deduction from the purchase money. This proposition was refused by Cocke; and Tucker exhibited a bill to the Lynchburg Chancellor, making Cocke, Norvell the executor, and the trustees, defendants, praying that a proper deduction might be made for the deficiency of land, and that the defendants might be injoined from proceeding on the last bond, and the deed of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-4\">In his bill, <em>Tucker </em>relies upon the terms of the written \u2022agreement, executed before the conveyance, which states that the lands were <em>supposed to contain from </em>10,000 <em>to </em>12,000 <em>acres. </em>He states, that in the negociation, the discussion of the parties turned principally upon the <em>price </em>and <em>terms of </em>payment, and the title, then contested, by the executors of David Ross; but, that the <em>quantity </em>of the land was taken for granted to be from ten to twelve thousand acres and upwards; that no specific quantity was mentioned in the deed; but, that this <em>unicsual </em>circumstance was noticed and objected to by the complainant; but, after some consideration, the objection was deemed unimportant, and the deed was executed in its present form; that he afterwards had a survey made of the said lands, and they fell short more than two thousand acres of the quantity they were supposed to contain, by both parties, at the time of iheir agreement; that when he applied to Cocke to allow a deduction in the price, on account of the said deficiency, the latter insisted that the complainant purchased the land <em>in gross, </em>and not <em>by the acre; </em>that although the purchase was <em>in gross </em>and <em>no particular quantity was warranted, </em>yet, that both parties, <em>relying that the land had been previously conveyed, as containing about </em>10,000 <em>acres, and, consisted of old surveys, and upon the general reputation respecting the quantity of the said land, confidently expected that the real quantity would considerably exceed the estimated quantity; that this belief operated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>on both parties in making the bargain; </em>that the complainant is persuaded, that the said <em>Edmund B. Norvell </em>would not have asked so much, if he had known the real quantity; and it is certain that the complainant would not have given so much, especially as he knew he was purchasing a title which was then contested by the executor of <em>David. Boss, </em>whose right and interest in the said land, the said Coles and the complainant have since purchased for the s\u00fcm of $7,000; that upon investigation of the title papers, he cannot discover that the said <em>David Boss, </em>(whose title the said <em>Thomas Norvell </em>had purchased under a deed of trust,) ever had title to as much as 10,000 acres; that <em>Thomas Norvell </em>never paid taxes for more than 9,537 acres, which facts have come to the knowledge of the complainant since his purchase; that he had no better opportunity of knowing the quantity of the land than the said <em>Norvell, </em>as he lived 30 or 40 miles distant, and had never seen it before his purchase; and although he had been counsel in an action of ejectment brought by <em>Thomas Norvell </em>against <em>David Boss, </em>to recover part of <em>the said </em>land, yet no title papers were necessary in the said action, but the conveyance of the said <em>Boss </em>to his trustees, and from them to <em>Norvell; </em>and he does not recollect that he examined even these, till some time after his purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-4\">The Chancellor denied the injunction, but it was after-wards awarded by a Judge of the Court of Appeals, to restrain the trustees from selling, to the amount of $5,000 of the principal debt, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\"><em>Edmund B. Norvell, </em>states in his answer, that when he entered into the written agreement, he had no knowledge of the quantity of the land in question, having never seen any of the title papers relative to it, and having no knowledge of the quantity of land, for which his brother had paid taxes, nor what was the amount estimated on the Commissioner\u2019s books; but, that all that he had learned on the subject, was from vague report: that he had understood that his brother had purchased the land at the estimated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>quantity of 10,000 acres; and lie had heard it as the opinion of others, that the tract would hold out more than 10,000 acres; but, whether it would exceed that quantity, the respondent had no means of judging: that he does not admit that, in the negociation, it was taken for granted, that the quantity of land was from 10,000 to 12,000 acres; and he is confident that no such thing was mentioned at the time: that he does not admit, that a deiiciency in quantity was never contemplated by the parties, and therefore not provided for; because, although the respondent did expect that there would be found more than 10,000 acres in the tract, yet, such was the vague and unsatisfactory information on which they both acted, that it was certainly in the contemplation of the respondent <em>that there might be a </em>deficiency, and he thinks it must have been in the contemplation of the complainant also; and he is confident that both parties intended to make provision for such deiiciency, and believed that they had done so, <em>by a, contract for a sale in gross, whereby the purchaser took the risque of quantity: </em>that the contract was written by the complainant, and the expression that the tract of land contained <em>\u201c by estimation, </em>ten or twelve thousand acres,\u201d was selected by himself, and founded on nothing which had passed during the negociation, unless upon the great vagueness and entire uncertainty of the quantity of land sold, and was regarded by the respondent as an evidence that no definite quantity of land %vas intended to be stipulated for: that, by the recital of the deed from the trustees of Ross to Thomas Norvell, (which the respondent had never seen till after his sale to the complainant,) it was stated that the tract was <em>supposed to contain </em>10,000 <em>acres: </em>that the complainant had been employed as counsel in a suit concerning a part of the said land, hi which the title papers must necessarily have passed under his view: that the respondent having refused to warrant the title, except against his testator, and those claiming under him, the attention of the complainant was particularly attracted to the title of the land, and, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>to the title papers: that the respondent considered that the sale made by him was a sale <em>in gross, whereby the purchaser was to take the whole risque of quantity, and was to Pay ^ie whole purchase money, whether the tract held out much or little, and that whatever excess was found in the quantity, the plaintiff would be entitled to it without paying more than the stipulated price: </em>that the exigencies of T. NorvelPs estate required an immediate sale of the land, and in such manner as to leave no ground for controversy <em>about the payment of the purchase money: </em>that, in consideration of these circumstances, the respondent agreed to take less for the land, than he would otherwise have taken, and much less than his testator held it at in his life-time : that, if the objection was ever made by the complainant, that no specific quantity was ever mentioned in the deed, as stated in the bill, his <em>relinquishment of it afterwards </em>proves that, in the opinion of both parties, the purchaser took the risque of quantity: that he had no <em>confident belief, </em>as the bill states, that the real quantity would considerably exceed the estimated quantity of land, as he had no <em>data </em>on which to form a judgment: that he believes that, during the negociation, he did express to the plaintiff the opinion, that the tract would hold out more than 10,000 acres; but he did not profess to give the complainant any information on the subject, but only founded this opinion on facts, and the opinion of others, concerning which the respondent knew more than himself: that he does not know whether his testator paid taxes for as much as 10,000 acres, having never seen the documents in relation to that subject, before the sale: that, for these reasons, he does not think that the complainant is entitled to any deduction; but, if he is, it can only be for a deficiency of the land below 10,000 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\"><em>Jesse Burton </em>states, that he had frequent conversations with <em>Tucker </em>and <em>Edmund B. Norvell, </em>during their negociation for the land in question, and he understood that <em>Tucker </em>purchased, <em>just as it stood, </em>taking on himself all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>risque as to <em>quantity as well </em>as title: that, from the best information he could collect from the neighbors, it appeared to be their opinion, that the land would probably hold out 12.000 acres; which opinion the witness communicated to both parties: that those neighbors did not state any fact upon which this opinion was founded, except the immense boundaries of the land: that, before the sale, the witness urged <em>E. 13. Norvett to ask </em>a higher price than he seemed disposed to take, and his reply was, that he wished to wash his hands of it, and have nothing more to do with it: that he was the agent for leasing the said land, and paid the taxes: but that the plaintiff never enquired of him, upon what quantity he paid taxes, as well as he recollects: that he is under the impression that several conversations took place, in his presence, between <em>Norvett </em>and <em>Tucker, </em>in relation to the said land, before the sale; and he does not recollect that a less quantity was ever contemplated, than 10.000 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\"><em>James C. Moorman </em>states, that he understood from <em>Tucker, </em>that he was to take the interest of <em>Norvett </em>in the estate, supposed to contain 10,000 acres, <em>more or less, </em>and to give <em>$ </em>27,500: that he was anxious to become a partner in <em>the </em>purchase, and should have considered himself as taking the <em>risque of quantity: </em>that he had offered <em>Norvett </em>$35,000 for the land, with <em>general warranty; </em>but that the latter refused, saying that he only intended to sell his testator\u2019s interest: that the parties spoke of 10,000 acres, but, it being an old survey, they thought it would hold out more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">The deed, from the trustees of <em>Ross </em>to <em>T. Norvell, </em>conveys the land, as \u201c being <em>supposed </em>to contain 10,000 acres. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-9\">The Chancellor dissolved the injunction; and an appeal was allowed by one of the Judges of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A7O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Leigh </em>and <em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Av1\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-8\">On the part of the <em>appellant, </em>it was admitted, that the deed from <em>Norvell </em>to <em>Tucker </em>contained no specification of quantity, and therefore the appellant must depend upon extraneous evidence. That such evidence is admissible, is proved by the cases of <em>Quesnell </em>v. <em>Woodlief, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 173; <em>Jolliffe </em>v. <em>Hite, </em>1 Call, 301; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 164. But, it would be improper to resort to <em>parol </em>testimony to explain the intention of the parties, while there is the more authentic evidence of a <em>ivritten contract under seal. </em>Confining ourselves, therefore, to this document, we find that the land was conveyed - as \u201c <em>containing by estimation ten or twelve thousand acres.\u201d </em>The parties contemplated a sale of land, which was to amount to <em>at least </em>10,000 acres. Even if the expression \u201cmore or less\u201d had been used, the cases of <em>Quesnell </em>v. <em>Woodlief </em>and <em>Jolliffe </em>v. <em>Hite, </em>prove that such ex- ' pression would only cover a <em>small </em>deficiency, not such an enormous one as occurs in this case, as 1,085 acres, according to the lowest estimate, or 1,673 acres, according to the highest. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>confirms this principle. The case of <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>1 Munf. 330, proves, that a mistake as to the <em>boundaries </em>of land will be a good \u2022ground for relief. It is a well known principle, that when the vendor\u2019s own title papers call for a less quantity than that which he sells, the vendee shall be relieved. <em>Duvals </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>2 Munf. 290. The deed from the trustees of <em>Ross </em>to <em>T. Norvell, </em>states that the land was <em>supposed to contain </em>10,000 <em>acres; </em>and, therefore, <em>E. Norvell </em>the executor was guilty of a <em>constructive </em>fraud in stating the amount in the written agreement, at ten <em>or twelve thousand </em>acres. <em>Gross negligence </em>is equal to <em>intentional fraud; </em>and if <em>E. Norvell </em>did not take the trouble to examine the deed, by which his testator held, he cannot pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>tect himself by such culpable neglect. Where there is a mutual mistake, a Court of Equity will grant relief. 13 <em>Ves. 125, </em>427. Contracts of hazard are not to be encouraged; as they are, in truth, nothing more but a species of gambling. 1 <em>Anstruth. </em>C4; 10 <em>Ves. </em>209. Here the parties never treated for less than 10,000 acres. The deed to <em>T. Norvell </em>called for that quantity; and it was the duty of his executor not to sell it for less. He accordingly stales it at that quantity in the written agreement; but goes further, and excites an expectation, not justified by his title papers, that it <em>map </em>contain 12,000 acres.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-5\">As to the depositions of <em>Moorman </em>and <em>Burton, </em>they are inadmissible. <em>Parol </em>evidence cannot be received, to explain a written contract under seal, except in certain specified cases, none of which apply to the present case. The only question is, whether, under the words of the contract, the vendor sold any precise quantity, or made a representation, which turns out to be untrue. But, these depositions, if admitted, are very far from supporting the appellee\u2019s pretensions. <em>Moorman </em>only proves a contract for 10,000 acres, <em>more or less. </em>It has been often decided, that these words only cover a small deficiency in quantity. As to <em>Burton\u2019s </em>deposition, he gives his <em>inferences </em>instead of <em>facts. </em>His opinions are formed upon <em>Norvell\u2019s </em>representations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-7\">As to the presumption of information in <em>Tucker, </em>from his vicinity to the land, and from his being employed as counsel in an action of ejectment for part of this very land, the first is unfounded in fact, and the other is refuted by <em>Tucker\u2019s </em>declaration in his answer, that the suit in which he was engaged as counsel, did not require any other title paper than the deeds from <em>Boss </em>to his trustees, and from them to <em>Norvell; </em>and, that in point of fact, he had never seen any other title paper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-8\">For the <em>appellee, </em>it was said, that it appeared by the bill of the <em>appellant </em>himself, that he had no shadow of right to a decree in his favor. By his own statement, the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>tract was a bargain of <em>hazard, </em>by which he took the chance 0f <em>\u00a1\u00a1oss^ </em>jf ianc\\ should prove deficient; and, of <em>gain, </em>if there should turn out to be an excess. The bill admits that <em>Tucker </em>bought the land in <em>gross. </em>It is not pretended that <em>Norvell </em>knew more than <em>Tucker </em>about the land. A deed was executed <em>without any specification of </em>quantity. This omission was objected to by <em>Tucker </em>before the execution of the deed; but, <em>after </em>some discussion, it was waived, and the deed suffered to remain without any mention of the number of acres. And yet, the appellant contends, that the appellee <em>warranted </em>a certain quantity; by which, he would have the benefit of any <em>excess, </em>while the vendor would not derive advantage from any <em>deficiency. </em>Such a contract would be_highly improbable in any man, and much more so in an <em>executor, </em>who was to derive no personal benefit to himself, and might sustain a personal loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-3\">But, it is contended, that we may resort to the <em>written contract to </em>explain the deed, while we are precluded from relying on the <em>parol </em>evidence. But, the contract itself, cannot be resorted to, upon the mere ground of <em>variance </em>between it and the deed; because, in that case, it will be presumed that the variance was intentional, and that the parties thought fit to change the terms of the contract before the execution of the deed, as is clearly proved by the decisions respecting marriage articles. <em>Legge </em>v. <em>Goldwire, </em>Forrester 20; <em>Fearne\u2019s Cont. Rem. 4th edit. </em>124; 1 <em>Fonb. </em>190, <em>n. p.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-4\">If, however, we resort to the written contract, it prove\u00ae nothing, but a sale in <em>gross. </em>It describes the land as a tract of land \u201c <em>containing by estimation </em>10,000 <em>or </em>12,000 <em>acresf\u2019 </em>that is, the same land that <em>T. Norvell </em>purchased of the trustees of <em>Ross; </em>and, that <em>Norvell, </em>the executor, is only to convey <em>the interest vested in the said T. Norvell to said land, and to warrant the title against all persons claiming under the said T. Norvell. </em>These expressions can convey no other meaning than that of a sale in <em>.gross, </em>without responsibility in the vendor for any de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>fieiency, and without right to gain by any excess. The <em>vagueness </em>of the quantity mentioned shews, that those expressions were mere terms of <em>description, </em>and not <em>conditions </em>of the agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-4\">But, if we go beyond the deed, we are at liberty to look into <em>the parol </em>evidence, as well as the written agreement. All the cases which have been cited on the other side, prove, that there is no exclusion of <em>parol </em>evidence, if a proper case made out for admitting evidence extraneous to the deed. If the depositions are admitted, they place the subject beyond doubt. <em>Burton </em>proves that he was present during the negociation, and that he understood the contract to be such, that <em>Tucker </em>took the risque of <em>quantity </em>as well as title. <em>Moorman\u2019s </em>testimony confirms <em>Burton\u2019s </em>in this particular, and proves <em>Tucker\u2019s </em>declaration, that he bought the land for <em>more or less. </em>When these words are coupled with tho phrase <em>by estimation, </em>they amount to a sale in <em>gross. </em>A mistake in both parties, as to a matter of opinion, has never been considered a ground for relief. There is no case of a <em>bargain of hazard, </em>made upon equal terms, where the losing party has been relieved. In most of the cases, the vendor has more information than the vendee, and either makes a false representation, or suppresses that which he ought to communicate; but, in this case, <em>Tucker </em>had at least as much information as <em>Norvell, </em>if not more. The parties in this case both speculated on the probability of an <em>old survey </em>being short of the actual quantity. Their bargain was formed on <em>the </em>idea of this uncertainty. The grounds of opinion were open to both. No fraud, no suppression of facts can be imputed to either. It was, in short, like the ordinary case of insurance, where the event is doubtful to both parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-5\">The case of <em>Jolliffe </em>v. <em>Hite, </em>1 Call, 301, is in strict conformity with these ideas, and establishes the principle, that in a sale in <em>gross, </em>the parties take the risque of quantity; and, that in such a bargain, the words <em>more or less </em>cover any deficiency, however great. Indeed, in a sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>in gross, </em>those words are superfluous, the contract implyfng the same thing without them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adx\"><em>Nelson v. Matthews, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 164, is not appbcable to this case. That was the case of a sale of land as containing a certain number of acres, when the vendor\u2019s own title deeds called for less than such specified quantity. The case did not turn on the words <em>more or less, </em>but upon the constructive fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-6\">The case of <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Cunningham, 1 </em>Munf. <em>330, </em>is no authority against the appellee. That was a sale <em>in gross, </em>and a mistake was committed as to the <em>boundaries </em>of the land. Relief was very properly granted to the purchaser in that case, because he had bought a particular <em>tract, </em>and an error having been committed as to its boundaries, he could not get the <em>specific thing </em>he had purchased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-7\">As to the case of <em>Quesnell </em>v. <em>Woodlief, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 173, it is incorrectly reported. It turned on the ground of fraud. <em>Quesnell </em>was a Frenchman, ignorant of our language, customs and laws. The vendor sold <em>by the acre. </em>He represented that there was an old survey, that called for a certain number of acres, which was <em>not true. </em>On the ground of these circumstances of imposition and false representation, <em>Quesnell </em>obtained relief. But, here it cannot be pretended that <em>Norvell </em>made any false representation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-8\">The case of <em>Duvals v. Ross, </em>2 Munf. 290, .simply affirms the principle of <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Matthews.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-9\">The case of <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Hickman, 2 </em>Munf. 294, (reported in Judge <em>Roane\u2019s </em>opinion in <em>Duvals </em>v. <em>Ross,) </em>is also a case of <em>constructive fraud; </em>the vendor having conveyed land as containing a greater number of acres than his title deeds warranted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-10\"><em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Carrington, </em>4 Munf. 332, was a sale of land by the <em>acre, </em>and therefore not applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-11\"><em>Fleet </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>6 Munf. 188, belongs to that class of cases which affirm, that a sale <em>in gross </em>does not bind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the vendor to convey a certain number of acres, even although a number of acres be mentioned, <em>by way of description.</em></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Acc\">\n<em>December 4.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Akn\">As to the <em>taxes, Norvell </em>avers in his answer, that he did not know tlieir amount; and no man consults Sheriffs\u2019 receipts to ascertain the quantity of his land.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A70\">Judge Green,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">delivered the following, as the unanimous opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">If the appellant, provided he had not accepted the deed, would have been entitled to the relief for which he asks, his acceptance of the deed ought not to preclude him from claiming it now. The mistake in the quantity of the land, was not, and could not be ascertained, until after the execution of the deed. That was executed only three days after the execution of the contract. The deed may be evidence of the then understanding of the parties, as to the terms of the agreement, but not a bar to relief, if a proper case for relief in other respects, were made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Whether the circumstances of this case would or would not authorise the admission of <em>parol </em>evidence to explain the written agreement, it is unnecessary to decide. If the <em>written </em>contract be mistaken or equivocal as to its terms, the parties may explain it according to their real and original intention, either by a new instrument of writing, or by their admissions of record. The contract in this case was, upon its face, equivocal, and of doubtful construction. But, the appellant\u2019s bill states the real terms of the agreement, to the same effect as the <em>parol </em>proofs in the cause. It slates, that \u201cboth parties, relying that the lands had been previously conveyed as containing about 10,000 acres, and consisting of old surveys, and upon the general reputation respecting the quantity of the said land, confidently expected that the real quantity would considerably exceed the estimated quantity, and that this belief operated on both parties in making the bargain;\u201d and that \u201c during the whole negociation for the purchase, which continued seve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>i\u2019al days, the discussions of the parties turned principally on the price and terms of payment, and especially the title, which was then controverted by the executor of <em>D. Ross', </em>^ut the quantity of land was taken for granted, to be from 10 to 12,000 acres, and upwards; and that a deficiency was never contemplated by the parties, and, consequently, was not provided for;\u201d and that \u201chis purchase was <em>in gross, </em>and no particular quantity was warranted.\u201d This last declaration is equivalent to an assertion, that the purchase was not by the acre, or of any particular quantity of land; but of a tract of land in bulk, for a price in gross, upon the belief of both parties, that it would turn out 10 or 12,000 acres, or more; but, without regard to what it might actually turn out to be, and without contemplating a responsibility of either party, in case of an excess or deficiency. For, a sale by the quantity would have been in effect a warranty on the part of the vendor, of the quantity sold. This accords with the cotemporaneous construction given by the parties, in executing and accepting a deed for the entire tract of land, without the specification of boundaries or quantity. If 10 or 12,000 acres of land had been the subject of the contract, and the quantity had been considered as material, it would have been stated in the deed; the object of the deed being to convey what had been sold. The written contract is fairly susceptible of the same construction. If quantity was the real object of the purchase and sale, although the parties had not the means of ascertaining that truly, they would have stated, upon conjecture, a specific quantity; so as to afford some rule for the measure of compensation for the deficiency or excess, when ascertained. The indefinite expression of 10 or 12,000 acres afforded no such rule, and shews that the subject of quantity was not really in the contemplation of the parties, as one of the terms of the contract. It was an expression, apt enough as one particular of the description of the \u201ctract of land\u201d sold, and was probably introduced for that purpose only. This conclusion is warranted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>terms of the contract, and is rendered certain by the admissions in the bill. The purchaser took upon himself the <em>. </em>risque of quantity and title; and although both parties were influenced, in their agreement as to the price, by the belief that the tract of land contained more than the estimated quantity, as stated in the conveyance from <em>Ross\u2019s </em>trustees to <em>Norvell; </em>yet, the hazard of loss to one party, in the event of an excess, and to the other, in case of a deficiency, which, although not expected, was possible, would also influence the parties in fixing the price. It cannot be known or presumed, that if <em>Tucker </em>had insisted, that <em>Norvell </em>should warrant that the tract contained 10,000 acres, he would have consented to do so, upon any terms, or that he would have taken the price which he agreed to take, upon the contract in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">- The estimation of the quantity was made by both parties, upon the same facts, which were equally known to both. Norvell did not take upon himself, to make any affirmation or representation in respect to quantity. He only declared his real opinion, founded upon the very same information which <em>Tucker </em>had, and in which the latter concurred with him, without being influenced by the opinion of the former. He concealed no fact within his knowledge, which could, in any degree, influence that opinion. He had not seen the receipts for taxes, and he was guilty of- no negligence (if that were material) in not searching for them, and examining them, as a means of ascertaining the quantity. The source of information on that subject, which he would most naturally and reasonably resort to, was, the conveyance under which his testator claimed; and being informed that the conveyance called for <em>about </em>10,000 acres, he had no motive for further enquiry; and if he had, he could not have expected any thing like accurate information, from the Sheriff\u2019s receipts for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">This was, therefore, a contract of hazard, without any fraud, concealment, misrepresentation, or negligence, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the part of the vendor. The error in respect to the quantpy 0f land, was mutual, and was not in relation to the substance of the thing contracted for, but in relation to the very hazard contemplated by the parties. The question is, whether the disappointed party is, in such case, entitled to relief; and this was the question which the appellant, with perfect frankness, intended to submit to the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">There are cases in which the mutual error of the parties, without default in either, may be a just ground for rescinding a contract. As, if the error be in a matter which is the cause of-the contract, that is, in the <em>substance </em>of the thing contracted for, so that the purchaser cannot get what he bargained for; as in the case of a purchase of military lands on <em>Paint Creels, </em>stated to be located under specified warrants, and the warrants were located <em>elsewhere; </em>and of the purchase of an obligation at the risque of the purchaser, and the paper turned out to be forged, or the obligor to have been previously discharged from the obligation, under the statute of bankruptcy. In such cases, the contract ought to be vacated, even if it had been executed; and, if both the parties, in the first case, verily believed that the warrants were located on <em>Paint </em>Creek; and, in the other, that the obligation was genuine and the party bound by it; the object, in the first case, being to buy lands on <em>Paint Creek; </em>and, in the other, to buy a valid and subsisting obligation, the error would go to the <em>substratum </em>of the matter contracted for. <em>Chamberlayne </em>v. <em>Marsh, 6 </em>Munf. 283; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>Ibid. 287. But, if in the one case, the warrant had really been located on <em>Paint Creek, </em>and the parties had both been of opinion, from the general character of lands on that Creek, that the lands were of great value, and it had turned out that they were of very little value; or, if in the other, the obligation had been genuine and still binding upon the obligor, and both parties believed that he was in affluent circumstances and able to pay, and it turned out that he was, at the time of the contract, utterly insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>vent; the purchaser, in neither case, could have relief, since he has gotten that which was the cause of the contract, and the error was in relation to the very hazard, which the purchaser took upon himself. If relief could be given in such a case as the case at bar, <em>a fortiori </em>it should be given, if the vendor knew of the deficiency and concealed it. So that, in both cases, when the vendor knew, and when he was ignorant of the deficiency, relief being given, there could no lon - ger be a contract, in which a purchaser could take the risque of quantity effectually upon himself. The Court of Appeals have uniformly recognized the validity and obligation of such a contract, and in all cases in which they have given relief, it has been founded on circumstances either of fraud, misrepresentation or concealment; or mistake in part, or in whole, in relation to the substance of the <em>thing contracted for. </em>It is possible, that the case of <em>Quesnell </em>v. <em>Woodlief </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 173, does not fall within this observation; but, the grounds of the judgment in that case are so uncertain, some of the Judges who decided it, the. Reporter and the counsel on both sides, who argued the cause, differing so materially in their statements of the reasons upon which the judgment was founded, that it cannot be considered an obligatory authority to the point now under consideration; and, if it were so considered, it has been repeatedly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The Court is unanimously of opinion, that the decree is <em>right </em>and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
