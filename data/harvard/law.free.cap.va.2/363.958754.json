That the reciting in the bond, the names of the plaintiffs in the execution, by their partnership name, is sufficient.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-22\">In July 1837, <em>Jesse Davis </em>instituted an action of trespass in the Superior Court of <em>Hampshire </em>county, against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Samuel Davis </em>for unlawfully taking and selling the plaintiff\u2019s horse. The defendant appeared, and pleaded the general issue, and also a special plea. The special plea stated: That heretofore, to wit, on the 15th of May 1837, at the county of Hampshire, one <em>Reuben Davis, </em>a justice of the peace in and for said county, issued three several executions of <em>fieri facias, </em>directed to any sworn constable of the district No. , to execute and execute and sell as much return commanding him to of the personal estate of <em>James Murphy </em>as would satisfy <em>Vance Sp Kuykendall. </em>(The three executions were then set out at length in the plea; and seem to be in proper form, except that in the caption it is \u201c <em>Hardy </em>county\u201d instead of \u201c <em>Hampshire.\u201d) </em>The plea then proceeds: which said several executions, afterwards, to wit, on the 5th day of May 1837, (the date of the executions,) at the county aforesaid, and whilst the same was in full force, and unsatisfied, were placed in the hands of said defendant, then and there being a constable in and for the said county of <em>Hampshire, </em>with district , to execute and return according to law. And said defendant avers, that afterwards, to wit, on the day of May 1837, at the county aforesaid, and whilst the said several executions were in his hands as constable aforesaid, and whilst the same were in full force, and unsatisfied, and before the return day thereof, and within the district for which he was constable in said county, he levied the said several executions on an iron grey horse, which the said <em>Vance Sf Kuykendall </em>then and there alleged to be the property of said <em>Francis Murphy; </em>and a doubt having arisen whether the title to said property was in the said <em>Francis Murphy, </em>or not, <em>William Vance, </em>one of the partners of the said firm of <em>Vance Sf Kuykendall, </em>afterwards, to wit, on the 26th of June 1837, in the county aforesaid, and whilst said defendant had said horse under said executions, and whilst they were in full force and unsatisfied, by the name of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>Vance Sf Kuykendall, </em>together with <em>David Gibson </em>as his surety, executed and delivered to the said <em>Samuel </em>Davis, so being a constable of the said county of <em>Hampshire, </em>a bond in the penalty of eighty-nine dollars, with condition. (The bond is set out at length in the plea, and recites \u201cthat whereas the said <em>Vance Sf Kuykendall </em>had sued out from <em>Reuben Davis, </em>a justice of the peace for the county of <em>Hampshire </em>aforesaid, three different writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>to wit, one, and another, and another, against the goods and chattels of <em>Francis Murphy, </em>upon three different judgments obtained before the said justice of peace, which said writs, with the legal costs attending the same, amounted to the sum of forty-four dollars and fifty cents. And whereas the said <em>Samuel Davis, </em>constable of the county of <em>Hampshire </em>aforesaid, by virtue of the said writs, to the said constable directed, had levied the same on the following property, viz: one iron grey horse, and a doubt arising\u201d &amp;c. This bond was signed \u201c <em>Vance Sf Kuykendall.'\u201d) </em>The plea then proceeds to aver that the security was sufficient, that the defendant proceeded to sell the horse under the executions, and that, within twenty days from the date of the bond, he had returned the executions and the bond to the clerk\u2019s office of <em>Hampshire </em>county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-4\">The plaintiff craved oyer of the bond, and demurred to the plea; and assigned for causes of demurrer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\"><em>First. </em>That the judgments are not set out in the plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-6\"><em>Second. </em>That the executions upon their face were issued by a justice of <em>Hardy; </em>and are averred in the plea to have been issued by a justice of <em>Hampshire.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\"><em>Third. </em>The indemnifying bond was not taken pursuant to the statute:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-8\">1st. Because the executions are not set out in the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-9\">2d.
