After maldng this deed, the grantor died the same year (1810), leaving a widow, and three children by her. In 1811, the acting trustee sold a portion of the real property, and the proceeds were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>applied towards the discharge of the debts. In 1814 one of the children died, whereby her interest in remainder in the whole estate passed to her mother and the two other children. In 1815 another child died, whereby his like interest (embracing that acquired through the child that had first died) passed to his mother and the surviving child. And in 1816 the widow died, whereby the interests in the remainder which she had so acquired, passed, as to the realty, to her surviving child, and as to the personalty, to her second husband, who survived her and became her administrator. At the period of the widow\u2019s death, part of the real and part of the personal estate conveyed was undisposed of by the trustee; and thereafter he disposed of part of each to satisfy debts. Held, 1. the conversion in 1811, of part of the realty into personalty, being within the authority and discretion of the trustee, and made at a time when there was no conflict, but an identity of interest, amongst those entitled to the estate, cannot, by reason of circumstances thereafter arising, furnish any equity for a reimbursement of the realty out of the personalty, or for contribution in favour of the former against the latter. 2. That though, upon the widow\u2019s death, the succession to the real fell into a different channel from the personal property, yet as the authority and discretion of the trustee in regard to sales of the property, whether real or personal, continued as before, no equity could arise between the realty and personalty for <em>reimbursement </em>of one to the other, neither being primarily, but the whole estate indiscriminately, subjected to payment of the debts by the provisions of the trust deed; which, and not the principles governing the administration of decedents\u2019 estates, must give the rule upon the subject. But 3. that an equity of a different nature did, however, arise out of the provisions of the trust deed, so soon as the succession to the realty and the personalty so fell into different channels; and it was simply this, that the owners of the realty and personalty should <em>contribute </em>to the burthen of paying the debts remaining unsatisfied at the widow\u2019s death, in proportion to the value of their respective interests: and the exercise by the trustee of the authority and discretion vested in him, should not have the effect of disturbing the due apportionment of that burthen amongst those several interests.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-9\"><em>Ralph Wormley </em>the first died in 1806, having by his will devised and bequeathed a large real and personal estate to his son <em>Ralph, </em>subject however to the payment of debts. On the 8th of August 1810, the testator\u2019s son <em>Ralph </em>(who will be called hereafter <em>Ralph </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>second) made a deed of trust to <em>John Tayloe </em>and <em>John T.

The child <em>Elizabeth </em>died in 1814, and <em>John </em>in 1815. After-wards, in October 1815, the widow <em>Eliza </em>married <em>Carter Braxton. </em>She died in 1816, leaving her husband <em>Braxton </em>and her son <em>Ralph </em>surviving her, and no other descendant. In 1824 this son <em>(Ralph </em>the third) died an infant, intestate and unmarried, whereby, his estate became divisible into two moieties, one for bis paternal and the other for his maternal kindred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-4\">In 1828 a bill was filed in the superior court of chancery at <em>Fredericksburg, </em>by the said paternal and maternal kindred, setting forth, that <em>Lomax </em>alone took upon himself the burthen of the execution of the trust; that at various times he sold considerable real and personal estate, and received rents and hires, and had paid off the debts of <em>Ralph </em>the second ; that in a suit in the said court in the name of <em>Ward </em>and others, creditors of said <em>Ralph </em>the second, against <em>Tayloe </em>and others, the accounts of said <em>Lomax </em>as trustee had from time <em>to </em>time been settled by a commissioner and allowed, and the complainants, having examined the same, were content therewith ; that the real estate left consists of a valuable tract of land called <em>Rosegill, </em>in <em>Middlesex, </em>and the personal estate left consists of about <em>23 </em>slaves, some stock, and a balance of funds in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>hands of the trustee, arising from sales of real and personal estate, rents of land, and hires of slaves; and the complainants claim that the whole of the said real and personal estate, not required for the payment of debts, should be divided and distributed amongst them. They state, however, that <em>Carter </em>Braxton, as administrator of his wife, claims to share in the personal estate ; and he is made a defendant, as well as <em>Lomax </em>the surviving trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-4\">The answer of <em>Lomax </em>admitted, that the entire agency of the trust had devolved upon him (except as to the sale of one slave and the disbursement of the proceeds), and that he had from time to time settled accounts of his trust, in the suits by the creditors of <em>Ralph </em>the second against the trustees, all of which were consolidated in the name of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Tayloe; </em>and the respondent expressed his belief that there would be a considerable surplus of estate of <em>Ralph </em>the second, after the payment of the creditors. He prayed, however, if the court made a decree for a division of the estate, that it would make provision for an adequate indemnification of himself and his cotrustee against the liabilities to which they were exposed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\"><em>Braxton, </em>in his answer, said, that on the death of the infant <em>Elizabeth, </em>her mother became entitled to one third of her estate, that is, to one ninth of the estate of <em>Ralph </em>the second ; and on the death of the infant <em>John, </em>his mother became entitled to one half of his estate, that is, to two other ninths of the estate of <em>Ralph </em>the second; and thus, at the time of the death of mrs. <em>Braxton, </em>the portion to which she was entitled of the estate of <em>Ralph </em>the second was one third thereof. He stated that the only real estate sold since the deaths of <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>John </em>was a farm called <em>The Cottage, </em>which was sold for about 3000 dollars ; while the personal estate sold since their deaths amounted to about 12000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>dollars. And he insisted that the heirs of <em>Ralph Wormley </em>the third had no right to have the real estate relieved and reimbursed by the personal, (because of the palpable difference between the case of an executor and of a trustee,) but on the contrary, when the real and personal estates descended and passed to different parties, the trustees ought, and in equity would be compelled, to draw ratably on the two funds, the real and the personal, for the payment of debts ; or, if this principle be not sanctioned, that the court should decree the respondent one third of the slaves and money remaining in the hands of the trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-4\">The court of chancery, in 1828, decreed a division of the tract of land called <em>Rosegill </em>among the heirs of <em>Ralph </em>the third, making provision for the indemnity of the trustees against any debts which might afterwards be demanded against either <em>Ralph </em>the first or <em>Ralph </em>the second; and the court also directed certain accounts, to enable it to decree in respect to the personalty. The cause was afterwards removed to the circuit court of <em>Stafford, </em>and subsequently to <em>Essex.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">The report of the commissioner shewed, that there was brought into the accounts reported in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Tayloe, </em>and applied towards the discharge of the debts of <em>Ralph </em>the second, the sum of 9172 dollars 41 cents, which was the proceeds of a tract of land called <em>Fianketank, </em>sold by the trustees in 1811.

At the time of the decree in 1828, the proceedings in the suits between the creditors of <em>Ralph Wormley </em>and his trustees, together with the papers filed and the accounts taken in those suits, were, by consent of parties, referred to as a part of the record in this suit, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>court at that time confirmed those accounts. Hence the account returned in this case by the commissioner, the transactions of the trustee, commenced with the balance due on the first of September 1828 according to a previous report, and no accounts of the trustee prior to that time were inserted in the record of this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\">In the progress of the cause an amended bill was filed, making the personal representatives of <em>Elizabeth, John </em>and <em>Ralph </em>the third, parties defendants. This amended bill, however, set forth that they all died infants and not at all indebted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-8\">On the 26th of April 1837, the circuit court of <em>Essex, </em>declaring its opinion to be that the money and slaves of the trust fund in the hands of the defendant <em>Lomax </em>should be distributed as the personal estate of the deceased infants <em>Elizabeth, John </em>and <em>Ralph Wormley, </em>directed a division of the slaves, and decreed to the defendant <em>Braxton, </em>as administrator of his wife <em>Elizabeth, </em>one third thereof, and one third of the said sum of 5165 dollars 78 cents ; and to the distributees of <em>Ralph Wormley </em>the third, the other two thirds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-9\">From this decree, on the petition of the complainants, an appeal was allowed. The view taken in the petition was, that by the report of the commissioner, the aggregate amount of the personal estate in the hands of the trustee appeared to be far short of what had come to the hands of the trustee from the real estate, since the deaths of the two children of <em>Ralph </em>the second, and indeed since the death of their mother, his widow. And it was insisted that the decree was erroneous,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-10\">1st. Because it is a matter of plain equity, that the conversion of the estates of infants, after their deaths and the devolution of their rights on their heirs, which after events ascertain to be unnecessary, does not extinguish or impair their rights therein, so as to alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>their rights of succession; but there was a plain re-suiting trust to <em>Ralph </em>the surviving child, in the proceeds of the converted property; and consequently, respect to the balance of 5165 dollars 78 cents, of a fund of upwards of 20,000 dollars resulting from the real estate, that stands in place of so much real estate of <em>Ralph </em>the third, and passed on his death to his heirs and distributees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-4\">2ndly, Because, by principles analogous to the foregoing, (as the personal was the natural fund for the payment of debts,) the trustee and administrator of <em>Ralph </em>the second ought to have applied the slaves to that object; and if, for convenience, he has, by his power as trustee, applied the real estate of the heir to that object, the slaves ought, in a question between the real and personal representatives, to stand in the place of the land and have the same destination as the land wouldi or at least, in favour of the heir, be charged with a sum equal , to that which had been taken from the real estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-5\"><em>Stanard </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9Px\">If it was the purpose of any party to insist that what the commissioner has reported to have arisen from real estate did not so arise, there ought to have been an exception to the report on this ground. But the report is without exception, and must be considered correct. So considering it, the consequence follows, that what now remains in the hands of the trustee should pass as real estate. For the rule is well established, that where a conversion is not made until after the death of the party making a trust, the surplus remaining after satisfying the purposes of the trust that he has created, and which would go to him if alive, is an interest in real estate, which passes as such to his heirs or devisees. <em>Emblyn </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>Prec. in Ch. 541. <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Radcliffe, </em>10 Mod. 230. <em>Digby </em>v. <em>Legard, </em>2 Dick. 500. <em>Ackroyd </em>v. <em>Smithson and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>others, </em>1 Brown\u2019s Ch. Rep. 503. These cases shew that where a conversion of land is authorized for particular purposes, and the land is converted to a larger amount than is necessary for those purposes, the surplus money will descend as land. The surplus here must pass as land on. another ground. Equity will not permit the real estate of infants to be so converted into personalty, as to interfere with the course of descent. 1 Lomax\u2019s Digest 203. 1 R. C. of 1819, ch. 108. \u00a7 21. p. 410.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-4\">II. Since the death of mrs. <em>Braxton, </em>real estate has been applied to pay debts which are chargeable as well upon the realty as the personalty. What were the rights of the parties at her death ? Suppose, upon that event, <em>Ralph </em>the third had filed a bill claiming an account of the trust subject, and it had then appeared that there were debts chargeable upon the trust subject, and that this subject consisted partly of real estate and partly of personalty. Surely <em>Ralph </em>would have been entitled to require that the personalty should be applied to pay the debts, unless, by the act of a party competent to do it, the personalty had been exonerated from its primary liability for the payment of debts. This primary liability of the personalty results from the creditor\u2019s having a capacity to subject it primarily, while there are no means in his power to subject the real estate so long as there is personal property. But whether this or any other principle be the foundation of the rule, it\u2019is enough that the rule is established. The rule is not affected by the circumstance of there being a charge of debts upon the real estate as well as the personalty : to prevent its application, it must appear that there was a purpose not only to charge the realty, but to discharge the personalty. The cases, it is true, in which the doctrine has been principally discussed, are cases arising on wills. 1 Roper on Legacies 463. <em>Samwell </em>v. <em>Wake, </em>1 Brown\u2019s Ch. Rep. 144. <em>Duke of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Ancaster </em>v. <em>Mayer &amp; others, </em>Id. 454. And it may be said, this is not a case arising under a devise, but under a deed. But if the intention is to govern in the one case, it should govern in the other. It is in vain to say that the trustees had power to sell by the terms of the deed : there is the same power under a devise. But the power is not allowed to be so exercised as to affect the rights of others. Parties whose rights the testator did not contemplate affecting, shall not be affected. If, at the death of mrs. <em>Braxton, </em>the decision upon a bill by the heir would have been such as has been supposed, then the subsequent acts of the trustees cannot change the rights of the parties. The case of an heir paying a bond debt, who is entitled to be reimbursed out of the personal assets, and the case of the heir or devisee of a mortgagor paying off the mortgage, who is entitled to like reimbursement, are both familiar, and the principle of those cases applies to this. What is the discretion in the trustees ? A discretion to sell for the payment of debts, and limited to this purpose. Can it be held that this authorizes them to change the nature of the subject at their pleasure ? In what respect does this differ from a case of rights devolved by the law; such a case, for example, as <em>Godwin\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Godwin\u2019s adm\u2019x &amp;c. </em>4 Leigh 410. where slaves were sold to raise a fund for the payment of debts, and it turned out afterwards that the funds were not wanting ? The case will be exactly the same, if we suppose slaves to be sold, and funds afterwards to come to hand from other personalty, which might have been applied to the payment of debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arn\">But if, at the death of mrs. <em>Braxton, </em>the right of her personal representative be not to one third of the personal estate charged with the whole debts, the charge must at least be of a ratable proportion of the debts, according to the amount due and the value of the respective estates at the time the rights devolve.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ALC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Robinson </em>for appellee <em>Braxton.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO3\">Where land is conveyed by a deed of trust or mortgage to secure a debt, and, the debt not being paid, there is a surplus arising from the proceeds of sale, that surplus, not being disposed of by the deed, goes of course to the representatives of the grantor; and whether to his real or his personal representatives, depends upon the nature of the subject at the time of the grantor\u2019s death. If, when he died, the land had been sold, and the surplus was in the hands of the trustees in money, that surplus would necessarily go to his personal representative. If, when be died, the land had not been sold, and he had an interest in the land subject to the debt, an interest entitling him to redeem on paying the debt, that interest passes to his heir or devisee. Then if the land be sold in the lifetime of the heir or devisee, and at the time of the death of the heir or devisee there is a surplus in the hands of the trustees in money, it necessarily goes to the personal representative of the heir or devisee. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Rose, 2 </em>Sim. and Stu. 323. 1 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 477. <em>Evans &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Kingsberry &amp;c. 2 </em>Rand. 120. The circumstance that more than enough happens to be sold gives no equity, as between the heir and personal representative, to consider this surplus of money as land, but their rights depend upon the state of the subject at the time those rights accrue. <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin's ex'ors &amp;c. </em>5 Munf. 125. Upon the death of the party entitled to a surplus arising from a previous sale of lands, that surplus, being then a personal subject, goes to his personal representative; and if such party was entitled to rents and profits which had accrued from the lands before his death, those rents and profits are also a personal subject, which goes to his personal representative. <em>Levet v. Needham, 2 </em>Vern. 138.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-6\">If, in such a case as has been supposed, a case in which the conveyance was of real estate alone for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>simple purpose of paying debts, the surplus would go from the party entitled to his personal representative, <em>a fortiori </em>it must be the case here, where the grantor has blended his real and personal estate together, and conveyed the whole, without distinction, for the payment of his debts, for the support and maintenance of himself and his wife and family, and for the benefit of his children when the husband and wife should be dead. This case is much clearer in favour of the right of the personal representative, than the case of <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>decided by lord <em>Camden, </em>a statement of which is contained in <em>Fletcher v. Ashburner, </em>1 Brown\u2019s Ch. Rep. 500. 501. There it was provided, that the debts were to be paid in the first place out of the personal estate, as far as it would extend, and in the next place by a sale of the real estate or a sufficient part thereof. Whereas here the trustees are fully authorized and empowered to sell such part of the estate, whether real or personal, as to them might seem fit. They might sell real estate first, or personal estate first, or such part of one and such part of the other as to them might seem fit. There, too, the power to sell was a limited power to raise so much money as should be sufficient to pay the debts and legacies; and after payment thereof, the real estate unsold, and the surplus proceeds of the part sold, were devised to the testator\u2019s father and brother. Whereas here, besides the power to raise by sale so much money as should be sufficient to pay the debts, the trustees are authorized and empowered to dispose of the estate, or any part thereof, in such manner as might by them be deemed most beneficial and advantageous to all the parties interested. And there, though the question was between the heir and personal representative in respect to the surplus arising from a sale decreed after the ancestor\u2019s death, under an idea that a previous sale was insufficient, which (it appeared afterwards) was in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>sufficient, the court nevertheless determined (there being no fraud) that the second sale could not be considered as improperly made, and the money must go to the personal representative. Lord <em>Rosslyn, </em>in adverting to this decision, says, it shews the court thought there was no equity between the representatives, but that they must take their respective rights as they find them. <em>Oxenden </em>v. <em>Lord Compton, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 77, 8. <em>S. C. </em>4 Brown\u2019s Ch. Rep. 239. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Denne, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 176. <em>Lord Compton </em>v. <em>Oxenden, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 265. <em>S. C. </em>4 Brown\u2019s Ch. Rep. 403. A distinction may be supposed to exist between <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Flanagan </em>and this case, upon the ground that the surplus there arose from a sale made under a decree of court. But is there any material difference between such a sale, and a sale under the power given by this deed ? The trustees who acted here were a court chosen by that party under whom all interested claim, and who could give as much power and authority as could be conferred by a decree. And he has given such power. When, for the purpose of paying his just and lawful debts, they deem it proper to sell any part of the property, or when they dispose of any part of it because they deem it beneficial and advantageous to all interested, whether the part sold or disposed of be real or personal, their opinion, supposing they act without fraud, must bind all claiming under the deed, and the sale must be a valid sale. No injunction could be awarded to prevent the sale of any part of the property which the trustees saw fit to sell, if there were debts to be paid, or the sale was deemed by them beneficial and advantageous those interested. And if in such a case no injunction could be awarded to prevent the sale, it must be impossible to hold afterwards that it was improperly made. And unless a court can say that the sale w'as improperly made, the surplus must go to the personal representative of the party who, at the time of the sale, entitled to that surplus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The conversion from land into money being made in a regular and proper manner, the heir is not entitled to come into equity to reconvert the property, in order give it a descendible quality. If he were, it would be contrary to all analogy. Where money is transferred with directions that it shall be laid out in land, but the court comes to the conclusion that the character of land is not by the grantor imperatively fixed to the property, but that an option is given to parlies to retain the properly in money or vest it in land, the moment the conclusion is arrived at that there was such option, that moment it is ascertained that the property will go to the real or the personal representative, according to its state at the death of the party entitled. <em>Wheldale </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>5 Ves. 388. <em>S. C. </em>8 Ves. 227. When the fund is money, and it is claimed that the owner has made it land, it must appear that he intended it at all events to be turned into land and descend as such. If this was not his fixed purpose; if there be any uncertainty as to his purpose; if thpre be any option to permit it to remain in the one form or be converted into the other, it does not become land until that option is exercised and the conversion made. On the other hand, where the fund is land, and there is an option to permit it to remain in that form or be turned into money, when that option is exercised and the conversion made, it becomes money, and passes to the personal representative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-4\">The case of <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Maunde, </em>19 Ves. 424. is very apposite to this. The will in that case (the provisions of which are stated in <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>16 Ves. 27.) gave the whole estate to trustees, for the payment of debts, funeral expenses and legacies, and then to dispose of the residue for the use and benefit of the testator\u2019s relations and kindred, as the trustees in their discretion should think proper. The testator left it to their discretion to sell the same or such part thereof as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>might think proper, and to convey the same in such manner and form as they might think proper, wholly or only partly converting the estate into money for the purpose of division, as they might think proper. The trustees died before distribution; and then the heir claimed the fund, upon the ground that there was no longer any person authorized to distribute it. It was decided in 16 Yes. <em>27. </em>that the court of chancery might make the distribution; and the manner of distribution was decided upon by the chancellor in 19 Ves. 427, 8. \u201c Whatever the trustees did,\u201d says lord <em>Elion, \u201c </em>towards and in a due execution of their power, with a view to the execution of the trust which is now disappointed, the court will also take to be property of the same nature and quality as it is found. Whatever therefore was converted into personal estate in the due execution of the trust, must be taken as personal estate.\u201d These principles are further sustained by the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Claxton &amp;c. </em>4 Madd. C. R. 484. and <em>Dixon v. Dawson, 2 </em>Sim. &amp; Stu. 327. 1 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 485.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-9\">Considering it clear that upon the death of mrs. <em>Braxton, </em>her rights in whatever was then real estate passed to her real representative, and in whatever was then personal estate to her personal representative, the true question in this case is, whether the real representative had a right at that time to require that the personal estate should be applied to pay the debts, in exoneration of the real estate ? Upon this question, the cases relied upon on the other side are all cases of the administration of the assets of decedents\u2019 estates. But we have no such case here. <em>Ralph Wormley </em>the second, at the time of his death, had no assets whatever which could pass from him to his executor or administrator. His whole estate, real as well as personal, had been transferred by a conveyance made in his lifetime. And the case is no more one of the administration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>assets of his estate, than it would have been if the conveyance, instead of being by <em>Ralph Wormley, </em>had been by another person, of the property of that other upon the same trusts that are declared in this deed, and that person had continued alive to this time. We certainly can have here no question of marshalling assets, in the sense in which that term has hitherto been used. In all cases of the administration of assets of a decedent, whether testator or intestate, and whether under the will or under the law, the rights of the parties are fixed at the time the will takes effect or the death occurs. To that period the court looks in fixing their rights, no matter how long afterwards it may be that it has to decide upon them. How will such a principle apply here ? Could any <em>cestui que trust </em>say, at the date of the deed, that the personal estate must be exclusively applied, and the real estate not at all, to the payment of debts ? And if this could not be done, then it must be contended that the rights conferred by the deed are not to be ascertained from the deed, but depend upon subsequent events. Can this be so? Upon the deaths of <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>John, </em>could either mrs. <em>Braxton </em>or the guardian of <em>Ralph </em>have obtained the decree of a court controlling the discretion conferred upon the trustees by the deed? Surely not. The court must have said, it was competent to the grantor to put the trustees in his place, and make their action binding upon all claiming under him; and their authority to sell such part of the estate as to them might seem fit, was not, by the terms of the deed, limited to the lives of <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>John.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">It seems impossible to hold that at the death of mrs. <em>Braxton, </em>her third of the personal estate was charged with the whole debts then remaining. On the other hand, there may be difficulty in saying that after that time, when different parties were interested in the realty from him who succeeded to the personalty, the trustees still had the arbitrary right to sell, for the debts re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>maining due, such part of the estate either real or personal as to them might seem fit. A more equitable principle seems to be that suggested in the alternative presented by mr. <em>Stanard, </em>when concluding his argument ; to wit, that the court should say, that there being at the death of mrs. <em>Braxton </em>a certain amount of debts due, chargeable alike on the whole estate, and the real estate going to her son and the personal to her husband, an account should be taken of the value of each kind of estate then remaining, and the debts made to fall in ratable proportions upon each. <em>[Sianard. </em>I do not go for charging the debts ratably.] <em>Robinson. </em>You contend, I know, that the personal estate remaining when mrs. <em>Braxton </em>died should bear all the debts ; but if you should fail in this, then it was suggested by you that the two kinds of estate ought to be charged with ratable proportions of the debts. There is great force in this view of the subject; and if the power of sale is to be considered as existing after mrs. <em>Braxton's </em>death only for the payment of debts, it is difficult to come to any other conclusion. For as the rights to the really and two thirds of the personalty were then concentrated in <em>Ralph Wormley, </em>and the right to the other third of the personalty was then in the administrator of mrs. <em>Braxton, </em>there ought to be a right in them to pay off the debts, and there must be some correct principle on which this could be done ; and no rule seems so fair as that of ratable proportions according to the value of the estate then falling to each. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Short, </em>1 P. Wms. 403. <em>2 </em>Vern. 756. <em>Headley </em>v. <em>Redhead, </em>Coop. 50. It may be said that these were cases of the administration of assets <em>; </em>but there is nothing in the principle of contribution which should confine it to cases of that sort, or prevent it from being applied to a case like this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-3\">If the decree be reversed, an enquiry will be necessary to ascertain the value of each kind of estate existing at the time the rights were severed, and the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of debts due at that time. For it is apparent on the face of the commissioner\u2019s report, that his statement of the sums made from the realty after the death of infants is not to be relied on. The proceeds of wheat, barley, corn, tobacco and other crops are put down as sums received from the realty, though they must have arisen as much from the slaves as from the land. The land would not have produced the crops unless the slaves had worked it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-3\"><em>Braxton </em>said, he was desirous of ending this litigation, and would not ask a reversal of the decree <em>; </em>but if it should be reversed, and the principle of ratable contribution just mentioned should be adopted, he was satisfied that principle would give him much more than the decree of the court below.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-4\"><em>Patton </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad5\">The argument of mr. <em>Stanard </em>and the authorities cited by him have sufficiently established, as a general proposition, that a man\u2019s personal property is primarily bound for the payment of debts, from which nothing will relieve it but express exemption, or plain and manifest intention so to exempt it. This principle has not been controverted, in cases of the administration of assets. Is not this case one of that character? Concede that upon the death of <em>Ralph </em>the second, who had conveyed away his estate, there were no assets to be administered ; was it so upon the deaths of bis children <em>Elizabeth </em>and John? Clearly not. Upon their deaths, their shares descended and passed, not under the deed, but under the statute of descents and the statute of distributions. And if there had been an administration on the estate of either, and a suit by the administrator to recover his share of the personalty, he could have recovered nothing until all the debts were paid. As it regards the conflicting rights of the real and personal representatives of <em>Elizabeth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and <em>John, </em>the case being one of descent and distribution, their personal estate must exonerate their real estate. So upon the death of mrs. Braxton, her personal representative was entitled to nothing as against her real representative, until all the debts charged upon her estate had been paid out of the personalty. Supposing the case can be looked at in this point of view, as one of descent and distribution, the proposition does not appear to be controverted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-4\">[Robinson. If not controverted, it was because the matter was not before presented in this point of view. But it will not aid the other side at all to consider this a case of the administration of assets, either of the estates of <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>John Wormley, </em>or of mrs. <em>Braxton. </em>Let us suppose that either of them had had personal estate other than that derived under the deed from <em>Ralph </em>the second ; nothing can be more plain than that such personal estate would not have been bound to exonerate the estate derived under that deed (though it were altogether realty) from the debts of <em>Ralph </em>the second. The exoneration of real estate out of the personal estate of a decedent is confined to cases where the debts are the <em>proper </em>debts of that decedent,\u2014debts of his own contracting. This is a well established principle, acted upon in the case of <em>The Duke of Ancaster </em>v. <em>Mayer and others, </em>1 Brown\u2019s Ch. Rep. 454. 464. (which mr. <em>Stanard </em>cited for another purpose) and in numerous other cases. <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>1 Brown\u2019s Ch. Rep. 58. 3 Brown\u2019s Parl. Cas. p. 424 of <em>Tomlins </em>edi. <em>Evelyn </em>v. <em>Evelyn, 2 </em>P. Wms. 664. and cases there collected by mr. <em>Cox </em>in his note. In <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Beecher and wife, 5 </em>Madd. Ch. Rep. 96. (am. edi. 65.) a copy-hold estate was mortgaged, and the mortgagor not only devised to his widow the copyhold estate, but bequeathed to her his personal estate, which was sufficient to pay all his debts, including the mortgage. She qualified as executrix, and afterwards died without hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ing paid off the mortgage, but leaving outstanding personal assets of her husband\u2019s estate sufficient to pay it off. In a contest after her death (which produced a severance of rights), it was held that her heir had no equity to have this mortgage paid off out of the rnortgagor\u2019s personal estate. It thus appears that if the deed of trust of <em>Ralph </em>the second had been upon real estate alone, the subsequent deaths of <em>Elizabeth </em>and John, or of mrs. <em>Braxton, </em>could give no right to her heirs to have the debts secured by the deed paid off out of the personal estate, even though that personal estate was derived from the party who contracted the debts. And the circumstance of personal estate being conveyed by the deed, along with real estate, can only authorize each kind of estate to be subjected to debts according to the terms of the deed ; which have already been considered.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-4\">\n<em>Patton.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYo\">In the cases just cited by mr. <em>Robinson, </em>the real estate was primarily and indeed exclusively bound. In our case, it is not exclusively bound : and the debts are due by the same person from whom both the real and personal fund are derived. My argument is, that the contest being between the heirs and personal representatives of <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>John Wormley, </em>and the estate real and personal being derived from <em>Ralph </em>the second, the personal representatives of <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>John </em>had no right to any part of the personal property as assets of their estates, until all the debts of <em>Ralph </em>the second, charged by him upon that personal property, were discharged. It is true, he had charged his real estate also. But the real estate was neither exclusively nor primarily charged with the debts by him. And it is that feature in this case which distinguishes it, clearly and plainly, from all the cases cited by mr. Robinson, and brings it more nearly within the influence of <em>The Earl of Belvedere </em>v. <em>Rochfort, 5 </em>Brown\u2019s Par. Cas. p. 299 of <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>edi.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0Q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>No matter what may </em>be the interpretation of the deed of <em>Ralph </em>the second, as to the discretion and power of the trustees to sell either real or personal property to pay debts, that power and discretion was given in reference only to the rights of his children and grantees, as to whom, in their lifetime, it was a matter of no consequence whether the real or personal estate was sold, as they were to have all that was left, whether real or personal. When, however, new rights and inconsistent interests grew up by their deaths, the deed could not operate to leave it to the trustees, in the exercise of a discretion for the benefit of the children, to defeat those rights and interests. As to the heirs and representatives of the grantees, the law threw on them the estates real and personal, subject to the charge for the payment of debts. As between them, the case is similar to a devise for the payment of debts and legacies, where, so far as the creditors are concerned, both real and personal estates are equally responsible, but as to the representatives themselves, the natural and primary obligation of the personal estate recurs. This argument is applicable, supposing mr. <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>interpretation of the deed to be the true one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-4\">But we do not admit that interpretation. We insist that the deed had no other effect than to give a power to sell the real estate, if necessary, for the payment of debts; that this power was only conferred to insure to the creditors full satisfaction, and was not intended to disturb the primary and natural obligation of the- personal estate to pay the debts; and that if the trustees, for the more speedy and convenient payment of the debts, chose to sell the real estate for that purpose after the deaths of <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>John, </em>their doing so could not affect or impair the rights of the infant heir <em>(Ralph </em>the third) to be reimbursed out of the personal estate. In equity, the trustees, after the deaths of <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>John, </em>were <em>quasi </em>guardians of the infant <em>(Ralph </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>third), and could not sell his real estate to pay the debts of his ancestor <em>(Ralph </em>the second), when there was ample personal estate to pay them, and especially when the effect was to throw the whole burden on the real estate, and to give one third of the amount, out of his estate, to the personal representatives.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-4\">\n<em>Stanard.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4k\">Much stress seemed to be laid on the case of <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Beecher and wife. </em>This case will be found to be a hasty decision of the vicechancellor, rendered upon slight argument, in support of which no authorities are cited ; and the position broadly assumed in it is not tenable. For the widow, as residuary legatee of <em>John Tyson, </em>took his estate subject to the payment of his debts, and among others the bond secured by the mortgage ; and there can be no doubt that had the mortgagee chosen to proceed at law upon the bond, instead of resorting to the mortgage, he might have had satisfaction out of the personal estate of the mortgagor in the hands of bis executrix. The case admitted of a decision on another ground; <em>viz. </em>that the widow having the absolute dominion over the whole subject, and being <em>sui juris </em>in all respects, her conduct evinced an election on her part to continue the mortgage as a charge upon the real estate : and in the face of such election by the party under whom both claimed, her heir had no equity as against her personal representative. But that ground would not apply to a case like this, arising between the real and personal representatives of parties not <em>sui juris, </em>not clothed with any dominion over the subject, and not competent in law or in fact to manifest any intention or make any election whatever. Unless the decision in <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Beecher and wife </em>can be placed on this ground, it is inconsistent with the case of <em>The Earl of Belvedere </em>v. <em>Rochfort. </em>And if there be an inconsistency between the two, at least as much consideration is due to a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Cree in chancery affirmed in the house of lords, as to a hasty decision of a vicechancellor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP7\">It is somewhat remarkable that though mr. <em>Robinson </em>seemed to think that this case has nothing to do with the doctrines in cases arising under wills or relating to the administration of assets, the only two cases which he has adduced to support his new theory of contribubution, in favour of which he seems willing to abandon the decree of the court below, are both cases arising under wills and relating to the administration of assets. No case, it is believed, can be found amongst the decisions of this court, in which it has been\u2019held that where a man by his will gives a slave or a horse to A. and a tract of land to B., the legatee of the chattel can claim contribution from the devisee of the land. But whatever may be the rule as to such a case, nothing is better settled than that a general or pecuniary legatee, or a residuary legatee, can never call on the devisee of the land for contribution. As between them, the personal estate must always be first applied to the payment of debts, even though the legacy should thereby altogether fail. <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>1 P.

By the death of the grantor <em>Wormley </em>in 1810, the remainder became vested in his three children, <em>Elizabeth, John </em>and <em>Ralph </em>the third, but did not take effect in possession until the death of the widow. By the death of <em>Elizabeth </em>in 1814, her interest in remainder in the whole property, real and personal, passed to her mother the widow, and to <em>John </em>and <em>Ralph </em>the third her brothers; and by the death of <em>John </em>in 1815, his like interest, embracing that which he had acquired by the death of <em>Elizabeth, </em>passed to his mother the widow, and <em>Ralph </em>the third his brother. And by the death of the widow in 1816, the interests in the remainder which she had acquired by the deaths of her children <em>John </em>and <em>Elizabeth, </em>passed, as to the realty, to her only surviving child <em>Ralph </em>the third, and as to the personalty, to <em>Carter M. Braxton, </em>her surviving second husband and administrator. In 1811, the acting trustee sold a portion of the real property to the amount of 9172 dollars 41 cents, and the proceeds have been applied towards the discharge of the debts. This was a conversion, within the authority and discretion of the trustee, of so much of the realty into personalty; and being made at a time when there was no conflict, but an identity of interest amongst those entitled to the estate, it cannot, by reason of circumstances thereafter arising, furnish any equity for a reimbursement of the realty out of the personalty, or for contribution in favour of the former against the latter. The surplus income of the estate, real and personal, beyond the maintenance of the family, which accrued prior to the death of the widow, has also been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>applied to the payment of debts; and the record furnishes no information of the respective amounts derived in that way from the realty and personalty. Nor would such information be at all material, the widow being entitled to the profits of the whole estate, subject to the payment of debts, during her life, for the maintenance of herself and family. It follows from these considerations, that upon the questions involved in this cause, it is unnecessary to look back beyond the death of the widow in 1816, to ascertain the relative payments theretofore made out of the realty and personalty, towards the discharge of the debts. And any equity between the parties must arise out of the means respectively furnished for that purpose by the realty and personalty, since that period ; when the succession to the real fell into a different channel from that of the personal property ; <em>Ralph </em>the third then becoming the owner of the whole of the former and two thirds of the latter, and the defendant <em>Braxton, </em>in right of his deceased wife, of the remaining third of the latter. After that period, the authority and discretion of the trustee in regard to sales of the property, whether real or personal, continued as before, and no equity could arise between the realty and personalty for reimbursement of one to the other, neither being primarily, but the whole estate indiscriminately, subjected to payment of the debts by the provisions of the trust deed ; which, and not the principles governing the administration of decedents\u2019 estates, must give the rule upon the subject. An equity of a different nature did, however, arise out of the provisions of the trust deed, so soon as the succession to the realty and the personalty practically fell into different channels : and it was simply this, that the owmers of the realty and personalty should contribute to the burthen of paying the debts remaining unsatisfied at the widow\u2019s death, in proportion to the value of their respective interests; and that the exercise by the trus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tee of the authority and discretion vested in him should not have the effect of disturbing the due apportionment of that burthen amongst those several interests. It appears that after full payment of the debts charged upon the estate, there remained of trust moneys, besides the slaves, in the hands of the trustee at the date of the chancellor\u2019s decree of 1837, for distribution, the principal sum of 5165 dollars 78 cents, consisting exclusively of a residue of the hires of the slaves which had accrued from the 1st of January 1829 to the 1st of January 1835. It further appears that in the year 1817, the trustee sold other parts of the real property, to the amount of 3738 dollars 53 cents, which has been applied to the payment of debts, still leaving the tract of land called <em>Rosegill, </em>of which partition was directed by the chancellor\u2019s decree of 1828, amongst the heirs of <em>Ralph Wormley </em>the third, who died in the year 1824. If the plaintiffs, as heirs and distributees of <em>Ralph </em>the third, have any equity against the defendant <em>Braxton's </em>distributive third of the personal property, it must be founded on the fact that the said sum of 3738 dollars 53 cents, applied from the realty towards the payment of the debts, together with the rents and profits of the realty which may have been so applied since mrs. <em>Braxton's </em>death, exceeds the due proportion which ought to have been contributed from the real property and <em>Ralph </em>the third\u2019s distributive two thirds of the personal property, compared with what ought to have been contributed by the defendant <em>Braxton's </em>one third of the latter, having due regard to the value of each interest. That the fact is so is hardly probable, and it ought to have been made appear by the plaintiffs. The record before usdoes not contain the accounts of the trustee prior to the 1st of September 1828; and of course does not furnish the means of ascertaining the rents and profits of the lands and the hires of the slaves, and the proceeds of sales (if any) of slaves and other personal property, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>were applied to the payment of debts from the time of mrs. <em>Braxton's </em>death until the 1st of September 1828. For the accounts of the trustee between those periods, reference, it would seem, was had in the court below to a settlerilent by a master commissioner, and the other papers in certain suits brought by creditors of the estate, and which by the chancellor\u2019s decree of 1828 were, with the consent of the parties, directed to be made parts of the record of the present suit. The papers and proceedings in those suits have not been copied into the record before us, though they probably contain the evidence upon which the chancellor held,\u201e by his decree of 1837, that the money and slaves remaining of the trust fund in the hands of the trustee should be distributed as the personal estate of the deceased infants <em>Elizabeth, John </em>and <em>Ralph Wormley, </em>and which distribution wTas thereby accordingly decreed. If copies of those papers and proceedings could have availed the appellants any thing in their purpose of shewing the said decree to be erroneous, they ought to have suggested a diminution of the record, and brought them up by <em>certiorari. </em>But inasmuch as said papers and proceedings were probably confined to the trust transactions, without furnishing comparative estimates at the proper period, of the value of the lands on the one hand, and of the slaves and other personal property on the other, it would perhaps have been more regular for the chancellor to have directed an account, in the present suit, of the whole trust subject and transactions. Wherefore, though this court perceives no error in the decree for which the same ought to be reversed, and though the appellee <em>Braxton </em>states that he is content therewith, and desires no further account; yet if it is desired by the appellants, and they are willing to incur the risk of a readjustment of the accounts upon the principles above declared, this court will amend the said decree by directing the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>\\_Stanard. </em>I cannot take the responsibility of calling for any new account.
