The person requested to be her surety manifesting some reluctance to become such, the executor assured him that there was no danger of his having any thing to pay, as the purchases by the distributee were not so much as her portion of the estate. Whereupon the bond was executed. The executor died in 1821, and there was immediate administration on his estate, and on that of the first testator; but no suit was brought on the bond till 1827. Judgment was then obtained on it: and in the same year some of the legatees brought a suit for a settlement of the executorship account. In 1832, the distributee acquired slaves by the death of her father, and made a voluntary conveyance of them. One of them was sold under execution upon the judgment, and purchased by the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>at the sheriff\u2019s sale. Two others being afterwards levied on, the donee filed a bill in 1833 against the judgment creditor, to restrain the sale. During all this time there was no settlement of the executorship account; and none took place until the administrator of the executor was coerced to settle, by attachments for his contempt in disobeying the orders of the court in the suit of the legatees. Held, 1. On the donee\u2019s bill, an injunction may be awarded to restrain the sale of the two slaves levied on, until the amount of the distributee\u2019s claim is ascertained; and when ascertained, the same may be set off against the judgment. 2. The distributee is an indispensable party to the donee\u2019s suit. 3. As a suit is pending in which all the other distributees are parties, there is no necessity to make them parties in the donee\u2019s suit, but the proper course is to retain the injunction until, by the adjustment of the account in the other suit, the amount of the distributee\u2019s claim is finally liquidated, and then to apply that amount as a setoff against the judgment. 4. It being ascertained that after allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ing credit for the entire claim of the distributee, she was indebted, at the time of the sale of the slave first levied on, more than the amount for which he sold, the credit in respect to that slave cannot be enlarged to what is estimated as his value at the time of the sale, but must be limited to the amount made on the execution by the sale of him: <em>dissentiente </em>Baldwin, J. on the last point.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b661-4\">A testator dies possessed of slaves, to a third of which his widow, who renounces his will, is entitled during her life. In a settlement of the executorship account after the death of the executor, and after the widow\u2019s death, it appears by the appraisement that the slaves were seven in number. Two were specifically bequeathed by the testator, and the presumption is that they were delivered over to the legatees. Two were sold under execution of a creditor of the testator, before the executor had other assets in hand to pay the execution, and were purchased by the executor at the sheriff\u2019s sale. And two others were sold by the executor, though the payment of debts did not require the sale of them if the widow had paid up a sum of 792 dollars 48 cents, due from her for purchases of the testator\u2019s goods. When or for what prices these two were sold, did not appear. The record furnished no information of the disposition of the seventh slave; but the probability is that he was old and of little or no value. Held, the charge for the widow\u2019s interest in the slaves, instead of being measured by their estimated hires, should be an annual sum from the death of her husband until her death, equal to the annual interest of one third of the gross amount of the sales or the value of the slaves: <em>dissentiente </em>Baldwin, J. who was of opinion that the widow was entitled to credit for one third annually of the estimated hires.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-7\">In 1815 <em>Joseph Hickerson </em>died, leaving a will by which he gave legacies to his children, and leaving a widow <em>Elizabeth, </em>who renounced the provision made for her by the will. His son <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>qualified as executor, and on the 9th and 10th of November 1816, made sale, on a credit of 12 months, of the perishable goods of his testator, and of some of the other personalty. <em>Elizabeth Hickerson </em>made purchases at this sale to the amount of 792 dollars 48 cents, and gave bond for the same with <em>Daniel Hickerson </em>as her surety. <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>died on the 3d of July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>1821 (while away from home) in <em>Augusta </em>in <em>Georgia. </em>August of that year his brother <em>Hosea </em>qualified as his administrator, and as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of <em>Joseph Hiclcerson. </em>In March 1827, the legatees of <em>Joseph Hiclcerson </em>brought a suit against the said <em>Hosea </em>(to which the said <em>Elizabeth </em>was made a party) for a settlement of the executorial accounts, and a distribution of the said <em>Joseph's </em>estate. About the same time an action appears to have been brought by the said <em>Hosea, </em>as administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>against mrs. <em>Hiclcerson </em>and her surety, upon the bond before mentioned: for, in June 1827, an office judgment was rendered against them. An execution on this judgment was returned by the sheriff without any part being made ; and then no other execution issued for about five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-4\">In the mean time, proceedings were going on in the suit of the legatees, the style of which was <em>Shumate &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Hickerson &amp;c. </em>In that suit, on the 19th of May 1828, the defendant <em>Hosea Hiclcerson </em>was ordered to render an account of his administration on the estate of <em>Marshall Hiclcerson; </em>and on the 21st of September 1829, he was ordered to render, in addition, an account of his transactions as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Joseph Hiclcerson, </em>and an account of <em>Marshall Hiclcerson's </em>transactions on the same estate. In May 1830, a rule was made upon the said <em>Hosea </em>to shew cause why he should not be attached for his contempt in failing to render the said accounts; which rule was made absolute on the 2d of October 1830 : but on the 11th of the same month, upon an affidavit of the said <em>Hosea, </em>stating (among other things) that he had rendered an account to the commissioner as far as he w\u2019as enabled to do so, the order making the rule absolute was set aside. Again, however, on the 16th of October 1830, an attachment was awarded, with a proviso that it was to be discharged upon the said <em>Hosea's </em>appearing before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the commissioner, and answering interrogatories upon oath in relation to the said accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-4\">On the 26th of March 1832, the will of <em>James Parr </em>was proved, whereby he gave to his daughter <em>Elizabeth Hickerson </em>a third of his slaves and a share of his other estate.

The division was returned to court the 28th of May 1832, and ordered to be recorded ; and on the 23d of November 1832, the deed to <em>Helm </em>was acknowledged in thp clerk\u2019s office, and admitted to record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-20\">On the 19th of January 1833, an execution issued in favour of <em>H\u00f3sea </em>Hickerson, as administrator, against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>mrs. <em>Hickerson </em>and <em>Daniel Hickerson </em>her surety; but <em>' </em>the county court quashed it, because <em>Daniel Hickerson </em>was dead at the time it was issued. A new execution was issued the 12lh of April 1833, against mrs. <em>Hickerson </em>alone, which was levied on the slave <em>King. Hosea Hickerson </em>gave an indemnifying bond to the sheriff, and the slave was sold for 325 dollars, the said <em>Hosea </em>becoming the purchaser. The sheriff returned that this was all the property he could find. But some lime afterwards a new execution was sued out, which was levied upon two other slaves <em>Lucinda </em>and <em>John.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-6\">Whereupon, to wit, on the 22d of July 1833, <em>Lina Helm </em>exhibited a bill to the judge of the circuit court of <em>Fauquier, </em>asserting that under the deed from mrs. <em>Hickerson </em>he became entitled to certain property, part whereof consisted of <em>Lucinda </em>and <em>John, </em>who were delivered up by the executor of <em>Parr </em>in March 1832, and from that time until lately had been in the complainant\u2019s possession. The consideration of the deed, he alleged, was not only good but valuable; and he made the following statement concerning it. \u201c The said <em>Elizabeth, </em>at the time of its execution, and for a length of time previously, was an inmate in your orator\u2019s family, and has been and is so living up to this moment. In maintaining, supporting and providing for the said <em>Elizabeth, </em>your orator had, prior to the execution of the said conveyance, encountered considerable expense, and has since encountered more. As some remuneration to your orator for the expenses thus incurred by him, as well as some indemnity for expected future expenses, the aforesaid conveyance was executed.\u201d The bill insisted that the deed invested the complainant with a good title against any creditors of the said <em>Elizabeth </em>(even if she had any). But the ground was further taken, that the said <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>was not entitled to enforce his judgment, even against the said <em>Elizabeth. </em>For, it was alleged, her in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>terest in the estate of <em>Joseph Hickerson </em>was more than her bond, and had been so stated by <em>Marshall HicJcerson. </em>The bill, after detailing some circumstances in regard to the levy upon <em>Lucinda </em>and <em>John, </em>mentioned (in aggravation, as it would seem, of <em>Hickerson's </em>conduct) his course in regard to <em>King; </em>stating, that on the day of sale an injunction was granted to restrain the sale, but before the injunction bond could be executed and the process perfected, and after the sheriff was apprized of the injunction, the sale took place, at a price much below the actual value of the slave. \u201cThus then,\u201d the bill proceeded, \u201chas your orator been deprived of one of the negroes already which he obtained under the aforesaid conveyance, and an attempt is now making to deprive him of the other two.\u201d The prayer was for an injunction to restrain <em>Hickerson </em>from selling the slaves, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-4\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-5\"><em>Elizabeth Hickerson </em>was no party to this bill. The defendant <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>answered, denying that the deed to <em>Helm </em>was upon valuable consideration, insisting that it was upon a consideration merely voluntary, and that the deed was in fact fraudulent, and made with the express intention of defeating the recovery of the debt due him. <em>Marshall Hickerson, </em>he said, had died suddenly while on a visit to a distant part of the union, and left his papers in great confusion, and the respondent had to encounter almost insuperable difficulties in the settlement of said estate. It was impossible, he thought, for any person, in the present state of the suit brought by the legatees, to form any thing like a correct estimate of the final result of that case. The whole amount of the debt due from the said <em>Elizabeth </em>might, and in all probability would, be required for the payment of debts. And he insisted that the regular collection of the assets of <em>Joseph Hickerson's </em>estate ought not to be interfered with. What was said in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>bill in relation to <em>King </em>was noticed in the answer, and the defendant\u2019s conduct explained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHJ\">The deposition of <em>Joseph Thompsonwas </em>taken in 1835, t0 prove the understanding with mrs. <em>Hickerson </em>at the time the bond was given. He recollected, he said, \u201c that she was called on by the executor for security, and that <em>Daniel Hickerson </em>was applied to, to unite with mrs. <em>Hickerson </em>in the bond. Mr. <em>Hickerson </em>seemed rather to decline binding himself, saying that there might be some difficulty; but the difficulty was overcome by the assurance given him by the executor, that there was no sort of danger of his having any thing to pay for the widow, that the purchases made by her would not amount to any thing like the portion of the estate she was entitled to.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-5\"><em>Rodham Esk7'idge </em>and <em>Meredith Eskridge </em>deposed, that after the injunction, <em>Helm </em>made sale of <em>Lucinda </em>and <em>John.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-6\">There were'many depositions in regard to the consideration of the deed to Helm, and evidence also as to the value of <em>KiTig </em>at the time he was sold by the sheriff; some of the witnesses for the plaintiff considering him worth 500 dollars, and others for the defendant not placing him at a higher value than 325 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-7\">The suit of the legatees, which was originally brought in the superior court of chancery at <em>Fredericksburg, </em>and afterwards transferred to the circuit court of <em>Spotsylvania, </em>was removed by consent, in 1837, to the circuit court of <em>Fauquier; </em>and in February 1839, mrs. <em>Hickerso7i </em>having died, the same was revived against <em>Lina Helm </em>as her administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-8\">In this suit there were filed as exhibits, the appraisement of the ^estate of <em>Joseph Hickerson </em>on the 9th of November 1815, amounting to 3136 dollars 64 cents, and the account of sales made on that and the next day, amounting to 1830 dollars 5 cents. This account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>of sales did not include the slaves, the names and values of which were stated in the appraisement as follows: negro man <em>Admiral </em>60 dollars, negro man <em>JacJc </em>450 dollars, negro boy <em>Willis </em>400 dollars, negro woman <em>Flora </em>300 dollars, negro girl <em>Nelly </em>250 dollars, negro boy <em>Landon </em>300 dollars, negro boy <em>Alexander </em>300 dollars. Of these, <em>Flora </em>and <em>Landon </em>were specifically bequeathed by the testator. <em>Nelly </em>and <em>Alexander </em>were sold in April 1816 by the sheriff of <em>Fauquier, </em>under an execution against the estate of <em>Joseph HicJcerson, </em>and purchased at the price of 544 dollars 50 cents by <em>Marshall Hickerson. Jack </em>and <em>Willis </em>were sold by <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>as executor, but the prices for which he sold them did not appear by any thing before the commissioner. And the commissioner, in stating the account of the said executor, charged him in 1816 with the sum for which <em>Nelly </em>and <em>Alexander </em>were sold, and with the appraised value of <em>Jack </em>and <em>Willis.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-4\">So slating the account, the commissioner reported a balance due from <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>as executor of 4483 dollars 12 cents, with interest on 1909 dollars 71 cents part thereof from the first of January 1839, chargeable with the payment of a balance found due to <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Joseph Hickerson </em>(on the settlement of his administration account) of 652 dollars 65 cents, with interest on 537 dollars 2 cents part thereof from the first of January 1839 till paid, and chargeable also with a balance of a debt to <em>Bazil Gordon. </em>The commissioner also settled the account of <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>as administrator of <em>Marshall Hickerson, </em>and reported a balance due from the said <em>Hosea </em>on this account. The commissioner\u2019s report was returned on the 2d of May 1839; and on the 10th of that month <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>paid to <em>Bazil Gordon </em>ih\u00e9 balance due him, amounting to 460 dollars 33 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AY3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>There was an exception by <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>to the rePort&gt; uPon the ground that the execution under which <em>Nelly </em>and <em>Alexander </em>were sold was for more than the amount of sales. And the court, on the 20th of May 1839, recommitted the report to the commissioner, for him to make a statement shewing how the account would stand if <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>should now pay the balance due on the said execution. This was the last order in the case of <em>Shumate </em>v. <em>Hickerson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-3\">On the same 20th of May 1839, the court made an order in the case of <em>Helm </em>v. <em>Hickerson, </em>directing the commissioner to ascertain mrs. <em>Hickerson\u2019s </em>share of the perishable estate of <em>Joseph Hickerson, </em>and add thereto interest on one third of the value of his slaves. The court also directed the said commissioner to credit her distributive share with the execution injoined, and to credit the execution with 500 dollars, which, in the opinion of the court, was the value of <em>King </em>at the time of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-4\">The commissioner made a report whereby it appeared, that omitting the slaves, and charging <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>with the proceeds of all the other personalty (including mrs. <em>Hickerson\u2019s </em>own purchases) as if the amount had been received by the executor, the sum in his hands, as of the first of January 1839, was 1358 dollars 8 cents; and then deducting what was due to <em>Hosea Hickerson, </em>and the sum paid by him to <em>Bazil Gordon, </em>the balance was only 254 dollars 93 cents, of which mrs. <em>Hickerson's </em>third was 84 dollars 98 cents on the said first of January 1839. Then, after stating the slaves to be of the value of 1994 dollars 50 cents, one third whereof was 664 dollars 83 cents, and the annual interest on that third 39 dollars 89 cents, he made a statement whereby it appeared, that charging mrs. <em>Hickerson </em>with 1588 dollars 72 cents the amount of the judgment with interest to the 27th of May 1833, when <em>King </em>was sold, and crediting her on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number><em>King </em>with 500 dollars, less 15 dollars 50 cents the sheriff\u2019s commissions on 325 dollars, and also crediting her with the said annual interest of 39 dollars 89 cents from the first of January 1816 to the 17th of February 1838, when she died, and likewise crediting the said 84 dollars 98 cents, a balance still remained due upon the judgment of 261 dollars 88 cents with interest from the 1st of January 1839. The plaintiff excepted to this report, and at his instance the commissioner made a special statement, upon the principle of allowing, in lieu of interest on one third of the value of the slaves, an annual hire of 50 dollars. The first sum of 50 dollars was credited on the first of January 1817, and thereafter annually, whereby the principal of the judgment on which interest was calculated was annually diminished ; and on the first of January 1S37, there was, according to this statement, a balance due mrs. <em>Hickerson </em>of 16 dollars and 90 cents. The statement was continued to the first of January 1839, and shewed on that day a balance due her of 163 dollars 15 cents, with interest on 158 dollars 13 cents part thereof from that day till paid. In the statement so continued, mrs. <em>Hickerson </em>was credited with 2 dollars and 2-cenls for interest on the 16 dollars and 90 cents to the 1st of January 1839, and 3 dollars for interest on the hires of 1837 to the same time, making 5 dollars and 2 cents as the amount of interest on conjectural hires during the last two years. As bearing upon this statement, it is proper to mention that according to the report of the commissioner in <em>Shumate </em>v. <em>Hickerson, </em>the executor had <em>not, </em>at the time of the sale of the two slaves under execution, other assets with which he could have satisfied that execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-4\">On the 19th of October 1839 the case of <em>Helm </em>v. <em>Hickerson </em>came on to be heard upon the commissioner\u2019s report in that case, and the record in the case of <em>Shumate </em>v. <em>Hickerson. </em>Whereupon the court, approving of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>that statement in the report wherein hires were allowed, confirmed the same, and decreed that the injunction be made perpetual, and that the defendant pay 1\u00b0 the plaintiff 163 dollars 15 cents, with interest on dollars 13 cents part thereof from the 1st of January 1839 till paid, and the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-4\">From this decree, on the petition of the defendant <em>Hosea HicJcerson, </em>ari appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b670-5\">The cause was argued by <em>Howard </em>and <em>Robinson </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Seddon </em>and <em>Morson for </em>the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZj\">The question most elaborately discussed was whether the deed from mrs. <em>HicJcerson </em>to <em>Lina Helm </em>was made with intent to defraud creditors : but upon this, and indeed upon some other points, a report of the argument is deemed unnecessary. The following notice is confined to the principles of law more particularly involved in the decision.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b670-6\"><em>Howard </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHOH\">The enquiry which devolved upon the court below was whether the slaves <em>Lucinda </em>and <em>John </em>could properly be sold under the execution. And when the court ascertained that the deed was upon a consideration merely voluntary, it followed that the deed was void as to creditors, and that the slaves might legally be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahx\">Under the decision in <em>Pulliam </em>v. <em>Winston &amp;c. </em>5 Leigh 324. even mrs. <em>HicJcerson </em>herself would not be allowed to tie up the judgment against her, until complicated accounts of administration should be settled, in order to discover whether there would be a distributable surplus. But here the debtor against whom the judgment is rendered asks no injunction to it, and in no way alleges that the debt is not due. The objection to enforcing the judgment is raised by one who, after the rendition of the judgment, received a conveyance from the judgment debtor of a part of her properly. Surely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>this enquiry cannot be gone into in a suit standing , 7 , . , ,. , . <em>\u00b0 </em>merely between the judgment creditor and the voluntary grantee. The claim of the j'udgment debtor as distributee can never be used as a setoff against the j\u2019udgment, in a suit to which the judgment debtor is no party. Nor can the extent of such setoff be ascertained, except by a settlement of the administration account in a suit to which all the distributees are parlies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-8\">If, however, it were competent in this suit to set off mrs. <em>Hickerson\u2019s </em>claim as distributee against the judgment, the mode in which this has been done is altogether erroneous. The obvious course was to consider the judgment creditor as entitled to the amount of his judgment, deducting the 325 dollars for which the slave <em>King </em>was sold under the execution, less 15 dollars and 50 cents for commissions. If damage resulted from the seizure and sale of <em>King, </em>the remedy for that damage is by an action on the indemnifying bond; for, the sale having taken place, it is not the province of equity to assess damages. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Hogsheads, </em>3 Leigh 667. <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Winfree, </em>2 Leigh 370. But no claim to such damages is asserted by the bill; and there is, in truth, no right to recover damages either at law or in equity. Regarding the plaintiff as a claimant under a voluntary deed, he can have no greater right in this respect than his grantor; and she clearly can claim credit only for the net proceeds of the slave.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-9\">The special statement is wholly unsuslained by evidence, and the hires entirely conjectural. If it had been right to allow the conjectural sum of 50 dollars a year, it would have been wrong to allow interest upon such conjectural hires. <em>Shields adm\u2019r &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Anderson &amp;c. </em>3 Leigh 729. <em>Roper &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Wren &amp;c. </em>6 Leigh 38. Here the slaves had been disposed of, and no hires could have been received. [Stanard, J. It has been settled as a general rule, that the widow is to have the use for life of one third of the money for w\u2019hich the slaves sold. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>Godwin\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Godwin\u2019s adm\u2019x &amp;c. </em>4 Leigh 410.] The special statement is wrong not only as to the interest but as to the principal.

In a suit between <em>Lina Helm </em>plaintiff and <em>Hosea Hiclcerson </em>defendant, that balance is stated specially as due to mrs.

This is a suit, not for damages, but for <em>King </em>or his value. It is on the ground that the sale had been made in an oppressive manner, and ought to be set aside. But even if viewed as a suit for damages, yet as the plaintiff has been obliged to come into equity to injoin the sale of two other slaves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>claimed under the same deed, the court, on the princi1 pie of preventing multiplicity of suits, will take jurisdiction of the whole case, and decide it as to <em>King </em>as well as the two other slaves. Where the same right which entitles a party to an injunction against future waste entitles him to compensation for past waste, the court of equity will give relief as to both. The court, having jurisdiction of the suit for one purpose, goes on and ends the controversy between the parties. This principle is acted on in many cases. 1 Story\u2019s Equity, \u00a7 64. <em>a. </em>p. 82-S6.

Here it was necessary to take notice of the value of the slave, in determining the amount of the credit on account of his being sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b673-11\">The case of <em>Pulliam </em>v. <em>Winston &amp;c. </em>is very different from this case, in which there had been a failure for 11 years to settle the executorial accounts on <em>Joseph HicJcerson\u2019s </em>estate before suit was brought by the legatees, and then every thing was done to delay a settlement, that the process of the court would allow. But even in <em>Pulliam </em>v. <em>Winston &amp;c. </em>it is admitted that the offset will be allowed if the executor agreed to allow it. And here the fact of such agreement is deposed to by a witness whose evidence is sustained by all the circumstances. In that case, too, the objection was taken in the court below, and the injunction dissolved on motion ; while here, the case having been proceeded in to a decree, and the account taken, the objection is stripped of its force. <em>Scott &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Halliday &amp;c. </em>5 Munf. 103. <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Mitchell\u2019s </em>ex\u2019or, 5 Munf. 175. On these grounds, tnrs. <em>Hiclcerson </em>herself might insist on the setoff. But even if she could not, still <em>Helm </em>may insist on its being allowed. It is always competent for the volunteer to require the creditor to shew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>that he has a debt. He may have an account to ascertain its amount,\u2014to ascertain how much is liable to be setoff by a fund in the creditor\u2019s hands, and amongst other things the amount to be credited on the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b674-4\">The rule settled in <em>Godwin\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Godwin\u2019s adm\u2019x &amp;c. </em>may be a general one, but it is not inflexible. It would not be applied in a case of fraud. Here the executor has been guilty of such negligence that every presumption ought to be made against him. His conduct makes it necessary to resort to conjecture of price or conjecture of hire. And his representative can have no right to insist on the former instead of the latter. The interest allowed on conjectural hires amounts only to a few dollars, and there is a blunder of 15 dollars and 50 cents the other way in regard to commissions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b674-5\">It is objected, however, that mrs. <em>Hiclcerson </em>is not a party to this suit. Though the debt could not be ascertained so as to bind her, it could be ascertained so as to bind the parties to this suit. There are various cases in which parties may sue singly; for example, creditors may sue singly to get a fund out of an executor\u2019s hands. The case of <em>Moore\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>George\u2019s adm'r, </em>10 Leigh 228. shews that this court will not extend the objection for want of parties. Besides, the objection was not taken in the court below, and the authorities shew that such objection may be waived. Opinion of <em>Tucker, </em>P. in <em>S. C.

The record of that case also shews that she died while the case was pending, and that it was revived against <em>Lina Helm </em>as her administrator. The decree then in this case is substantially right, and the informality, if any, arising out of the fact that mrs. <em>Iiickerson's </em>administrator was not a party to the suit as such, is cured by the act of February 27. 1828.

Is it to be maintained that merely because an injunction was <em>awarded </em>on the former bill, the sale was not to be made at the time appointed by law, but was to be postponed in order that the injunction bond might be given ? If a court of equity could interfere on any such ground, the interference would properly be under that bill on which the injunction was awarded : and that case is not before this court. But the sale could not be treated as improperly made, either on that bill or on this. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Hoomes's ex\u2019ors &amp;c. 2 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. 23. <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>Twynam, </em>Jacob 418. 4 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 193. If the plaintiff sought by force of his deed to recover the value of the slave, his remedy was by an action on the indemnifying bond : if he sought to recover the specific property, his proper course was to bring an action of detinue against the purchaser. A legal title being claimed on the one hand under execution against the debtor, and a paramount title on the other under the debtor\u2019s deed, a court of law was obviously the proper tribunal to determine which of these titles was the best.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b675-6\">Is it clear that it was proper for a court of equity to exercise jurisdiction as to <em>Lucinda </em>and <em>John\u2018S </em>As to them, the court had no jurisdiction to injoin the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>except upon the ground that slaves are considered <em>prima </em>* * * <em>facie </em>of peculiar value to their owners. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>3 Rand. 170. <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>6 Rand. 194. Does that presumption exist here, or is it repelled ? <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>judge <em>Carr </em>takes the distinction between family slaves and those recently purchased by the plaintiff; and judge <em>Green </em>said, the appellant there did not appear to have seen the slaves before he purchased them. In <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>the judges cite, on the one hand, cases of peculiar attachment, and, on the other, cases of large slaveholders, where the slave is not even personally known, or cases in which the. slave is a subject of traffic. What are the circumstances here ? The complainant never had the slaves till the spring of 1832. He obtained them then, not by a purchase of specific slaves on account of any peculiar qualities, but by a transfer from mrs. <em>FLickerson </em>of her interest in a particular estate, in the division of which these slaves were afterwards allotted as her portion. To him it was the same whether he obtained these or other slaves, or other property of equal value. There was no peculiar affection between the master and these particular slaves, such as made him desire to retain them in specie. This is evident from the fact deposed to by <em>Meredith </em>and <em>Rodham Eskridge, </em>that immediately upon his being restored to possession by the injunction, he endeavoured to sell them, and as soon as practicable did sell them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-8\">On the other side it is contended, that though the deed shall be held to be voluntary, the judgment is to be reduced by whatever amount may be due mrs. <em>FLickerson </em>as a distributee of her husband\u2019s estate. This ground is taken in a suit to which she is no party, and in which, no matter what the view' of the court may be upon the accounts, it can make no decree perpetuating the injunction <em>to the judgment, </em>either in whole or in part. But suppose her grantee may require all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>that she could have required, if she had made no assignment, and were the plaintiff in the bill; <em>Pulliam </em>v. <em>Winston &amp;c. </em>5 Leigh 324. settles that she cannot be received in equity to make any setoff of this nature. It is however insisted that this case is an exception to the general rule, because here the executor agreed that any claim which mrs. <em>Hiclcerson </em>had against the estate might be discounted. To establish such agreement, an expression' of the executor is deposed to by a witness 20 years after the transaction. The act of the executor in taking the bond and security is far stronger than such words as are here deposed to. If he was satisfied that her portion of the estate would be equal to the amount of the bond, and agreed that the one should be set off against the other, why take bond and security at all? His taking it is at least evidence that it was not certain her portion would be sufficient. It would be contrary to well established principles to allow the force of the bond to be destroyed by parol evidence of this uncertain character. Where an agreement to set off is relied on, it should be an agreement at a subsequent time, after there has been opportunity to clear up the doubt existing at the time of taking the bond. The decree directing an enquiry to ascertain mrs. <em>Hiclcerson's </em>share as distributee was then improper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-5\">But if it was proper to go into any such account, the principle upon which it was directed to be stated in regard to <em>King </em>is clearly erroneous. The report made under the court\u2019s direction establishes the impropriety of its direction. At the time of the sale of <em>King, </em>the amount of the judgment was 1588 dollars 72 cents, and if from this there be deducted 678 dollars 13 cents for the annual interest from the first of January 1816 to the first of January 1833 on one third of the value of the slaves sold, there was yet due on the judgment, when <em>King </em>was sold, more than 900 dollars. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>credit be also given for a third of the amount of sales to mrs. <em>Hiclcerson </em>herself (though remaining unpaid), as well as of all other personal estate, there was still due upon the judgment at that time more than 800 dollars. Under these circumstances, what conceivable reason can there be for giving credit on account of the sale of King, for more than he produced at the sheriff\u2019s sale ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b678-4\">Then as to the question whether interest on a third of the value of the slaves sold shall be allowed, or conjectural hires. Neither in the bill of the legatees nor in this bill is there any allegation that the slaves of <em>Joseph Hiclcerson </em>were sold improperly. Nor is there any thing whatever to take this case out of the general principle established in <em>Godwin\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Godwin\u2019s adm\u2019x &amp;c. </em>4 Leigh 410. Charging <em>Marshall Hiclcerson </em>with the amount of mrs. <em>Hiclcerso?i\u2019s </em>bond, and leaving out the sales of slaves, his account was about even. He had then either to remain in advance to the estate the amount of the debt due by mrs. Hiclcerson, or to get from her that debt, or to sell slaves. He was under no obligation to remain in advance: she did not pay the debt: and he sold slaves. When it has been settled as a general rule, that though a widow\u2019s share of slaves be unnecessarily sold to pay debts, she is to be compensated by interest on one third of the sales, what is there in this case to authorize a departure from that rule ? So far from being a stronger case in favour of the widow than the case generally is, it is a weaker one. For it was necessary to sell the slaves unless she paid her debt. And it is not for her whose default has been the cause of this, to say that the burthen of the executor shall be increased, because he has done that which her default made necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b678-5\">But the error did not stop here. Having settled the principle, it was at least proper, when there was no sort of evidence to shew what hire would be fair, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>refer it to a commissioner to report on this subject. . . , . All enquiry of this sort was passed by, and the special statement acted upon, although that statement was not the view of the commissioner upon the evidence, but the mere <em>ex parte </em>suggestion of counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b679-5\">That <em>ex parte </em>statement is not only without evidence to shew that 50 dollars a year was a fair hire, but is wrong upon its face in allowing interest on such conjectural hires. It may appear as if the interest so allowed were only 5 dollars 2 cents, but it is in fact much more. If the interest on the judgment had been calculated to 1S39, and then a deduction made, as of that date, of the conjectural hires from 1816 to 1839, there would be no interest on such hires. But the conjectural hires are credited at the end of each year from 1816 to 1839, and the effect is to allow interest to the extent to which the creditor loses interest by having his principal diminished before 1839.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b679-6\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aa8C\">The merits of this cause turn upon the question whether the interest of mrs. <em>Hickerson </em>in the personal estate of her husband <em>Joseph Hickerson </em>deceased (with the credit to which she is entitled for her property sold under execution) is sufficient, and properly applicable, to extinguish the debt contracted by her for purchases at the sale made by <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>his executor. This involves an enquiry into the principles upon which the accounts have been settled by the master commissioner, under the order of the circuit court. The basis of the settlement is a report made by the same master commissioner, in another suit of <em>Shumate &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Hickerson &amp;c. </em>then depending in the same court, of several accounts directed by interlocutory decrees in that suit; to wit, an account of the administration of <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>upon the estate of <em>Joseph Hickerson </em>deceased; another, of the administration <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>upon the estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Joseph Hickerson deceased; </em>and a third, of the admin\u00a1gtraI\u00a1on <em>Qf Hosea Hickerson </em>upon the estate of <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>deceased. The result of that report is a balance against <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>as executor of <em>Joseph Hickerson; </em>a balance in favour of <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Joseph Hickerson; </em>and a balance against him as administrator of <em>Marshall Hickerson. </em>It was upon the basis of the accounts thus reported, that the master commissioner proceeded in the present cause to ascertain the aforesaid interest of mrs. <em>Hickerson, </em>who was a party in the case of <em>Shumate Sfc. </em>v. <em>Hickerson &amp;fc. </em>but not in the present suit. Mrs. <em>Hickerson being </em>entitled absolutely to a distributive share of one third in the residue of her husband\u2019s personal estate exclusive of the slaves, after payment of his debts, and to one third of the slaves as her dower for life only, the commissioner restated the accounts, so as to shew in the first place a balance against <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>executor of <em>Joseph Hickerson, </em>exclusive of the slaves, of 254 dollars 93 cents, after deducting the balance due to <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Joseph Hickerson; </em>the one third of which balance, to wit, 84 dollars 98 cents, he reported in favour of mrs. <em>Hickerson. </em>He then went on to ascertain what she was further entitled to, on account of her interest in the slaves. None of these were forthcoming. It appears from the appraisement that there were seven. Two of them were sold under execution: two were specifically bequeathed by the testator, and the presumption is were delivered over to the legatees : two others were sold by the executor <em>Marshall Hickerson, </em>but when, or for what prices, does not appear: the record furnishes no information of the disposition made of the seventh, and the probability is that he was old and of little or no value. The widow, for whom no provision was made by the will, claimed that made for her by law. Her dower in the slaves being one third for life, and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>having been deprived thereof by the conduct of the executor, compensation could be made to her therefor in but one of two modes; to wit, by allowing her the annual interest during her life on one third of the %'alue of the slaves, or by allowing one third of the annual estimated hires. The commissioner made statements in both ways, debiting the widow with the judgment against her for purchases at the sale, and crediting her, in the first, with one third annually of the interest on the value of the slaves, and in the second, with one third annually of the estimated hires; and in both, with her distributive share of the other personal estate, and with the actual value of the slave <em>King </em>(acquired from her father\u2019s estate and sold under the first execution upon said judgment) <em>minus </em>the sheriff\u2019s commission upon the sale. The result of the first statement was a balance against the widow, of 261 dollars 88 cents with interest from the 1st of January 1839; and of the second a balance in her favour, of 163 dollars 15 cents with interest on 158 dollars 13 cents thereof from the same dale. This last statement was adopted by the circuit court, and the decree rendered against the defendant <em>Hosea Hiclcerson </em>individually; doubtless because there were ample assets in his hands as administrator of <em>Marshall Hickerson's </em>estate, for payment of the amount thus ascertained to be due to the widow and chargeable against that estate, after the extinguishment of the judgment by the application of her credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">If this adjustment of the accounts between <em>Elizabeth Hiclcerson </em>and the estate of her deceased husband be correct, it relieves us from the necessity of considering the questions so elaborately discussed at the bar, arising out of the allegation of the defendant that the conveyance to the plaintiff <em>Helm, </em>by <em>Elizabeth Hiclcerson, </em>of her interest in her father\u2019s estate, was voluntary and fraudulent as regards, her creditors; inasmuch as.it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>will thus appear that the defendant has no right in a court \u00b0f equity to occupy that relation towards her.. And this brings us to the consideration of the objections to that adjustment urged on the part of the apPeIiant*</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In the first place, it is contended that the whole adjustment is wrong, on the ground that a court of equity ought not to interpose by way of injunction, to ascertain and set off a distributive interest in an estate, against a debt contracted by the distributee for purchases from the executor of property belonging to the estate. This is certainly correct as a general proposition, and is well established by the authorities cited for the appellant. Such a practice would occasion much confusion and injustice, by obstructing and perplexing the executor in the administration of the assets, exposing him to the danger of devastavits, and subjecting creditors of the estate to injurious delays. The rule however is not free from exception, and the reasons upon which it is founded are inapplicable to the case before us. All the difficulties which have occurred in the administration and distribution of this estate are attributable to the misconduct of <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>the executor, and the defendant <em>Hosea Hickerson, </em>his administrator and successor. There has been the most unreasonable delay in the settlement of the administration accounts. No step towards it was taken during the six years which elapsed from the time of the executor\u2019s qualification in 1815 until his death in 1S21. In August 1821, the defendant <em>Hosea Hickerson </em>qualified as administrator of <em>Marshall Hickerson, </em>and as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of <em>Joseph Hickerson; </em>but <em>instead </em>of settling up the administration accounts of himself and his predecessor in a reasonable lime, he failed to do so for a period of nearly twelve years prior to the institution of this suit in July 1333. Nor could he be brought to such settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ment, in the suit instituted against him for that purpose in 1827, by <em>Shumate </em>and other distributees of <em>Joseph Hickerson, </em>until coerced by attachments for his contempt in disobeying orders of the court in that suit, \u2022Thus a period of eighteen years prior to the institution of this suit was suffered by the personal representatives of the estate in question to elapse without a settlement of their administration accounts. This delay, connected with the representation made by <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>at the lime of the executorial sale, that there was no danger in becoming the widow\u2019s surety for the amount of the purchases made by her, inasmuch as it would fall far short of her distributive interest in the estate, was well calculated to lull her into security, and inspire the belief that payment of her bond would not be exacted, unless shewn to be necessary by a settlement of the administration accounts. And if the judgment recovered against her in 1827 had a tendency to remove this impression, it could not have suggested the necessity of a suit on her part for the recovery of her distributive share ; inasmuch as the suit of <em>Shumate &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Hickerson &amp;c. </em>brought by the other \u2022distributees in 1827, to which she was a party, would have accomplished that object, but for the continued default of the defendant <em>Hosea Hickerson; </em>whose conduct was extremely unjust and oppressive in suing out execution against her, in 1S33, upon the judgment, while in contempt of the orders of court requiring a settlement of the administration accounts. I think, under the circumstances, it was entirely proper that he should be restrained by injunction from proceeding upon the execution, until he should shew, by a full and fair settlement of the estate, that the purposes of justice required it: that if he could have been subjected at that late period to any inconvenience or hazard, it was far from arising out of the due discharge of his duties: and that any creditors who had so long postponed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>prosecution of their demands against the estate would more probably be benefited than injured by the aid of the court in sifting the accounts of the delinquent fiduCI9X16S\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"A5R\">l^e next P^ace&gt; 11 13 urgec^ that the compensation to the widow for her dower right in the slaves ought to have been the interest on the value, instead of estimated hires. I am at a loss to perceive any principle upon which that pretension can be sustained. The widow was entitled to her dower interest in kind ; an important privilege, of which she could not be lawfully deprived, unless by a sale of the slaves rendered necessary for payment of the debts by the inadequacy of the other personal assets. In regard to the slaves specifically bequeathed, and supposed to have been surrendered to the legatees, there is not a shadow of apology for disregarding the dower interest of the widow. As to those sold by the executor, it has not been shewn when, or for what amount, or under what circumstances they were sold; and on the other hand it is apparent from the master commissioner\u2019s report, that there was no deficiency of the other personal assets, a balance having been reported against him on that account. The only colour for a sale of slaves is as respects those sold under execution in April 1816, when it may be supposed that the fund arising from the executorial sale of the perishable property belonging to the estate w.as not available, the bonds therefor not falling due until November following. It certainly would be unreasonable to charge an executor with the injurious consequences arising from a forced sale of slaves under execution, before it was in his power to obtain from the assets the means of payment: but that is not the question here. The slaves were purchased in by the executor himself; and, under the circumstances, he ought to be treated in relation thereto as the trustee of the estate. The sale moneys of the personal estate were to fall due at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>no distant period. It was the duty of the executor to do the best he could for the preservation of the interests confided to his care; and the plea of an inevitable prejudice cannot avail him, when we find that he had the means of becoming the purchaser. It ought to be presumed that he raised the money upon the credit of the estate, or that he advanced it himself upon that security; a presumption working no injustice; for if he gave the full value, he is reimbursed by a credit for the purchase money, and if he did not, it would be of dangerous consequence to permit him so to speculate upon the temporary necessities of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The credit therefore for hires, instead of interest, is correct in principle, and is not in conflict, as supposed, with the decision of this court in <em>Godwin's adm'r </em>v. <em>Godwin's adm'x &amp;c. </em>4 Leigh 410. The question there was as to the prospective allowance to be made to a widow out of the proceeds of slaves, sold by the executor under an innocent misapprehension that the situation of the estate required the sale for the payment of debts; and it was held that \u201cshe should receive one third of the purchase money, to be enjoyed by her during her life, and then returned to the estate; an allowance considered by the court more equitable than a commutation for a gross sum, the proper amount of which it would be difficult to ascertain by calculations, involving, as they must, an estimate of complicated hazards. But in the case before us, the question is in regard to the retributive compensation to be made for a dower right, from the enjoyment of which the widow was debarred during her life by the gross injustice of the executor. That the allowance is of estimated hires, from imperfect materials, is the fault of the executor himself, who has furnished no account or evidence in relation to the slaves, whether of hires or sales; in consequence of which the commissioner has been compelled to found his estimate chiefly upon the appraised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>value of the slaves, most probably to the detriment of vvidow; and upon that basis, if he has committed an error, it is obviously not to the prejudice of the executor. His allowance of interest on estimated hires was ^or a br'e^ period and on a small balance, and not excepted to by the defendant.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Such minute errors in a commissioner\u2019s report, however obvious, especially when unexcepted to, are not proper for the consideration of an appellate court; as they would require, from its repugnance to the reversal of the decree for a small matter, a reexamination, and it may be a restatement of the whole account, in order to ascertain whether there may not be errors to an equal or greater amouut on the other side.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Again, the appellant insists that the proper credit to the widow on account of the slave <em>King, </em>sold under the first execution against her, is the net proceeds of the sale, and nothing more ; that if his actual value at the time was 500 dollars, (which is denied, though 1 think proved) still the credit for that sum, <em>minus </em>the sheriff\u2019s commission on'the price obtained, is wrong in principle; and that to allow it, is in effect to assess damages in a court of equity for proceeding at law under process of execution. This objection would, I think, be well founded if the result of the credit were an actual loss to the defendant, as would be the case if the property had been purchased by a stranger. But the defendant, having become the purchaser himself, is in fact subjected to no loss. He is merely denied an unrighteous gain, arising out of a sacrifice of the property occasioned by his own iniquitous and oppressive conduct. The question necessarily arose, upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>facts stated in the bill, in the adjustment of the mat- . . ters ot account involved in the controversy ; and was not at all cognizable at law. The defendant had an undoubted legal right to enforce his judgment by process of execution ; but his exercise of it under the circumslances, not only to the prejudice of his adversary but to his own individual profit, could not be countenanced in a court of equity. The mode of relief was the only one that could be adopted, unless the defendant had been required to surrender the property, which it does not appear that he offered, nor that it was still in his power to do. The question was merely as to the measure of relief, that is to say, the proper amount of the credit; and that fell within the province and discretion of the court, in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction over the whole subject, of which it was an inseparable incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">There is much plausibility in the argument founded upon the master commissioner\u2019s report, that at the time the defendant\u2019s execution was levied upon King, the widow was still in arrear on account of her purchases at the executorial sale, to a greater amount than the value of the properly levied on. I think it not improbable that such would be the result of a statement based upon the materials furnished by the report, though none has been made by the commissioner with a view to that enquiry. But its concession does not relieve the defendant from the impropriety and injustice of proceeding to enforce the whole amount of his judgment, without giving the widow the smallest credit on account of her interest in the estate, every particle of which had been withheld from her for a period of eighteen years, unless upon the supposition of an agreement that the payment of her bond was to await a settlement of the estate. After the assurance given by his predecessor at the time of the widow\u2019s purchases, and the great <em>laches </em>of both in regard to their adminis\"<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>tration accounts, it was not for him to decide, without a settlement, and in contempt of the orders of court requiring a settlement, upon the question of the widow\u2019s indebtedness. Nor can the materials furnished ^y the report be relied upon as shewing the balance due, on one side or the other, at any given period of time prior to the final adjustment; for they do not consist of accounts actually kept, but of substitutes therefor, resorted to for the purpose of preventing a failure 'of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Thus it seems to me, that the decree of the circuit court was founded upon a correct adjustment of the matters of account involved in the controversy, and that mrs. <em>HicJcerson, </em>under the circumstances, was entitled to the interposition of the court to restrain the defendant from further proceeding upon his judgment at law. I can perceive no good reason why the actual plaintiff, as her grantee or donee, should be excluded from the benefit of her equity, so far as to prevent the slaves embraced in her conveyance to him from being subjected to the defendant\u2019s process of execution against her. But I think it clear that she ought to have been made a party in the cause, inasmuch as she was directly interested in the settlement of the accounts, and the plaintiff <em>Helm </em>had no interest therein, except for the purpose of shewing that the defendant\u2019s demand was extinguished. She died however in the progress of the suit, and <em>Helm.' </em>became her administrator, and as such the proper representative of her interests. If she had been a defendant in the cause, he could not have revived it against himself as her administrator. Her death and his administration were judicially known to the court, being disclosed by the record in the case of <em>Shumate </em>v. <em>Hickerson, </em>made part of the record in the present suit, and referred to in the decrees. The omission to state these facts on the order book, or by a supplemental bill, was a mere informality, for. which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>it would be improper to reverse the decree, especially since the statute of the 27th of February 1828, Suppl. to Rev. Code, p. 125. which declares that no \u201c decree of a court of equity shall be reversed for informality in the proceedings, where the parties have proceeded to take their depositions, and it appears to the court that there has been a full and fair hearing upon the merits, and that substantial justice has been done between the parties.\u201d And this gives the proper answer to the appellant\u2019s objection that the balance found due to the widow is decreed to be paid to the plaintiff <em>Helm. </em>It will not be improper, however, for preventing any possible future misconstruction, to amend the decree in this particular, by directing the payment to be made to <em>Helm </em>in his character of administrator. A further amendment of the decree will also be proper, to supply its omission to require a refunding bond in regard to any future demands against the estate.</p>\n<author id=\"b689-4\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ANR\">The appellee sought the aid of a court of equity by injunction to the sale of slaves on which an execution had been levied as the property of <em>Elizabeth Hiclcerson, </em>on the ground that the slaves were his property in virtue of a conveyance from the said <em>Elizabeth. </em>He claims that under that conveyance he became the owner of the slaves, either as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for valuable consideration, or as a donee. If he sustained his title as <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for valuable consideration, the only question that would arise is that respecting the jurisdiction of the court of equity to interpose its protection by way of injunction to the sale. The question of jurisdiction must, I think, have been resolved, on the authority of many decisions of this court, in favour of the appellee; and being so resolved, the relief that a court of equity should give would be the perpetuation of the injunction to the sale of the slaves which were under execution at the time the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>junction was awarded. Such relief would be granted, irrespective of any question concerning the fact or amount of indebtedness from <em>Elizabeth Hicherson </em>to the claimant under the execution, and consequently all en-qu\u2018ry *nt0 l^at matter would be superfluous, and foreign to the question of the relief to which the appellee was entitled. Viewing the case under this aspect, the indebtedness of <em>Elizabeth Hicherson </em>to the claimant under the execution would not restrict, nor would the absence of such indebtedness enlarge, the relief proper to be given the appellee. Under this aspect of the case the appellee <em>would have </em>no colour of right to resort to a court of equity to recover the slave that had been taken and sold under a previous execution. That taking and sale would be an invasion of his right of properly for which he would have a plain and adequate remedy at law, and for which he could no more obtain redress in equity, than he could for any other trespass on or dispossession of his personal property, for which the law had provided the remedy of an action of trespass, trover or detinue.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">In the relief that has been given by the decree in this case, the court below has not regarded the appellee as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for valuable consideration, but has (and I think properly) regarded the conveyance to him from <em>Elizabeth Hicherson </em>as voluntary: and with this element in the case many questions arise as to the propriety of granting in equity any relief, and if any, the nature and extent of that relief.</p>\n<p id=\"AjR\">Viewing the conveyance from <em>Elizabeth Hicherson </em>to the appellee as voluntary, the questions are, Ought the enforcement of the judgment at law against <em>Elizabeth Hicherson </em>to be injoined until the extent of her interests as distributee and dowress in the estate of her deceased husband, for which <em>Marshall Hicherson </em>was responsible, should be liquidated and adjusted, with a view to a setoff of the amount thereof against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>judgment ? And has the appellee a right to have those interests applied in reduction of the judgment, for the protection of the property he claims under the voluntary conveyance ?</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">I concur with my brother <em>Baldwin </em>in the opinion, that under the circumstances of this case, it was proper to make it an exception to the rule (which, as a general one, has my hearty approbation) that denies to a creditor or distributee the aid of a court of equity to intercept by injunction the collection of the assets by the executor or administrator, especially those arising from the sales of the executor or administrator, until the administration accounts are adjusted, with the view that the debt or distributive share may be set off; unless the title to such setoff be founded on the express agreement of the executor or administrator. There is evidence, direct and inferential, tending strongly to prove that such agreement was made in this case. This, coupled with the long continued delinquency of the executor and his representative to settle the administration account of the estate of <em>Joseph </em>Hickerson, and the delays to which the suit brought by the distributees of <em>Joseph Hickerson </em>to have that account settled has been subjected, mainly by the neglect and contumacy of the appellant the representative of the executor, justify the court in making this case an exception to the general rule. If <em>Elizabeth Hickerson </em>had not conveyed to the appellee, but still retained title to the slaves on which the execution was levied, she would be entitled to protection by injunction until the amount of her claim on <em>Marshall Hickerson </em>as the executor of her husband should be ascertained, and when ascertained, to set off the same against the judgment. The appellee, claiming under her conveyance, had as strong a claim to this equitable protection of the slaves conveyed to him by her, as she herself would have had if no such conveyance had been made; at least so far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>that protection operated on the interests of the appelgut frotn very nature 0f th\u00a18 c]a\u00a1mj <em>Elizabeth Hickerson </em>was an indispensable party to a suit in equity asserting it. The necessity of making her a Party such a su*t evinced- by the consideration that it involved the adjustment and appropriation of her claim on the representative of her husband, and that unless she were a party thereto, the adjustment and appropriation that might be made of that claim by the decree would not bind her, and the representative of the executor would still be exposed to her suit, unprotected by such adjustment and appropriation. What, in my opinion, is the effect of the omission to make her or her representative a party to this suit, and what the proper mode of supplying that omission, will be stated in the sequel.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">While I think the court below was right in maintaining the title of the appellee to its interposition in this case, I cannot approve of its decree. That, in my opinion, is in many respects erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The account by which the amount of the setoff to the judgment was to be liquidated could not have been properly settled but in a suit in which all the unsatisfied distributees of <em>Joseph Hickerson </em>should be parties. Such a suit had been brought many years before, and was pending at the institution of this. That and other considerations rendered it improper to make those distributees parties in this suit. In this predicament, the proper course was to retain the injunction in this suit until, by the adjustment of the account in the other, the amount of <em>Elizabeth Hickerson's </em>claim on the executor of her husband was finally liquidated ; and then to apply this liquidated claim as a setoff against the judgment. It was therefore premature to render in this case a final decree giving to the appellee the benefit of the entire claim of <em>Elizabeth Hickerson </em>on the executor, while the suit in which only it could be properly liqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>dated remained undecided. Furthermore, as has been before stated, <em>Elizabeth Hiclcerson </em>or her representative was a necessary party, and no decree should have been rendered until that omission was supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"AQux\">In my opinion it was wrong, in adjusting the relief to which the appellee was entitled against the appellant, to subject the appellant to a charge for the estimated value of the slave that had been taken and sold under the appellant\u2019s execution before the institution of this suit. Had the appellee been a <em>bona fie </em>purchaser for value from <em>Elizabeth Hiclcerson, </em>he would have had no title to relief in equity in respect to that slave after the levy and sale. I cannot understand how his title to relief, and the measure of such relief, can be extended by reducing his right in the slave to that of a claimant under a voluntary conveyance. Where there are contested mutual claims, and one claimant has his judgment at law, against an execution on which his antagonist might have obtained an injunction, but does not, and such execution issues, is levied, and the property is sold, the plaintiff in the execution has never been held chargeable in equity for the estimated value of the property sold, though it should be ascertained by that court, on the adjustment of the mutual claim, that he was indebted as much as or more than the amount of the execution, to the party against whom it issued. <em>A fortiori </em>such responsibility could not attach, when, on the adjustment of the claim, the judgment claimant is creditor to an amount above the mutual claim, equal to that levied under the'1 execution. In this case it was ascertained, that after allowing credit for the entire claim of <em>Elizabeth Hiclcerson </em>on the executor of her' husband, she was indebted, when the slave <em>King </em>was taken and sold, more than the amount for which he sold. The credit in respect to that slave should have been limited to the amount made on the execution by the sale of him.</p>\n<p id=\"AEM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>My opinion is that an undue allowance was made for the dower interest of m'rs. <em>I.lickerson </em>in the slaves of her husband, by charging in her favour the estimated hires of her dower interest in all the slaves of which her husband died possessed. In respect to the two sold under execution before the executor had other assets with which he could satisfy the judgment, it is perfectly clear that if they had been purchased by a stranger, the executor could not have been made responsible for hires. I cannot perceive that the purchase of them by the executor himself would leave him exposed to such responsibility. The sale was made without culpable default in him, and at the sheriff\u2019s sale he, though executor, might purchase, as any other might; and a purchase by him, without fraud, as effectually withdrew those slaves from the dower claim on them specifically, as if the purchase had been by another. And yet the decree has subjected him to a charge for hires which he has not received, as though there had been no sale, and such hires had been received by him. In respect to the four other slaves, while I do not question that a case may exist of such gross misconduct of an executor, as to render him justly chargeable to the widow for hires of slaves that he ought to allot as her dower, but which he has wantonly sold, I think that, having regard to all the circumstances of this case, the dower interest in these four slaves should be adjusted (as I am satisfied it ought to be in respect to the other two) upon the principle adopted by this court in the case of <em>Godwin's adm'r </em>v. <em>Godwin's adm'x &amp;c. </em>4 Leigh 410. Furthermore, in a case in which the estimated hires would properly be chargeable to the executor, the amount of that charge, where it was impossible to trace the slaves and ascertain how long they lived, should be fixed by making a due allowance for the risk of life, and abating the amount thereof from the estimate of hires. The slaves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>may have died shortly after the sale, and the widow claiming hires wmuld be entitled to them for so long only as the slaves lived. To make the dower right in . . a slave equivalent to a certain estate for the life of the widow, an insurance of his life during that of the widow must be made; and the amount of such insurance would be the proper measure of abatement from the estimate of hires during the life of the widow.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em> Note by the reporter. </em>It is believed to be unnecessary to except to what is not reported by the commissioner as his view of the case.
