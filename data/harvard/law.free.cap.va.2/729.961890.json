Upon an amended bill against the surety as well as the husband, it appears that the surety, while bound as such, and of course with full knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, caused the slave to be removed and sold out of the commonwealth, through the instrumentality of an agent. Held, 1. That for such removal and sale in contempt and subversion of the court\u2019s authority, it is competent for the court to give redress and vindicate its jurisdiction by decreeing in favour of the plaintiff against both the obligors in the bond. 2. That the measure of relief is not for the value of the slave, but for the value of the plaintiff\u2019s reversionary estate in her, which should be ascertained by reference to a commissioner. 3. That the agent of the surety, by his agency in the removal and sale of the slave, would have subjected himself to the like decree, if he had known at the time of the claim of the plaintiff, and had confederated with the surety to defeat the same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b761-9\">Case in which a defendant was brought in by a messenger to answer interrogatories.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b761-10\"><em>Benjamin Davis </em>of <em>Campbell </em>county died intestate leaving no children, whereby his widow became entitled to one half of his personal estate, including the use for her life of two slaves named <em>Billy </em>and <em>Esther, </em>who were in her share. The widow removed to the state of <em>Tennessee </em>and married <em>John W. Evans.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b761-11\">In 1821, <em>William Davis senior </em>the father of <em>Benjamin, </em>and the reversioner in the two slaves, exhibited a bill in equity to the superior court of chancery at <em>Lynch-burg </em>against <em>Evans, </em>setting forth that the slaves had till <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>then remained in <em>Campbell </em>county, but that <em>Evans </em>had come to <em>Virginia </em>for the purpose of removing them out of the commonwealth. An injunction was prayed to restrain their removal, which the court awarded,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AD2\">An amended bill was filed, setting forth, that before the process was served upon <em>Evans, </em>he actually removed the slaves out of the commonwealth. It alleged that there were moneys or effects in the hands of <em>Thomas Fox </em>as administrator of <em>Benjamin Davis, </em>to which <em>Evans </em>in right of his wife would be entitled, the amount whereof would depend upon a suit in which <em>Fox </em>as administrator of <em>Davis </em>was plaintiff and <em>Jesse Harvey </em>was defendant. <em>Fox </em>and <em>Harvey </em>were made defendants as well as <em>Evans, </em>and an injunction asked to restrain <em>Fox </em>and <em>Harvey </em>from secreting or paying over the said moneys or effects. The bill also prayed that <em>Evans, </em>who it was insisted had forfeited his and his wife\u2019s interest in the slaves by removing them from the commonwealth, might surrender the slaves, or that the plaintiff might receive from <em>Harvey </em>and <em>Fox </em>the value of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-4\">A restraining order was made, in May 1822, according to the prayer of this amended bill. After which <em>Evans </em>brought the slaves back into the commonwealth, and the plaintiff thereupon went into the office of the court of chancery and consented that the said order should be discharged, so as to permit <em>Evans </em>to collect from <em>Fox </em>and <em>Harvey </em>whatever he should be entitled to from them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-5\">In May 1823, a second amended bill was filed, alleging that it was the intention of <em>Evans </em>to remove the slaves out of the commonwealth, or sell them to some person, for the purpose of being removed, and praying that the injunction might be reinstated until <em>Evans </em>should give bond and security that he would not remove them. The injunction was reinstated accordingly; and thereupon, to wit, on the 13th of June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>1823, <em>Evans </em>gaye bond with <em>Cornelius Turner </em>his surety, in the penalty of 2000 dollars, conditioned that he would abide by and perform the final decree of the court of chancery in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7Gi\">In November 1826, a third amended bill was filed against <em>Turner, </em>alleging, that after the bond was given, <em>Evans </em>left <em>Esther </em>with <em>Turner, </em>who was his brother in law, and that she had been carried out of the commonwealth and sold by <em>Turner </em>or his agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b763-5\">A fourth amended bill was filed, making defendant thereto <em>William Helm, </em>w?ho had in possession the slave <em>Billy </em>and other effects of <em>Evans.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b763-6\"><em>Evans </em>answered, that he sold <em>Esther </em>to <em>Turner, </em>and in the sale sacrificed her value by binding <em>Turner </em>to continue her in the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b763-7\"><em>Turner, </em>though served with a <em>subpoena </em>as early as the 17th of March 1827, not having filed any answer, the circuit court of <em>Lynchburg </em>(to which the case was by law transferred) made an order, on the 11th of January 1833, that he should be brought in by <em>Hill Shaw, </em>a messenger for that purpose, on the Wednesday following, to answer interrogatories. <em>Turner </em>was accordingly brought in, and by his answers to the interrogatories it appeared, that he placed <em>Esther </em>in the hands of <em>Daniel Johns </em>of <em>Pittsylvania </em>to sel!, and he afterwards understood from <em>Johns </em>that she had been sold by him for 250 dollars; but whether she was in or out of the commonwealth, he <em>(Turner) </em>did not know.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b763-8\">Thereupon, to wit, in February 1833, a fifth amended bill was filed, alleging that <em>Johns, </em>with a perfect knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s right and of the pendency of this suit, carried <em>Esther </em>out of the commonwealth and sold her; charging a combination between <em>Evans, Turner </em>and <em>Johns </em>to deprive the plaintiff of his reversionary estate; insisting that the act of carrying the slave out of the commonwealth was a forfeiture of the life estate, and that he was entitled to receive from any or all of those participating in the act the full value of the slave.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b764-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number><em>Johns, </em>by his answer, admitted that he sold <em>Esther </em>as agent of <em>Turner, </em>but denied that he had confederated with <em>Turner </em>to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and indeed denied that he had any knowledge of the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b764-10\">He did not admit that the slave was removed and sold out of the commonwealth : but in the opinion both of the circuit court and of this court, the fact was clearly established by the evidence. The circuit court was also satisfied from the evidence, that <em>Johns </em>confederated with <em>Turner </em>with full knowledge of the situation and title of the slave.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b764-11\">The cause having been revived in the name of the executor of <em>Davis </em>against the administrator of <em>Evans, </em>the circuit court, on the 4th of February 1835, decreed that <em>Turner </em>and <em>Johns </em>out of their own proper <em>goods, </em>and the administrator of <em>Evans </em>out of the goods of his intestate in his hands, should pay to the plaintiff the sura of 300 dollars, the value (in the opinion of the court) of <em>Esther, </em>with interest from the 16th of June 1826 (the time when she was sold by <em>Johns) </em>and the costs. But the plaintiff was not to have <em>execution of </em>the decree against <em>Evans\u2019s </em>administrator unless it should be ascertained that the money could not be made out of the other defendants. In case he should be subjected to payment, leave was given him to apply for a decree over. And liberty was reserved to <em>Johns, </em>in case the money should be made of him, to apply for a decree over against <em>Turner.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b764-12\">On the petition of <em>Johns </em>an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>Stanard </em>for appellants</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aeo\">As a general rule, a bill in equity will not lie for a reversioner or remainderman to recover from the tenant for life a slave or the value, upon the ground of a forfeiture having been incurred under the statute. The penalty is severe, and it would be contrary to a fundamental principle of equity to aid in\u2019 its recovery when the party has a remedy at law. <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 431. The case cannot be different here, merely because the plaintiff had applied before to the conservative power of the court to secure the property to him when his right of enjoyment should accrue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b765-4\">But the decree goes beyond the statute. That, while it forfeits the husband\u2019s life estate for his wrongful act, does not affect the interest of the wife, who has committed no wrong. At all events, the liability created by the statute is only of the husband or the tenant for life. When a third person is liable for aiding in the eloignment of a slave, that liability does not result from the statute; it is not independent of the actual damage, but is strictly measured by such damage, and cannot be carried beyond it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b765-5\"><em>C.

And if so, how can <em>Johns </em>stand in a better situation? He acted in combination with <em>Turner, </em>and under his direction ; he acted <em>pendente lite; </em>he acted, as we contend, with full and actual knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>of the pendency of this suit, and of <em>Davis\u2019s </em>rights in the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGC\">The court of chancery, having properly taken jurisdiction for the purpose of protecting the plaintiff\u2019s rights jn remaincJer, as properly proceeded to decree indemnity for the violation of those rights, perpetrated while the suit was pending, and in defiance of the restraining orders of the court. It is immaterial that the conduct of the defendants produced a forfeiture of the life estate, and an immediate right of possession on the part of the plaintiff. The jurisdiction originally vested in the court was never afterwards divested. And when the court was satisfied that the slave was irretrievably gone, it properly proceeded, having all the parties and all the fact's before it, to do complete justice and put an end to the controversy, without imposing on the injured party the burthen of a new litigation at law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b766-5\">\n<em>Grattan,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAKr\">on the same side, cited <em>Sparks </em>v. <em>Liverpool Waterworks, </em>13 Ves. 428. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Barclay, </em>16 Ves. 402. <em>S.

And the court is further of opinion that the effect of the injunction against the removal of the slaves, granted by the last mentioned order, and of the bond given by said <em>Evans </em>with the defendant <em>Turner </em>as his surety, under the provisions thereof, conditioned to have said slaves forthcoming to answer the decree of the court, would have been to secure to the said <em>Davis </em>the relief sought by his second amended bill, inasmuch as the court, upon the hearing of the cause, could have directed that said <em>Evans </em>should give bond and security conditioned against the removal of the slaves from the commonwealth, and in the event of his failure, that the slaves should be kept within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>power and under the control of the court. And the court is further of opinion that the subsequent conduct of said <em>Turner, </em>after he had obtained possession of the slave <em>Esther </em>from said <em>Evans, </em>and while bound as his surety as aforesaid, and of course with a full knowledge of said <em>Davis's </em>claim, in causing said <em>Esther </em>to be removed and sold beyond the reach of the court, was in contempt and subversion of its authority, and that it was competent for the court to give the only redress within its power, and to vindicate its jurisdiction, by decreeing against said <em>Turner, </em>to the parly injured, the value of the reversion in said slave <em>Esther; </em>and that said conduct of said <em>Turner </em>was moreover a breach of the condition of the bond executed as aforesaid by said <em>Evans </em>with said <em>Turner </em>as his surety, which subjected the said <em>Evans </em>also to the like decree. And the court is further of opinion that the appellant, by his agency in the removal and sale of said slave, would have subjected himself also to the like decree, if he had known at the time of the claim of said <em>Davis, </em>and had confederated with said <em>Turner </em>to defeat the same; but that such knowledge and confederacy have not been established by the evidence in the cause. The court is therefore of opinion that the said decree is erroneous in giving any relief against the appellant, and is moreover erroneous in the measure of relief given against said <em>Turner </em>and the administrator of said <em>Evans, </em>inasmuch as the same should have been not for the value of the slave <em>Esther, </em>but for the value of said <em>Davis's </em>reversionary estate in her, which ought to have been ascertained by reference to a commissioner. It is therefore ordered and decreed that the said decree of the circuit court be reversed with costs. And this court proceeding to render such decree in regard to the appellant as ought to have been rendered by the said circuit court, it is further ordered and decreed that the fifth amended bill of the appellee be dismissed as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>the appellant, but without costs. And the cause is remanded to the said circuit court, to be there further proceeded in, as regards the other defendants, according to the principles above declared.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b764-13\">The statutes of <em>Virginia </em>bearing upon the case are in 1 R.
