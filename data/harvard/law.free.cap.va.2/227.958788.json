And if she should have children, for them to come under the same regulation, after they pay for their raising; but their labour to be equally amongst all my children, if they choose to employ them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">\u201c Item. I will and bequeath to my beloved wife <em>Mary </em>my land not heretofore disposed of, and my negro girl <em>Eliza, </em>during her natural life.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">The widow of <em>Josiah Wynn </em>died subsequent to the year 1830; and during her life, <em>Eliza </em>had three children. After the death of <em>Mrs. Wynn, Eliza </em>and her three children went into the possession of <em>Joshua Carrell, </em>who had married the testator\u2019s daughter <em>Jinney. </em>And in 1835, the children of the testator filed a bill against <em>Carreli </em>and wife, claiming that these slaves should be distributed equally among the next of kin of <em>Josiah Wynn. Carreli </em>answered the bill, insisting that by the will of <em>Josiah Wynn, </em>the slave <em>Eliza </em>and her children, born in the lifetime of the widow, were given to his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">The cause came on to be heard in April 1838, when the bill was dismissed with <em>costs; </em>and from this decree, the plaintiffs obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-8\"><em>Sheffey, </em>for the appellants, contended 1st.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A72\">That the slaves were not emancipated by the will. That the testator had attempted to place them in a condition between freedom, and slavery, not recognized by law; and therefore the bequest was void. <em>Rucker's adm'r </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>3 Leigh 8. He contended 2d. That the leading object of the testator having failed entirely, there was an intestacy as to these slaves. Manifestly, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>not the intention of the testator that <em>Jinney, </em>or any of his children should have a beneficial interest in the slaves. The object was the same as that in the case of <em>Rucker's adm'r </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>and must be ruled by it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AS-\"><em>Fulton, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlX\">concurred with the counsel for the appellants, on the first point. On the second point, he insisted that the bequest to the testator\u2019s daughter <em>Jinney </em>was good, and the proviso attached to it was void. The bequest to the daughter was, in the first place, absolute; and the addition of a void provision to it, could not affect the preceding absolute bequest. 1 Roper on Leg. 677.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-8\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AFl\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The Court is of opinion, that although by the terms of the will, the testator looked, principally, to the benefit of the slave <em>Eliza </em>and her increase, in the provision made respecting her, it was not his intention to confer upon her or her increase, the absolute right to freedom. That he contemplated a continued custody and control of the persons as slaves; but conferring privileges and benefits, inconsistent with that relation; and thus attempted to place the said <em>Eliza </em>and her increase in an intermediate condition between free persons of colour and <em>slaves; </em>a condition unknown to the laws, and contrary to their policy. The Court is therefore of opinion, that this provision of the will is inoperative and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">The Court is further of opinion, that the will cannot be construed as a bequest of said <em>Eliza </em>or her increase, to his daughter <em>Jinney, </em>or to his other children, as slaves. He expressly declares, that he bequeaths <em>Eliza </em>not as a bound slave; thereby clearly shewing he did not contemplate disposing of her as property; an intention made more manifest by the provision respecting the wages for her labour. And by the clause providing that the chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>dren of <em>Eliza </em>should come under the same regulation after they pay for their raising, he intended to place the increase in the same condition with the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that the will contains no disposition of the slave Eliza, or her increase, as slaves or property; and the leading intent being to create a <em>status </em>or condition of persons which the law does not permit, the whole provision in regard to <em>Eliza </em>and her increase after the death of his wife, is inoperative and void; and the said <em>Eliza </em>and her increase remained undisposed of after the happening of that event; and should be distributed as in other cases of intestacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">The Court is further of opinion, that an account should have been stated, charging the parties in possession with the hires and profits of the slaves, subject to a proper deduction for the expense of raising, if any, in order to a final settlement and distribution of the whole subject in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that the decree of the Circuit Court, dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, was erroneous. It is therefore reversed with costs against <em>Joshua Carrell; </em>and remanded for further proceedings in order to a final decree, according to the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
