Lomax </em>v. <em>Picot, 2 </em>Rand. 247.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AT0\">Two verdicts were rendered in favour of a party whose land was overflowed, against the owner of a mill, for keeping his dam too high. The dam was then swept away: and the plaintiff at law thereafter exhibited a bill of injunction against the mill owner, which alleged that he had not begun, within the time prescribed by law, to rebuild the dam, and also contained a suggestion in general terms, that irreparable mischief would result to the plaintiff from rebuilding the same. It did not appear that there was ever any order of court granting leave to build the mill and dam; it did appear, however, that the mill and dam had existed more than 50 years. Held, that the verdicts for keeping the dam too high shew that the mill owner had at least a prescriptive right to keep the dam at some height; that these verdicts did not warrant an injunction to restrain him from rebuilding the dam, in the absence of any allegation in the bill that he was about to build it, or had threatened to build it, beyond the authorized height; and that if it was competent for a court of equity to interpose at all to enforce a forfeiture of the mill owner\u2019s right because of his failure to rebuild the dam within the time prescribed by law, it ought not to be done by way of injunction, without an allegation in the bill of some distinct and sufficient ground of irreparable mischief.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\">In August 1836, <em>Joseph Tyree </em>exhibited a bill to the judge of the circuit court of <em>Hanover, </em>setting forth, that he is the owner of a tract of land in <em>Hanover </em>county on the south side of <em>Mattadyquin </em>creek, and <em>Dydball Talley </em>is the owner of a tract on the north side of said creek ; that across the creek, for many years, <em>Talley </em>had had a dam, and a mill connected therewith ; that whether the same was authorized by law or not, the complainant had never been able clearly to ascertain, but so far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>he had investigated the subject, he was satisfied, and therefore charged, that legal and proper permission had never been obtained to erect said dam and mill; that it is certain, however, the same has been, within less than 20 years, raised above any height at which in previous years it had stood, and by consequence had greatly flooded and injured the complainant\u2019s land; that for this injury the complainant instituted an action at law, and by a fair trial obtained a verdict and judgment ; that the said <em>Talley </em>still continuing to hold the water in his pond higher than he should under any circumstances have done, the complainant, for this continued injury, instituted another suit at law against the said <em>Talley, </em>and obtained another verdict and judgment; that sometime about the 10th of September 1834, a considerable part of the dam of the said mill was swept off by a very heavy flood, by which all the water, or very nearly all, was drawn off from the pond, and the lands above the dam were uncovered, and have since so remained; that the said <em>Talley </em>had not since begun to \u201c rebuild or repair\u201d the said mill, although the same had been unfit for public use nearly two years; but that he now threatened to rebuild the dam forthwith, and by doing so he would again flood and greatly injure the land of the complainant, lying both above and below the said dam. And the complainant alleged, that if the said <em>Talley </em>should be permitted to proceed thus arbitrarily and illegally, he (the complainant) would be subjected to the most serious and irreparable injury; an injury for which he could obtain no adequate legal relief. An injunction was therefore prayed, to restrain the said <em>Talley </em>from proceeding to rebuild or repair the said mill or dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\"><em>Talley </em>answered, that the mill and dam (or rather the privilege thereof) have existed in use and unquestioned, certainly for 50 years, and he believed for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>much longer time. He admitted that he had not found, among the records of <em>Hanover </em>county court, the original proceedings by which his said mill was established; but it was, he said, one of the oldest in the country, and could be proved to have had existence at a period the records of which were very imperfect, and it was not improbable that it was built at a time when it was lawful, and frequently the practice, to build mills and dams without application to any court for authority to do so. The complainant\u2019s speaking of the water having been, within less than twenty years, raised above its proper height, betrayed, the respondent argued, the complainant\u2019s own knowledge of the fact which he pretended to question, that the said mill and dam had an undoubted legal existence, from the length of time they had continued. The respondent did not deny that the complainant had recovered two verdicts against him in actions brought to recover damages for injury done to his lands. In these suits, he said, he laboured under the disadvantage of having no record to shew the height to which he was entitled to hold the water in his pond, and he believed that in consequence of this the jurors referred to his supposed illegal acts, consequences resulting from the relative situation of the creek and of the complainant\u2019s land. For, he said, he believed he could shew that as much injury would result to the land from a flood in the creek, when his dam is down and the water let off, as when the dam is standing. After each verdict, he said, he held the water in his pond at a lower height. Yet the complainant had instituted a third suit to recover damages for injury to his land in the intervening period between the last verdict and the month of September 1834, when the dam was carried away; and had avowed his purpose to contest the respondent\u2019s right to have his mill and dam on the site where they ha'd stood so long, on any terms whatever. The only ground, the respondent argued, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>which the complainant could come into equity, was for \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 the prevention of irreparable injury. What, he asked, is the \u201cirreparable injury\u201d in the present case? The plaintiff complains that his land will be covered when the dam is raised too high. Then, said the respondent, the injury can only arise from raising the dam to an <em>illegal </em>height. \u201c How can the complainant anticipate that this will be done, and that injury will ensue ? Will it not be time enough to bring his action when the injury actually occurs ? And has he shewn in any manner that such action will not compensate the injury?\u201d The respondent denied emphatically the allegation in the bill that he did not begin to rebuild and repair his dam within one year from the 7th of September 1834, when it was carried away; and proceeded to state what he had done towards such rebuilding and repair, and when he did it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">Depositions read in the actions at law were produced by the defendant to shew the antiquity of the mill. According to these depositions, it was erected before 1768.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\">The defendant moved to dissolve the injunction, but the court overruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-9\">From this order an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-10\"><em>Daniel </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au3\">The appeal was properly allowed in this case, to settle the principles of the cause, and save expense and delay. 1 R. C. 1819, ch. 66. \u00a7 57. p. 208. Sess. Acts 1830-31, ch. 11. $ 31. Suppl. to Rev. Code, p. 149. The case of <em>Lomax </em>v. Picot, 2 Rand. 247. is a decision in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-13\">The charge of irreparable injury to the appellee from the erection of the dam is in general terms, and it is not shewn how such injury is to result. The jurisdiction of equity to interfere in such cases by injunction is of modern origin, and very cautiously exercised. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Coulson </em>v. <em>White, </em>3 Atk. 21. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Gardiner, </em>7 Ves. 307. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Beekman and others, </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 318. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 207. \u00a7 928. <em>Earl of Ripon and others </em>v. <em>Hobart and others, </em>3 Mylne &amp; Keene 169. 8 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 331. The principle of this last case is directly applicable to the present. In <em>Crenshaws </em>v. <em>The Slate River Company, </em>6 Rand. 245. the court adverts to the peculiar nature and public utility of mill prop\u00e9rty, and the hardship which may be inflicted on the mill owner by the interference of the court of chancery.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-6\"><em>Lyons </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyvB\">It may well be questioned whether an appeal from an order refusing to dissolve an injunction is sustainable. Great delay, without any corresponding benefit, must be the consequence of allowing appeals in such cases, since they are not now privileged in respect to the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-7\">This is a case of nuisance, in which there have been repeated trials at law, and repeated verdicts for the plaintiff. In such a case, equity has unquestionable jurisdiction to interfere by injunction, as it would have, indeed, if the case were one of simple trespass. Eden on Injunctions 259-275. 1 Chitty\u2019s Gen. Pract. 722, 4. <em>Field </em>v. <em>Beaumont, </em>1 Swanst. 208. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Village of Newburgh, 2 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 164. <em>Corning and others </em>v. <em>Lowerre, </em>6 Id. 439. <em>Beveridge </em>v. <em>Lacey, </em>3 Rand. 63. The plaintiff had no adequate remedy but in equity. If he had waited until the dam was rebuilt, a prosecution for a public nuisance could not be sustained. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, 2 </em>Leigh 721. And the plaintiff might also have been held to have waived his right to equitable relief, by his delay in applying to the court. As to actions at law, the history of this case is enough to shew that they would not afford any sufficient or effectual redress.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Daniel </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGI\">While the act of April 16. 1831 (Sess. Acts 1830-31, ch. 11. \u00a7 32. Suppl. to Rev. Code p. 149.) has taken away the right to priority of hearing in cases such as this, it has left the right of appeal as it was under the former law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-5\">The defendant had an unquestionable right to have his dam at some height, and it does not follow, because it has been heretofore too high, that he intended to rebuild it to an illegal height. <em>[Lyons. </em>The verdicts ascertain that the former height of the dam was illegal: but they do not determine that the defendant had a right to raise the dam. He may have had no right at all to have a dam at the place.] The verdicts are not in the record. They were not found, however, because a dam was unlawfully in existence, but because the height of it was too great. The bill itself concedes that the defendant had a right to have a dam of some height. And the plaintiff does not shew that the rebuilding the same would produce injury to him. There is then no ground disclosed by the bill for equitable interference; and though a demurrer might have been filed for that cause, yet it was unnecessary. The want of equity in the bill is a proper consideration on a motion to dissolve the injunction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b537-6\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AqOa\">delivered the following as the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The court is of opinion, that the verdicts recovered by the appellee against the appellant for keeping his dam, in the proceedings mentioned, too high, serve to shew that he had at least a prescriptive right to keep the same at some height; and therefore that if it was competent for a court of equity to interpose at all, to enforce the alleged forfeiture of such right, by reason of the appellant\u2019s alleged failure to reconstruct his dam (after it had been swept away) within the time prescribed by law, it ought not to have been done by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>way of injunction, without an allegation in the bill of distinct and sufficient ground of irreparable mischief, instead of a general and indefinite suggestion of such mischief. And the court is further of opinion, that the said verdicts against the appellant for keeping his dam beyond the authorized height did not warrant an injunction to restrain him from reconstructing it at all, or even from reconstructing it beyond the authorized height, in the absence of any allegation in the bill that he was about to reconstruct it, or had threatened to reconstruct it, beyond such authorized height. The court is therefore of opinion, that the circuit court erred in refusing to dissolve the injunction which had been granted to the appellee, inasmuch as the same was improvidently granted. It is therefore considered that the order of the said circuit court overruling the appellant\u2019s motion to dissolve said injunction be reversed and annulled, and that the appellant recover against the appellee his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal here.' And this court proceeding to make such order as the said circuit court ought to have made, it is further considered that the said injunction be dissolved. Which is ordered to be certified to the said circuit court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
