Quarles </em>for 319/. military certificates, with interest from 16th <em>Maty, </em>1786. <em>fiord </em>accordingly paid off the execution, and took an assignment of the bonds. He received die amount due <em>\u00edroin. Micozv; </em>and brought suit against Quarles, and recovered a judgment for 84/. 10s. <em>8d. </em>the value of the certifi-\" cates,. and costs; upon which he sued out an execution, which being returned \u201c <em>no </em>effectshe brought suit against <em>Kenner </em>as <em>assignor </em>of the bond, and, upon the general issue, recovered the judgment first above mentioned.</p><p id=\"b31-4\">The defendant in his answer denied his having taken any unfair advantage; but admitted that he fairly purchased the bonds for less than their nominal value ; and insisted, that the plaintiff\u2019s defence having been properly <em>at </em>law, he ought now to have the benefit of his judgr ment.</p><p id=\"b31-5\">The <em>affidavits </em>filed, stated, that <em>after </em>the assignment of the bonds, the plaintiff insisted that the defendant had received them <em>without recourse; </em>which he denied; that<em>Sitiarles </em>had considerable property in possession in the year 1786; and that the plaintiff was not defended at law upon the ground of <em>laches </em>in the defendant to pursue <em>Quarles; </em>and a complete copy of the proceedings at law was filed. At the last <em>May </em>Term, the injunction was dissolved ; and, at the last <em>September </em>Term, the bill was dismissed.</p><p id=\"b31-6\">In the fall vacation, the plaintiff applied to the Chancellor at his chamber, for an appeal, which he refused for these reasons: 1. That the subject had been, or might have been, fairly settled by the proper tribunal, <em>at law; </em>and, 2. If it was not, yet the plaintiff should not be relieved against his own contract, (though it may have been a hard one,) since nothing like fraud attends it; as it is supposed that <em>bonds, </em>as well as <em>horses, </em>may be <em>sold, </em>for a stipulated value, and such sales enforced,' in a court of equity, as well as in a court of law, when not a <em>usurious </em>trait appears in the transaction.</p><p id=\"b31-7\">The plaintiff was not satisfied with this denial; but applied for an appeal to the Judges of the Supreme Court, who <em>unanimously </em>refused it.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
