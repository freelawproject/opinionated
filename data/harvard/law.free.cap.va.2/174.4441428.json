A. Pennell &amp; Co. </em>The declaration was filed at the November rules, 1817. The defendants being arrested, and not appearing, a conditional judgment <em>was </em>entered at the rules. In December following, the defendants still failing to appear, the conditional judgment was confirmed against the defendants, and their appearance bail. On the 18th of April following, that being the last day of the term of the said Superior Court, the judgment aforesaid became final, according to the act of Assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">On the 4th of June following, the defendants, <em>Pennell\\ Wamsley, </em>and <em>Heiskill, </em>their appearance bail, haying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>sued out a writ of error, <em>coram voids, </em>the Superior Court of the said county awarded a <em>supersedeas, </em>upon bond and security being given for the effectual prosecution of the said writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-4\">An assignment of errors accompanied the application for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which stated, that the said <em>Pennell, \u201c </em>at the time of the commencement of the said suit, and at the time of making and entering the common order, for want of an appearance therein, and at the time of the entry of the said judgment aforesaid, was under the age of twenty-one years, to wit: of the age of twenty years, and no more, to wit: at the county of Harrison, aforesaid, in which case, the said Fielding\u201d (meaning <em>Fielding A. Pennell,) </em>\u201cought to have been admitted to appear and defend the said suit by his guardian;\u201d and this they are ready to verify. The assignment concludes with praying, that the judgment might be revoked, annulled, and altogether held for nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">With the assignment of errors, the affidavits of <em>Pennell, </em>the defendant, and his father, were filed, going to prove, that the said <em>Pennell </em>was born on the 9th of January, 1797.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">The bond and security were given, according to the terms of the order awarding the supersedeas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\"><em>Cole </em>appeared by his attorney, and craved <em>oyer </em>of the record mentioned in the writ of error, and pleaded, that the judgment in his favor ought not to be reversed or annulled, because, after taking the judgment aforesaid, at rules, in the Clerk\u2019s office, against the said <em>Pennell, Wamsley, </em>and <em>HeisJeill, </em>their appearance bail, and before the next term of the Superior Court, held on the 18th of April, 1818, to wit: on the 9th of January, of the same year, the said <em>Pennell </em>became of full age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">To this plea the plaintiff in error demurred generally, and the defendants joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-9\">The Court sustained the demurrer, over-ruled the pica, and reversed and annulled the judgment in favor of <em>Cole. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>obtained at the rules, and which afterwards became final by \u00a3he rising of the Court at the spring term, 1818.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AU-\"><em>Cole </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Axm\"><em>Nicholas, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWzd\">made four objections to the judgment of the Superior Court:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-8\">1. The writ of error <em>coram vobis </em>ought to have been applied for to the <em>Court </em>itself, and not awarded by the Clerk, and this fault being in the foundation of the pro-vitiates the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-9\">2. The plaintiff in error in the Inferior Court, improperly alledges that he was an infant, at the time when the judgment was obtained against him. The judgment was never complete, until after the term. <em>Digges\u2019s exr. </em>v. <em>Dunn\u2019s exr., </em>1 Munf. 56; and then, it is admitted by the demurrer, the party had attained full age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYf9\">3. Writs of error <em>coram vobis, </em>on the ground of <em>infancy, </em>do not lie on behalf of an <em>adult, </em>as the party was, when he applied in this case. It is fatal for an infant to \u25a0 bring error to reverse a judgment, by <em>attorney </em>and not by <em>guardian. </em>3 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>616, <em>tit. Infancy; Co. Ent. </em>289; <em>Cro. Ja. </em>25. The party in this case had a. day in Court, at which he might have pleaded infancy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-13\">4. The judgment should not have been reversed in favor of <em>Pennell, </em>because it was a joint judgment against a mercantile firm, and would bind the social effects, though one of the partners might have been an infant during part of the partnership, but admitted to be of full age when the judgment was obtained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-14\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-15\">It sufficiently appears from the record, that the writ of error was regularly awarded, or at least allowed. The bond recites, that the writ had been awarded by a Judge of the General Court; and should that point be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>material, there is little doubt that a <em>certiorari </em>would bring up a, record, which would shew the award in form. Besides, it is stated, that the writ was produced in Court, by the plaintiffs in error, and that the Court thereupon superseded further proceedings on the judgment complained of; which, if not a formal award, is clearly an allowance of the writ; and the defendant in error having appeared and pleaded cannot avail himself of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-5\">But, writs of error of this kind may be prosecuted <em>without </em>being awarded by the Court, or a Judge in vacation. At common law, all writs of error in civil cases, as well those from a Superior to an Inferior Court, to correct-errors in law, as writs of error <em>coram, vobis </em>to correct mistakes or errors in fact or in process, were suable of common right, <em>ex debito justitisa. Queen </em>v. Paty, <em>2 </em>Salk. 504; 2 <em>Wms. Saunders, </em>101, <em>a, note. </em>The provisions in our statutes do not relate to writs of error <em>coram vobis. </em>1 <em>Rev. Code, chap. 69, \u00a7 55, 6, 7, 8, </em>9; <em>chap. 64, \u00a7 </em>11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-7\">The writ of error <em>coram, vobis </em>was clearly the proper remedy in this case. 2 <em>Wms. Saunders, </em>101, a, <em>note; Gordon </em>v. <em>Frazer, 2 </em>Wash. 130. That a judgment against an infant is error, there can be no doubt. 3 <em>Bac. Abr.

On this single point, Ihe plea of the defendant in error rests the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-10\">But, the whole proceedings at rules were erroneous, and should have been set aside, instead of being confirmed at the ensuing term. If the office-judgment was irregular and nugatory, there was nothing to he confirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-11\">Where an infant defendant makes default, the plaintiff ought to apply to the Court to assign him a guardian <em>ad litem; </em>and he cannot take any available step till that be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>done. 2 Wms.

An appearance will cure many errors; but, if the party, although he might have appeared, either at rules or in Court, to set aside the office-judgment, fail to do so, his default in not appearing does not cure any error in the <em>proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">In the case at bar, one of the appellees being an infant, undefended when <em>the </em>rules and judgment were taken against him in the office, although adult before the term of the Court at which that judgment might have been set aside, his failure to appear did not cure the error, if any, in the proceedings in the office. Those proceedings were erroneous. No rule could be taken against him, until a guardian was appointed to defend him, or he attained his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>age; and, if no one on his behalf applied to the Court to appoint one, the plaintiff was bound, at his peril, if he had continued an infant, to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"AeJ\">Two inconveniences would arise out of this rule to the plaintiff; but, the,y are such as are unavoidable, without abandoning the rule of law, that an infant cannot he prejudiced by any judicial proceeding, unless he be defended by guardian; a rule, without which, infants, incapable of protecting themselves, might be utterly ruined, under <em>co-lour of </em>judicial proceedings. One of those inconveniences is, that the plaintiff could not proceed a step in the cause, beyond the filing of his declaration, until the infant attained his age, or the Court sat, so as to enable him or some other to move to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem,. </em>The consequence of which is, that he must continue the cause at rules, without taking any rule in the mean time. The other is, that if the infant be held to bail, and will not or cannot give special bail, as he cannot appear without bail, unless with the plaintiff\u2019s consent, the latter must be content to continue the cause at rules, until the infant attains his age, or to consent to his appearing without bail, which would be left to the election of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The failure of the infant to appear after he was adult, does not cure the errors at the rules; and, the judgment, being founded on those erroneous rules, is, therefore, erroneous. Moreover, the rules and judgment being joint, and erroneous as <em>to </em>one, they were erroneous <em>in toto, </em>and ought to have been <em>revoked. </em>But, these errors not extending to the writ or declaration, the Court went too far in depriving the party of the benefit of his writ and declaration, which were good. For, if the infant had pleaded infancy, and it had been found for him, judgment might still have been given against the adult defendant; <em>liarIrup v. </em>Thompson, 5 Johns. Rep. ICO; or, the plaintiff might have replied necessaries, though probably without effect; or, the infant may have confirmed the contract, since he came of age. The plaintiff could not have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the benefit of such replications upon the writ of error, and should not be precluded from availing himself of them, if the facts exist. The judgment should have been revoked, anc^ the proceedings at rules, subsequent to the filing of the declaration, set aside; and the cause sent to the rules, to be further proceeded in. The infant now being adult, must give special bail, and plead, or judgment may properly be entered against him, by default for want of appearance, or by <em>nil dicit, </em>as the case may be.</p>\n<author id=\"b192-4\">Judge Coalter.</author>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">I have not been able to satisfy myself, whether the plea in this case was a bar to the writ of error, or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The other Judges, however, being of opinion that it is not, I will merely state my doubts, in order, that if a similar case should ever come before the Court again, an opportunity may be afforded for further enquii-y.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The appellee, <em>Pennell, </em>who has brought this writ of error on the ground of his infancy, was the principal partner, it would seem, in a store, contracted this debt in Philadelphia for goods, and executed the note of the firm. Suit is brought on this note in the Superior Court of Harrison county, returnable to the November rules, 1817, and appearance bail given by the defendants. There being no appearance, an office-judgment was then taken, which at December rules was confirmed. It appears, that on the 9th of January following, the plaintiff in error arrived at full age. The cause stood as an office-judgment at the April term following, and not being set aside, is, by the law, to be considered as a judgment of the last day of that <em>term, </em>and would be so stated in any exemplification of the record, in the same manner as if actually entered in the order book of that day, and signed by the Judge. At this term, the party was of age. Generally, a plea to a writ of error of this kind, that the plaintiff in er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ror was of ago at the time of the judgment, is a. good bar to the writ. <em>2 Lill. Entr. </em>491, 231, 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">Suppose he had pleaded at the rules by attorney, and this plea had been tried at the April term. Had he been then an infant, this would have been error; but, 1 believe, it would not in this ease, he being then of age; and that a plea to the writ, that he was then of age, would have been good.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">In an action against a defendant who is an infant, the plaintiff may declare as against another person, and it is not necessary to declare against him as an infant, and charge that the goods were necessaries. 2 <em>Morg. Vade </em>mecum, 443; 5 <em>Comyn\u2019s Dig. </em>173. The suit then was well brought without naming him as an infant, if that had been known. April term was the first time at which the plaintiff could have applied for a guardian to be named; but, then the defendant was of age. What was the plaintiff then to do? Was he to take an office-judgment at November and December against the other defendant, and suspend proceedings against the infant until January rules, (for they were on tlie 19th, and he was of age on the 9th,) and then take a judgment against him, and confirm it at February rules? Had he done this, I apprehend there would have been no foundation for the writ of error. He, however, takes an office-judgment against both, before the infant came of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>Suppose he </em>had been under age at April term, and the plaintiff had then <em>moved to </em>have a guardian named, but the infant failed to give appearance bail, without which, I apprehend, the guardian could not enter an appearance, and defend, what could the Court do? All that could have been done in that case, it appears to me, would have been, to set aside the office-judgment against him, and send the cause to the rules, that he might give bail, and appear there. But, could even this be done, unless special bail was first given, so as to enable the guardian to appear and make the motion? I am not prepared to say. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>that an infant is not to give bail. He may have contracted a debt for necessaries. He may, on the eve of coming \u00b0f age, have committed an outrageous assault, and may a*s0 on the eve of flying the country, and bail may be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u25a0 But, at the office-judgment Court he was an adult, and at least stood in no better situation than if he had been an infant, and a guardian had then been assigned. Had he then appeared in Court, and moved to send the cause to the rules without bail, ought the Court to have done so? Had he given bail, and set aside the office-judgment, then the errors, if any, at the rules, would have been cured: 2 <em>Wils. 50; </em>and the most he could have complained of, would have been, that he ought to have an opportunity at rules, to plead in abatement. The Court might have sent it back for that purpose, or perhaps permitted such plea in Court, under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">These are some of the grounds, on which I doubt whether the plea in this case was not a bar to the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The other Judges, however, being of opinion that it was not, still I think that the judgment on the writ of error is erroneous. The writ and declaration were good, though the proceedings in the office against the infant were not. The course of the Court then, is, to reverse the first error. The judgment and proceedings, then, ought to have been reversed to the declaration, and the cause remanded to the rules, for further proceedings.</p>\n<author id=\"b194-7\">Judge Brooke.</author>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The objection, that the writ of error in this case was issued by the Clerk, and not upon motion in Court, is obviated by the facts in the record. The order of the Court, superseding the judgment sought to be reversed, is made on the day of the date of the writ; and the bond recites, that the writ issued by the order of a Judge of the General Court. In the absence of these facts, the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>comes loo late after <em>oyer </em>of the writ of error, and a plea to the assignment of errors, in pursuance of the writ. The judgment on these proceedings, I think, is also correct. The coming of age of the appellee, Pennell, since the coinmon order, can give no new aspect to the case. No Cu-lure pleadings can avail the appellant. The infancy of the appellee being admitted by his plea to the assignment of errors, and adjudged upon demurrer, cannot again he put in issue in any proceedings at rules, nor would it be regular to send the cause back to rules, for a plea that could not be negatived <em>by the </em>plaintiff. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Judgment and proceedings reversed to the declaration, and the cause remanded to the rules, for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-14\">Judge Cabbell, absent</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
