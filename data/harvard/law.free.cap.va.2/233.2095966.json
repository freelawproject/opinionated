But that the plaintiff, relying upon <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>assurances, that no payments had been made to him by <em>Harris, </em>and that he was insolvent, executed the following agreement, <em>viz: </em>\u201cWe <em>John H Morton </em>and <em>George </em>Anderson, have this day entered into a final settlement of all our accounts of every denomination whether in bonds, open accounts, bills, money, or traffic of all and every kind, from the earliest period to this day, and we agree, that there shall be paid to the said <em>George Anderson </em>by the said <em>Morton, </em>(as soon as he can possibly effect the same,) 450/., which is to be considered as full payment for every debt that may have been due, and is due at the present date from the said <em>Morton </em>to the said <em>Anderson, </em>as also for all and every transaction the said <em>Anderson </em>has had with any person in which the said <em>Morton </em>held an interest in any manner whatsoever. The above payment to be made pn or before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u00bfhe 1st of <em>January </em>next.\u201d This agreement was signed and sealed, by Norton, who at the same time received . a counterpart thereof, sealed by Anderson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-3\">The bill further states, that after the execution of the above deed, the plaintiff drew an order upon <em>Wilson </em>and <em>John </em>Nicholas, in favor of Anderson, for 450/, In discharge of the sum mentioned in the above deed, but that it was neither accepted, paid, nor returned to the appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\">The bill prayed an injunction against a judgment obtained upon the aforesaid agreement by the defendant <em>Rose, </em>as assignee thereof, to be allowed all discounts which he could make appear against Anderson, and for general relief. An Injunction till further order was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">The defendant Rose, by his answer denied any notice of the plaintiff's equity, at the time of the assignment made to him, and insisted that he was a <em>bona Jide </em>purchaser of the debt in question, for valuable consideration paid to Anderson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">The depositions in the cause established the receipt of a sum of money by <em>Anderson </em>from <em>Harris ; </em>but no proof of the plaintiff' s title to any part of it, <em>or </em>respecting the order drawn upon Nicholas, <em>v </em>as exhibited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-7\">The cause being set down as to the defendant <em>Rose, (Anderson </em>not having answered,) the Court delivered the following opinion, u that the order stated in the bill to have been drawn \u201c by the plaintiff upon <em>Wilson </em>and <em>John </em>Nicholas, payable to the defendant <em>.George </em>Anderson, could not have been legally discounted against the debt claimed by the other defendants in virtue of the deed acknowledged by the bill to have been executed by the plaintiffand that the plaintiff cannot set oft\u201d against the said debt any equitable demand which he may have a right to claim from the said defendant <em>George </em>AndersonThe bill was dismissed as to the defendant Rose, and-the cause continued as to <em>Anderson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-8\">From this decree, <em>Norton </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-9\"><em>Wickham$ </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The question is, whether a bond, in the hands of an assignee without notice, is discharged of an original equity existing against it ? I shall contend, that it is not. 1st. Upon general principles of law, and 2dly, upon the just construction of the Act of Assembly which permits bonds to be assigned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-9\">The assignment of a <em>chose in </em>action, cannot so far change the subject of negotiation, as to make it the evidence of a debt in the hands of an assignee, when in truth no debt exists. If it were originally void, the assignment cannot give it validity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-10\">The case of <em>Turton </em>v. Benson, 1 P. <em>Will. </em>497, is conclusive upon this point to prove, that the equity which was originally attached to the bond, follows it into the hands of an assignee, with, or without notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-11\">The ground upon which this Court relieves is, that the plaintiff ought not in equity to recover, because no debt was due. The assignment can only transfer the right of the obligee, and will not create a right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-12\">Thus the question stands upon general principles; but 2dly, upon the just construction of the Act of 1748, Ch. 27, &amp; 7, there is less room for maintaining a contrary opinion. The law after authorising the assignment of bonds, and permitting the assignee to sue in his own name, provides, \u201c that in any suit upon such bond, bill, or note, so assigned, the plaintiff shall allow all discounts that the defendant can prove, either against the plaintiff himself, or against the first obligee, before notice of such assignment was given to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-13\">The Act makes no distinction between legal and equitable discounts. The word <em>discount </em>is much broader than payment, and was intended to let in the obligor to any defence against the assignee, which he might have set up against the obligee. Would it not be strange, that the obligor should be protected against the assignee, as to <em>partial payments </em>made to the obligee, and yet, that he should be left exposed to his entire demand, where in equity no part of the bond was due ? As to discounts, the assignee buys at his peril, and consequently it becomes his duty to be sa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ttisfied upon that subject, before he concludes the negotiation. At the same time, and with equal conve- . nience he may, and ought to know from the obligor, if he hath any, and what objections to the payment of the bond. This observation is intended to anticipate the argument of inconvenience, which may probably be insisted upon, and to shew, that bonds were not considered by the Legislature in the same light with those negotiable papers, which on account of their use in mercantile transactions, are rendered as current as 'possible, and are, on that account, subject to different rules. There is a wide distinction between bills of exchange and bonds ; the former are drawn for the transmission of money from one country to another; they pass through many hands, and if every person who became an assignee, were under a necessity of applying to the drawer and indorsers to k^jow whether they had objections to paying the bill, it would stop their circulation altogether. It is on this account, that an equity originally attached to a bill, does not follow it into the hands of an assignee without notice. On the other hand, bonds seldom circulate out of the neighbourhood in which they \u00ab ere created; they scarcely ever travel into foreign countries, and there is therefore little or no inconvenience, in gaining all necessary information respecting them, from the person who is to pay. Whoever therefore takes a bond, without inquiry, takes it upon the faith of the assignor; and if he be deceived, he must suffer in the mean time for his misplaced confidence, and seek for reparation from the person who had deceived him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-4\">Washington, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-5\">I shall make two points, 1st. Thai the appellant has not established an equity of any sort against <em>Anderson. </em>2dly. If he had, that the equity would not follow the bond into the hands of an assignee, for valuable consideration, and without notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-6\">The .first point depends upon the evidence which is contained in she record. The bill states, that the appellant was entitled to a proportion of the sales of certain goods, which were put into the hands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>Charles Harris </em>by <em>Anderson. </em>The proof is complete as to the delivery of the goods, and the amount for which they were sold; but there is no evidence that the appellant had any interest in them, and consequently, this important fact rests altogether upon the allegations in the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-8\">As to the order upon Nicholas, it is exposed to the same observation ; there is no evidence respecting it, and if there were, the appellant by his own shewing could set up no equity on that account; for he admits that it was neither accepted, nor paid by the drawee, and that he had no funds in his hands belonging to the drawer. So that notice of the refusal, or the return of the order, was immaterial to the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-9\">The second point is new in this Court, and of great importance to this country, in whatever manner it may be deeded. It is admitted, that in the case of bills of exchange, the indorsee is not chargeable with any original equity attached to the bill. It is equally indisputable, that this principle applies to all negotiabh papers in <em>England; </em>and the law of this State, which makes bonds assignable, brings them within the reason and influence of the same principle. The application of this rule to bonds, is to be defended, 1st, upon the policy of the thing, and 2dly, upon long established maxims which prevail in this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-10\">As to the first, it is not difficult to foresee, that if the assignee of a bond must take it subject to any con\u00bb cealed equity which may be attached to it, the negotiability of such papers would be at an end. The design of the Legislature, in making bonds assignable, was to create a kind of circulating medium, in order to supply the want of real money, and to accommodate the planters of this country. But if it be necessary for the person who is about to purchase a bond, to go from one part of the State to the other, in search of the obligor, in order to obtain information concerning its validity, he would rather relinquish it altogether.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-11\">As to the principle itself, it is interwoven with the best established maxims which prevail in Courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Equity. The assignee of a negotiable paper acquires a <em>legal </em>right to the money, of which the paper is the evidence ; of course, <em>he has the law in his favour. </em>The obligor may oppose the demand, by <em>the equity </em>which was originally attached to it. But the assignee being a purchaser for valuable consideration, and without notice, has <em>at least </em>as much equity to receive, as the obligor or drawer has to withhold payment. The equity then being equal, the law must prevail | nay, so far does this principle go, that in contests of a <em>merely equitable </em>nature, if either has obtained an advantage, though not a legal one, the Court will not deprive him of it, but will leave him to make such use of it- as he can, 1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>301. This Court, when applied to for relief against a judgment obtained by the assignee at law, must be assured that there is <em>superior equity </em>on the side of the person asking its aid. But if the parties stand equal in point of equity, it will not interfere between them. It is admitted that this principle applies to bills of exchange. When notes of hand were made assignable, <em>they </em>became of course subject to. the same rule, not on account of commercial considerations, but because they were thereby brought within a rule of equity, which in its operation is universal. <em>Cunning. </em>Bills, 119. But where the assignment transfers <em>no legal right, </em>there, if the equity be equal, he who has <em>the prior equity </em>must prevail. Upon this latter rule, the cases of <em>Turton </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>1 <em>P. Will. </em>496, 10 <em>Mod. </em>450, and <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Caillovel, </em>1 <em>Vez. </em>123, were decided. The assignment of a bond, in <em>England, </em>can only pass an equity <em>i </em>the meaning of it is, that the assignee is to have all equitable advantages from it, which the assignor possessed. But If he had no equitable right to the money, he could transfer none.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-2\">Observe how the principle runs through all cases coming within it, though totally unconnected with commerce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-3\">If a trustee sell land to a third person, for valuable consideration, and without notice of the trust, the purchaser is discharged from the claim of the <em>cestui que </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>trust, because he has the law in his favour, and has equal equity. As to the inconvenience of this doctrine to the obligor, it is easily avoided ; he may g've notice of his equity in the public news-papers, or he may institute a suit against the obligee, which would be notice to the whole world, and would thereby render any subsequent assignee a. <em>lite pendente </em>purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\"><em>Wickham. </em>\u2014 It is admitted, that <em>in </em>equity, bonds were assignable before the Act of 1748 ; and that the equity originally attached to them, followed into the hands of an assignee. What then w&gt;as the object of this law ? Not to render bonds subjects of commercial negotiations, nor to make them an article of traffic. No merchant would purchase a bond, unless for usurious purposes, since they could never answer the end of transmitting money to a foreign country as bills of exchange do. The obvious intention of making bonds assignable was, to prevent circuity of action, and to do away the necessity of accompanying them with powers of attorney, as formerly. It enabled men more easily to settle with each other the debts which they respectively owed. A, being indebted to <em>B, </em>and <em>C, </em>to <em>A, </em>the assignment of <em>Cfs </em>bond, prevents the necessity of more than one suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-7\">But what I principally rely upon is, that the Act of Assembly, by allowing the obligor to avail himself of all just discounts against the obligee, as well as the assignee, before notice of the assignment, forms a most decided difference between the case of bonds, and bills of exchange. In the first place, it affords a complete answer to the inconvenience which is so much relied upon by the counsel for the appellee, if the assignee should .be compelled to make enquiry before he receives it, and which it is supposed, would tend to prevent their negotiability altogether. For since every shilling of the bond may have been paid, if the assignment be accepted without inquiry, as to that point, the assignee must suffer for his neglect. The Statute therefore, imposes it as a duty upon him, to make the inquiry, let the inconvenience be what it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>may; or if he do not, he acts at his peril What is to prevent him from extending his inquiries to other circumstances, respecting the validity of the bond ? When it is considered that this very law speaks also of bills of exchange, without making similar provision as to discounts, I cannot fail to deduce this principle from it 5 that the Legislature considered the two cases as entirely dissimilar, and by making bonds assignable, they did not thereby intend to regulate their negotiability by rules which, by the law of merchants, were applicable to bills of exchange. It is fair to contend, that if the case of an original objection to the bond, be not within the letter of this law, which per-mils discounts to be claimed, it is within the spirit and equity of the provision. If the obligor be suffered to defeat the assignee of a part of his claim, by proving that so much hath been discharged what should prevent him from a similar advantage, if instead of its having been discharged, it had never been justly due? It is not an unusual thing to consider cases which are not strictly within the letter of a Statute, to be within the equity of it. Thus the Act of Limitations does not literally apply to an <em>equitable </em>demand, since it speaks only of <em>actions known in Courts oj Law </em>; yet the Court of Chancery has adopted the Statute by analogy, because suits in that Court are equally within the equity of the Statute. If no good reason can be assigned for distinguishing between legal and equitable discounts, can it be supposed, that the Legislature intended a distinction ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">As to bills of exchange, they are in every respect different from bonds; and the principle which is contended for as applicable to them, may be supported by strong reasons. They are always remitted to foreign countries ; they there pass through many hands, and answer all the purposes of actual money. To subject them to legal, or to equitable discounts, would defeat their use entirely, and of course, they are protected, by the law of merchants, from all objections on the part of the drawer and indorsers, whether they be such as were originally attached to them, or such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>as might afterwards have arisen. The reason that notes in <em>England </em>are considered as being within the same principle, is, that the words of the Statute of <em>Ann </em>strongly assinsilate them to bills of exchange. But above all, there is no provision in that Statute, similar to that, which so evidently distinguishes the case of bonds from bills by our law, and which prevents a <em>construction </em>which could tend to assimilate them to each other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-9\">It is attempted to remedy the inconvenience which the obligor must labour under, if the principal contended for be correct, by saying that he may give notice of his equity in the public newspapers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-10\">But surely, this would seldom better the situation of purchasers ; it would seldom afford actual notice to any person ; and it would certainly never be considered as implied notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-11\">The rule that where equity is equal, he who has the law in his favour must prevail, is in general correct, but in this case, it is inapplicable. The equity is not equal, because it being the duty of the assignee to inform himself, whether the bond be justly due before he throws away his money, he can never be permitted to found an equity upon his own negligence. If he might have had notice, and ought to have sought it, he is as culpable as if he had actually obtained it. As to <em>JYorton, </em>the same charge is not imputable to him. It is necessary that there should be confidence between man and man. He was himself deceived by Anderson, and was of course a stranger to the injustice which had been done him. I admit, that it a trustee sell land without notice to a stranger, the rule is as it has been stated. But if, on the face of the deed, or from other circumstances, the purchaser might have ground to suspect that a trust existed, he would be chargeable v\\ ith the equity of the <em>cestui que trusty </em>on account of his neglect. The case of assignees of a bankrupt is more analogous to this than any which the opposite counsel has cited. The legal estate is vested in them by the assignment; they may bring suits in their own names ; and being generally, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>always creditors, they are assignees for valuable con? side'ration. Yet it will not be questioned, but that a debtor who has an equity against the bankrupt, may set it up against the assignees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-3\">Randolph, on the same side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-4\">I will not bottom the arguments which I shall use, upon the policy or convenience of extending, or of limiting the negotiability of bonds ; but at the same time, it will not be improper that this should be considered. We see that, whilst in <em>Great Britain, </em>notes of hand are made negotiable, it is not deemed a wise measure to render bonds so. The former were introduced for the purposes of internal commerce, and having been preceded by <em>Goldsmiths' </em>notes, which circulated like bills of exchange, it was thought wise to place notes of hand upon the same footing, and to assimilate them to the two former. But can it be supposed, that at the time when bonds were made assignable in this country, it was intended to increase the circulation of paper credit ? The very reverse was the policy which governed that country to whom we owed the liberty of passing laws. In the year 1705, notes of hand in <em>England, </em>assumed, by Legislative authority, the high ground upon- which they now stand. Yet the Assembly of <em>Virginia, </em>with that law before them, did not think proper to exalt bonds to the same station. And yet this law of our own country will answer all the beneficial purposes for which it was made, although our construction of it should be found to be accurate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">If the equity be subsequent in time to the creation of the bond, it is admitted, that it attaches itself to it, and accompanies the bond into the hands of an assignee. Suppose it to be coeval with the bond ; the <em>English </em>cases prove that the same consequences follow : Suppose <em>A </em>gives his bond to B, and <em>B </em>gives a like bond to <em>A: </em>though <em>A </em>shall assign the bond of <em>B </em>to a third person, yet would it be contended, that <em>B </em>might not oiler A*s bond as a discount, notwithstanding it was coeval with his ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">. The Legislature of 1786a revise this subject, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>pass a law similar to that of 1748 ; they still hold out protection to the obligor, against all just discounts which he can establish against the obligee, as well as against the assignee, and they again subject the latter to the necessity of inquiring into the nature of the debt which he is about to purchase. With a full knowledge, that bills of exchange were exempt from this clog, no disposition to assimilate the one to the other is to be discovered. Could language have expressed more decidedly the Legislative construction of the former law, and their present determination to distinguish these negotiable papers from each other ? They say, that the assignment of bonds, notes, &amp;c. <em>shall he valid; </em>meaning, that the assignee shall thereby gain a legal right to sue in his own name : and this was the sole object of the former, as well as of the latter law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-9\">But it is particularly worthy of observation, that though notes of hand, according to the Statute of <em>Ann, </em>were placed, upon the same ground with bills of exchange, and of course governed by the same rules, the Legislature of 1748, by assimilating them in every respect to bonds, rendered them unlike to bills of exchange in this country, and thereby gave a convincing proof, that it was not their intention to suffer bonds to be governed by those rules which applied to bills. And after such proofs of the Legislative mind, can the Court, by any principle of sound construction, suffer a case, which is so evidently within the spirit and meaning of the law, to be without the operation of it; or permit the obligor to avail himself of a discount against part of the debt, and yet leave him unprotected, if he set up a well founded objection to the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-10\">It may not be improper in me to mention, that a similar question with this has been determined by the Supreme Court of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>upon a law of that State, similar to the Statute of <em>Ann, </em>by which notes of hand were made assignable; but the strong words in that Statute, \u201c like to bills of exchange,\u201d were omitted in the Act of the <em>Pennsylvania </em>Legislature ; the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>determined, that the assignee of a note was chargeable with the equity originally attached to in <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Hughes' ex. </em>1 <em>Dall. Rep. </em>23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-3\">This case, though not authority here, still deserves our respect, as being the decision of the Supreme Court of a sister State, and as shewing the opinions entertained in other parts of the union respecting the former policy of this country, upon the subject of negotiable paper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-4\">If we ask, what have been the <em>British </em>decisions upon this subject \u2014 in cases of bonds, it is agreed on all hands, that the situation of the assignee is in no respect better than that of the obligee. <em>Turton </em>v. <em>Benson </em>is an express authority that the assignee is considered as standing in the shoes of the obligee, because, say the judges, it is his fault if he do not inquire into the validity of the bond, and the nature of the debt, before he takes the assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-5\">But it is insisted \u00bfhat the principle of that case is inapplicable to the present, because the assignment of a bond in <em>England </em>does not transfer a <em>legal right </em>to the money. It is obvious, that the distinction is not a sound one, for since by the rules of equity in that country, and by the laws of this, the assignee is expected to inquire into the nature of the debt before he obtains an assignment: his negligence in not making that inquiry forbids him in either case to say, that he has <em>equal equity </em>with tne obligor. Of course, the assignee\u2019s <em>legal right </em>will not avail him, since by his negligence he has deprived himself of that equity which would have counterbalanced the equity of the obligor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-6\">If this case be considered upon principle, independent of authority, nothing can be more clear, than that the rule laid down in <em>Turton </em>v. <em>Benson </em>is bottomed upon the soundest reason. For what could be more absurd or unjust, than that a bond, however fraudulently obtained, should acquire a binding quality by passing into the hands of an assignee, when at the moment of the assignment, it was invalid or ineffectual ? Even in the caite of a bill of exchange, (the peculiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>favourite of <em>British </em>Courts,) if it be drawn for a gaming, usurious consideration, it is void, as well in the hands of an indorsee, as in those of the original payee. And although in other instances, where the same principle of justice prevails, it is compelled to yield to reasons of policy founded in commercial considerations, yet, where those reasons do not apply, the principle can never be done away. If bonds be not essential to commercial negociations, as they certainly are not, there can be no reason for applying the same rules to them which prevail in cases of bills of exchange ; and if so, why should a bond which has been paid off, which was obtained by duress, or fraud, be more binding in the hands of the assignee, than it was previous to the assignment? In every point of view it seems clear, that not only <em>English </em>decisions, but the municipal regulations of our own country, favour the doctrine, that an original or subset \u00a1uent equity against a bond, follows it into the hands of an assignee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-9\">Washington, in reply. The principle, that where equity is equal, he who has gained a legal advantage must prevail, is admitted. But it is denied to be applicable for two reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-10\">1st. That the assignee has not equal equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-11\">2d. That under the equity of the Act of Assembly, the rule is in this case to be rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-12\">1st. The assignee it is said has not equal equity, because he is guilty of culpable negligence, in not in\u00bb quiring of the obligor before he takes the assignment, into the nature of the debt. This however is a <em>petitio principa. </em>That he is obliged to make the inquiry is proved by no case, except that of <em>Turton </em>v. Benson, which can only apply where, by the assignment, a <em>merely equitable </em>right passes. In such a case, the assignor can only dispose of a naked equity, and of course, the assignee can acquire no greater interest. If the former has not an equitable interest in him, he can dispose of none. The <em>posterior equity </em>of the assignee, unsupported by a <em>legal </em>right, cannot prevail against the <em>prior </em>and <em>equal equity </em>of the obligor. It is this, and not the neglect of the assignee which de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>feats his equity: in a case of that sort, the principle of <em>caveat emptor </em>applies in its full force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-4\">But why is not the indorsee of a bill of exchange obliged to inquire ? The answer is, that for the sake of commerce the law of merchants does not require it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">I must allow the entire credit of this reason to the counsel, since there is no case in which it is assigned as the cause of the decision. But if it were, it will apply with almost equal force to bonds. Though bills are used for the purposes of remittance, and are therefore <em>paid in foreign countries, </em>yet they are <em>drawn, </em>and generally <em>indorsed in this country; </em>so that, it will be as easy to inquire of the drawer in the one case, as of the obligor in the other, into the circumstances of the debt. But why should <em>inland bills </em>and <em>notes of hand </em>be governed by the same rule of law, when it must be admitted that the reason assigned as to foreign bills, cannot apply to these cases more than to bonds ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">It was observed by one of the Court, that the reason, for applying the rule I contend for to the case of bills of exchange, might be, that every indorser is considered as a new drawer 5 consequently, a new contract arises which might discharge the pre-existing equity. With submission, I cannot think that this will furnish a sufficient reason. If the <em>indorser </em>claimed an equity, it might be so; but surely, his assignment could not discharge the prior equity of the <em>drawer, </em>merely because that assignment created a new contract on the part of the indorser. The indorser is so far a new drawer, that he obliges himself to pay the amount of the bill, in case the drawee do not. But the <em>drawer </em>is not privy to this latter contract, and cannot therefore lose his prior rights, because the <em>indorsee </em>has gained a new security. I should rather suppose, that if this consideration could have any influence, the indorsee, having obtained additional security, will have less reason for defeating the equity of the drawer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">But why does the principle I am attempting to maintain, extend to other cases than the transfer of <em>choses in action ? </em>For example, an absolute conveyance by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>a trustee to a third person, without notice; a sale by a mortgagee, having an absolute conveyance, though in fact intended only as a security for money, to a stranger, without notice; a conveyance by the vendee of land, where the vendor has a <em>lien </em>upon it for. the consideration money; in these cases, the equitable rights of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>mortgagor, and vendor, are defeated, and yet the purchaser might have inquired, particularly in the two latter cases, of the mortgagor and vendor, if they had any equitable claims to the land. But this is not necessary; and yet in all those cases the grantee takes the land discharged of the equity, because, having acquired a legal title, and being a purchaser for valuable consideration and without notice, he must prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-9\">For what reason should the inquiry be made? The bond upon the face of it furnishes no cause for suspicion ; the obligor could but confirm by parol declarations, what he had before solemnly acknowledged under his hand and seal. Suppose the inquiry in this case had been made, and <em>Norton </em>had made parol declarations, similar to those expressed in the bond, he being still under the deception which his counsel impute to him: could he set up an after-discovered equity ? If he could, then the inquiry would be unavailing to the assignee; if otherwise,'then the obligor could not be benefited by it. The equity which the obligor may have, is always coeval with, or posterior to, the bond. If coeval with it, it is either then, or afterwards known to the obligor; if then known, it is a fraud upon the public to send into circulation a negotiable paper which may deceive others, and therefore every principle of Equity is stifled by the fraud; if not <em>known, </em>but <em>suspected, </em>the case is the same ; for then, the bond should express what is suspected, that third persons may not be imposed upon. In this case, Mr. <em>Norton </em>states in his bill that he knew of the credit, now made the ground-work of his application for relief in Equity, and insisted upon its being allowed ; but that he was deceived by <em>Anderson </em>into a belief that he was not entitled to it. Why then did he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>not reserve the right of claiming this credit, in case he should afterwards discover that he was entitled to it, and by a memorandum on the bond give notice to the world of this latent equity. The charge of neglect therefore is returned upon Mr. Norton, and his counsel very well know the influence it will have in defeating an equity. If the equity be neither known, nor suspected at the time the bond is given, then the principle which applies in all contests <em>de damno </em>evitando, must be resorted to: it is, that wherever one of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third, he who hath enabled such third person to occasion the loss, must sustain it. <em>Lickbarrow </em>v. <em>Mason, 2 Term </em>Rep. 63. As soon as the equity is discovered, the obligor should immediately give notice of it; this may easily be done in the public prints, or by suit. <em>Amb. </em>66. But the answer to this remedy is, that the bond may have been previously assigned; if so, then the inquiry would not have bettered the situation of the assignee, or of the obligor, for the latter must then have acknowledged what he had before done with more solemnity, that he knew of no equity against the bond: If not previously assigned, then the notice would prevent its transfer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-3\">On the other hand, the trouble and inconvenience of making the inquiry, and the difficulty of proving the re-acknowledgment, would put a stop to the negotiability of bonds, and would entirely defeat the intention of the law which made them assignable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-4\">It is contended, that it is essential that the parties to a bond should have confidence in each other. Be it so; but let it also be conceded, that he who places the confidence should take the consequence of having misplaced it, and not seek to throw it upon a third person who was not privy to the transaction. In commercial matters, confidence is peculiarly necessary; and yet this Court determined in the case of <em>Hooe Harrison </em>v. <em>Oxley </em>&amp;? <em>Hancock, {ante, </em>vol. i. p. 19,) that if an agent who is authorised to draw bills for special purposes, abuses the trust, and misapplies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>money, the principal who gave the confidence must suffer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-8\">It is said that the Statute of <em>Ann </em>assimilates notes to bills by the expressions it uses. It declares, that they <em>may be assigned like </em>bills, but it does not assimilate them in any of their consequences, or collateral points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-9\">It is then contended, 2dly, That this case is within the equity of the Act of Assembly, which, it is said, essentially distinguishes it from the cases which have been cited respecting bills, notes, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-10\">There is an apparent inconsistency in the arguments respecting this law. It is obstinately insisted upon, that the equity originally attached to a bond would follow it into the hands of an assignee, upon principles unaffected by this law; if so, why was this law made ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-11\">The Legislature, w hen engaged in the business of altering a general principle of law, are not to be supposed ignorant of the full extent of that principle. If, without legislative interference, the obligor could not have protected himself against an assignee even for actualpay<em>ments </em>made before notice of the assignment, (and that he could not, was evidently the sense of the Legislature, otherwise their interference was unnecessary,) much less could he set up an original, and concealed equity? for the former case an express provision is made. There is no ambiguity in the language of the proviso, nor is it even contended, that the case of an original equity comes strictly within it. But it is contended to be with the spirit of the proviso. There are cases, I admit, where it is justifiable to take liberties of this sort with the words which the Legislature uses: but there should be an apparent necessity for it, and I hold it to be always unwarrantable, if a reason for excluding the case which is sought to be constructively included, can be assigned. A little reflection will furnish a satisfactory reason for the discrimination between posterior discounts, and original equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-12\">In the first, the obligor has done what, by the terms of his contract, he had stipulated to perform. He has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>made partial payments, or has entirely discharged the debt; it was his duty to do this; and therefore, he who Is about to purchase, ought to suppose, that to have been'done, which the contract stipulated to be done; here, there is a cause of suspicion growing out of the Instrument itself, strong enough to prompt an inquiry, and if the assignee be hardy enough to calculate against this reasonable presumption in consequence of the confidence he may repose in the obligor, it is perhaps not improper to leave him to his recourse against the person who has deceived him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-3\">But it is far otherwise with respect to an original equity. To presume that the debt was never due would be to form a conclusion against the words of the contract itself, which import the contrary. The obligor has declared the debt to be due, and that he will pay. This solemn acknowledgment of its justice, he has confirmed with his\u201dsignature and seal. If It were not due, he would not, and certainly ought not, to have obliged himself to pay it, and that too in a manner calculated to deceive those who trust in this declaration. It is not enough to say that he was ignorant of the objections to the claim at the time he gave the bond, or was imposed upon by the obligee; It was his duty to investigate the subject, before he sent forth a negotiable paper, which, in every change it underwent, possessed the power of deceiving, and of injuring fair purchasers. In this case the assignee could have no cause to suspect an original equity contrary to the express letter of the contract. To inquire of the obligor, if he meant the reverse of what he has declared, would be an absurdity which the Legislature could never mean to require of the asssignee. The difference between discounts, and an original equity. Is this; in the first, the assignee purchases upon the faith of the <em>obligee, </em>since nothing but his assurances could repel the natural conclusion, that payment had been made; In the latter, he purchases upon the faith of the <em>obligor, </em>that the debt was due when the bond was executed, because he has said so, and that In the most solemn manner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The Legislature therefore, were influenced by the strongest motives to make the discrimination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-9\">If the Legislature state a particular case, and might by apt language have expressed themselves <em>generally, </em>if they had meant to do so, it is too much like legislating for the Court to make a construction broader than the words which are used will warrant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-10\">If an original equity had been intended, the proviso would have permitted the obligor, \u201c to make any defence in law or equity, which he might have made, in case no assignment had been made;\u201d and it is contended that the Court should construe the word <em>discount </em>so as to mean the same thing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-11\">It is said, that the Act of Limitations, though it does not extend to the Courts of Equity in express terms, is nevertheless adopted by analogy. This is true; and I do not object to Courts of Equity permitting the obligor to avail himself of discounts against the assignee, in the same manner as he might at law; what I contend is, that neither Courts of Law, nor of Equity, can <em>exteitd </em>the construction of the proviso beyond the fair meaning of it. The Act of Limitations is restricted, or rather <em>disregarded </em>in Equity in many cases; but it is never <em>extended beyond the periods prescribed by the lazo.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-12\">No two cases can be more unlike than this, and the case of assignees of a bankrupt; in the latter case, the assignees are merely <em>trustees, </em>and are no more entitled to avoid an equity against the bankrupt, than the bankrupt himself would have been.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-12\"> <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Moriis, (post, </em>p. 255,) was first argued, and one of the points discussed in that cause involving the only question in <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>the latter was brought on before a decision was given in the former.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b324-13\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0Z\">There are some points in this cause, which are not controverted by either side. It is admitted, that upon the principles of the common law, a <em>chose in action </em>is not assignable; that is, the assignment does not give to the assignee a right to maintain an action in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">It is also conceded, that in <em>England </em>the assignee of a bond takes it charged with every species of equity which was attached to it in the hands of the obligee. If a different principle prevail in this country, it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>grow out of the Acts of Assembly, which authorised the assignment of bonds. The Acts of 1730 and , 1748, upon this subject, are precisely the same as to the present question. I should have been glad to have seen the Act of 1705, but I have not been able to meet with it. This case depends upon the just construction of the Act of 1748. The intention of it was to alter the common law, so far as it prevented bonds from being assigned, and to give to the assignee a right to sue in his own name, in the same manner as the obligee might have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">It was not intended to abridge the rights of the obligor, or to enlarge those of the assignee, beyond that of suing in his own name; and since it is clear, that prior to this law, an original equity attached to the bond, followed it into the hands of the assignee, this law does not expressly, nor by implication, destroy that principle. Notes of hand are now assignable in <em>England, </em>and it is admitted that the assignee is discharged of any equity which existed against the assignor, unless the note was given for an usurious, or for a gaming consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The reason of this, is not that the principle attached to them is a <em>legal consequence of their being made assignable, </em>but because this rule for <em>commercialpurposes </em>applied to <em>bills of exchange, </em>and the Statute of Ann, declaring notes assignable, <em>in like manner as bills of exchange, </em>showed an intention, as it was supposed, to render the former as highly negotiable, and as current in <em>internal </em>as the latter was in <em>external commerce. </em>The Act of our Assembly embraces equally the subject of bonds and notes, but contains no expressions tending to induce a belief, that the making them assignable, was intended for purposes of commerce. The design certainly was, to make them transferable to a certain extent; the provision points out the limits of their negotiability, and fixes a strong mark of distinction between them and bills of exchange. As to the latter, they were always assignable, and the indorsement transferred a legal right to the indorsee. They did not owe this quality to statutary provisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and of course they continued within that principle , which-had attached to them, and of which they were not deprived by any Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>lays it down in the case of <em>Peacock </em>v. <em>Rhodes, Dougl. </em>636, \u201c that the holder of. a bill of exchange, or promissory note, is not to be considered in the light of an assignee of the payee. An assignee must take the thing assigned, subject to all the equity <em>to </em>which the original party was subject: if this rule applied to bills and promissory note.-, it would stop their currency. So in <em>Cunningham's Law of Bills of </em>Exchange, p. 65, the <em>Chancellor </em>refused to relieve against the assignee of a hill, \u201c because it would tend to destroy trade, which is carried on every where by bills of exchange, and he would not lessen an honest creditor\u2019s security.\u201d And we are informed by <em>Domat, </em>131, <em>Tit. </em>16, \u00a7 4, p. 231, that the covenant which passes between the person who gives the money, and him who undertakes to remit it to another place, hath in it some particular characters which distinguish it from other kinds of covenants, that seem to have some resemblance to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">It is therefore, not because the indorsee is an assignee of the <em>legal </em>right to such bills and promissory notes, that the equity is barred by the indorsement, but because of their quality as a <em>currency, </em>and from the necessity of adopting such a principle for the convenience of trade and commerce with respect to such ; currency. But bonds are not to be considered as a '\u00a1currency, and within the reason of the principle laid down in <em>Peacock v.Rhodes, </em>for that principle is founded uponcommercial considerations altogether,and notupon a distinction between <em>legal </em>and <em>equitable </em>assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">With respect to the proviso in the Act of 1748, it contemplates <em>legal discounts </em>only. The words, \u201c the plaintiff shall allow <em>all discounts </em>which the defendant can prove,\u201d were meant to extend those discounts beyond the credits which might be indorsed on the bond; and the latter words, \u201cbefore notice of such assignment was given to the defendant,\u201d were meant to restrain the discounts to such as existed prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>notice of the assignment. This enlarging and restraining proviso was necessary, in order to express dearly the meaning of the Legislature j but neither the proviso, nor any other part of this Act, was intended to <em>extend </em>to, or to <em>abridge equitable discounts, </em>which were not in the contemplation of the Legislature who made this law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">The inconvenience which it is apprehended will result from rejecting the application of the principle contended for, is certainly not real, or if it be, it was not so considered by the Legislature. The assignee, it is admitted, takes the bond at his peril, so far at least as the possible claim of the obligor to discounts ma}<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, extend. If he choose not to encounter this risk, or to repose entire confidence in the obligee, lie must inquire of the obligor, and from him obtain' information, respecting (at least) this part of the subject. With the same convenience, may the inquiry extend to any equitable objections attached to the bond. The two cases are precisely within the same reason, and I can discover no principle of policy or justice which should so widely distinguish them. The assignee of a note given by an infant, <em>feme </em>covert, or for a gaming, or usurious consideration, does not take it discharged of those objections, but the contrary. In those cases, as well as in respect of discounts, he must take care what he purchases; he acts at his peril, and must therefore act with caution. For what reason, then, shall an equity, originally incorporated with the bond, and which should destroy its obligation, be discharged in the hands of an assignee ? The provision of this Act has long governed the assignmentof bonds, and it is but of late years that the existence of such a principle as has been contended for in this cause has been thought of as applicable to bonds and notes. This consideration, though it would not direct, has much weight in confirming the opinion which I clearly entertain upon this subject. The appellee may suffer in consequence of it; but this is preferable to the establishment of a principle, which may produce great public mischief and injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"AEOP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Although I am clear in the opinion, that an equity existing against a bond, is not lost or extinguished by assignment for valuable consideration and without notice,- yet it may be lost by length of time or other circumstances. In this case however it does not appear <em>when </em>the deception practised by <em>Anderson </em>was found out by <em>Norton, </em>or that <em>Norton </em>delayed an unreasonable length of time in coming forward to assert - his equity. It is true, that his interest in the goods sold by <em>Harris </em>is not established in the proof, but the ground of the <em>Chancellor\u2019s </em>decree being wrong, it must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings, so as to let in Mr. <em>Norton </em>to the proof of his equity. The decree, so far as it respects the order on <em>Nicholas, </em>with reference to the present appellee, I think is right.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq98\">Carrington J. \u2014 To consider this case upon general principles ; the question is, whether an equity, originally attached to a bond, follows it into the hands of an assignee without notice. In <em>England, </em>notes of hand were not assignable, until the 3d and 4th ,of <em>Queen Ann, </em>so as to enable the assignee to bring a suit at law in his own name. Courts of Equity were of course resorted to, where the maker of the note was not precluded from setting up any equitable defence which he might have. Frequent attempts were made by the bankers and traders to bring them within the custom of merchants, and to place them upon the same footing of negotiability with bills of exchange. But the judges still considered them merely as evidences of debt. At length, the Statute was procured, conformably with the wishes of the trading part of the community, making them assignable, <em>in like manner as bills of exchange. </em>The likeness thus strongly sanctioned by Legislative authority, produced similar decisions in cases where their negotiability were concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">But no efforts were made in favour of bonds, and they remain in the same situation <em>in </em>England, as they stood at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>This country was then a part of the <em>British </em>Empire, and our Legislature assimilated its laws to those of the mother country, so far as our local situation and state of society authorised it. In 1705, shortly after the <em>English </em>Statute passed respecting notes of hand, the Assembly passed a law, authorising the asssignment of bonds and notes. This law, I cannot meet with, .but it was repealed by proclamation in 1730, and in the same year, another law was enacted, exactly similar to the Act of 1748. With the <em>English </em>Statute before their eyes, the Legislature did not choose to adopt it altogether, or to introduce into it a principle which should defeat the equity of the obligor, as it was secured to him at common law. Those expressions in the Statute which assimilated notes to bills of exchange were omitted in our law, and, in the room of them, others were introduced, which established an opposing principle. The negotiability of bonds and notes was qualified and restricted within bounds consistent with the commercial station of this country. There was no necessity for exalting those kinds of paper to the high ground on which the commercial world had placed bills of exchange, and the whole complexion of the latv shews, that it. was intended to be avoided. The doctrine which has been stated and relied upon, as applicable to foreign bills of exchange, is consequently inapplicable to the present discussion. These considerations have produced conclusions in the public mind, as to the construction of the law in question, the very reverse of what has been contended for by the counsel for the appellee. I should be unwilling tb unsettle these long formed opinions, unless the expressions of the law rendered it absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">Tha't a bond fraudulent and void in its creation, cannot be cleansed of its impurity, and rendered valid by assignment, is settled by- the case of <em>Turton </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>and has uniformly been so decided in the Courts of this country. \u00d1o man can, by the mere act of assignment, transfer a greater interest than he. holds ; dispose of an interest where he has nothing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>or make good and valid, that which was originally vicious and void. In this .enlightened age, former decisions are rejected, and a new mode of attaining justice is discovered. But is it true, that the means are adequate to the object <em>? </em>It is urged, as a reason for the rejection of former opinions upon this subject, that they tended to impose deceptions upon the public, and to cramp commerce, by destroying the negotiability of bonds and notes. As it strikes me, they rather tend to prevent, than to countenance those frauds, and if the other consequences will follow, it is preferable to sacrificing a majority of the public, to the avarice and injustice of a few. But I cannot perceive, how commerce, or that sort of it which is most useful to society, can be injured. That their negotiability will be restrained I admit, but they will answer the purposes for which the law intended them, by. facilitating the collection of debts, and thereby affording a convenient, and desirable accommodation to the people of this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The case now under consideration comes fully within those principles which seem to me correct. <em>Norton </em>and <em>Anderson </em>were concerned together in trade, and upon a settlement of accounts, <em>Norton </em>claimed a credit for the proceeds of a quantity of goods in the hands of <em>Harris. </em>But <em>Harris assuring </em>him that he had received no part of those proceeds, Norton, unsuspicious of the truth, gave his bond for the balance as it stood. <em>Rose, </em>it is admitted, was a fair <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the bond. He is chargeable only with neglect; he might and ought to have satisfied himself that the debt was justly due before he received it. If, upon an inquiry, <em>Norton </em>had assented to the payment, or acknowledged he had no objections to it, this would have deprived him of his equity against <em>Rose. </em>It was easy for any person wishing to take an assignment of the bond, to make the inquiry ; they would know at once, where to make the application. On the other hand, <em>Norton </em>could not give a special notice to the person who was about to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>obtain it, and the public papers would afford a very uncertain channel of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\">Upon the whole, I am clear that the decree is erroneous and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Lyons J. \u2014 This has been truly said to be a cause of considerable importance, on account of the precedent to be established. In order to discover the legislative intention when the Act of 1730, (of which that of 1748 is an exact copy, as to this question,) was passed, and to comprehend more clearly the consequences of the construction contended for by the appellee, I shall consider this case as if it had been to be decided upon at that time. If <em>Norton </em>had given this bond before assignments were sanctioned by legislative authority, it is admitted on all hands, that his equity would have followed the bond into the hands of an assignee. If so, is it possible that the Legislature could have meditated so much injustice, as to ex-, elude him from setting up an objection to the debtj which, but for the law, he might have made ? Could; it mean to protect fraud, and to give validity to an instrument which was originally void and founded in deception ? Whatever would then have been the construction of the law, must be the construction of it at this day. I mention this to shew that the Legislature, by making bonds assignable, did not thereby mean to deprive the obligors of any equitable objections, which they might have to them. Until this Act passed, bonds were not assignable. Bills of exchange could not answer the purposes of internal negotiation, between the planters and the merchants; the former, from their situation, were under a necessity of having credit from the latter, and to secure this, it w\u2019as deemed proper to make bonds assignable, by which means, the factors, who often took them in their own names, were enabled to pass them away in the purchase of commodities, or might, when necessary, transfer them over to their principals. This history of bonds will evince, that as there was no necessity, so it never could have been the legislative intention to give to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>them all the high privileges attached to bills of ex- - change, and particularly that which has been contended for by the appellee. Independent of this, the law, upon the face of it, repels a construction, calculated to deprive the obligor of his equitable objections. It <em>saves to him the right </em>of opposing the claim by all <em>Just discounts </em>which he can make, and consequently could not mean to <em>deprive </em>him of an equity, strong enough to invalidate the whole claim. The law, so far from being designed to grant favours <em>to the as</em>signee, is calculated to protect the <em>obligor; </em>the .former, is obliged to admit all discounts against the obligee, and at his peril to give notice of the assignment, under the penalty of being bound by payments made, after the obligee has parted with his right to receive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The accuracy of the principle laid down by the appellee\u2019s counsel is not questioned; its application to this case is. For since it is admitted, that if the law had not permitted the assignment of bonds, an equity existing against the'obligee would have accompanied the bond into the hands of an assignee, the single inquiry which remains is, does the law take away this ! right, previously possessed by the obligor ? I have endeavoured to shew, that so far from doing this, the law itself displays a careful attention to the rights and interest of the obligor.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The arguments which were used to assimilate this to the case of a bill of exchange and promissory note, are totally without foundation. The reason of the law, as applicable to those cases, is not founded upon the principle stated by the counsel for the appellee, but upon considerations altogether of a commercial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Upon the whole, I concur in opinion with the other Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">The opinion and decree of the Court, was entered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">\u201c The Court is of opinion, that an assignee of a bond or obligation, takes the same, subject to all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>equity of the obligor, and that the appellant ought to t'e allowed to set off and discount against the debt claimed by the appellee as assignee of <em>George Anderson, </em>the other defendant in the decree named, any equitable demand respecting the said debt, which' he had a right to claim from the said <em>George </em>Anderson, the original obligee.\u201d ' Decree reversed with costs, and the caufce remanded to the High Court of Chancery for further proceedings to be had therein, according to the principles of this decree.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-3\">(1) <em>Woodson et al </em>v. <em>Barrett &amp; Co.
