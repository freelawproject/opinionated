That the breach laid in the declaration was not well assigned, inasmuch as it did not state the amount of the revenue tax for which the sheriff was in arrear. That there is a class of cases which say, that the assignment of a breach in the words of the condition is sufficient, I shall not deny; but these are cases in which the party is to do some particular \u00e1ct, which is specified with sufficient certainly in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-10\">This is not like the case of a <em>general </em>agency, where it may often be difficult to state with precision the sums collected by the agent, and not accounted fon The amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>of <em>the </em>'revenue tax was known to the officers of government. The Auditor knew to a single cent the sum in which the sheriff was in arrear, and filed his account accordingly. If no account had been exhibited to the General Court, a judgment could not have been recovered. If it was necessary to exhibit an account stating the sum due from the sheriff, it was equally necessary to state it in the declaration. [To prove the necessity of assigning breaches <em>specially, </em>Mr. <em>Wickham </em>referred to the cases of <em>Cornwallis </em>v. <em>Savory,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Williams.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-4\">The condition of an executor\u2019s bond is as general as that of a <em>sheriff; yet </em>surely it will not be contended that a general assignment in the words of the condition would be sufficient. It would be necessary to state whether the breach was for the non-payment of debts or legacies, or the not returning an inventory, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-10\">[Judge Tucker, wished to be satisfied how advantage could be taken of the generality of the assignment of a breach, when there was neither an appearance, nor demurrer.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-11\"><em>Wickham. , </em>'l ids is a <em>substantial </em>defect. 1 have always understood it to be a general rule of law, that defects which go to the <em>merits, </em>may be taken advantage of at any time. Matters of <em>form </em>are cured by the act of <em>jeofailsf </em>but not matters of <em>substance.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-12\">In these cases, the breaches were assigned for failing to <em>account, </em>and failing to <em>pay. </em>According to a well-known rule of practice, it; is presumable that damages were given for failing to <em>pay; </em>and the declaration should have slated <em>hozo much </em>the sheriff was <em>bound to pay, </em>for the information of his sureties and representatives. This was the very <em>gist </em>of the action; and the damages being given, as well for the breach well assigned, in failing to <em>account, </em>as for that badly assigned, in failing to <em>pay, </em>the judgment cannot be sustained. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>2. The writ of inquiry was prematurely executed. This point is clear, not only from the words of the act of Assembly, but from the regular entry in all such cases when the record is fully drawn up. On the confirmation of the office judgment at the rules in September, 1805, the entry is, that the plaintiff should recover judgment for the debt in the declaration mentioned \u201c to be discharged by the \u201c payment of such damages as the plaintiff hath sustained \u201c by occasion of the defendant\u2019s breach of the condition of \u201c the writing obligatory in the declaration mentioned, as- \u201c signed by the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth, \u201c and the costs; which damages were to be inquired of by \u201c a Jury at the next Court, <em>in case the defendants then </em>\u201c <em>failed to appear and plead to issue.\u201d </em>According to this entry, which is in strict conformity with the law, the defendants had the <em>whole </em>of the next Court to appear and plead to issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-8\">But the act of Assembly is equally explicit. The rules and proceedings in the General Court, in all cases not otherwise specially directed, are to be the same as in the District Courts in similar cases.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> By the District Court law, <em>Rev. </em>Code, vol. 1. c. 66. s. 42. p. 80. it is declared, that all judgments by default obtained in the office, and not set aside <em>on some day of the next succeeding District </em>Court, shall be entered by the clerk, <em>as of the last day of the </em>term* which shall be final in actions of debt founded on any specialty, bill or note in writing ascertaining the demand, unless the plaintiff shall choose in any such case to have <em>a xvrit of inquiry of damages; </em>and, in all other cases, the damages shall be ascertained by a Jury, to be impanelled and sworn to inquire thereof, <em>as therein after directed. </em>The next section (43. p. 81.) shews how a writ of inquiry is to be executed. Before every Court, the clerk is to enter in a particular docket, all such causes (and those only) in which an issue is to be tried, or an inquiry of damages to b\u00e9 made, &amp;c. The writ of inquiry is to be docketed <em>before the Court </em>at which it is to be executed; but, as it is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>be <em>entered as of the last day of the term </em>next succeeding the judgment by default obtained in the office, those only can be docketed for trial, which were entered on the last <em>day </em>of the preceding term. How is it possible to execute a writ of inquiry at the same term, when it is considered as awarded on the <em>last day. </em>Suppose the defendants had come, on the <em>last moment of the last day </em>of the term, and offered to set aside the writ of inquiry and plead to issue: surely they would have had a right to do so. How could it then, with propriety, be executed before, when the party had till <em>that moment </em>to set it aside ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-7\">There is an important difference between the <em>old General Court </em>law, and the <em>present District Court </em>law. In the former, judgments by default were to be signed by the clerk in his office, <em>as of the preceding </em>Court, and writs of inquiry might be tried at the succeeding term,- on giving notice to the defendant, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But in the latter, they are to be entered as of the <em>last day </em>of the succeeding term, if not set aside during the term. Again, by the old General Court Law, the defendant was only allowed till the <em>eighth </em>day of the term to set aside an office judgment ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> but, tinder the present District Court Law, he has the <em>whole </em>term. In a subsequent law regulating the practice of the General Court,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> \u00e1ll judgments by default, obtained in the office, and not set aside on the <em>eighth </em>day of the succeeding term, were to be entered <em>as of that day. </em>So that, after the <em>eighth </em>day, there could be no ground of complaint, if the writ 'of inquiry were executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-8\">Another argument which may be urged, is, that it is the uniform practice of the District Courts never to try writs of inquiry at the next term succeeding the confirmation of the office judgment at the rules.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-9\">In some County Courts, indeed, a different practice may prevail. But this can only relate to <em>issues </em>which are made up during the term, by setting aside the office judgment. The County Court Law (in which respect it differs from that concerning the District Courts) directs that all office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>judgments so set aside shall be <em>immediately put at the end of the issue docket.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This, in the opinion of the County Courts, may confer the power to try them the same term. Whether this practice be correct or not, it is unnecessary to inquire in the present <em>case; </em>as it is clear that the General Court and District Courts have no such power. The case of <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Mandeville,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>being that of an <em>issue in the County </em>Court, has no bearing upon the present question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-10\">These objections are common to both cases, but there are others peculiar to each.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-11\">3. In the case of <em>Little\u2019s </em>administrators, there is a variance between- the bond declared on, and that given in evidence. The declai'ation charges a bond dated the 10th of November, 1802, when in truth it bears date on the 10th of <em>November, </em>1801. Although in the record sent up by <em>certiorari, </em>there is neither <em>writ </em>nor <em>bond, </em>yet I contend, that, where there is a judgment by default, they are <em>both </em>necessarily a part of the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-12\">Observe the consequence of <em>not </em>considering the <em>writ </em>a part of the <em>record.' </em>A man owes a debt of <em>ten </em>thousand pounds; he is sued upon it, and makes no defence because he knows it is justly due. But the plaintiff declares against him for <em>one hundred </em>thousand pounds, or files a declaration in trespass, <em>assaidt and battery. </em>If the writ be no part of the record, the defendant may be condemned in a sum, or in an action, without the possibility of redress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-13\">The <em>bond </em>is an essential part of the record, because the clerk is to enter up judgment for principal, interest, and costs. How can he do this without a reference to the bond ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-14\"><em>4. </em>An objection which applies peculiarly to the assignment of breaches in the case of <em>Craghill and </em>others, is, that it is said <em>they </em>(the securities) broke tire condition, in this, that <em>Little </em>(himself) did not well and truly collect, account for and pay all the taxes imposed by law in the County of <em>Jefferson.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The Attorney-General, for the Commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeVu\">said, that he did not understand Mr. <em>Wickham </em>as controverting the general doctrine, <em>that an assignment of the breach in the -words of the condition was sufficient, </em>but only as attempting to shew that the case of a sheriff was an exception. No difference could be perceived between this and the class of cases to which Mr. <em>Wickham </em>alluded. The following are relied on: <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Field and others,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Salman </em>v. <em>Bradshaw,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> Proctor </em>v. <em>Burnet,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Hughes v. Richman;</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>all decided in the Courts of England.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaeX\">But after the decision of this Court in the case of <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>Governor, &amp;c.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> upon an elaborate argument, and a full review of all the British authorities, there can be no doubt on this point. The law must be considered as forever settled. If this be not a binding authority, there can be no end to litigation. In that case, this very exception was taken, and was made a point in the petition for a <em>supersedeas ; </em>but, after the case had been solemnly argued, the objection was overruled, and the judgment sustained.<footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>In point of reason there can be no necessity for stating, in the declaration, the amount of the taxes for which the sheriff is in arrear. Every sheriff has access to the commissioners\u2019 books in his county, and to the Auditor\u2019s office <em>; </em>and must be presumed to know the amount of the Commonwealth\u2019s claim against him. In <em>Winston </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court recognizes the distinction between public and private claims, and the facility with which public debtors may know the amount due from them to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-8\">Another objection to the assignment of the breach, is that it is <em>double ; </em>for failing to <em>account, </em>and failing to <em>pay. </em>But this only conforms to the law, which says, the sheriff <em>shall account </em>and <em>pay. </em>It was. incumbent on the <em>Commonwealth </em>to shew that he had not accounted and paid. He could not pay without accounting ; because it was one entire act. No inconvenience could result from this practice; the Auditor must produce his books, which are made evidence against the sheriffs, and which always shew in what sum a sheriff has failed to account and pay ; and, in the spirit of the statute of Jeofails, the Court will presume that every thing was proven which was necessary to found the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-9\">The next point is, that the writ of inquiry was prematurely executed. The law has been correctly stated that the practice of the General Court shall conform to that of the District Courts ; but the fair construction of all the laws is, that writs of inquiry may be executed at the next term after they are awarded in the clerk\u2019s office. The office judgment becomes final at the next term, unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>defendant relieves himself by pleading to issue. Where the plaintiff chooses to have a jury sworn to inquire of damages, the law expressly authorises him to do so.; and there is nothing in the law to prevent him from doing it the same day. In this case a writ of inquiry was necessarily awarded, because the writ was on a bond with collateral condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-4\">But the case of <em>Mandeville </em>v. Mandeville<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> is conclusive authority, in this case. It is said, however, that that case was decided under the County Court law, which directs that all office judgments set aside during the term shall be immediately put at the end of the issue docket.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> But the law does not say they shall be <em>tried ; </em>nor is there any clause in the District Court law, which <em>forbids </em>the trial of a writ of inquiry at the same term. The County Court law<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> provides that the proceedings of the County Courts, <em>on the law </em>side, shall conform to the practice of the District Courts. <em>This Court </em>has already decided that the trial of a new issue, at the same term, in the County Court, is correct; and the <em>Legislature </em>has said that the practice of the two Courts shall conform.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-5\">As to the variance between the declaration and bond, in the case of <em>Little\u2019s </em>administrators, it is now too late to object. Advantage might have been taken of it at the trial, by objecting to the bond\u2019s going in evidence to the Jury. But no <em>oyer </em>having been taken, neither the writ nor bond is any part of the record, <footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-21\">It is said by Mr. Wickham, that the writ is necessarily a part of the record, in all cases where there is a judgment by <em>default. </em>The reason of this distinction between judgments by default, and where there is an appearance, cannot easily be perceived. On executing the writ of inquiry the plaintiff must <em>prove </em>his demand; and this Court will presume that the Court below did right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-22\">But, even if it were necessary to consider the bond a part of the record, where the judgment becomes final after an office judgment, and the clerk issues the execution without the intervention of a Jury, as in cases of debt for the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ment of money simply, the same reason would not apply to bonds with a <em>collateral condition ; </em>because there must always.be a trial before a Court and Jury, and the bond must be given in evidence to prove the demand.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-7\"><em>Wickham </em>said,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4I\">that he considered the second point made by him, that of prematurely executing the writ of inquiry, so conclusive, that it would be an unnecessary consumption of the time of the Court, to reply to the various arguments of the <em>Attorney-General </em>on the other points. He would, therefore submit the causes.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> 2 <em>Burr 772.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"><em> </em>Doug. 214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> <em>Rev.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b472-9\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"A-D7\">The errors assigned are, 1. That the breach is too general. The breach assigned in the case of <em>Merriwether </em>v. Johnson, was equally so, <em>3 </em>Call, 524. And in <em>Branch </em>v. Randolph, Governor, &amp;c. <em>October </em>term, 1805, (MS.) the breach is nearly in the same words as in the present declaration. Yet both those cases were affirmed.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">2. Another error assigned is, that there is a variance between the declaration and the bond, but this' does not appear. <em>Oyer </em>of the bond was not prayed; the variance might have been pleaded, or objected to on the trial. <em>After </em>a verdict, it would be too late to take adyantage of it; for though a bond is necessarily a part of the record, in many cases where the condition is for the payment of <em>moneys </em>because the judgment must be entered up according to the condition; yet, it does not appear to be equally necessary that bonds <em>with collateral </em>condition, shouldbe so considered. If any advantage can be derived to the defendant from its tenor, he must spread it upon the record, either by <em>oyer </em>or by a demurrer to evidence, or by a bill of exceptions; or lastly by a special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">3. Another point not noticed in the argument occurred to me .in reading it; no damages ar\u00e9 laid in the declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>against <em>Little\u2019s </em>administrators. It is not necessary to lay damages in the declaration in an action of debt.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Hook </em>v. <em>Turnbull, May, </em>1806, I gave it as my opinon that the writ is to be considered as a part of the record, for the purposes of <em>amendment. </em>From my note of that case there was no difference of opinion upon that point; the <em>declaration </em>may then be amended by the writ, and that omission cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">In addition to tbe errors above mentioned, it was said that in the case of <em>Craghill and others </em>the <em>declaration </em>was erroneous, in that it charged the defendants, who were only securities, with a breach of a condition of their bond, for that Little, (tlic <em>pincipal, </em>in the bond,) had not accounted for, and paid the taxes. How this might have been upon a <em>special demurrer, </em>where the want of a due observance of grammatical or technical precision might have been assigned as error, I need not say. But, at present, I conceive the objection unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">There is, however, one error, common to both these cases, which I consider as <em>important. </em>From the most attentive examination of the act of Assembly, <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> I am fully satisfied that a writ of inquiry ought not to be <em>executed </em>in the General Court, or District Courts, at the term next succeeding the rule day on which the office judgment is confirmed. Because the defendant has the whole of the <em>next </em>succeeding term to set aside that office judgment, and plead to issue, if he chooses so to do. Upon this ground, I think the judgment erroneous, and, therefore, that it must be reversed, the finding of the Jury upon the writ of inquiry set aside, and the cause remanded to the General Court to be there proceeded in, as if the writ of inquiry had never been executed, and the cause had still remained on the docket in that Court.</p>\n<author id=\"b473-11\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"A62\">The case of <em>Branch </em>v. <em>The Common</em>wealth, (MS. October, 1805,) which was much argued upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the very point, seems conclusive that the breach in this case *s we^- assigned. But the General Court, I think, erred in executing the writ of inquiry at the term in which it was done : the party should have had the <em>-whole </em>term to set aside that judgment and plead to issue. This seems so plain upon the several acts relating to the subject, that I shall content myself with referring to the exposition thereof made by the appellants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">As to a variance, in the case of securities, in relation to the <em>date </em>of the bond, I can see none. In the case \"of the securities, the recovery is upon a bond executed in <em>Novem</em>ber, 1801, for the taxes of 1801; and in that of the <em>administrators, </em>it is upon a bond of <em>November, </em>1802, for the taxes of that year. This variance cannot be made out, unless you take for granted, that the bond referred to in the case of the administrators, is the bond upon which the other judgment was also rendered; but I will rather take it that there were <em>two </em>bonds for the two years, aud <em>that one of </em>these judgments is founded on <em>one, </em>and the other on the <em>other. </em>There is nothing in the record which forbids this pi-esumption, and the objection would not perhaps have occurred, had not the two cases been brought on and submitted, together.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">On the ground of prematurely executing the writ of inquiry, I am of opinion that the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AJi\">Judge Fleming said, it was the unanimous opinion of the Court (absent Judge Lyons) that the judgments in both cases should be reversed, on the ground of prematurely Executing the writs of inquiry.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\"><em> </em>See <em>Branch v. the Commonwealth, </em>2 <em>Call, </em>510.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">a) Per Lyons, J. 2 <em>Wash. </em>212. <em>Stevens </em>v.
