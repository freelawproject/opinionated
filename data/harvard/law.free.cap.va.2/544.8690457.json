Fletcher </em>and <em>Richard C. Pollard, </em>stating that a copartnery had existed between himself and the defendants under the firm of <em>Fletcher and Pollard} </em>that he was a creditor partner to a considerable amount; that <em>Fletcher </em>undertook to keep the books in a regular and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>mercantile maimer, which had not been done, inasmuch as there were various entries in them in which the sums had not been extended; that <em>Fletcher </em>had executed a deed of trust on a tract of land and sundry slaves to indemnify the complainant for his advances to the copartnery; and had assured the complainant, during the progress of the business, that it was a profitable one ; notwithstanding which the company were involved in debt and perplexed with law-suits, which a proper attention, on the part of the said <em>Fletcher </em>might have prevented. The object of the bill was for an account, and to subject to sale the property conveyed in trust by <em>Fletcher </em>as an indemnity to the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-3\">. The answer of the defendant <em>Richard C. Pollard </em>was a mere echo of the complainant\u2019s bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-4\">Fletcher, in his answer, denied that he had undertaken to keep the books, or that it was more obligatory on him than the other defendant, or the assistants in the store; that he did not know of any loss which had been sustained by blank entries in the books; and expressly denies that any debts had been lost through his neglect. ' He admits, that during the copartnery he told the complainant they were making money because they sold their goods at a high advance, but avers, that the losses afterwards sustained arose from circumstances over which he had no controul; for being compelled, for the re-establishment of his own health and that of his family, to leave the place at which their store was kept, the other defendant, <em>on whom the whole business </em>devolved, advertised the goods for sale \u2022at public auction, and did not even attend the sale himself, having previously thereto gone to the Western Country on business of his own and of the complainant; and that the goods were sold much below cost; that he has paid large sums of money since the dissolution of the partnership without the assistance of the complainant or the other defendant, although he holds the complainant\u2019s obligation to exonerate him from more than one-third of the debts; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>and that he has always been willing to come to a settlement ^le accounts, which had hitherto been prevented by the non-attendance of the other partners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AB3N\">The cause being set down for hearing, the following entry was made: \u201c Pursuant to an agreement in writing \u201c between the plaintiff and the defendant <em>Thomas C. </em>\u201c Fletcher, filed with the papers in the cause, the Court \u201c\u25a0 doth refer all matters in difference between those parties \u201c relative to the copartnery of <em>Fletcher </em>and <em>Pollard </em>to <em>Na- </em>\u201c <em>thaniel Anderson </em>and <em>Hudson </em>Martin, and, in case of \u201c their disagreement, to such umpire as they shall choose, \u201c whose award is to be made the decree of the Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-6\">The referees <em>reported </em>that they had <em>examined and stated the books </em>of the copartnery of <em>Fletcher and Pollard, </em>(an account of each partner with the firm being annexed,) the result of which was, that <em>Fletcher </em>had overpaid his proportion, that <em>Robert Pollard </em>was a creditor partner to a considerable amount, but that the debtor partner was <em>Richard C. Pollard. </em>The referees finally proceeded to <em>award, </em>that <em>Richard C. Pollard </em>shall pay to <em>Fletcher </em>10/. Os. <em>81-2d. </em>and to <em>Robert Pollard </em>819/. 6s. <em>Sd. </em>they then make provision for the distribution of the outstanding debts when collected. In making their report they expressly state, that the payments made by <em>Fletcher </em>leave a balance due to him, after discharging his proportion of the partnership debts, of the above sum of 10/. Os. 8 <em>1-2d. and discharge him, from any further claim of the complainant on account of the copartnery.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-7\">The plaintiff filed exceptions to the award: 1st. Because it was not final, the interest account being still unsettled; 2dly. Because the <em>items </em>of the account were unsupported by vouchers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-8\">The Chancellor was of opinion, that the referees had neither pursued their authority, nor completely pe. formed their function; that the plaintiff had ascribed the losses of the company to the negligence of Fletcher, to which he gave an evasive answer; that the bill alleged, that .the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>costs with which the complainant would be burthened might have been avoided by the sedulous attention of <em>Fletcher </em>to his duty, to which he gave no answer; yet the referees had overlooked these articles; that they had dehi ted the plaintiff with interest, although some of the accounts stated by them shewed that he had advanced more than his proportion of the joint stock, so that had his co-partners been equally provident, interest as well as costs would have been saved ; and although, too, the defendant <em>Fletcher </em>flattered the plaintiff with a prospect of gain, instead of warning him of a danger of loss. The Chancellor, therefore, <em>rejecting </em>the report, which he says was improperly called .an award, the prefatory words of its authors being, \u201c We have examined and stated the books of \u201c the copartnery of <em>Fletcher and, </em>Pollard, the accounts of <em>u </em>which, from our report, appear as follows,\u201d &amp;c. made a new reference of the accounts to a commissioner. From which opinion the defendant <em>Fletcher </em>prayed an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-5\"><em>The Attorney-General, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad9U\">The. opinion of the Chancellor was founded on a misapprehension of facts. Every allegation in the bill was as fully answered by <em>Fletcher </em>as it was possible from the nature of the case. <em>All the matters in controversy </em>were referred to arbitrators, and they, after <em>reporting </em>upon the state of accounts, proceed to make up an <em>award </em>between the parties. This was complete and final, and ought to have been made the decree of the Court. Justice and sound policy require, that, after men have chosen their own Judges, their decision shall be binding. No sufficient reason has been assigned for setting aside this award. As to the first exception, that the interest account was unsettled, it was , altogether a mistake; interest was given to both parties: and with respect to the second, that the <em>items </em>of the account were unsupported by vouchers, it was not necessary that they should be; but even if it were, it does not appear that the <em>books </em>were the only documents before the referees.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ALX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Randolph, for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apq\">admitted that some of the reasons given by the Chancellor for his decree were untenable, but contended that the result was correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALWN\">On the face of the award it appears, that .the referees have taken the books as conclusive evidence, instead of requiring vouchers in support of each item. These books were kept by <em>Fletcher; </em>and it was therefore incumbent on him to produce evidence to establish the several entries. <em>Robert </em>Pollard, being a creditor of the firm to a much <em>greater </em>amount than Fletcher, ought to have been allowed interest for his superior advance. The award ought therefore to have settled this question of interest, which has not been done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-7\">Again: <em>Robert Pollard </em>was in advance for the firm, considerably over his proportion of the debts; notwithstanding which he has been subjected to an equal proportion of interest and costs. This is neither legal nor equitable. He ought to have been exempted from the payment of interest and costs, inasmuch as his money was in the hands of the other partners. Mr. <em>Randolph </em>concluded by observing, that he asked an affirmance of the decree, for the purpose only of having a new account taken.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\"><em>Monday, May </em>23. The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b564-9\">Judge Tucker,</author>\n<p id=\"AoTU\">In this cause, the Court of Chancery, pursuant to an agreement in writing entered into between these parties, referred <em>all matters in difference </em>between these parties relative to the copartnery of <em>Fletcher and Pol</em>lard, to <em>Nathaniel Anderson </em>and <em>Hudson </em>Martin, who returned their <em>award </em>pursuant thereto, which the Court of Chancery rejected, on the ground that the arbitrators had not adverted .to the subjects in controversy, except in one particular instance; and referred the accounts between the parties to a commissioner. From which opinion <em>Fletcher </em>prayed and was allowed an appeal.'</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Upon examining the award, it appears to me not to be liable to the objection made to it by the Chancellor, or to any other. I think it final, as to the subjects of controversy, though it was objected at the bar that it was not so. And I also think it perfectly just and equitable, and therefore that it ought to have been made the decree of the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"b565-7\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"Ap0\">was of opinion that the award was good, and ought to have been confirmed by the Chancellor. He Was, consequently, in favour of reversing the decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b565-8\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AoTZ\">The award now under consideration was made by referees or arbitrators, chosen by the parties themselves, and under a special order of the High Court of Chancery, which Court had, at a preceding day, referred the accounts of the copartnery in the bill mentioned, to one of the commissioners of the Court, in the usual form.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The referees, in pursuance of the <em>special </em>order, which was made on the 27th day of May, 1801, proceeded to examine and state the accounts between the parties, from the books of the copartnery of <em>Fletcher and Pollard; </em>the only ground, in my apprehension, on which they ought to have proceeded. The award appears to be perspicuous and just, and ought, in my opinion, to be conclusive, at least, between the parties who agreed to the special reference. The plaintiif however, filed two exceptions to the award; 1st. That it was not final, the interest account not being settled,- and 2dly. That the <em>items </em>of the account were unsupported by vouchers. With respect to the first objection, it appears, from the general accountstated by the referees, that the credit of <em>1,524l. 17s. </em>2 <em>1-2d. </em>due to <em>Robert </em>Pollard, was for advances by him made with <em>interest </em>to the first of September, 1801; the period to which interest on all the accounts was calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">As to the second exception, It appears a novel doctrine to me, that in the settlement of accounts from the books <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of a copartnery, where all the partners of the company are equally interested, vouchers for the specific items should be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The opinion of the Court was, that the decree of the Superior Court of Chancery was erroneous in rejecting and setting aside the award made by the referees <em>Nathaniel Anderson </em>and <em>Hudson Martin. </em>Decree reversed at the costs of the appellee in the Court of Appeals; the award of the referees confirmed as between the appellant and appellee ; the bill of the appellee as against the appellant dismissed, as to\" so much thereof as relates to the settlement of the accounts between the said parties, as partners in the house of <em>Fletcher </em>and <em>Pollard; </em>and each party to pay liis own costs in the Court of Chancery.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
