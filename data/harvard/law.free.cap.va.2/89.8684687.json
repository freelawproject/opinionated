The other circumstances in the case, being foreign to the point on which the cause was decided, need not be mentioned ; except that the above allegations in the answers, as to the particular <em>time of the loan, </em>were neither supported, nor contradicted, by the depositions. The late Chancellor, observing that, if the loan of the 400 dollars were a <em>fair </em>transaction, and <em>preceded </em>the delivery of the <em>fieri facias </em>to die officer, the property never was bound by that precept ; that it had not been suggested in the bill that the loan, a fact admitted by the plaintiff, <em>(for so he </em>charges,) was not a <em>bona fide </em>contract; and that the defendants, who were required by the bill to discover <em>xvhpi </em>the said execution was delivered to the said <em>Benjamin Sheppard, </em>had declared, that the loan was even before the emanation of the execution ; in which they had not been contradicted ; dismissed the bill at the plaintiff\u2019s costs, who, thereupon, appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAr\">The only question is, can the sheriff levy <em>n fieri facias </em>delivered to him to be executed, upon money in his hands belonging to the debtor ? or rather, must he not return the execution, <em>ready to satisfy ?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acd\">The Chancellor has admitted the proposition ; but says, that in this case, it was not <em>money in the hands </em>of the officer, but a <em>debt </em>due from the officer to the debtor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-9\">In <em>Armistead </em>v. <em>Philpot,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided that, \u201c if a \u201c plaintiff cannot find sufficient effects of the defendant, to \u201c satisfy his judgment, the Court will order the sheriff to \u201c retain, for the use of the plaintiff, money which he has \u201c levied, in another action, at the suit of the defendant.\u201d The old authorities were against taking <em>money </em>in execution ; but the rule is now otherwise. In this country, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>clear, that money in the officer\u2019s hands is liable : whether a rule of Court is necessary or not, I cannot say ; but it amounts to the same thing. Here, the application was to a Court of Equity; and, if the money was <em>&amp; pledge, that Court </em>could direct its application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-9\">In <em>Smithier </em>v. <em>Lewis,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court directed money <em>lent </em>to be applied ; and in <em>Angell </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>(the next case in the same book,) the same principle was recognised ; but it was adjudged that it should be <em>after execution sued out ; </em>for, until then, the goods were not bound by the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-10\">Even if there were other claims for which the money Was pledged, the plaintiff was entitled to a decree, after satisfying those claims. 9 <em>Mod. </em>153.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-11\">But the fact is not as the Chancellor has presumed. <em>Sheppard </em>held the money, at the <em>time the execution was delivered to him </em>as <em>officer, </em>not as <em>borrower. </em>His answer is the only evidence of his holding as a <em>borrower s </em>but tire answer is not evidence so far as it is not responsive to the bill. The plaintiff states that the money <em>was lent; </em>but he does not say that the loan was <em>before </em>the execution came to the sheriff\u2019s hands. At that time the money was held to indemnify the sheriff as <em>bail </em>at the plaintiff\u2019s suit. His <em>return </em>on the execution proves this : and is the proper evidence ; for his answer cannot be received to contradict it, unless he allege a mistake and prove it. By his return, he admits that he did not hold as a <em>borrower, </em>but as a <em>public Officer.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-12\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT_\">There has been no decision <em>in this Court </em>that <em>money </em>is subject to an execution. But if a sheriff, <em>indebted </em>to a debtor, against whom an execution issued, was bound to return it, <em>ready to satisfy, </em>it would indeed be a new doctrine : and this is that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-13\">The objection that the sheriff\u2019s answer is not responsive t? the bill is incorrect; for it appears on inspecting the bill and answer, to be completely responsive, and is, therefore, evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>But the decree is correct for another reason : the plaintiff had no right to come into <em>Chancery </em>upon an assigned judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-6\">Randolph, on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6z\">This is a new doctrine in this country. The case is that of an assignment of a judgment purchased by the plaintiff, for less than its nominal amount, of a man who called himself an agent of <em>Catlett; </em>and <em>Catlett </em>is no party to this suit; neither is there any proof that the <em>agent of </em>Catlett, as he calls himself, had any power to sell. The plaintiff, therefore, had no title to the judgment; and, of course, his suit cannot be supported.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-7\">As to the other point. The money in the sheriff\u2019s hands became a <em>debt </em>on the 8th of August, and on the 11th of the same month, the execution was put into his hands: if so, that execution could not reach the money. This is proved by the answers ; and the sheriff' is not estopped by the <em>return; </em>for, in that, he had no business to state any thing as a private individual, and, therefore, returned what was proper : but when giving his answer, ought to have stated what he did <em>; not contradicting </em>the return, but mentioning additional circumstances.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-8\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXB\">There is no rule of law or equity against purchasing <em>a judgment: </em>so may <em>open accounts </em>be purchased, and recovered by a suit in equity ; which is the rule in <em>England. </em>As to the objection to <em>tire price </em>given, <em>Crump </em>has certainly no right to make it: for, if <em>Catlett </em>was satisfied to sell for less than the nominal amount, he had a right to do so. It was not necessary to make <em>him </em>a party, because the defendants do not, by their answers, object to the <em>right </em>of the plaintiff to have the <em>beneft of the judgment. </em>Neither was it necessary to prove the assignment : but, in fact, it is proved by the deposition of Brooke, the agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-9\">I admit there is no adjudged case in this country upon the principal point: but the principle is clear; in the same manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>as a judgment creditor can bring a bill against a mortgagor and mortgagee to compel a sale, and to be paid his, debt out of the proceeds, after paying the debt secured , , by the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1S\">So if a <em>debt </em>was due to <em>Crump, </em>and afterwards the plaintiff had proceeded against him by execution, he might still sue <em>in equity </em>to be paid out of that debt: and in this case, the ground for jurisdiction is as strong as possible, because the money was held as a <em>trust.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">But, here, the sheriff\u2019s return shews that he held the 400 dollars, <em>as Crump\u2019s money ; </em>not as a <em>debtor, </em>but <em>as holding Crump\u2019s money ; </em>and the bill does not authorise him to state a different case than is made by the return. The officer may have money as an officer, and, by a collateral agreement, agree to pay interest; yet he continues to hold as officer. As, where the sheriff has returned, so much money made on an execution, and the plaintiff being about to move against him, he agrees, if the motion be not made, to pay the money at next Court, with interest; he is bound to pay the interest, yet holds the money as officer.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\"> 1 <em>Doug. </em>230.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> 1 <em>Vern. </em>398, 399.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\"><em>Saturday, </em>12th <em>March, </em>1808, the Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b110-10\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak5\">The principal question in this case is, whether money deposited in the hands of a deputy-sheriff, as apledge for some particular purposes, and afterwards lent by the owner thereof to the sheriff, and applied by him to his own use, three days before the issuing and delivery of the execution against the goods and chattels of the lender, was liable to satisfy that execution. The Chancellor decided that it was not, and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill: and I concur with him in that decision, and am of opinion, that the decree ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-11\">Judges Roane and Fleming concurring, the decre\u00e9 Was AEEIRMED.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
