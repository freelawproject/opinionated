The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 6000 dollars, with interest from the 14th of July 1836, or such part thereof as the Court should think the plaintiff entitled to recover, subject to the demurrer to evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>From the evidence in the record, it appears, that as early as January 1833, <em>Wyche if Parker </em>were merchants and partners, doing business in the town of <em>Petersburg; Wyche </em>being the acting partner, and <em>Parker </em>living in the county of <em>Sussex. </em>On the 31st of January 1833, they were indebted to Cousins, on account of a <em>note of </em>theirs which had been transferred to him, and for money advanced to <em>Wyche </em>to buy groceries, in the sum of 4S87 dollars; and on that day he advanced them the farther sum of 1049 dollars; making due him 5936 dollars; and he took their negotiable note for 6000 dollars, payable at sixty days. The sum then advanced was intended to make up the sum of 6000 dollars, less the discount on that sum for sixty-four days, taken according to the custom of the banks of <em>Petersburg. </em>This note was given under an agreement between <em>Cousins, </em>and <em>Wyche </em>acting for the partnership, that the note was to be renewed every sixty days, until May 1837, upon their paying the discount. The note was, accordingly, renewed at the expiration of every sixty days, and the days of grace; and sixty-four dollars were received for 'discount thereon; the day of the date of the note, ''ail'd; the day when it fell due, being both counted; so that in fact, interest was taken twice for every sixty-fourth <em>day; </em>whilst the year was counted at 360 days, and.,the month at 30 days, according to <em>Rowlett\u2019s </em>tables. These notes were regularly renewed until the 12th of May 1836, when the note on which this suit was brought was executed: but they were never deposited in bank, but were attended to by <em>Wyche </em>and <em>Cousins </em>themselves, or their clerks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-5\">Between the 31st of January 1833, and February 1835, the firm of <em>Wyche if Parker, </em>was changed several times, by the admission and withdrawal of another <em>partner; </em>and on such occasions, the name of the firm was changed; but these notes were always made in the same name of <em>Wyche Sf Parker. </em>At this last date, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>partnership of <em>Wyche Sy Parker </em>was dissolved; <em>Parker </em>selling out to <em>Wyche, </em>at 12 per cent, advance upon the capital he put into the concern; and <em>Wyche </em>binding himself to discharge all the liabilities of the partnership ; and being authorized to settle up the business of the concern. The notice of dissolution was immediately published, and very soon afterwards the fact that <em>Wyche </em>was to pay the debts was known to <em>Cousins.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">The note to <em>Cousins </em>continued to be renewed by <em>Wyche, </em>after the dissolution of the partnership, until he absconded in June 1836j and the only change in the mode of its execution was, that it purported to be signed \u201c <em>Wyche Sy Parker, </em>by <em>William P. Wyche.\u201d </em>All these notes were executed by <em>Wyche; </em>and it does not appear that <em>Parker </em>knew of the existence of this debt, until after the dissolution of the partnership. It appears that before <em>Wyche </em>absconded, <em>Cousins </em>informed <em>Parker </em>that he held the note, and <em>Parker </em>promised to see <em>Wyche </em>about it, and then see <em>Cousins again; </em>but that upon <em>Parker\u2019s </em>speaking to <em>Wyche </em>on the subject, <em>Wyche </em>denied there was such a note, and <em>Parker </em>did not therefore return to <em>Cousins.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">It was in proof, that the discount taken in this was according to the usage of the banks and merehanti of <em>Petersburg; </em>and that <em>Cousins </em>was engaged business of discounting commercial paper. *&gt;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-9\">Upon the demurrer to evidence, the Court belo^kwas of opinion for the plaintiff; and gave judgment agam\u00e1f*^ the defendant for 5950 dollars 73 cents, with legal interest thereon from the 14th of July 1836, till paid, and the costs.

This action cannot be sustained upon the special count in the declaration. That is upon the note executed by <em>Wyche </em>after <em>Cousins </em>had notice of the dissolution of the partnership. It can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>not be doubted, that as a general principle, the power of oae partner to bind his copartner, ceases upon a dissolution of the partnership; and an original note, executed one 0f the former partners <em>for </em>a partnership debt, would not bind the other, though executed in the partnership name. But a note given for the renewal of a former note stands upon the same footing. 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 63; <em>Vernon </em>v. <em>Manhattan Co. </em>22 Wend. R. 183.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhG\">The authority to <em>Wyche </em>to settle up the business of the partnership, is only the usual authority ; and that is always confined strictly within the necessities of the case. <em>Abel v. Sutton, </em>3 Esp. R. 108; <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Ten Eyck, </em>2 Johns. R. <em>300; Sanford v. Mickles &amp; als. </em>4 Johns. R. 224; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Walton Sp Co. </em>1 M\u2019Cord\u2019s R. 16; <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>1 Hill\u2019s R. 572. It may be said, that the agreement was that the note should be renewed until 1837. But the original execution of the note, and all the renewals of it, were by' <em>Wyche </em>alone; and there is no evidence that <em>Parker </em>had any knowledge of the agreement. To bind <em>Parker </em>by <em>Wyche1 s </em>agreement, <em>Wyche </em>must have had authority to make it; and it is not pretended that he had any other than the usual authority of a partner. It cannot be contended that this enabled <em>Wyche </em>to bind <em>Parker </em>to continue to renew the note after the dissolution of the partnership. When, therefore, that was terminated, <em>Parker </em>was not bound to renew the note in his own name, or to acquiesce in its renewal. <em>Bank of South Car. </em>v. <em>Humphreys, </em>1 M\u2019Cord\u2019s R. 388. But not only was <em>Parker </em>not bound to renew the note after the dissolution of the partnership, but it is impossible to suppose that <em>Cousins </em>considered that <em>Parker </em>was a party to the renewed note. He knew that <em>Wyche </em>was to pay this debt; he knew that <em>Parker </em>had left with <em>Wyche </em>the partnership effects, for the purpose of paying the debts of the partnership; that <em>Parker </em>had no interest in its renewal, but much that it should be paid; and as the renewals were with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>out his knowledge, <em>Cousins </em>knew they were a fraud . . upon him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adz\">If the action cannot be maintained upon the special count, can it be sustained upon the common counts? It is insisted for <em>Parker, </em>that he has been discharged from the payment of this debt, by the dealings between <em>Wyche </em>and <em>Cousins. </em>I have endeavoured to prove that this is the note of <em>Wyche </em>alone. When the note was renewed, it was in the course of business, as it was the right of the makers, that the old note should be given up. And this would especially be the case here, as the notes were not deposited in bank, but were attended to by the parties or their clerks; and it is certain that none of the old notes have been produced upon the trial of this cause. They cannot, therefore, be relied upon in this case as sustaining the liability of <em>Parker.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-7\">But whether or not the preceding note was surrendered or cancelled, it was extinguished by the execution of that one which succeeded it. When, therefore, <em>Cousins </em>accepted a note which only bound <em>Wyche, </em>and which <em>Cousins </em>must be presumed to know only bound <em>Wyche, </em>and which he did know ought only to bind him, in satisfaction of the note of <em>Wyche Parker, </em>that was a discharge of <em>Parker </em>from all liability, not only on the note, but for the debt. <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>6 Cranch 253; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Perceval, </em>27 Eng. C. L. R. 241; Story on Part. 239, 242; <em>Smith &amp; als. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>17 Johns. R. 340; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>32 Eng. C. L. R. 715; <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Innes, </em>4 Mylne &amp; Craig 101. In these cases, the note of one partner was given for a debt of the firm by open account. But there is another class of cases more resembling that now before the Court, where the creditor, holding the note of the firm, takes that of the continuing partner for it. If the old note is retained, then the presumption is that the creditor takes the new note as a security. But when the old note is given up, then it is to be inferred that the creditor agrees to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the new note instead of the old one. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>12 Johns. R. 409 <em>; Evans </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>4 Esp. R. 89; <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Deakin, </em>3 Eng. C. L. R. 303; <em>Vernon </em>v. <em>Manhattan Co. </em>17 Wend. R. 524; <em>8. C. </em>22 Wend. R. 183 The cases of <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Dicas, </em>5 Eng. C. L. R. 397; and <em>David </em>v. <em>Ellice, </em>11 Id. 201; will be relied on by the counsel for the appellee; but the principle of these cases was disapproved in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Perceval, </em>and <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Innes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-5\"><em>Wyche, </em>having undertaken to pay the debts in consideration of the partnership effects, this is a sufficient consideration for the contract between <em>Wyche </em>and <em>Cousins ; </em>and is precisely the contract of delegation of the civil law. <em>Wharton </em>v. <em>Walker, 10 </em>Eng. <em>C. L. R. </em>302; 1 Archbold\u2019s Ni. Pri. 24, 49 Law Libr. 80. But the execution of the new note was an additional consideration, because in some respects, it was a preferable security to the old one. Thus, the new note being taken on the day when the old one fell due, this last was of no use. except to prove the debt; whereas, the new one might be discounted, and money be raised upon it. The new note, moreover, gave the creditor a greater rate of interest for his money than he would have received on the old-one. Both these advantages are matters of value; and the quantum of value is not for the consideration of the Court, but of the parties. If there is any legal value, it is enough for the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">But if there has been no valid novation of this debt, by the substitution of <em>Wyche\u2019s </em>note for that of the partners, <em>Parker </em>is released by the dealings of <em>Cousins </em>with <em>Wyche. </em>After the dissolution of the partnership, <em>Wyche </em>was only the agent of <em>Parker </em>to settle up the business of the firm. Now, a creditor dealing with the agent, by taking his separate security for the debt of the principal, and giving time to the agent, so that the principal, supposing the debt settled, leaves with the agent property' which otherwise he would withdraw, the creditor can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>not, on failing to receive his money from the agent, go hack upon the principal. <em>Reed </em>v. White, 5 Esp. R. 122; <em>James &amp; als. </em>v. <em>Hackley, </em>16 Johns. R. 273; <em>Muldon &amp; als. </em>v. Whitlock, 1 Cow. R. 290. But the case here is still stronger. By the agreement between <em>Wyche </em>and Parker, on the dissolution of the partnership, as between themselves, <em>Wyche </em>became the principal debtor, and <em>Parker </em>his surety; and <em>Cousins </em>was fully informed of this agreement. He, therefore, in dealing with Wyche, was dealing with the principal debtor; and any thing which would release a surety released <em>Parker. Oakeley </em>v. <em>Pasheller, </em>10 Bligh\u2019s N. S. 548; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>1 Hill\u2019s R. 123. And it has been expressly held, that a creditor taking another acceptance upon farther time, releases the endorser. <em>Gould </em>v. Robson, 8 East\u2019s R. 576.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">It is a general principle, that taking interest in advance is usury. Comy. on Usu. p. 81 to 84; <em>Agricultural Bank </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>12 Pick. R. 586; <em>Utica Ins. Co. </em>v. Tillman, 1 Wend. R. 555; <em>Same </em>v. <em>Kip, </em>3 Id. 369; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>2 Id. 513. This Court has decided, that this principle does not apply to commercial paper discounted at bank; but in this case the bank was no party to the transaction. It was a simple loan of money by one man to another, upon which the interest was taken in advance, so that in fact <em>Wyche \u00a3f Parker </em>never received but 5936 dollars, whilst they paid interest on 6000 dollars: and paid double interest on every sixty-fourth day. In <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>5 Leigh 251; and <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>The Bank of Washington, </em>3 Peters\u2019 R. 36, it was held, that under the usage of the banks, the taking double interest on the sixty-fourth day was not usury; but it was conceded in both these cases, that if there was a contract not to pay, but to renew, that it was usury. Here, I submit, that under the agreement between the parties, according to the concessum in these cases, the contract was usurious.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ac9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>Macfarland </em>and <em>G. N. Johnson, </em>for the appellee;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9c\">The first question to be considered is, whether the evidence sustains the special count. This depends upon the other question, whether <em>Wyche </em>was authorized to renew the note of <em>Wyche &amp; Parker, </em>after the dissolution of the partnership. It is to be borne in mind, that the note was originally executed, and afterwards renewed during the partnership, by <em>Wyche, </em>when he certainly had full authority to do so; that he was authorized to wind up the business on the dissolution of the partnership ; that the note was regularly renewed from that time to May 1836, without objection or complaint by <em>Parker ; </em>and that whatever was the agreement between <em>Wyche </em>and <em>Parker, Parker </em>was responsible to <em>Cousins </em>for this debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-4\">We admit it is a general rule, that after dissolution, one partner cannot bind the other by a new contract. But it is equally true, that he has power to do all acts necessary to wind up the business of the partnership judiciously. This involves the power to make contracts, because the condition of a partnership at the time of dissolution, renders it absolutely necessary. There are debts outstanding which are to be collected by a judicious employment of the means <em>best </em>adapted in each case to attain the end. There are debts due from the partnership, and means are to be provided for their payment. There are goods on hand' which must be sold. There are adventures not closed. The partnership business cannot, therefore, be settled, without the making of <em>contracts; </em>and there must be a discretion on the part of the acting partner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-5\">There is then a limitation to the general principle above <em>stated; </em>and the true rule will be found to be, that no contract can be made by one partner, after the dissolution, by which the others will be bound, unless such contract is an appropriate means, for settling up the business of the concern. For this purpose, the partnership, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>and the power of one partner to bind the others continues. It is upon this principle, that it has been held, that after the dissolution, one partner may, by his acts or admissions, ascertain the existence of a debt due by the firm, so as to bind all the partners. <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Agee\u2019s adm\u2019r, 7 </em>Leigh 362; <em>Brown\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Higginbotham &amp; Co., </em>5 Leigh 583. So, one partner may give an acknowledgment of a debt of the firm, which will bind all. <em>Wood &amp; als. </em>v. <em>Braddick, </em>1 Taunt. <em>104; Lacy </em>v. <em>M\u2019Neile, </em>16 Eng. C. L. R. 185. So it has been held that an admission by one of the partners after the dissolution, would revive a debt barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Whitcomb </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>Doug. R. 652. And this case has been recognized as law in <em>England, </em>by a series of cases, and also in many of the States of this Union. It has been denied in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and <em>Kentucky, </em>and by the <em>Supreme Court, </em>in <em>Bell </em>v. Morrison, 1 Peters\u2019 R. 351. But in this case, the Court was divided, and the decision was controlled by the <em>Kentucky </em>authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-4\">Apply the principle of these cases to the case under consideration, and there would seem to be no room for doubt, as to the power of <em>Wyche </em>to renew the note so as to bind <em>Parker. </em>There is certainly nothing in this record to prove that <em>Iiarker </em>could have expected a debt which had existed for three years, whilst the input capital of both partners might be resorted to to discharge it, would be paid off within sixty days after the dissolution of the firm, and the withdrawal of the whole of <em>Parker\u2019s </em>capital, and twelve per cent, upon it. If he did not expect it to be paid in that time, he must have expected it to be renewed <em>; </em>because he knew that a refusal to renew, would have prompted <em>Cousins </em>to enforce payment, which must have destroyed <em>Wyche\u2019s </em>credit, whilst it subjected him to a burden which by the terms of the dissolution was to be borne by <em>Wyche. </em>The renewal of the note was therefore a necessary, and a judicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>measure in the settlement of the business of the partnership.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-10\">If the Court shall be of opinion that <em>Wyche </em>had no authority to renew the note after the dissolution of the partnership; and so that the case cannot be sustained upon the special count; then we submit that <em>upon the </em>common money counts, we are entitled to recover either on the last note executed whilst the partnership existed, or upon the original consideration. This note is binding upon Parker, unless it has been paid, or he has been discharged by the acts of <em>Cousins. </em>It is not pretended that it has been paid. The only question, therefore, is, has <em>Parker </em>been discharged by the acts of <em>Cousins ? </em>We say by the acts of <em>Cousins, </em>because a retiring partner cannot be discharged by any act or agreement of the partners, among themselves; but there must be an agreement on the part of the creditors, either express or implied to release him. Cary on Partn. <em>5 </em>Law Libr. 70. In most of the cases it is considered a question of fact for the jury; and it is only when the facts are clearly made out that the Court will infer an intention on the part of the creditor to release the retiring partner. This case comes up on a demurrer to evidence by <em>Parker. </em>The inferences are, therefore, to be made against him ; and as there are no facts to prove the agreement to release him, it is impossible that the Court can infer such intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-11\">But it is insisted, that where a creditor of the firm gives up the note of the firm, and takes the note of the continuing partner, the retiring partner is discharged. But the principle upon which this rule is based, is, that such is the intention of the creditor. Does our case come within the rule, or the reason on which it is founded ? If there has been no agreement by <em>Cousins </em>to take the note of <em>Wyche </em>in place of the note of <em>Wyche &amp; Parker, </em>then the case does not come within the principle on which the rule is founded. If he has not ta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ken the note of <em>Wyche, </em>but took that of <em>Wyche &amp; Parker, </em>then the case does not come within the ride. Indeed nothing could more clearly evince the intention of <em>Cousins </em>to hold <em>Parker </em>bound for his debt, than his act of continuing to take the note in the name of the firm. Why thus take the note if he was content to have <em>Wyche </em>alone for his debtor ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-4\">It is said again, that an agreement to release the retiring partner may be inferred from the dealings of the creditor with the firm. But where there is a distinct expression of intention to hold the retiring partner bound, surely this inference cannot be made. To bring this case within the authority, <em>Cousins </em>should have left his money with <em>Wyche, </em>and must have dealt and contracted with him, as being his only debtor. <em>Lord Abinger, </em>in <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>32 Eng. C. L. R. 715, held that the outgoing partner was bound until an agreement could be proved, or inferred from his continued dealings with the continuing partners. So in the case of <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>6 Cranch\u2019s R. 253. And in the case cited by the counsel on the other side of <em>Vernon </em>v. <em>Manhattan Co., </em>22 Wend. R. 183, it is held that the retiring partner will not be discharged, unless the creditor so intended. All the authorities ascertain that it is not mere dealing or indulgence from which an agreement to release the retiring partner will be inferred. <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Percival, </em>1 P. Wms. 682; <em>Feather stone </em>v. <em>Hunt, 8 </em>Eng. C. L. R. 34; <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Deakin, </em>3 Eng. C. L. R. 303.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">Having seen that an intention on the part of the creditor to release the retiring partner is necessary to effect it, it follows of necessity, that the last note executed when the partnership existed, of the authority to execute which there is no doubt, is still a valid and subsisting security. This is involved in the principle that an old contract is not merged in or satisfied by a subsequent security of the same character. This principle is clearly established by many cases, and among others by <em>Cole </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Sackett, </em>1 Hill\u2019s R. 516. And the doctrine that an intention to release is necessary, is strongly illustrated by the case of <em>Galt\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Calland\u2019s ex\u2019or, 7 </em>Leigh 594. rpjiaf. was case 0f a t,on(j executed by one partner in tire partnership name, which was held not to extinguish the original debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-4\">But it is said, that by the agreement between <em>Wyche Sf Parker, Parker </em>became a mere surety of <em>Wyche, </em>and that he is on this ground released by the indulgence of <em>Wyche, </em>by <em>Cousins ; </em>and for this the case of <em>Oakeley </em>v. <em>Pasheller, </em>10 Bligh N. S. 548, is relied on. That case was decided on its peculiar circumstances; and does not sustain the general principle deduced from it. But if it did decide that partners by their agreement can convert one into the surety of the other, without the assent of the creditors, it is in conflict with <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Deakin, </em>and <em>Vernon </em>v. <em>Manhattan Bank.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">The ground of usury relied on by the counsel on the other side, is the talcing the interest in <em>advance; </em>and taking double interest for every sixty-fourth day. The first point is settled by the cases of the <em>State Bank of North Car. </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>8 Leigh <em>238; Bank of Utica </em>v. <em>Wager, </em>2 Cow. R. 712; <em>New York Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ely &amp; als. </em>2 Id. 678; <em>Stribbling </em>v. <em>Bank of the Valley, </em>5 Rand. <em>132; Thornton </em>v. <em>The Bank of Washington, </em>3 Peters\u2019 R. 36. The second ground is overruled by <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>5 Leigh 251. These cases leave no doubt upon the question of usury, unless the agreement that the note might be renewed, varies the case. In <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>there was an understanding that the note would be renewed, but the Court held there was no obligation binding both parties to renew, and therefore there was no usury. To exempt this case from the influence of <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>it must be shewn that the agreement to renew was obligatory upon both parties. The counsel on the other side has relieved us from the trouble of proving that such was not the agreement, by performing the task himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Bat if there was usury in taking the interest in advanee, or in taking double interest for every sixty-fourth day, that would not avoid the pre-existing debt; and <em>Cousins </em>is entitled to recover on that account, even if all the notes were usurious. Comyn on Usu. p. 187 to 195 ; <em>Rankin\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Rankin\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>1 Gratt. 153.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-4\">Stanard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApY\">The efficacy of the objection to the judgment in this case, on the ground of usury, depends on the result of the enquiry, whether usury can be justly imputed to the original transaction between these parties. For, if the discount of the first note was not usurious, that note constituted a valid debt, which would remain a just and legal demand, though usury could be legally predicable of the notes subsequently discounted, of which this debt founded in part the consideration. Indeed, though there was usury in the discount of the first note, so far as the consideration of that note was a pre-existing and valid liability, the debt remained in full obligation, to the extent of that liability, though the note, as a security for the debt, should be null and void, by reason of the usury in the discount of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Without going farther back than the original note, I think, on the demurrer to evidence, the jury would have been justified in considering that note as offered by <em>Wyche &amp;f Parker </em>to <em>Cousins </em>for discount, and as discounted by him, retaining out of the sixty days note, sixty-four days interest in advance, and computing interest at the rate of the half of one per cent, for thirty days; that is, computing interest as if thirty days was a month, and three hundred and sixty days a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Supposing there had been no previous transactions between the parties, but that <em>Cousins </em>had given on the discount of a note of 6000 dollars at sixty days, 5936 dollars, the objections to the validity of the note on the ground of usury, are, 1st. That interest was taken for sixty-four days, and in advance. $d. That in the corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>putation of interest, the year has been considered as equal to twelve months, and thirty days as equal to the month; these being the elements of the computation <em>from </em>which <em>Rowlett\u2019s </em>tables have been framed. That the first objection is not tenable, was decided by this Court in the case of <em>Crump </em>v. Nicholas, 5 Leigh 251; and by the Supreme Court in the case of <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Bank of Washington, </em>3 Peters\u2019 It. 36. That the second objection is equally unavailing to fasten the imputation of usury on the transaction, was decided by this Court in the case of the <em>State Bank of North Car. v. Cowan, </em>8 Leigh 238; and was so decided in <em>Massachusetts </em>in the case of the <em>Agricultural Bank </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>12 Pick. R. 586. If, then, the nett proceeds of the discount of the note, that is, 5936 dollars, had been paid to <em>Wyche If Parker </em>in money, the discount would not have been usurious. In this case the proceeds of the discount was in part applied to an existing debt of the makers of the note, and the residue thereof paid in money. Does this feature of the transaction give it a character different from that which it would have borne had the whole amount been paid in money? That it does not, is, I think, free from all doubt. The full amount of the discount is in each case accounted for to the makers of the note. The only difference is, that in respect to the part the makers previously owed, the money is already in their hands, without the tradition of it from the hands of the discounter or lender. Indeed, the discount of a new note to meet one previously discounted and at maturity, a transaction of such familiar occurrence, is the example of the application of the whole proceeds of the discount to an existing liability; and on the question of usury on such new discount, it never has been seriously contended, that the application of the proceeds of the discount to the existing note, rather than the payment of the proceeds in money, had the slightest influence. On a question which has never been seriously raised, judicial decisions cannot be expected. The case of <em>Crump </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>5 Leigh 251, furnished the occasion to raise such a question; and that case shews, that no one thought it could be even plausibly maintained; and that if it had been propounded it would have been condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The original note, therefore, was valid; and by it <em>Wyche Parker </em>became the debtor of <em>Cousins, </em>in the sum of G000 dollars. The subsequent renewals of the note for that sum, during the continuance of the partnership, notwithstanding that on the renewal the notes were taken, as the original note had been, by deducting the interest for sixty-four days computed as it was on the discount of the original note, on each renewal in advance, was not usurious; <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>5 Leigh 251; and <em>Wyche Parker </em>was, at the dissolution of the partnership, indebted in the amount of the then existing note. Besides, could the objection on the ground of usury be maintained in respect to the renewed notes, it would have annulled them; but that would not have cancelled the pre-existing debt. The new security would have been void, but the pre-existing debt would not have been abrogated. That would have remained unsatisfied by the nugatory and void security, and the creditor would have been remitted to his original title thereto, and remedy therefor. Comy. on Usu. 187-194; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Fowler &amp; als. </em>1 H. Bl. 11. 462; <em>Rankin\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Rankin\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>1 Gratt. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">There being a valid debt, existing at the dissolution of the partnership of <em>Wyche Sf Parker, </em>the question is, has any thing which has since occurred absolved <em>Parker </em>from the responsibility ? The elaborate argument of the counsel for the plaintiff in error, though most creditable to his industry and ingenuity, is unavailing to justify an affirmative answer to this question. Without entering into the enquiry, whether in any case the unperformed promise, oral or written, by one of two already bound for the same debt, by a like promise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>same party, can discharge, or be pleaded, or used in evidence to bar the legal remedy on the original promise, I think it may be safely affirmed, on principle and authority, that such discharge will not be effected, nor such i3ar j-,0 created, unless the parties making and accepting such new promise intended or stipulated that such discharge or bar to the former <em>assumpsit </em>should be the consequence of the making and acceptance of the new several promise. The new note given by <em>Wyche </em>in the name of the old partnership, (whether the new note <em>propria </em>vigore, in strict law bound <em>Parker </em>or not,) is plenary evidence that neither <em>Cousins </em>or <em>Wyche </em>stipulated, or expected, or intended to discharge <em>Parker </em>from his responsibility for this debt. So far from this being intended, it is demonstrable that it was intended to continue his responsibility. Had <em>Cousins </em>accepted the individual note of <em>Wyche </em>for this partnership debt, a foundation would have been laid for the enquiry, whether it was taken in discharge of the partnership responsibility; and to the determination of the question, how far it operated a discharge, the accessional enquiries into the known position in which the parties were placed by the terms of the dissolution, the conduct of the parties <em>inter se, </em>the influence of that conduct on the measures of the retiring partner in retaining securities or enforcing the liabilities of the other partner, would be most proper and relevant. But here no act has been done by the creditor indicating any purpose to absolve Parker, or calculated to mislead him; and no pretence even, that he has taken or surrendered any security from, or remedy against Wyche, or attempted, much less ever interrupted <em>Parker </em>in any attempt to enforce the obligation of <em>Wyche, </em>as between him and <em>Parker, </em>to do that which <em>Parker </em>was as much bound to the creditors to do as <em>Wyche, </em>discharge the liabilities of the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">If the notes, made after the dissolution by <em>Wyche </em>in the name of the partnership, did not (and I think they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>did not) <em>per se </em>bind Parker, they did not perform the function they were intended to perform, and they should not have the effect of discharging the pre-existing debt. The only foundation for the hypothesis that the new note was accepted in discharge of the former, is, that the parties considered it as but a new obligation of the same parties for the same debt, and being so, the retention of the former evidence of the debt was supererogatory. Not performing this function, the consideration for the inferred stipulation to discharge that debt, also fails, and the debt remains. No agreement of <em>Cousins </em>to discharge a former note but in consideration of the combined obligation of the parties on the new note, can be inferred j and if such obligation was not continued by the new note, it cannot, against the intent of the parties, operate a discharge or satisfaction of the debt due on the old, and intended to be continued by the new note.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The strongest position that the plaintiff in error can take still leaves it predicable of the case, that the consideration of the new note was a partnership responsibility, and that it was given and accepted as binding on both of the former partners, but was, by reason of the defect of the power of the one who gave it to bind in that form the other partner, void of obligation as to that other. Now in the stronger case in which a partner gives a bond for a partnership simple contract responsibility, by which the other is not bound, and as to the partner giving the bond the simple contract is merged in the higher security, and <em>pro tanto, </em>there is an actual novation, and radical change of the original obligation, yet if the bond be in the name of the partnership, and thus furnishing satisfactory evidence that it was not the purpose of the parties, in giving and accepting the bond, to discharge the debt as to the partnership, the partnership liability still remains. The only consequence of the several liability of one of the partners on the bond might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>be a change of the mode of enforcing the partnership liability. Xn-such case the bond, if considered as a merger of the simple contract as to the party who gave it, W\u00fclpq oppose a technical difficulty to the enforcement 0p tpe ciaim at law on the simple contract of the partnership ; and if so, a Court of Equity would be the proper resort for redress against the partnership ,\u2022 and there redress would be had. <em>Galt's ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Calland's ex\u2019or, </em>7 Leigh 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">It is not perceived by what process of calculation the Court below reduced the amount of 6000 dollars principal, as found by the jury, to the sum of 5950 dollars 72 cents, for which the judgment was rendered. Some abatement of the principal of 6000 dollars might have been properly made, but I do not perceive that any abatement that could be justly claimed, or legally required, could equal the amount made by the Court. But of this excess of the abatement, the defendant in error does not, and the plaintiff in error has no right to <em>complain; </em>and therefore it is not a cause for the reversal of the judgment. I am therefore of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The other Judges concurred in the opinion of <em>\u00a3'ta\u00f1ar\u00e1, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
