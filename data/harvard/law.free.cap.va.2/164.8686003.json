They also denied any knowledge of a deficiency in the lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-8\">The suit being at issue, commissioners were appointed, <em>by consent of parties, </em>to superintend a survey of the said lands ; to note the quantity contained within the lines of the larger tract, also the quantity contained in each of the small surveys, and wherein and to wbat amount these,surveys in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>terfered with older rights.

The commissioners returned a survey made under their direction, and reported that the larger tract <em>said </em>to contain 572 acres, was found by actual measurement to contain only 544 acres, shewing a deficiency of 28 acres; (that is) between the <em>actual </em>quantity of 544? <em>acres, </em>and the quantity called for in <em>Lockhart's </em>deeds to <em>Sampson </em>and <em>George Matthews, </em>of 552 acres, there was a difference of <em>eight </em>acres; and between the said quantity of 552 acres, and that of 572 aci-cs expressed in the deed from <em>Matthexvs </em>and wife to <em>Nelson, </em>there was a difference of <em>twenty </em>acres, making in the whole a deficiency of 28 acx-es, as reported by the commissioners.) They further report, that one of the sxnall surveys described in the title bond as lying on the northwest side of the larger tract, contained by actual measux-ement 44 aci'es, but it was <em>entirely lost </em>by ixiterfering with older rights; and that the other small sui-vey, described as lying oxx the south-east side, contained 130 <em>acres, fifty-one </em>of which were ifx fact <em>comprehended xvithin the lines of the large </em>tract. That the <em>average </em>value of diese <em>fifty-one </em>acx-es was one-fourth higher than the rest of the survey of which they purpox-ted to form a part. The <em>average </em>value of each parcel, at the periods above mentioned, was stated as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-4\">On the 14th <em>Feb. 1783. </em>4th <em>Apr. </em>179S.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">The plantation or tract <em>said </em>to . . coxitain 572 acres, \u00bf6 75 816 66</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-7\">Small survey adjoining on the N.

The commissioners reported, that, according to the depositions of several witnesses, (who appear to have been called on from their knowledge of the land and supposed judgment in such matters,) the two small parcels of 44 and <em>51 </em>acres, which were lost by interference, were, in the opinion of the deponents, of an equal average value per acre with the large tract; and that the large tract was reduced <em>one-fifth </em>in its value per acre, by such loss. Considering the smaller survey of 44 acres as a <em>necessary appendage </em>to the large tract, on .account of a valuable growth of timber conveniently situated to such parts of it, as were much in want of that article: the commissioners estimated .the said smaller tract as worth, on the 14th of February, 1785, <em>eight </em>dollars, and on the 4th of <em>April, </em>1798, <em>twenty-fvc </em>dollars per acre. With respect to the 51 acres of the other Survey, lost by interference with the large tract, considering its remote situation from the cleared lands, and its being included in and adjoining the woodland part of the large tract, they saw no good reason for changing their opinion of its value per acre, as stated in their former report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-3\">At the hearing, on the 12th of <em>April, </em>1803, the Chancellor pronounced a decree to the following effect: That, the deed from the defendant, <em>George Matthews, </em>to the plaintiff, <em>(Nelson,) </em>calling for 572 acres, <em>more or less, </em>when <em>Matthews, </em>from a recurrence to his own title papers, had no reason to suppose that more than 552 acres were contained in the survey, <em>Nelson </em>was entided to a discount against the judgment for the value of <em>twenty </em>acres; but not for the deficiency of <em>eight </em>acres appearing within the lines of the said survey; such deficit not <em>being more than a-purchaser in gross might reasonably expect. </em>That <em>Nelson </em>was also entitled to a credit for the smaller survey of 44 acres, which was wholly lost by the interference of older rights, and for 51 acres of the other survey, which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>included within the lines of the larger tract, inasmuch as t the inattention of Matthews, that those interferences were not discovered before his sale and conveyance to <em>Nelson. </em>That <em>Nelson </em>was moreover entitled to a discount the surveys thus lost were made upon lands, for which, at the time, there were existing legal titles, and it was owing for the taxes paid by him on the <em>20 </em>acres deficient in the large tract, and on the difference between the quantity <em>called for </em>in the two deeds for the surveys, and die quantity <em>actually held </em>by him in virtue of those deeds; which taxes, were to be calculated from the year 1786 to the year 1790, when the deficiency was discovered by tire plaintiff, and the error was or might have been corrected. But the Court was of opinion, that in ascertaining the value of the deficits, their value, <em>at the time of the original, </em>contract, and not <em>at any subsequent </em>period, should be resorted to; and that their <em>real </em>and not their <em>relative </em>value should be adopted by the Court. Therefore the first report of the commissioners, in which the <em>intrinsic value of the </em>lost land <em>at the time of the sale </em>was ascertained, without respect to its <em>relative </em>situation, or to the aggregate <em>price paid </em>for the whole tract, oir which was a valuable mill and other improvements, none of which appear to have been on the lost land, was considered the just rule of decision. The-Chancellor made the injunction perpetual as to 471 dollars 94 cents, being the whole sum for which he considered the plaintiff entitled to a credit, as well for the deficiency of <em>each several parcel </em>of land, according to its <em>intrinsic value at the time of the </em>contract, as for the taxes aforesaid, and for a small account, (the correctness of which did not appear to have been contested by the defendant,) after an allowance of tire then legal interest upon the value of the lost land, as above ascertained, from the first of October, 1788, when the plaintiff\u2019s bond became due on. which the judgment had been obtained; upon the taxes according to the principles settled in the decree; and upon the said small account; and dissolved the injunction for the residue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Nelson, </em>claiming a credit for a much larger sum, appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av3\">There can be no question as to our right to compensation for the deficiency in the land. The only inquiry is, what shall be the measure of that compensation. I shall contend that we are entitled to compensation, <em>not at the date of the contract, </em>but <em>at a subsequent period.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-9\">As to so much of the land called for in the deeds as never existed, there is some difficulty, but as to that lost by prior titles, <em>Nelson </em>is entitled to compensation at -the time when he received the damage. He is entitled to his contract. If the price had <em>depreciated, </em>he must have submitted to the loss j as it has <em>appreciated, </em>he is entitled to the benefit. He can only be compensated by giving him the full value of his contract <em>after the purchase, </em>at which time he sustained the injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-10\">In <em>Groves </em>v. <em>Graves.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was a contract for the delivery of certificates, the Court determined that the standard of value should be fixed on the day when the contract was to have been performed. The ground that the Court went upon vras, that after the day' of payment had past, the party was not bound to receive the certificates, but might resort to his action. In <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Waller,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court determined that <em>Reynolds </em>should pay the value of the certificates at the time of the trial; and a distinction was taken between the two cases, in this, that, in the former, there was a contract to deliver the certificates at a <em>future day, </em>but,^ in the latter, there was <em>no contract, </em>the certificates having been fraudulently obtained by the ag-ent of <em>Reynolds, </em>and a bill was brought by the heirs and administrator of <em>Waller </em>for a specific restitution. So in <em>Morris </em>v. Alexander,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> the owner of certificates was considered as entitled to the certificates themselves, if to be had; jf not, their value at the time of the decree. The same doctrine was recognised in the late case of <em>Short </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>Skipwith, </em>in the Federal Court; and nothing but the peculiar circumstances of the case induced the Court to fix the value at a different time. The difference, however, between certificates and land is this: The contract cannot be satisfied by other lands, because there cannot be an <em>identity </em>of situation, &amp;c. But with respect to certificates, if the purchaser be disappointed, he can vest his money in others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-5\">The next point to be considered is, what should be the standard of compensation. The lands which were lost <em>were wood-lands, </em>rendered peculiarly valuable on account of their being annexed to the old plantation. They had, therefore, a <em>relative </em>value, and should have been estimated accordingly. The Chancellor has allowed the <em>real </em>and not the <em>relative </em>value; though the term <em>real </em>value is unintelligible, without considering, at the same time, the relative value. The <em>real </em>value of the land is its <em>relative </em>value; because its value is estimated in reference to its utility. The true injury the person sustained should always be the measure of damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-6\">If the value of the land at the time of the purchase be resorted to, what ought to be regarded? The price paid? Surely not. A man may agree to give for a tract of land a much greater price than it is worth. In this case, it appears, from the report of the commissioners, that <em>Nelson </em>agreed to give too much; and an arbitrary standard of their own has been established. According to this rule, and the principle established <em>by </em>the Chancellor, if <em>Matthews </em>had not had a foot of land, <em>Nelson </em>would still have had to pay him a considerable sum of money; because the <em>real </em>value of the land at the time of the purchase would have fallen so far short of the purchase-money. This shews the difficulty and impropriety of making the <em>price </em>and <em>date of the contract </em>the standard of compensation. [Here Mr. <em>Wick-ham </em>went into a minute calculation founded on the report of the commissioners, and the testimony of the witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>which stated that the value of the large tract was impaired one-fifth in consequence of the loss of the surveys <em>; </em>and endeavoured to shew that <em>Nelson </em>was entitled to a much larger sum than had been allowed by the Chancellor.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-4\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqFX\">No deduction ought to be allowed for the twenty acres deficient in the <em>large tract, </em>because the title bond speaks of it as containing so many acres, <em>more or </em>less, and the deed conveys it by <em>estimation </em>only. It is a rule of law, that if an estate be sold <em>by estimation, </em>the vendor is not liable for a small deficiency, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If a person wishes an exact quantity, he must contract for it by the acre, in which case he would be entitled to compensation in the event of a deficiency. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">It is clear that no discount ought to be allowed for the <em>surveys. </em>They were made on the 8th and 9th of February, 1785, (before the date of the bond,) for <em>Nelson himself; </em>one contained 39 acres, the other 115. On the 11th of <em>February, </em>1785, the bond was entered into. The inference is, that <em>Matthews </em>never saw those surveys; for if h\u00e9 had seen them, he never would have inserted in the condition o\u00a3 the bond, that they contained <em>about </em>200 <em>acres. Matthews </em>was to convey the land <em>contained in </em>Buchanan\u2019s surveys. If <em>Nelson </em>knew what was in those surveys, and did not disclose it to <em>Matthews, </em>he was guilty of a voluntary concealment, and cannot be relieved in equity. The entries were originally made, but <em>Matthexvs </em>never had the surveys. <em>Nelson </em>caused the entries to be surveyed himself <em>% </em>and obtained a deed from <em>Beverley, </em>with general warranty, for the quantity contained in them. The condition of the title bond clearly shews, that <em>Nelson </em>took the surveys from <em>Matthews, for better for worse; </em>and if he has been injured, he must resort to Beverley, upon his warranty, for redress^ according to a rule of law, that, although in <em>personal </em>things you must resort to the vendor, yet, in <em>real, </em>you must rely on the title papers alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">But if any compensation is to be made for deficiency, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ought only to be for 20 acres in the large <em>tract; </em>and that according to the <em>actual </em>value <em>at the time of the contract. </em>The Chancellor has correctly decided, that no allowance should be made for the difference of eight acres between the actual quantity, and that called for in <em>Matthews\u2019 </em>tide-papers ; <em>such deficit being no more than a purchaser in gross might reasonably expect. </em>In that position, he is fortified by the decree of this Court in <em>Quesnel </em>v. <em>Woodlief. </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>When an action is brought upon the warranty, the plaintiff at law goes upon the ground of future disturbance, and has a right to other lands, or as much money as will replace those from which he was evicted. But, on a bill in equity, it is like tiie action, for money had and received; and the complaint is, that the vendor has had the purchase-money for a consideration which happened to fail. The only rule which can be adopted, is, to take the <em>actual </em>damage, which is to be estimated by the money paid with interest. You cannot ascertain the <em>relative </em>value of parcels composing an entire tract: you cannot say that so much money was paid for one part of the land, and so much for another. In the case of <em>Calcraft </em>v. <em>Roebuck,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the purchaser came into a Court of Equity to be relieved on account of <em>two </em>acres, which lay in the centre of the tract, and for which the title proved to be bad. The Chancellor thought that the <em>actual value </em>with interest should be the rule, without regarding the particular situation of the two acres. If the land was really lost on the 11th of <em>February, 1785, </em>that ought to be the period at which damages should be ascertained. If <em>Nelson </em>wants <em>ulterior </em>damages, he must look to <em>Beverley, </em>who warranted the title. <em>Matthews </em>only sold the <em>surveys </em>such as they were.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-8\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aeu\">The only question in the cause respects the rate of compensation; upon which very little need be said. As to the objection, that <em>Nelson </em>bought th land for so many acres <em>more or less, </em>the <em>law </em>has been long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>settled in this country, upon that point, in the case of <em>Quesnel </em>v. <em>Woodlief and othersf.</em><footnotemark><em>(</em>1)</footnotemark> Whenever a man <em>purchases </em>land for \u201c more or less,\u201d he is entitled to the quantity specified, making a reasonable allowance for <em>small </em>in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>accuracies in tbe surveys, and the variation of instruments. Whenever a man <em>sells </em>land in that maimer, be holds out to the purchaser an idea that he has <em>title-deeds </em>for that quantity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGQb\">In the case before the Court, <em>Matthews </em>was to make a title not only to the <em>larger </em>tract, but to the two <em>small sur</em>veys, <em>supposed </em>to contain 200 acres. All that I contend for, is, that <em>Nelson </em>was entitled to <em>all </em>the land contained within the lines of the surveys, and has a right to compensation for .the deficiency. He does not claim for the <em>-whole </em>deficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>less than <em>two hundred </em>acres, but only for that, less than the quantity mentioned in the <em>surveys. </em>If a man sell lands, and describe the boundaries, and there be but <em>one acre </em>within those boundaries from which the purchaser is <em>evicted, </em>there can be no question but he is entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-8\">It is supposed by Mr. Call, that, because this is a case in Chancery, <em>Nelson </em>is not entitled to damages as if it were before a Court of <em>Lazo. </em>Nelson, having a just cause of action, came into equity to be relieved from the judgment at law, and the Court will not compel him to pay the money until compensation be made for the deficiency in the land. <em>Matthews </em>was bound at law, and we are as much entitled to compensation in equity, as if we had been at law.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b185-12\"> 1 <em>Wash. </em>1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AnxC\"> Ibid. 164.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b185-13\"><em> 3 Call, </em>89.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\"> <em>Sugden\u2019s Law of Vendors, </em>201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b187-11\"> Ibid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\"> See <em>note, </em>next page.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em> </em>1 Ves. jun. 361.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b189-3\"> The case above referred to was decided during the period of Mr. <em>Washington\u2019s </em>Reports, but was omitted in his collection.

The parties had been some time in treaty for the land s <em>Woodlief </em>representing it as held by old title-papers, and reputed, by himself as well as former proprietors, to contain at least 800 acres, and <em>\u00a7&gt;uesnd </em>believing that it would hold out that quantity. The land was not <em>re-surveyed by Woodlief, </em>either before he advertised it, or sold it to <em>H&gt;uesnel. </em>After the sale, <em>Woodlief </em>still expressed his belief that the tract contained 800 acres, and <em>Shiesnel </em>accepted a deed for that quantify \u201c <em>more or less.\u201d </em>But, in fact, upon an actual survey, it ivas found to contain only 608 acres, 1 rood, and 13 poles. Before any survey was made, <em>Skuesnel </em>gave a deed of trust upon the same land as containing 800 acres, (without any qualification,) to <em>Harrison </em>as trustee, for the purpose of securing a balance of the purchase-money, part to <em>Woodlief, </em>and part to <em>Bujfin, </em>to whom some of the bonfls of <em>Shyesnel </em>had been assigned. A bill was exhibited by <em>Spuesnel </em>in the High Court of Chancery for an injunction to judgments obtained on some of the said bonds, on the ground of the deficiency in the quantity of the land. The Chancellor, on a final hearing, dismissed the bill \u2022 and <em>Shtesnel </em>appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeals, where the following decree was pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u201c That the appellee <em>Woodlief, </em>not having surveyed the tract of land in \u201c the bill mentioned called <em>Sion Hill, </em>before he advert\u00ed sed the same for \u201c sale, or sold it to the appellant, but that, supposing there had been an \u201c old survey which he has not produced or referred to, and does not ap- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>\u201c </em>pear in the proceedings in this cause, under which the land had been <em>\u201c </em>long held, as he suggested, by the former proprietors of the said land, \u00ab and estimated by them and him as containing 800 acres, he advertised \u00abit as containing about that quantity, and the appellant was thereby <em>\u201c </em>induced to purchase it, expecting it would contain that full quantity, \u00ab and the appellee, <em>Woodlief, </em>having afterwards asserted his belief \u00ab thereof, occasioned the appellant to accept of a deed for the same as \u201c containing 800 acres <em>more or less; </em>and it appearing from the survey <em>\u201c </em>made by <em>Robert Turnbull, </em>and returned to the High Court of Chan. \u201c eery, pursuant to an order of the said Court in this cause made for ci ascertaining the exact quantity of land in the said tract called <em>Sion \u2018\u2018 Hill, </em>that the same contains only 608 acres, lrood, and 13 perches, <em>\u201c </em>so that both parties were mistaken in the quantity and number of <em>\u201c </em>acres contracted for, the said mistake ought to be rectified in a Court *\u00ab of Equity, and the appellant allowed a deduction <em>from the-price agreed </em>\u201c <em>by him to be given for tbe said land </em>for the deficiency in quantity, that \u201c deficiency being too great for a purchaser to lose under an agreement <em>\u201c </em>for a reputed quantity, notwithstanding the words <em>\u201c more or less,\u201d </em>in. serted in the deed, <em>which should be restricted to a reasonable or usual \u201c allowance for small errors in surveys, and for variations in instruments i \u201c </em>the value of the deficiency when ascertained under the direction and <em>\u201c to </em>the satisfaction of the said High Court of Chancery, to he deducted \u201c from his bonds for the purchase-money in the hands of the appellees, <em>\u201c Woodlief </em>and <em>Ruffin, </em>or either of them, if sufficient to satisfy the same, <em>\u201c </em>and if more than sufficient, the injunction to be dissolved for the resi* \u201c due, but if not sufficient, the appellee <em>Woodlief ta </em>be decreed to refund\u00ed \u201c it with interest,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">Decree of the High Court of Chancery reversed, and cause remanded to the said Court for a final decree, according to the principles of this decree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-9\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Wednesday, <em>March </em>30. The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b191-10\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AfJ\">Nelson, who was at that time a resident of Richmond, purchased of <em>Matthews </em>a tract of land in <em>Augusta </em>County, said by him to contain <em>572 </em>acres, which he held by deed ; with a valuable mill and other improvements thereon, together with two surveys adjoining the former tract, the quantity not known at the time of the bargain, but supposed to contain about 200 acres. A deficiency in all three of these tracts being suggested by <em>Nel</em>son, who brought a bill in Chancery to be relieved from a judgment obtained on one of the bonds given by him for the purchase-money, the Chancellor directed a survey ; and also an estimate of the value of the two small surveys, as connected with, and as an appendage to the larger tract on the day of the bargain, and also on the day the money became due upon the bond. The commissioners made a special report, by which it appeared that the larger tract contained only 544 acres, and that the conveyance for the same from <em>R. Lockart </em>to <em>Sampson </em>and <em>George Matthews </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>was for <em>552 </em>acres only ; that one of the small surveys for 44 acres was entirely lost ; and that 51 acres of the other small survey, were in fact comprehended within the lines of the large tract i they then report the <em>average </em>value of each parcel on the days before mentioned ; together with their opinion as to the relative value of the small tracts as an appendage to the large one. The Chancellor pronounced a decree that <em>Nelson </em>was entitled to a discount for 20 acres, the difference between the quantity expressed in <em>Lockarfs </em>deed to Matthews, and in that of <em>Matthews </em>to <em>Nelson ; </em>but not for the deficiency of eight, such deficiency not being more than a purchaser in gross might reasonably expect <em>; </em>and that the plaintiff was further entitled to a discount for the value of the 44 acres, and 51 acres which ought to be fixt according to the value at the time of the contract, and not at any subsequent period. And according to their real, and not their relative value; with some farther discounts not contested in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A1N\">If the quantity in each separate tract had been exactly that which the parties supposed at the time of the contract, and the real value of each tract respectively had at that time corresponded with the valuation by the commissioners, the appellant would have got 572 acres, of the value of 6 dollars and 75 cents each ; 44 acres of the value of 4 dollars, and 156 acres, of the value of 2 dollars and 25 cents each, amounting in the whole to 4,388 dollars and 50 cents, the average value of which would be 5 dollars and 68 cents and nearly one half a cent; at which rate I conceive the complainant ought to be allowed a deduction upon 115 acres, the quantity deficient, and with this amendment, I think the decree ought to be affirmed, in the same manner as was done in the case of <em>Pendleton </em>v. <em>Vandevier.</em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">It may not be amiss to add, that there appeal's to have been no actual specification made at the time of the contract, of the quality, or separate value of these several parcels of land, by the seller to the buyer.' They were repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>rented as adjoining each other, and <em>Nelson </em>probably thought, the quality of all three the same in general. Upon these grounds I think the <em>average </em>value of the whole, as estimated by the commissioners taken together, is the proper rate at which the allowance for the deficiency ought to be made; that deficiency arising in part from the interlocking of the smaller tracts with the larger, as well as from a want of quantity within the actual boundaries of the lands. If indeed there had been the full quantity of the land in each tract, and <em>Nelson </em>had been evicted of a part of it by a title superior to that of <em>Matthews, </em>the proper estimate of his damages would have beeti according to the actual value of the <em>land recovered; </em>for then it might have been precisely known: but it is impossible, in the present case, to ascertain the value of the <em>deficiency in quantity </em>otherwise than by reference to the average value of the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">I concur also in thinking the Chancellor perfectly right in fixing the value of the deficiency, at the time of the contract. Whereas, if the money had been paid, and then tha purchaser had been evicted by a superior title, I should have thought the value ought to have been fixed, as it-might have been at the time of the eviction.</p>\n<author id=\"b193-4\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AxO\">The decree of the Chancellor is right so far as it considers the <em>actual </em>value of the lost land, and the <em>time </em>of the purchase, as affording the proper standard for estimating the compensation in this case. If the question of compensation were now submitted to a Jury on ah issue of <em>quantum damnifeatus, </em>the <em>actual </em>value would alone be regarded, and not the value which may have been set upon the land by the purchaser, or the price lie agreed to give for it. So with respect to the <em>time, </em>the date of the purchsj.se gives the rule: the loss existed from that time, -and the value of that loss with interest gives the true measure of compensation <em>\u00a1 </em>unless indeed there were such spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>cial circumstances in the case, as Would make it proper <em>to </em>depart from that criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"AHd\">I differ, however, from the Chancellor, in supposing that the average value of the land lost in the <em>several </em>tracts, taken separately, gives the rule. For any thing known to its, the lands in question, although contained in three tracts, Were considered as one tract, and purchased in gross. This is the more probable, because,- as they adjoin, they in truth do form but one tract. Their being held by separate rights makes no difference. I cannot differ this case, then, from the general case of the purchase of a tract of land, in which a deficiency is found to exist, and in which the-average value of the whole tract gives the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">There may be circumstances in which this general rule Ought to be departed from, and in which the loss Ought to be considered in a <em>relative </em>point of view. This <em>{in the opinion of the commissioners') </em>is one of those cases; but from the plaintiff\u2019s own shewing it is not such a case. He does not State that the lost land, now in question, formed a particular inducement with him to make the <em>purchase; </em>on the contrary, he says, \u201c that he had <em>never viewed </em>the land, bu<em>t </em>relied on the information of <em>Matthews </em>as to <em>quantity and boundaries A </em>He does not even say that he asked or received any information as to <em>quality </em>and <em>description. </em>Not having asked this, he submits, in case of deficiency, to Stand upon the general ground. That ground is a <em>safe </em>one, inasmuch as it gives the <em>average </em>value of an article purchased in gross; whereas, when we inquire into the <em>relative </em>value, we enter into a <em>very </em>extensive field, where much is left to opinion, and in which there are no certain <em>data </em>to go by. I am far from saying, however, that that standard is -in no instance to be resorted to. I only say, that,- in this case, I see no reason to depart from the general principle. X am therefore of opinion to reform the decree by resorting to the average value per acre of the <em>whole </em>land purchased, and to affirm it for the residue.</p>\n<author id=\"b195-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>J adgc Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AGS\">Two important questions seem to \u25a0arise in this'case : 1st. Whether the compensation to be made for the deiiciencv in the quantity of land, be accord-mg to the value m the year 1785, when the contract was made, or according to the value in the year 1798, when the commissioners made their first estimate: and, 2dly, Whether such compensation be according to the real op relative value of the lands lost to the purchaser?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">With respect to the first point, I have no difficulty in saying, that I think it ought to be according to the value in February, 1785, the time of the original contract, and not at any subsequent day; because the compensation ought to be in proportion to the price given for the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The second point seems to be attended with more difficulty, and I was at first inclined to think that there ought to be a liberal allowance for the 44 acres of timbered land adjoining the large tract, on the north-west, stated by the commissioners on their first view, to have been worth four dollars per acre in the month of February, 1785, (the time of the contract,) and which was totally lost to the purchaser; but, on conferring with the other Judges, and\u00f3n more mature reflection on the subject, \u2014 it appearing from the record that the appellant contracted for 772 acres, in the whole, for the gross sum of 3,000/. without noticing any improvements on the old tract, or any peculiar advantage to be derived from any particular part of the purchase ; -and it not appearing that the 44 acres of timbered land was any inducement to die contract; of which it is probable <em>Nelson </em>was totally ignorant at the time, as the contract was made in <em>Richmond; </em>the most equitable way of doing justice between the parties seems to be to average the deficiency of 115 acres, at 5 dollars and 68 cents per acre, being the average value per acre of the whole land contracted for; which will give 1 dollar and 68 cents per acre for the 44 acres, and 3 dollars and 43 cents per acre for the 71 acres deficient in the survey adjoining the old tract on the south-east, more than they are stated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>commissioners in their first report to hare been worth in <em>Februanu </em>1735; making in the whole an allowance for de<em>J} </em>\u00b0 , ficiencj-, of the sum of 648 dollars and 7 cents, which is 205 dollars 63 cents more than was allowed by the decree ; with interest at 5 per cent, per annum to the first of April, amounts to-402 dollars 18 cents. I am of opinion that the decree ought to be reversed, so far as it respects the compensation for the deficiency in the land contracted fb?, and reformed according to the principles of the decree which has been agreed upon in conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">The following was entered as the decree of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">46 This .day came the parties by their counsel, and the. i4 Court having maturely considered the transcript of the 44 record of the decree aforesaid, and the arguments of 44 counsel, is of opinion, that the said decree is erroneous \u00cd4' in this, that it allows only the sum of four hundred and 44 forty-four dollars and forty-four cents, with interest 44 thereon from the first day of October, 1788, as a coinpe.nsation for the deficiency of pne hundred and fifteen acres \u201c in the land contracted for by and between the said parties \u201c on the eleventh day of February, 1785, <em>but that there is </em>44 <em>no other error in the said decree. </em>Therefore it is de44 creed, and ordered, that so much thereof as is above, 4i stated tq be erroneous be reversed and annulled, and if that the residue thereof be affirmed, and that the appel- \u201c lees pay to .the appellant his costs by him expended in ?4 the prosecution of his appeal, aforesaid here.
