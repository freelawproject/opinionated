A bill is filed to have an account taken. The items of the account are simple contract claims, except one, of a bond executed by the defendant to the plaintiff,- and of which the defendant had taken possession without the consent of the plaintiff. The defendant, in his answer, sets up simple contract claims against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>plaintiff, of the same date with the plaintiff\u2019s; and also pleads the statute of limitations in bar of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. The bar of the statute being allowed as to the simple contract claims of the plaintiff, the defendant Is not entitled to set off his simple contract claims against his bond.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A1uR\">8. In such a case, the Court should give the plaintiff a decree for the amount of the bond with interest.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">In 1813, <em>Thomas Turner </em>employed <em>William White </em>as a miller; and a written contract was entered into between them, by which it was agreed, that <em>White </em>should have one third of the profits of the mill, and should bear one third of the expenses. <em>White </em>continued in the employment of <em>Turner </em>under this contract, until 1815; and they then attempted to make a final settlement of their accounts. At that time, besides other claims upon <em>Turner, White </em>held his bond which then amounted, principal and interest, to 95 dollars 17 cents. The parties not being able to agree, <em>Turner </em>made a statement of the claims which <em>White </em>held upon him, amounting to 679 dollars 2 cents, which he signed and gave to <em>White, </em>after endorsing upon it, that there were offsets to which he was entitled, to be credited upon that sum ; and he took possession of the bond, and other evidences of debt which <em>White </em>held upon him, without <em>White\u2019s </em>consent. <em>White </em>then brought an action at law against <em>Turner, </em>in the Superior Court for the county of <em>Fauquier, </em>for the amount which <em>Turner </em>had stated to be due to <em>White.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\">After <em>White </em>had brought his action at law against <em>Turner, Turner </em>instituted a suit in equity against <em>While; </em>and in his bill he charged that <em>White </em>had not accounted for all the profits which had come into his hands; and, also, had not accounted for all the wheat which <em>Turner </em>had delivered at the mill, from his own farm; and he asked for a settlement of the accounts between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-8\"><em>White </em>answered the bill, denying the charges of delinquency on his part; and expressing himself not only willing but anxious for a settlement of their accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Whilst the suits were pending, by agreement of the parties, an order referring the accounts to arbitrators, was made in both of them; but the arbitrators never acted; an(j the order was, by consent, set aside. This last or-^er was entered in the suit in Fredericksburg, in May 1826; and in September 1827, the accounts were referred to a commissioner; but before the account was taken, <em>Turner, </em>in April 1828, dismissed the suit. The order of reference was set aside in the action in <em>Fauquier </em>in November <em>1827; </em>and the cause coming on for trial in September 1831, and it appearing that <em>White\u2019s </em>demand was founded in part upon transactions growing out of a partnership, he was compelled to suffer a nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">In November 1833, <em>White </em>instituted this suit in equity against <em>Turner, </em>in the Superior Court of <em>Fauquier, </em>setting out the facts as herein before stated, and asking for an account, and for general relief. <em>Turner </em>filed his answer, relying upon the facts stated in his bill, that <em>White </em>had not properly accounted for all the profits of the mill, and the wheat which <em>Turner </em>had delivered thereat, from his own farm. Subsequently, he asked leave to amend his answer for the purpose of pleading the statute of limitations in bar of the plaintiff\u2019s <em>claim; </em>and whilst this motion was pending, the Judge of the <em>Fauquier </em>Superior Court, conceiving that it was not proper for him to sit in the cause, transferred it to the Superior Court for <em>Spottsylvania. </em>After the cause had been removed, the motion to amend the answer came on to be heard, in the absence of <em>White\u2019s </em>counsel, when the Court allowed the amended answer, setting up the statute of limitations as a bar to the claim, to be filed; and the clerk, thereupon, entered a general replication to the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-6\">In May 1837, the cause came on to be heard, when the Court held that the statute of limitations was a bar to the account prayed, except as to the bond for 95 dollars 17 cents, of which <em>Turner </em>had taken possession; and except so far as might be necessary to shew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Turner </em>had offsets against that bond, or had discharged it. And the Court directed a commissioner to enquire and report whether there was any thing due upon the bond; and whether <em>Turner </em>had any offsets against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\">The admission of the amended answer, and the decree of the Court having been made in the absence of <em>While </em>and his counsel, he applied to the Court for a rehearing of the cause upon both <em>orders; </em>but the application was denied. Soon after this, <em>Turner </em>died, and the suit was revived against <em>Eliza C. </em>Turner, as his executrix j and then <em>While </em>obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-5\"><em>Morson, </em>for the appellant, and Moncure, for the appellee, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b525-6\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AuD\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The Court is of opinion, that the act of limitations relied on by the testator of the appellee in his amended answer, is a bar to the account prayed by the bill, except as to the bond of the said testator to the appellant of 95 dollars 17 cents in the proceedings mentioned. The Court is further of opinion, that as it is not pretended by the testator of the appellee the said bond has been discharged or paid, except so far as the same might be shewn to be extinguished by the allowance of offsets constituting distinct or unconnected claims against the appellant, and it furthermore appearing that such offsets were simple contract claims of the testator of the appellee, cotemporaneous with the simple contract claims of the appellant, it would be improper to go into an account of such offsets on the part of the appellee, so as to extinguish the bond, without at the same time permitting the appellant to prove his counter offsets against such offsets attempted to be adduced 'by the appellee; and thus the parties would be driven into an account of stale transactions, which it was the object of the testator of the appellee, by the defence of the statute of li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>mitations relied on in his amended answer, to avoid. The Court is of opinion, that as by that defence he has been protected from any charge growing out of the accounts barred by the statute, and as the accounts between the parties were cotemporaneous, and grew out of . . .. the same transactions and dealings, no account ot said transactions so barred by the statute, should have been directed for any purpose; and that upon the pleadings and proofs in the cause, as it appeared the bond aforesaid was improperly taken by the testator of the appellee, and the possession thereof still withheld from the appellant, the Court, instead of directing an account of offsets, should at once have rendered a decree in favour of the appellant, for the amount thereof, with interest thereon from the 10th July 1815; that being about the end of the second year for which the appellant held the mills, about which period the attempt was made to <em>settle the </em>accounts, and said bond was taken into his possession by the testator of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The decree is therefore reversed with costs to the appellant ; and this Court proceeding to make such decree as the Court below ought to have made, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the appellant recover of the appellee the sum of 95 dollars <em>17 </em>cents, with interest thereon from the 10th day of July 1815, until paid, and his costs, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
