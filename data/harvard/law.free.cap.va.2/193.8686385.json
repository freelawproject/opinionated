One of the first principles of law is, that a verdict between <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>cannot be given in evidence against <em>C. </em>The reason is, that a party shall not be bound by a verdict, who had no opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses. .The principle applies with peculiar force, in the present case, because no defence was made by <em>Mayes. </em>On this point, which he considered as decisive of the cause, he did not think it necessary to adduce authorities. Such a practice was never adopted before, and would be a prostration of every idea of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-9\">2dly. Though he admitted, that <em>hearsay </em>testimony, was properly received to prove the <em>descent </em>of <em>Isabell </em>from <em>Nanny, </em>yet he objected to the introduction of <em>G. K.

This record was offered <em>not as con</em>clusive, but only as <em>persuasive </em>evidence; and therefore the opinion of the Court in admitting it, is not in hostility with the case of <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Barbour,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which amounts to nothing more than that a verdict cannot be given in evidence, as <em>conclusive, </em>except between parties and privies. The record was the highest evidence, of that <em>particular </em>fact, that <em>Nanny </em>had <em>recovered </em>her freedom, and, if there had been a suggestion of any fraud in obtaining the verdict, it should have been shewn. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-8\">The objections that the verdict was not between <em>parties </em>or privies, and that there was no. opportunity of cross-expmining the witnesses, only apply to. those cases, where a a verdict was introduced as <em>conclusive </em>evidence: but, <em>in this case, </em>the record was. offered as <em>circumstantial </em>or <em>persuasive </em>evidence pnly. It was only offered to prove the fact that <em>Nanny </em>was free; from which fact such inferences might be drawn as the law would permit. Several authorities recognize this distinction.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> This is like the common case of an action upon the warranty of a slave or. other personal property. The plaintiff, as evidence of the recovery by a <em>third </em>person, introduces the record, containing the proceedings in the former suit. In that - case, as in this, it is competent to the defendant to say, that the verdict was obtained by <em>collusion;, </em>but the verdict is always considered evidence of the <em>fact </em>of a recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-9\">In <em>Hudgins </em>v. <em>Wrights</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>one piece of evidence relied on by the plaintiff below was., that <em>John </em>the brother of Hannah, daughter to, the female ancestor, under, whom the plaintiff claimed, had brought a suit for his freedom. \u2014 . No particular decision was made on that point, but it was mentioned by one of the Judges<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> as an auxiliary circumstance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>That the verdict in the case of <em>Nanny and others </em>against <em>Hayes, </em>was rendered on a <em>writ of inquiry, </em>makes no difference <em>in point of reason, </em>when it is considered for what object it was introduced. The legitimation of <em>Nanny, </em>however, appears as fully from it, as if there had been the most formal pleadings; and the inference is, that <em>Mayes </em>knew he-had no right to detain her in slavery, and therefore thought a defence unnecessary. But <em>Mr. Taylor </em>expressly proves that testimony was given on the trial as to <em>Nanny\u2019s </em>descent from a female Indian imported since 1705. Nor does it make any difference, <em>in point of law, </em>whether the verdict was rendered upon an issue or writ of inquiry.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-4\">It is admitted, by <em>Mr. Hay, </em>that hearsay evidence is sufficient to prove a <em>pedigree, </em>but not the particular <em>quality </em>or <em>character </em>of the parties. This record was not introduced as an independent piece of testimony, but as connected with, and explained by <em>Mr. Taylor\u2019s. His </em>evidence, as to title, was nothing more than what ancient people, who were dead, had said about the ancestor of <em>Nanny. </em>Butin <em>Jenkins </em>v <em>Tom and others,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court affirmed the principle that hearsay evidence was admissible a3 to the <em>quality </em>or <em>character </em>of the parties. [On the doctrine of hearsay evidence, the <em>Attorney-General </em>referred to <em>Peake\u2019s Law of Evidence, </em>p. 11. and to the same author, p, <em>50. </em>to shew that what a witness, who was since dead, had swore to at a former trial, might be given in evidence.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">It maybe said that it is not proved the witness was dead. <em>31r. Taylor </em>says that he <em>believes </em>those facts were proved by the'testimony of <em>Francis Coleman, </em>who, he believes, is since dead. This goes as far as was necessary, to admit the evidence. The witness was a very old man, and this circumstance fortifies the belief of <em>Mr. Taylor, </em>that he was dead.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-12\"><em>Hay, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXu\">said that his first objection was founded on the general principle, that a verdict was only evidence between parties and privies. This rule is laid down in <em>Peake\u2019s Law of Evidence, </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and the reason there given can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>not be controverted. And yet it is contended that the ver* chct, or rather the <em>inquest, </em>between <em>Nanny </em>and <em>Mayes, </em>e^c\u201cence :'n the case of <em>Isahell </em>and <em>Pegram. </em>Though <em>Nanny </em>might have been entitled to her freedom, it did not necessarily follow, that <em>Isahell </em>was entitled to her\u2019s; for <em>Nanny\u2019s </em>right to freedom might have accrued after <em>Isabell </em>was born.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-6\">But even though a <em>verdict </em>on an <em>issue </em>may in certain cases be evidence, yet it does not follow that an <em>inquest </em>may ; because, where a verdict is rendered on an <em>issue, </em>the <em>matter of fact </em>is found by a Jury, but, on <em>a,-writ of inquiry., </em>they are <em>bound </em>to find for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-7\">If it be inferred, from the circumstance of <em>Mayes\u2019s </em>making no defence, that it was a concession on his part that <em>Nanny </em>was entitled to her freedom ; still it was only binding on him and those claiming under him; but could not affect others. This is an important question. For, if it be once established that the confession of one man may bind others, a door will be opened to fraud, and emancipation, even in defiance of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\">But it is said, the record was introduced oi\u00edly as <em>circumstantial </em>evidence, When it got into Court, however, it was acted on as <em>conclusive </em>evidence: the defendant had a record exhibited against her of which she had never heard' before; and, because she was not prepared to prove that the verdict was fraudulently obtained, it was permitted to Operate against her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">In support of this case, that of <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>has been relied on. That case only proves that between parties and privies, the verdict <em>is conclusive. </em>This doctrine is. not denied; and is so laid down in all the books. But because the Court said, the verdict was <em>conclusive </em>evidence, between parties and privies, it was inferred that it is <em>circum stantial </em>evidence between others. A more correct inference would be, that it is' <em>no evidence at all. </em>In that case too, the verdict being <em>against </em>the mother after a full hearing of the cause, \"it might be giv\u00e9n in evidence by any person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>prove her descendants to be slaves, on the ground that <em>partus scquitur ventrem; </em>but it would have been otherwise if the verdict had been <em>for </em>her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-4\">The cases cited by the <em>Attorney-General </em>only prove that there are exceptions to the general rule ; but, unless he can shew that his case comes within those exceptions, they will not avail him. The principal point in the case of Lee, <em>executor </em>of Daniel, v. Cooke, was, that an action would lie against the <em>executor </em>of a covenantor, though his <em>heirs </em>only were named in the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\">On the 2d position, he contended that what a witness, who is dead, swore to on a former trial between <em>other </em>parties could not he given in evidence j but if between the <em>same </em>parties, it might, for a very obvious reason; because both parties had an opportunity of cross-examining. The Very book referred to by the <em>Attorney-General,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is conclusive authority, that such testimony is only admissible when it was given between the <em>same parties. </em>The evidence of <em>Mr. Taylor </em>ought not to have been admitted, <em>on another ground </em>,- because he did not know whether the witness was dead or not.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AIc\"> See vol. 1.p. 387.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\"><em> </em>2 <em>Wash. </em>64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b212-11\"> 1 <em>Wash. </em>306.

The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b215-9\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"Av58\">This was a suit for freedom, brought in the District Court of <em>Petersburg. </em>The pauper gave in evidence her descent in the maternal line, from <em>Nanny, </em>who recovered her freedom in that Court in 1799 against <em>Stephen Mayes, </em>fay judgment on a writ of inquiry, there being-no defence; and also gave evidence to prove, that on the execution of that writ of inquiry, (the record in which case was also offered in evidence, and admitted by the Court,) it was deposed by a witness, (whose name the present witness, Mr. <em>Taylor, </em>did not particularly recollect, but whom he believes to have been one <em>Francis Coleman, </em>a very old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>man, who, he <em>believes, </em>but does not <em>positively </em>know, <em>la </em>since dead,) that <em>Nanny </em>was descended, according to general reputation, in the maternal line, from an <em>Indian </em>ancestor, imported into this State since the year 1705. And further, that he (being the counsel assigned the pauper) had endeavoured to no purpose, to find a <em>living </em>witness, who might prove the same point in the present cause. And thereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the introduction of that record and evidence, because the defendant was not proved to hold or claim under, or in any other manner to be privy to the said <em>Stephen </em>Mayes, in that record mentioned; and because no issue was made up in that suit, whereby the title to the freedom of <em>Nancy </em>was brought into question. The Court overruled the objection, and admitted both the record and parol evidence to go to the Jury, liable to be rebutted by other opposing evidence and circumstances. Upon which there was a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The <em>general </em>rule as to giving verdicts and judgments in evidence is, that they are not to be admitted but between parties, or <em>privies, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But there are exceptions to this as well as to all other general rules. Among others, it is said, that where the fact is to be proved is such, whereof <em>hearsay </em>and <em>reputation </em>are evidence, a special verdict between other parties, stating a pedigree would be evidence to prove a descent; for, in such case, what any of the family who are dead have been heard to say, <em>or the general reputation </em>of the family, entries in family books, &amp;c. are a allowed.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> I find it also mentioned as a rule, that nobody can take <em>benefit </em>by a verdict that would not have been <em>prejudiced </em>by it, had it gone contrary.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> Whether the converse ! of this rule, viz. that whosoever might be <em>prejudiced </em>by a <em>) </em>verdict, if one way, shall be entitled to the <em>benefit </em>of it, if to the contrary, also holds, I have not been able to meet with any authority that has decided. I may, perhaps, notice this point, after considering the two exceptions to \u00a1ho general rule above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>1. The first is, that where the fact to be proved is such whereof hearsay and reputation are evidence, a <em>special verdict </em>between <em>other </em>parties stating a pedigree, would be evidence to prove a descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Among other cases in which hearsay is evidence, Mr. <em>Espinasse</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>mentions cases concerning legitimacy, cases of pedigree, and cases of settlement of paupers. As to the first, in a country where marriages are celebrated either by licence or publication of bans ; and where registers are required to be kept, it shews a liberal practice in the Courts to admit of <em>hearsay </em>evidence upon that point. Yet, inasmuch as there must be many marriages celebrated <em>in other </em>countries, the reason of the law prevails to admit hearsay evidence, instead of requiring the bishop\u2019s certificate, or the parish register to be produced. The same may be said as to <em>pedigrees. </em>And both the cases are stronger <em>in this </em>country, (where we have no registers of any kind at present, nor ever had as to persons of colour,) than in <em>England. </em>The case of <em>paupers </em>is also very strong. If then, the doctrine be sound, that a verdict <em>inter alios </em>may be admitted, wherever <em>hearsay </em>evidence is admissible,, we may infer that it is admissible in all these. In this country it has always been admitted in pauper suits for freedom. The whole testimony in the case of. <em>Hudgins </em>v. <em>Wrights </em>was of this <em>nature,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the whole Court concurred in its admissibility and weight. In that case, the circumstance <em>that </em>John, <em>a brother of </em>Hannah, <em>had brought suit for his freedom, </em>was noticed by one of the Court in giving his opinion. Would it not have been competent for that circumstance, coupled with the other evidence in the cause, to have been offered in evidence to a Jury ? And if so, is there any reason why a fact of that nature should not be proved by the highest evidence, namely, the record of his recovery. And, if such collateral and presumptive proof were admissible, where the party recovering was merely a collateral kinsman, would not similar proof, of a similar recovery by a lineal female ancestor, be also admissible <em>l</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>How far a verdict <em>inter alios </em>is admissible, either as <em>conclusive </em>or only as <em>presumptive </em>evidence in suits respecting freedom, I think may be shewn by the following case : A female held in slavery recovers her freedom by judgment in the Court of one County or District: she removes to another County or District, without a certificate of her freedom; is taken up as a runaway; advertised and sold as such under the act concerning runaways. She brings another suit for her freedom against her new master. Can it be required of her to do more than produce the former record of her recovery, with an averment that she is the same person ? I conceive not, and that such record is conclusive evidence <em>against all the -world; </em>unless the judgment can be impeached by a person whose title was <em>antecedent </em>to that recovery, on the ground of fraud and collusion between herself and the defendant against whom she had <em>recovered; </em>or whose title <em>was\u2018paramount </em>to that of the defendant, and who would not have fyeen barred by the act of limitations, if he had brought an action of detinue for her as his slave. Now let us suppose, at the time she was apprehended as a runaway, and sold, she had a child with her, who should also be sold as a slave. Would it not be competent to this child to produce the record of her mother\u2019s recovery, and aver that she was bom after, the commencement of that suit, or the day of the writ purchased. And, if she proved this, would not the record be <em>conclusive evidence </em>in her favour against <em>all the -world, </em>except as before mentioned. And, if it would be conclusive evidence in that case, as I hold it would, could she not avail herself of that record as <em>circmnstantial </em>evidence, to prove her right to freedom under a <em>prior </em>right thereto, in, her mother, if the child should happen to be born <em>before </em>instead of <em>after </em>the writ purchased in that suit ? I am decidedly of that opinion also. For if she could be let in to prove the fact that her mother was a free woman by <em>hearsay </em>testimony, ought she not to be let in to prove it by a <em>judgment P </em>Since every judgment in favour of any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>furnishes a conclusion <em>in lazo, </em>that the person obtaining it is free, and not a slave ?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">On these grounds, I am of opinion, that the record in the suit between <em>Nanny and others </em>and <em>Stephen Mayes, </em>was <em>admissible </em>evidence upon the trial of the suit between the present parties, although the defendant doth not claim a title to the plaintiff as his slave, under <em>Mayes. </em>But, although I am of this opinion, I cannot concur with the District Court to the extent of the opinion delivered by them, \u201c that it should go to the Jury as evidence, <em>that Nanny </em>\u201c <em>was free as being descended in the maternal line from an </em>\u201c <em>Indian ancestor, imported into this state, since the year </em>\u201c <em>1705 </em>j\u201d for the record contains no such fact as that: but. it is conclusive evidence <em>to </em>prove that <em>Nanny </em>was either a free woman, or entitled to be so, the day of the emanation of the writ in that suit; and this fact it was competent to the plaintiff <em>Isabell </em>to prove by the record, if it can avail her cause. I am therefore of opinion, that the judgment must for this reason be reversed, and a new trial had in the suit, in which the record between <em>Nanny and others </em>and <em>Stephen Mayes, </em>may be admitted as evidence that <em>Nanny, </em>one of the plaintiffs in that suit, was a free woman, or entitled to her freedom on the day of the emanation of the writ in that suit; leaving it open to both parties to shew upon what ground that judgment was rendered; and also whether the present plaintiff was born before or after the emanation of the writ in that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">I am also of opinion, that the evidence of Mr. <em>George Keith Taylor </em>was properly admitted; as he states his be-x.xee, although he did not positively <em>know, </em>that the witness alluded to by him was dead; and that it ought to be admitted on the new trial in this case, unless it shall appear to the Court that the witness is still living, and may be had.</p>\n<author id=\"Agm\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AXI\">In giving my opinion upon this case, I frill premise two positioxxs;</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>1st. That if any part of the evidence in this case, that is material, has been received when it ought to have been rejected ; or received to have a greater effect than it ought to have, the judgment of the Court below must be reversed, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">And 2dly, That although liberty is to be favoured, \u201c the \u201c Court cannot, on that or any other favoured subject, \u201c infringe the settled rules of Iaw.\u201d<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> In that case it was held, in conformity to this principle, that a verdict between parties and privies, finding the mother of the plaintiff to be a slave, was conclusive evidence against him, as much as a verdict finding her to be <em>free </em>would have operated in his favour. This decision, therefore, shuts out the pretence that we can, in this case, take a greater latitude in relation to the rules of evidence, than in any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Bearing in mind these positions^ let us examine the case before us,</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">The eyidence excepted to in this case, was twofold: 1st, That of <em>Geo. K. </em>Taylor, given at the trial; and 2dly. That of the record in the case of <em>Nanny </em>v. <em>Mayes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">As <em>to </em>the question concerning the testimony of Mr. Taylor, in the view I have taken of the subject, it is not absolutely necessary to be decided, As at present advised, however, I haye no hesitation to say, that as hearsay evidence, and that of general reputation is admissible in relation to pedigrees, especially where the point to be proved is of ancient standing, and as the witness in question declares, \u201c that he had endeavoured to no purpose tp find a \u201c <em>living zvitness </em>to prove the same point in the present \u201c case,\u201d &amp;c. his account of what was proved by an old witness in the trial of <em>Nanny </em>v. <em>Mayes, </em>and who under the1 above circunistances is to be accounted dead,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> was rightly received, (so far as it goes to prove that <em>Nanny </em>was descended from a reputed <em>Indian </em>ancestor,) although he does not particularly recollect the name of the witness, nor know positively that such witness is since dead. Under these circumstances, this testimony is probably the best that thp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>nature of the case will admit, and is better than mere hearsay testimony, inasmuch as it was given in upon oath, although it was not between the <em>same </em>parties, nor upon a point decided, or necessary to be decided by the Jury. This point was not necessary to be decided by the Jury in that case, because the plaintiff\u2019s right to freedom was <em>admitted </em>by the default of the defendant. This case, however, is at least as strong as that put in the case of <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Moss </em>of an <em>answer in </em>Chancery, given by the mother in a suit between <em>other </em>parties, but which was received merely as evidence <em>under her </em>hand,, of her having made a declaration touching the legitimacy of her child. Whether the <em>general reputation </em>spoken of in this deposition is competent not only to fix the fact of the identity of the ancestor, but also that this ancestor was an \u201c <em>Indian brought into </em>\u201c <em>this country since the year </em>1705,\u201d I am not entirely prepared to say. I believe that this point has never yet been decided by this Court. In the case of <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Dick and </em>Pat, this point was <em>found </em>by the Jury; whereas the <em>verdict </em>in question finds nothing but the damages submitted to them, upon the writ of inquiry; and in the cases of <em>Jenkins v. </em>Tom, &amp;c. and <em>Hudgins </em>v. Wrights, testimony was given respecting the <em>appearance </em>of the persons in question, which afforded <em>data </em>whereby the Jury and Court were respectively enabled to decide whether they were <em>Indians </em>or not. In this case, those <em>data </em>are not afforded, and the question is, whether by reason of the antiquity of the transaction, we can dispense with those data, and let in proof of these facts by general reputation. I am disposed to think we may, from the necessity of the case, and the impossibility of obtaining better testimony. It is, besides, not easy to conceive that this <em>general reputation </em>would ever have arisen unless these <em>data </em>had existed <em>at the time </em>of the origin of the transaction, to the general satisfaction of the neighbourhood; unless it had been clearly known to them, that the ancestor in question was brought into this country <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>about the time mentioned in the testimony, and mol cover had the entire <em>appearance </em>of an <em>Indian.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6V\">As to the next point, it does not concern any <em>evidence </em>offered at the trial in the case of <em>Nanny </em>v. Mayes, nor any <em>verdict </em>rendered in the cause upon the very point now in question; but it submits this question to the Court, whether the <em>record </em>in that suit should go in evidence to the Jury, to prove that <em>Nanny </em>was free \u201c <em>by reason of being </em>\u201c <em>descended in the maternal line from an Indiaii ancestor </em>\u201c <em>imported into this state since the year </em>1705and the Court upon this point decided in the affirmative. If the question submitted by the appellee and decided upon by the Court had been merely that <em>Nanny </em>had recovered her freedom, the opinion had been correct, and then the appellee\u2019s case might have been made complete, by proof that she was born since such recovery was had. In that case, that record would not be given in evidence to proye the <em>appellee's </em>right to freedom, but her <em>mother's </em>right to freedom, and her case would have been made complete, on the principle <em>partus sequitur </em>ventrem, by shewing that she was born after such recovery was had: or she might have rested her claim to freedom <em>dehors </em>that record, and relied on the evidence stated by Mr. Taylor, to recover it, on the same ground that her mother had claimed hers. But the question propounded and decided is, that the record proves that <em>Nanny </em>recovered her freedom, \u201c <em>as being descended </em>\u201c <em>from an Indian ancestor,\" </em>&amp;c. For any thing appearing in the record, the acknowledgment of the defendant, by means of which she recovered, might have been through mere inattention, or predicated on the ground of her having been <em>legally emancipated, </em>and not on that of a descent from an <em>\u2019Indian </em>ancestor. She-recovered her freedom by the default of the defendant and by the judgment of the Court, and not by the verdict of the Jury: the Jury were only charged to inquire of damages. The title set out in the declaration is a mere <em>general one </em>of freedom, and the suffering the judgment by'default, admits it as stated: it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>not admit any <em>specific </em>ground upon which the right of freedom was established: it does not admit that specific ground which is taken by the Court below in the present case, and was taken by the deposition of the aged witness. That testimony was given in, <em>posterior </em>to the confirmation of the judgment. The <em>judgment </em>therefore does not sanction or affirm the fact now in question; nor does the verdict of the Jury; (for <em>it </em>was confined to the mere question of damages <em>;)</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and in truth it only finds \u201c that die plaintiffs have sustained damages, by the occasion in the dcclaration mentioned, to one penny.\u201d Neither the judgment nor the verdict, therefore, have affirmed the particular ground now in question, and necessary to be established on the part of the appellee, and which the District Court supposes it has decided. The evidence stated by Mr. <em>Taylor </em>to have been given, on executing the writ of inquiry, may indeed be used as evidence ; but the <em>record </em>in question proves only this <em>general </em>position, that <em>Nanny </em>recovered her freedom. This would have been sufficient for the appellee, (as I have already said,) if that had <em>also shezvn </em>that she was born <em>since the time of that recovery; </em>but the <em>judgment </em>in question standing singly, proves nothing as to <em>Nanny's </em>right to freedom, anterior to the date of the writ, and affirms no specific ground of recovery; and therefore, although we are not now at liberty to controvert her right to freedom, the judgment in question proves nothing, so as to benefit the appellee; but admitted, in the extent in which it was received, it had a direct tendency to. injure the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">However competent, therefore, a verdict between <em>other </em>parties, and finding <em>% particular </em>fact, whereof reputation is admissible, evidence, might be to establish such fact, it is clear that the verdict and judgment before us, tvas inadmissible under this criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">I cannot well see why the testimony of the old.witness was at all exhibited, unless the writ of inquiry had been set aside, and the question of freedom put in issue; for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>that right was admitted, and the Jury, going for damages* ouS^t t0 have regarded, as they did regard, the established law on that subject, and found only one penny damages. That evidence, however, considered merely as evidence, was proper to be used in <em>this </em>trial, however irrelevant in the former; but as to the record'in question, it stands upon quite a different foundation; it does not prove the particular point for which it was produced, and which the District Court decided it did prove.</p>\n<p id=\"Adl\">On these grounds, therefore, (without going through every point and question made in the argument of the case,) I am of opinion that the judgment of the District Court, so far as it respects the admission of the record in question, in the latitude taken by the Court, was erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b224-6\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax-x\">Although it is admitted, that laws should be liberally construed in favour of the rights of freedom, yet the rights of property ought to be respected and preserved; and it is perhaps attended with difficulty to draw the true line of distinction between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">There are two objections to the opinion of the Court stated in the bill of exceptions in this case:.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">1st. In admitting the record and verdict, in the case of <em>Nanny and others </em>v. Mayes, to go in evidence to the Jury, to prove that the said <em>Nanny </em>was free by reason of her being descended in the maternal line from an <em>Indian </em>ancestor, imported into this state since the year 1705; because the defendant is not proven to hold, or claim under, or in any other manner to be privy to, Mayes, the defendant in the said record mentioned; and because there never was any <em>issue </em>made up in the said suit between <em>Nanny and others </em>and the said Mayes, whereby the title of the plaintiffs to freedom was brought in question, the suit being tried on a writ of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">2dly. In admitting the testimony of <em>Geo. K. </em>Taylor, who proved, that on the trial of the writ of inquiry aforesaid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>It was deposed by a witness, he thinks one Coleman, &amp; very old man, (who he believes is since dead,) that the said <em>Nanny </em>was descended, according to general reputation, in the maternal line, from an <em>Indian </em>ancestor, who was imported into this State since the year 1705, The said <em>Taylor </em>further stated, that he had endeavoured, to no purpose, to find a living witness, who might prove the same point in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">With respect to the first objection, it is a general rule, that no verdict shall be given in evidence, but between Such as were parties in the cause in which the verdict was given, or privies to them, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Sherwin </em>v. <em>Clarges, </em>cited in <em>Buller\u2019s Nisi Prius, </em>232. it is laid down that a verdict on the <em>same pointy </em>and between <em>the same par</em>ties, may be given in evidence, <em>though the lands are not the same, </em>but then the verdict ought to be between the same parties, because otherwise, a man would be bound by a decision, who had hot the liberty to cross-examine : and nothing can be more contrary to natural justice than that any .one should he injured by a determination that he was not at liberty to controvert. And where it is said that a verdict maybe given in evidence between the same parties, it is to be understood with this restriction, <em>that it is of a matter which was in issue in the former cause; </em>for otherwise, it will not be allowed in evidence, because, if such Verdict be false, there is no redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Apply these rules and principles to the case before us <em>t Pegram, </em>the appellant, was neither party nor privy to the suit between <em>Nanny and others </em>v. Mayes, nor is it pretended that she claims title to hold <em>Isabell </em>as a slave under <em>Mayes, </em>and the objection in this case has additional force, from the consideration, that in the former case there never was an <em>issue </em>by which the right of <em>Nanny and others </em>to freedom was brought in question before the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">2. As to the second point, the admission of the testimony of <em>Geo. K. </em>Taylor, it seems correct, and not exceptionable ; because the declarations, especially when made upon oath, of persons uninterested, and who are then dead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>or not to be found, are admissible and proper, in questions concerning legitimacy, or in questions of pedigree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">But the admission of the record in the case of <em>Nanny and others </em>v. Mayes, to go in evidence to the Jury, seems to me an error not to be gotten over ,\u2022 unless it had been qualified with an instruction that it should be considered only as evidence that <em>Nanny </em>had obtained her freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">In the case of <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Barbour,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was mentioned in the argument, the record in a suit for freedom, between the mother of the appellee and <em>Robert </em>Harris, was decided by this Court to be not only <em>proper </em>but <em>conclusive </em>evidence; because there was an act of Assembly in-force, declaring that children shall be bond or free, according to the condition of the mother; the verdict which found the mother a slave, was therefore conclusive evidence to prove the son was so, unless rebutted by evidence to proven that the son had been emancipated after his birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">I am of opinion, upon the whole, that the judgment is erroneous, and ought to be reversed,- that the cause be remanded to the District Court for a new trial, with an instruction that the record in the case of <em>Nanny and others </em>v. <em>Mayes, </em>is not to go in evidence to the Jury, unless it be qualified with an instruction that it be considered <em>only </em>as evidence that <em>Nanny </em>had obtained her freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">The opinion of the Court was entered as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">44 This day came the parties by their counsel, arid the \u201c Court having maturely considered the transcript of the 44 record of the judgment aforesaid, and the arguments of 44 counsel, is of opiniori, that the said District Court erred 44 in- permitting the record in the suit between <em>Nanny and </em>44 <em>others </em>and <em>Stephen Mayes </em>to go t\u00f3 the Jury, <em>as evidence </em>44 <em>to prove that the said Nanny was free as being descended </em>44 <em>in the maternal line from an Indian ancestor, imported </em>44 <em>into this Slate since the ye\u00fcr </em>1705; no such fact as that 44 appearing from the said record, in which there is neither 44 plea nor issue, but a judgment by default, and writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u201c inquiry of damages only; and that there is no other error \u201c in the said judgment. Therefore it is considered, that \u201c the said judgment be reversed and annulled. And it is \u201c ordered, that the jurors\u2019 verdict be set aside, and that a \u201c new trial be had of the issue joined between the parlies <em>u </em>in this suit; on which trial the record in the suit between. \u201c <em>Nanny and others </em>and <em>Stephen Mayes </em>shall be admitted \u201c to go to the Juiy as evidence that the said Nanny, one of &lt;c the plaintiffs in the said record mentioned, 'was a free \u201c woman, or entitled to her freedom on the day of the s\u2018 emanation of the writ in that, suit; leaving it open to \u201c both parties to shew, if they can, upon what ground the judgment in that suit was rendered; and also leaving it \u201c to them to shew, if they can, whether the plaintiff <em>Isabett </em>\u2018\u2018 was born before or after the emanation of the writ A that suit.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> <em>Butler's N.
