The bill prays for a discovery, an account ox the assets belonging to the estate of <em>Charles </em>Neale, and for general relief. The appellees, by their answer, deny the justice of the demand, and state several circumstances to shew that the account had been paid by <em>William Neale </em>just before his death. They express their belief that their testator, <em>Charles </em>Neale, never could have assumed the payment, as he had often refused, conceiving the transaction to have been fraudulent. Proof of the execution of the acknowledgment of <em>James Quarles </em>and <em>Charles </em>Neale, is called for, by the appellees ; who admit assets ; rely on the length of time, (no demand having been made of them till the year <em>1795,) </em>andon the survivorship of <em>James Optarles; </em>and state, that although he died insolvent, yet the remedy of the appellant was at law, there being no equitable circumstances to charge <em>Charles Neale, </em>as he was only one of <em>vseven </em>sons of his father, to whom portions of his' estate were given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-10\">At the hearing in <em>March, </em>1803, the Chancellor dismissed the bill, and directed the following entry to be made: \u201c Memorandum, ordered to be certified, that, on the \u201c hearing of this cause, yesterday, the plaintiff by her \u201c counsel offered in Court a witness to prove the hand- \u201c writing of <em>Francis Graves, </em>who was the only witness to \u201c the exhibit stated in the proceedings as an assumpsit of \u201c <em>James Quarles </em>and <em>Charles Neale, </em>and was dead at the \u201c time of commencing this suit; but the defendants by \u201c their counsel objected to the introduction of the witness \u201c first named, <em>because no notice had been given of the </em>in-\" <em>tention to offer testimony to that effect. </em>Whereupon the \u201c Court refused to permit the said witness to be examin- \u201c ed.\u201d The complainant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-11\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahs\">It is the regular practice in the Courts of Equity in <em>England </em>to prove exhibits at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the hearing by <em>viva voce </em>testimony : but, in this country, to save the trouble of witnesses\u2019 attendance, they are usually proved by commission. most cases, they are merely exhibited and inserted among the papers. But if, when an exhibit is introduced, it be objected to, the Court of Chancery ought to permit proof in legal form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-9\">As to the length of time, it was clear that the clause in the will which directed that the testator\u2019s land should be sold for the payment of his debts, created a trust and took the case out of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-10\">Warden, for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB4\">observed that it was only necessary to refer to dates to shew that the decree of the Chancellor was correct in dismissing the appellant\u2019s bill. The claim was clearly barred by the statute of limitations ; and no circumstances existed which would bind the executors of <em>Charles Neale </em>either in equity, or at law. Neither <em>Charles Neale </em>nor <em>James ^liarles </em>who subscribed the account, were executors of <em>William </em>Neale, for whom the services were performed. They were only part of several legatees ; but it does not appear what portion of the estate they received. Their promise was without consideration, and merely <em>nudum pactum ; </em>to which a trust, created in equity by directing lands to be sold for the payment of debts, is never presumed to extend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-12\">But <em>Quarles </em>having survived <em>Charles Nealey </em>the appellant\u2019s remedy, if ever she had any, was gone against the representatives of <em>Charles Neale </em>both at law, and in equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-13\">Randolph, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay4\">There is nothing more clear than that a party has a right to prove his exhibits at the hearing ; and the appellant having been prohibited, in this case, the Court of Chanceiy must have erred.

This, though <em>universal </em>at law, is always <em>qualified </em>in equity. If the person who dies first, is found to be in possession of the property for which the debt grew, his estate will be liable. It is the fund, and not the person, which is regarded in equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-9\">Wickham, as to the same point.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtfC\">The case of <em>Field </em>and <em>Harrison,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>goes so far as to say, that an obligation would not be set up in equity against a <em>surety only. </em>But here, <em>Neale </em>is liable as devisee, and the Court will set up the obligation against him on the ground of assets received from his testator ; <em>Quarles </em>the other obligor being insolvent.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\"> 2 <em>Wash. </em>136.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Friday, <em>March </em>25. The Judges delivered their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b144-11\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AxQ\">The first error which is assigned by the appellant\u2019s counsel to the decree in this cause, is, that the Court did not permit the appellant to prove an exhibit at the hearing by <em>viva voce </em>testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">The exhibit in question was an assumpsit, or promise in writing, purporting to be subscribed by <em>James Qatar les </em>and <em>Charles </em>Neale, and to be attested by <em>Francis Graves ; </em>by which <em>Qttarles </em>and <em>Neale </em>in <em>June, </em>1782, obliged themselves (jointly) to pay an account against the estate of <em>William </em>Neale, deceased, commencing in 1761, and ending in 1768, on or before the 1st day of <em>December </em>then next <em>\", </em>and the counsel for the appellant offered at the hearing, a witness to prove the hand-writing of <em>Francis Graves, </em>the witness to the paper; but not the hand-writing of the parties. On referring to <em>Harrison\u2019s Ch. Pr. </em>p. 596. I find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tbe rule there laid down to be, that to authorise the qxamination of a witness to prove an exhibit at the hearing, an order must be previously obtained for that purpose. No such order had been obtained, nor any notice given of the intention to offer such testimony; I therefore think the witness was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">The second error assigned is, that the promise in writing made by <em>Charles </em>Neale, was made on good consideration, and was binding on him. If <em>Charles Neale </em>had been an executor of his father\u2019s will, this would have been correct ; or if there had been any. devise or legacy to him in the will, on <em>condition </em>that he should pay the debts of the testator. <em>William Neale\u2019s </em>will among the exhibits, directs his executors to sell such part of his estate, either <em>real </em>or personal, as they shall think fit, (with the exception of the land whereon he then lived,) for payment of his debts. That will was proved in 1768, near fourteen years before the date of this pretended assumpsit. There is no proof that <em>Charles Nealeh&amp;d </em>either a larger portion of his father\u2019s estate than the rest of his children, or even any portion whatsoever ; and no <em>consideration </em>whatever is mentioned in the assumpsit; this brings the case to the question decided in this Court between <em>Hite, executor of </em>Smith, and <em>Fielding lewis\u2019s executors, October </em>term, 1804. That was an action founded upon a promise in writing in these words : \u201c I hereby oblige myself, my heirs, executors and 44 administrators, to indemnify Mrs. Smith, (who was ex-44 ecutrix of <em>Charles Smithy </em>for the said <em>Charles Smith\u2019s </em>\u201c becoming security for my son <em>F. S. </em>from any demand 44 which <em>E. I). </em>ike* may haye against the executors of 44 Captain <em>Smith </em>on that account, provided the sum does <em>\u201c </em>not exceed two hundred pounds,\u201d to which he subscribed his name in the presence of a witness. And a majority of this Court, consisting then of five Judges, decided it to be a <em>nudum pactum. </em>And though I was not one of that majority, I consider the question as settled by that decision, and as deciding this case ; there being no equitable cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>cumstances in the record, that I can discover, to make such apromise, as this is alleged to have been, bindingupon either of the parties who are said to have subscribed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">But, even were this point in favour of the appellant, it appears that <em>james Quarles, </em>who subscribed the paper at the same time, <em>survived Charles Neale-, </em>so that, according to the decision of this Court in <em>Johnson v. Richardson,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the death of the latter discharged his estate. And there are-no equitable grounds that I can discover to charge it further in equity, than it was chargeable at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">As to <em>Charles Neale's </em>having subjected his estate to die payment of his debts, diat must be understood as to <em>just </em>debts, only ; and I consider this as not belonging to that class. I am therefore of opinion that the decree be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b146-10\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"Al3\">It is unnecessary to decide whether the Court of Chancery erred in refusing to receive proof of the exhibit at the trial; inasmuch as, <em>upon the </em>merits, the appellant never can X\u2019ecover, and therefore was not <em>injured </em>by that error, if it were one.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The note on which this suit was founded, created no debt on the part of the makers, as it was made without any adequate consideration. It is a mere <em>nudum </em>pactum. Neither of the makers received the benefit of the services for which it was given: neither of them are executors of <em>William Neale </em>from whom the debt was owing : nor is it shewn that there is any deficiency of his assets, which would render the property received by the makers liable to the payment thereof; in which case it might be argued that such liability would afford an adequate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">The debt was barred by the time incurred between the making of the note and the date of <em>C. Neale's </em>will, (to say nothing of the lapse of time preceding,) and, although the-trust created by such will for the payment of debts would be considered as a waiver of the act of limitations, it is-presumed, it will not extend to. a mel'e <em>nudum </em>pactum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The trust created by the will of <em>C. Neale </em>was for the payment of <em>his debts ; </em>under which description the claim in question is not comprehended. In the case of <em>Trueman </em>v. <em>Fenton,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>upon this subject, the point arising in the present case seems to be conceded. The cases in which a debt extinguished is <em>revived </em>by a new promise, appears to be where the debt was due <em>in conscience, </em>and this would seem to exclude the case of a <em>nudum pactum ; </em>for a man is not bound <em>in conscience </em>to pay any thing, unless he has received a benefit from, or produced a loss to, the other party. So also it is held, that an acknowledgment of a debt so as to take it out of the statute, does not give any <em>new </em>cause of action ; but only revives the <em>old </em>cause, and is of no other use but to prevent the bar by the statute.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Considering- this also as a <em>joint </em>note, the action is gone at law against the representatives of Neale, in consequence of <em>4\u00a1narles's </em>surviving him ; and in equity it cannot be set up against <em>them </em>but on the ground of a moral obligation antecedently existing on the part of <em>Neale </em>to pay the money, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> In this case no such obligation existed, nor is it shewn that either of the promisers were responsible for any thing prior to the making the note in question. On the <em>merits, </em>therefore, the law is clear for the appellees, and the decree must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-5\">Judge Fleming was in favour of affirming the decree ef the Chancellor.</judges>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the decree of the Superior Court of Chancery affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"> 2 <em>Call, </em>527.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b147-10\"><em> Cowp. </em>548.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b147-11\"> 4 <em>Bac.
