And now, by an amended bill, she impeached the second sentence, upon the ground of her having been prevented from making her defence by accident. And the said bills alleged, that at the time of speaking the supposed testamentary words, the decedent was not of sound and disposing mind and memory; that he was not then (in contemplation of law) in his last sickness; and that the formalities of the law were not observed in reducing the will to writing, and in proving the same. It was insisted by the original bill, that real estate could not pass by a nuncupative will, and that the ratification by the nuncupative will of the division therein mentioned was invalid. The original and amended bills also submitted to the court the interpretation of the said will, in case the same should be established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-4\">The next of kin of the decedent and of his child being <em>Robert Page </em>and <em>Charles C.

The will was made about 1 o\u2019clock, and the decedent was then perfectly in his senses. The physicians who bad been sent for at the same time that <em>Charles Page </em>was sent for, did not reach <em>Mansfield </em>until between 4 and 5, and he was then much worse. He remarked to the physicians, that his friends had become very much alarmed and thought he would die, but he did not think he would. One of the physicians, however, deposed that he was then incapable of dictating a will, and the other said he thought it doubtful whether he would survive the night or not. But the next morning (monday the 25lh) the symptoms had improved, and he was perfectly in his senses; and he was in his senses at intervals every day between the 24th and the day of his death, being usually better in the morning and worse in the afternoon, when his fever rose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-4\">Pending the suit, <em>Robert Page </em>and <em>Charles C.

Upon the coming in of the commissioner\u2019s report, the case was again heard, and a decree made the 12th of October 1838, whereby the nuncupative will was established, and the division therein mentioned confirmed. And the court adjudged and declared, that according to the true construction of the will, the plaintiff was not only entitled to the specific legacy therein bequeathed to her, (all of which it was admitted she had received, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the washerwoman directed to be purchased for her) but that the child of the testator being dead, she was entitied to the whole profits of the estate, real and personal, so long as she remained the widow of the testator, and from and after her marriage, to her legal rights in the estate as if he had died intestate, to which end the estate was by the will to be kept together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-4\">On the petition of the representatives of <em>Charles C. </em>Page, an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-5\"><em>Daniel </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ank\">The object of the testator was to leave the widow to her legal rights, with the addition of certain specific legacies mentioned in the beginning of the will. The clause directing the estate to be kept together and managed for the benefit of the wife and child during her widowhood, if construed to give an estate during widowhood to the wife, would be inconsistent with the executory limitation to the testator\u2019s brothers in the event of the child\u2019s death under age without lawful issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anma\">The court has allowed the widow, during her widowhood, the whole estate, real as well as personal. Even if that had been the intention of the testator, it could not be effected by a nuncupative will; for such a will can create no interest in lands, much less an estate of freehold therein, which Would be imported by a gift of the profits during widowhood. 1 Tho.

Lit. 200.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-7\"><em>Lyons </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqhY\">There was no valid will. A nuncupative will made in the commencement of a disease, of which the testator ultimately dies, but dies after a considerable time has elapsed, and after rallying from time to time, so as to be perfectly capable from time to time of making a regular will in writing, is not made in the <em>last siclcness </em>contemplated by the statute. To render a nuncupative will valid on the ground of its being made in the testator\u2019s last sickness, it must be made in the sickness of which he dies, and there must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>afterwards be no such recovery (total or partial) as may leave him capable in mind and body of executing a will in writing. The statute contemplates cases of <em>necessity, </em>of <em>inability </em>to make any other than a nuncupative will, and ought not to be extended beyond cases of that character. <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Hazleton, </em>20 Johns. 502. The cases of <em>Weeden </em>v. <em>Bartlett &amp;c. </em>6 Munf. 123. and <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Bob &amp; others, </em>3 Leigh 140. though not precisely in point, may be referred to as confirmatory of the same principle. The testamentary words must also be uttered by the decedent in the prospect and contemplation of approaching death. The cases establish that , the proximity of death, in point of fact, at the time of the testamentary words spoken is not sufficient, unless the testator was aware of and believed such proximity. And here the evidence does not shew such consciousness and expectation on the part of the testator, but the contrary. Then as to the two sentences of the court of probat. The first of these was plainly invalid. And the second was after six months from the time of speaking the testamentary words. Then the enquiry arises, whether <em>the testimony, </em>or the substance thereof, was committed to writing within six days after making the will. 1 R. C. 1819, p. 377. \u00a7 8. The words spoken were so committed to writing; but they are only a part of the testimony required by the statute to be put in writing. The testator must be of sound mind. He must call on some person present to take notice that such is his will. And the words must be spoken in the time of the last sickness, and in contemplation of death. These matters are indispensable to be proved, and the statute requires that the <em>proof </em>of them, the <em>testimony </em>respecting them, should be reduced to writing, as well as the testamentary dispositions. But all this part of the testimony is omitted in the writing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-4\">II. A nuncupative will, it is admitted, cannot control the profits of real estate, any more than it can pass the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>land itself. But so far as the will could pass the estate \u00b0f ^e testator, the decree adopted the true construction. What is there in this will to countenance the idea, that iu the event of the child\u2019s death under age and without issue, the widow is to be stripped of all provision except the specific bequests ? Yet that is the inevitable result of the argument which denies that the wife took an estate during widowhood in all the property which the will was.competent to pass. For the limitation to the brothers, according to the terms of the will, must operate (in the contemplated contingency) upon all the testator\u2019s estate except the specific legacies to the widow; no more saving her share as distributee, than her supposed estate during widowhood. Such cannot be the meaning of the testator, because he has declared his intention to be not to give the widow legs, but to give her more, than the law would allow in case of intestacy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-4\">III. If the agreement between the three brothers for partition of the lands was not an agreement <em>executed </em>at the date of the nuncupative will, but merely executory, then the will could have no influence on it, since a nuncupative will cannot affect the title to lands; and the widow is entitled to her distributive share of the decedent\u2019s money invested in the tract called <em>Marshalls. </em>[,Stanard, J. A nuncupative will may operate to convert money into land, because it may dispose of money.} However that may be, it cannot have the effect of substituting a dower interest of the widow in place of an absolute property in her distributable share.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-5\"><em>Daniel </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah0\">According to the interpretation of the statute by this court, the will <em>was </em>made in the last sickness of the testator, and in contemplation of death. <em>Marks and wife </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 91. And it is plain that the meaning of the legislature was merely to require the <em>testamentary words </em>to be reduced to writing within the six days; not to require that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>testimony as to the decedent\u2019s sanity, his intelligent , i \u2022 i , . -i and voluntary action, and the other particulars proper to be proved in court, should also be put in writing. What would be the use of such a requirement ? And if there be any use, why was not a similar requirement made in the case of written testaments ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-5\">But it is too late for the widow to contest the validity of the will. She renounced all purpose to contest the probat, failed to appear though duly summoned, and the probat was in truth at the joint instance of herself and the other parties. She also accepted and enjoyed the legacies given her by the will, and never thought of a contest about the will until after the death of the child. This combination of circumstances would preclude her from a contest now, even if the will had been proved in common form merely. But the will was proved in the form in which, under the statutes of <em>Virginia </em>from 1748 to the present time, nuncupative wills have always been proved. 5 Hen. Stat. at large p. 457. \u00a7 11. 1 R. C. 1819, p. 379. \u00a7 18. That proof is very different from what is allowed in the case of written wills. The statute respecting probat of written wills authorizes the court to take the proof <em>immediately, </em>requiring no citation of the next of kin : the statute respecting nuncupative wills does provide for a citation of the parties interested, and invalidates the probat unless that provision be complied with. There is no reason for applying to the latter the statute in 1R. C. 1819, p. 378. \u00a7 13. allowing bills in chancery to contest the validity of wills. And this statute should therefore be restricted to cases in which the probat may be in law, and has been in fact, <em>ex parte </em>and without notice; cases, namely, of wills in writing. In <em>England, </em>when a testament of personals is proved in solemn form after citation of the next of kin and distributees, they \u00e1re in general precluded by such probat\u2014\u201c forever barred.\u201d 1 Wms. on Ex\u2019ors 194. And the probat here of a nuncu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>pative will, being what is considered in <em>England </em>a probat in <em>solemn form, </em>a bill in chancery ought not to be allowed after such probat, unless upon some ground of fraud or accident alleged and proved by the complainant. Nor is it at all material as to the first probat, whether it was strictly formal and regular; it is binding nevertheless, being the definitive sentence of a court of competent jurisdiction, never reversed or appealed from.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-3\">II. He contended that the true construction of the will was such as he insisted upon in opening. And III. as to the tract called <em>Marshalls, </em>he said, if the division could now be impeached, no division among heirs, not carried out in the most formal manner by deeds of partition, could ever be valid and obligatory. Besides, he remarked, if the division could be treated as a nullity, the testator\u2019s estate must be responsible for the rents and profits of the land during all the time he held it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b468-4\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AX_\">delivered the following as the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The court is of opinion that the act of assembly authorizing wills admitted to probat to be contested by a bill in chancery at any time within seven years thereafter, applies only to written, and not to nuncupative <em>wills; </em>and that the nuncupative will in question having been admitted to probat by a court of competent jurisdiction, after the appellee had been regularly summoned by its process to appear and contest the same, if she thought proper so to do, the sentence of the court of probat was binding upon her, and could not be impeached, except by appeal therefrom, or by a bill in equity founded upon her having been prevented by fraud or accident from making her defence in the court of probat. And the court is further of opinion, not only that the appellee was not prevented by fraud or accident from contesting the said will in the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>probat, but moreover that it clearly appears from the evidence in this cause, that the same was made by the testator in his last sickness, when he was of sound disposing mind and memory, and with the solemnities required by law. The court is consequently of opinion that there is no error in the decree of the circuit court, so far as the same sustains the validity of the said nuncupative will, and the sufficiency of the probat thereof, whether regard be had to the first or the last sentence of the court of probat: and is also of opinion that there is no error therein in recognizing the validity of the division made between the testator and bis two brothers of their father\u2019s real estate, and the allotment to the testator of the place called <em>Marshalls, </em>and his accountability for his due share of the balance of the purchase money thereof. But the court is of opinion that the said nuncupative will was of no effect in law in relation to the testator\u2019s real estate, or the profits to accrue therefrom; and that, by its true construction, the testator intended that his wife should have in absolute ownership the slaves and other personal property specifically bequeathed to her, together with her legal rights in his estate as his widow, and nothing more. And the court is further of opinion that the testator\u2019s posthumous child inherited his real estate, subject to the widow\u2019s right of dower therein, and was entitled under the will (after payment of debts) to the slaves not specifically bequeathed, subject to the widow\u2019s life estate in one third thereof, and to distribution with the widow, in conformity to law, of the other personal estate not specifically bequeathed: and that upon the death of said child, his interest in the real estate descended to his paternal uncles, <em>Robert </em>and <em>Charles C. Page, </em>and his interest in the slaves and other personal property passed to the said <em>Robert </em>and <em>Charles C. Page, </em>under the executory bequest in their favour contained in said will. The court is therefore of opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>said decree of the circuit court is erroneous, so far as the same is incompatible with the rights of the parties as above expressed, and so far as the same gives costs to the appellee, instead of the appellants: and in these respects it is considered by the court that the said decree be reversed and annulled, and that the appellants recover against the appellee their costs by them expended in the prosecution of their appeal aforesaid here. And the cause is remanded to the said circuit court, for assignment to the appellee of her dower in the real estate, including <em>Marshalls, </em>after setting aside the order of abatement as to the defendant <em>Robert Page, </em>and reviving the suit against the representatives of his real estate ; and for further proceedings in conformity with the views above declared, after a revival of the suit against the executor or administrator of the said <em>Robert Page.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
