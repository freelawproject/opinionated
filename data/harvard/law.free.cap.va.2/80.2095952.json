The bill states, that the plaintiff in the year 1769, had a lottery, the highest prize in which was some improved lots in <em>Charlottesville, </em>and a tract of land, which property in the scheme of the lottery, was estimated at 440/. That <em>Roderick M&gt;Rae </em>purchased two tickets, <em>Henry Mullens </em>one, to which the plaintiff added another, the whole forming a joint property, in which <em>Roderick MkRae </em>owned one-half, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>That one of the partnership tickets, (No 69,) drew the highest prize, and was therefore entitled to the property above-mentioned. But the ticket so soon as *ts g\u00b0\u00b0d fortune was known, was forcibly taken from the said <em>Roderick </em>M'-Rae, by the defendant <em>Philip </em>MlRae, who claimed the entire benefit of the prize. That the plaintiff and <em>Mullens </em>having sold their interest in the prize to <em>Roderick </em>M(Rae, the plaintiff conveyed the whole property to the assignee of Roderick. That about fifteen years after this, the defendant commenced a suit against the plaintiff at Law, and in the absence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, who could have proved the tortious manner in which the plaintiff acquired the possession of the ticket, a verdict was rendered against him 451/. 18s. <em>4d. </em>damages, for the <em>whole value </em>of the ticket. The bill prays an injunction to the judgment at Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">The answer states, that half of the ticket in question was purchased by <em>Roderick M'-Rae </em>for the defendant, the day before the drawing, and that after it was known to have been fortunate, it was delivered to the defendant by the said <em>Roderick. </em>That the defendant never claimed more than <em>one-half of the prize </em>drawn by this ticket.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-7\">The evidence, as to the right of <em>Philip M'-Rae, </em>and the manner of his obtaining possession of the ticket, is extremely contradictory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5Z\">The subject of dispute was submitted to arbitration by the two <em>M-Rea\u2019s, </em>(as appears by the testimony of some of. the arbitrators,) and a decision was given in favor of <em>Philip M'Rea\u2019s </em>title to one-half of <em>Roderick\u2019s </em>interest in the prize. One of the jurymen who tried the cause deposes, that his intention was to g*ve damages for the whole value of the ticket. Another juryman deposes, that the jury gave to the appellant <em>Philip M'Rae, </em>damages, for the interest which <em>Roderick M-Rae </em>held in the ticket. The declaration filed in the action at Law claims the whole ticket, and the verdict is general, \u201c that the defendant did assume upon himself as the plaintiff hath de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>dared against him, and assess the damages to 451/\u00bb 18,5V <em>AdP</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-3\">The Chancellor, upon the hearing of this cause, directed the issue between the parties in the action at common law to be tried again 5 from which decree the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-4\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">I shall object, <em>first, </em>to the decree <em>in toio </em>; or if I am wrong in that, then secondly, to so much of it as directs a trial of the right of the appellant to any part of the ticket in dispute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">Upon the first point, I contend that the bill ought to have been dismissed. The equity stated is, that the appellant was entitled to no part of the ticket \u00a7 but having obtained the possession of it tortiously, he thereby acquired <em>prima facie </em>an evidence of right, which on account of the appellee?s want of testimony at the trial, he was unable to controvert. The equity now set up, (namely, that the appellant was only entitled to a <em>fourth of the </em>ticket,) not being stated in the bill, he had 110 opportunity given him of controverting it by his answer, nor was it necessary for him to do so; and therefore, whatever proof the appellee might produce as to the extent of the appellants interest, it was improper for the <em>Chancellor </em>to decide upon it. The appellee might have amended, so as to put in Issue the point for which he now contends <em>% </em>but not having done so, he is confined to the equity stated in the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-7\">The Court are not now at liberty to say, that the verdict is wrong so far as it gives to the appellant the value of a moiety of the ticket. All the testimony in the cause proves the right of <em>Philip M6Pae </em>to a moiety, unless it be the award, which is made upon the principles of accommodation, and to which the appellee having objected, it would be improper to allow it any weight in the cause, by considering it as evidence of the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-8\">The <em>Chancellor </em>therefore erred, as I conceive, in setting aside the verdict. The trial before the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>was a fair one,, The appellee does not even charge:: In his bill that he was surprised, otherwise than by a general assertion, u that he was unprovided with tecti\u00bb <em>Ttaoayf </em>without setting forth who were the witnesses, the benefit of w hose testimony he wanted, or what they could have proved. It does not appear that there was any evidence before the Court of Chancery which was not given to the jury, and they having decided upon the right, the verdict ought not to have been set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">But admit the Court should be satisfied that the appellant was only entitled to a fourth of the ticket, then I insist secondly, that the <em>Chancellor </em>ought not to have set aside the verdict, but should have injoined one half of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">In cases where a verdict is vicious in all its parts, or where no standard is furnished by which to modify It, I admit it ought to he set aside in the whole. As In cases where it is unfairly obtained, or where the action is merely founded in damages, as in trespass and the like. But in that case if <em>Philip M'-Rae </em>was entitled to only one-fourth, instead of one-half of the ticket, then he is as certainly entitled to one-half of the amount of the verdict, as, in the other instance, he would have been to the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">As to the part of the ticket for which the jury gave him damages, there is no sort of uncertainty. The whole testimony in the cause proves that the appellant claimed only one moiety of the ticket. One of the jurymen proves, that the damages given were for that part. A single juryman deposes, that he intended the damages for the whole ticket. Consider what a dangerous precedent it would establish, if in any instance, a single juryman, or even two, should be permitted, after a fair trial, to set aside the verdict, by saying, that he intended to find in this, or in that way. Such a decision would be in direct opposition to that laid down in the case of <em>Cochran </em>v. Street, <em>(ante, </em>vol. I. p. 79,) where the Court went entirely upon the evidence of a large <em>majority of the jurors^ </em>which proved that they decided upon a mistake.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>In opposition to this solitary juryman, is not only She evidence of another juryman, as well as that of many other witnesses, but the amount of the damages assessed, plainly proves that the verdict was for a moiety only of the value of the property, <em>with interest </em>from the time it was withheld from the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-4\">The right of the appellant to interest, cannot I presume be contested. IF the appellee had not wrongfully conveyed the property to <em>Roderick </em>MiRae, and the appellant had resorted to a Court of Chancery to compel a conveyance of the part belonging to him, the <em>mesne </em>profits would have been decreed, and it would have been error to have refused. Having sued for damages, he was upon the same principle entitled to interest in lieu of the profits. And if the jury ought to have given interest, the Court will presume they did do so, and not that they gave damages for the whole value of the ticket, which the appellant did not claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">Why, then, shall the verdict be set aside, and the appellant put to sea again to establish his title, which has once been fairly ascertained ? If he be entitled only to a fourth, his right to a fourth ought not again to be put in jeopardy, since the jury, having given damages for a half, have furnished this Court with a rule to go by, in ascertaining the excess which ought ixi Equity to be injoined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">But if it were necessary for the Court to direct an issue at all, it ought to have been one to ascertain the <em>value of the fourth </em>part, and not one, which was to bring the appellants right to <em>any thing </em>again into question.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-7\">Campbell, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-8\">A short attention to the history of this transaction, will furnish a sufficient answer to the first point</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-9\">In the suit instituted at Law by <em>Philip MrRea </em>against Woods, he claimed the whole of the ticket, and recovered a judgment for the whole, in damages. <em>Woods </em>applied to the Court of Chancery, setting forth, that though <em>Philip MiRea </em>was in possession of the ticket, yet he obtained it iortiously, and had no title whatever to it. <em>Philip M\u2018Rae, </em>in his answer, admits himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>entitled only to one-half of the ticket, and upon these proceedings it necessarily and properly became a question with the <em>Chancellor, </em>whether <em>Philip MiRae </em>was entitled to any, and to what part of the ticket ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-9\">There appears to be two subjects of inquiry now before the Court. 1st. Can the verdict already found be established ? And if not, then, 2dly. How ought the Court to proceed after setting it aside ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-10\">1st. That the verdict cannot stand as it is, is what I confidently insist upon. If it were intended to give the appellant damages for half the ticket, it is unwarranted by the testimony in the cause, which goes completely to prove, that if he were entitled to any thing, it could only be to a fourth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-11\">If damages for the whole ticket were intended, then the appellant\u2019s counsel does not attempt to maintain it. Yet one of the jurymen has deposed, that he intended the damages for the whole of the property. This testimony is objected to by Mr. <em>Marshall, </em>who seems to consider a juryman, in such a case, as an incompetent witness. Let me ask, if a by-stander had proved misbehaviour, would the Court which tried the cause, or a Court of Equity, have hesitated to set aside the verdict ? It is admitted, that if <em>many </em>jurymen had concurred in proving the same fact, their evidence would have been sufficient. But let me ask, can the influence of truth depend upon numbers ? Or can testimony coming from a juryman be less worthy of credit, than if given by a stranger ? If he had been himself mistaken, or if he knew of a mistake in any of his brethren, it was his duty to expose it, that the error might be corrected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-12\">2d. If, then, the verdict is to be set aside, what is the Court to do ? It is entire, and cannot be set aside in part, and confirmed in part. It is either for the whole, or for a half of the ticket. Both are wrong. But <em>whether it </em>be for the one, or the other, this Court can, at most, only conjecture. One j my man says the first, the other the last. Where, then, is the standard which Mr. <em>Marshall </em>speaks of, by which the Court can divide the verdict ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The Court must decree either upon the evidence, or upon the verdict. Not upon the last, because that is avowedly wrong. If that be given up, and the Court suppose they can with propriety look into the evidence, and decide upon that, I am ready to go into it. There is a case in <em>Morgan\u2019s Essays, </em>of an action upon a bill of exchange. There were two counts in the declaration, upon one'of which, the jury found for the plaintiff; upon the other, there was an improper finding for the defendant. The plaintiff desired to set aside the second finding, and to retain the first. But the Court refused, as the verdict was entire. It is argued that the jury are to be presumed to have given interest, because they ought to have done so. But I do not think they ought. <em>Philip MlRae </em>complains that <em>Woods </em>conveyed to <em>Roderick MlRae </em>instead of himself. But this arose from the neglect of of <em>Philip MhRae, </em>who had improperly acquired the possession of the ticket, and without which no verdict could have been obtained. But <em>Woods </em>did right in conveying to <em>Roderick M(Rae </em>to whom he had sold the ticket. What considerations then prevailed with the jury in forming the verdict, cannot certainty be known by the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\">As to the value fixed upon the property in the scheme of the lottery, it furnishes no standard, by which the intention of the jury can be explained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\"><em>Marshall, </em>in reply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa9\">, That a verdict is entire at Law cannot be denied. But that a Court of Equity may, when there is a guide to go by, set it aside in part only, is every day\u2019s practice. If the verdict be improper in the whole, as if the trial be unfair, or the whole finding be inequitable, or if it be wrong in part, but the Court has no standard by which to distinguish the good from the bad, ira such cases the whole verdict ought to be set aside. But if, as in the case of a bond, the plaintiff has recovered too much.at Law, what does^ Court of Equity do ? Not set aside the whole verdict, but injoin so much of it as the obligee in conscience is not entitled to. If it be necessary to direct an issue, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>does so as to the part disputed, but never sets aside the verdict, which, in the first instance is presumed to be right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">There is a great difference between evidence to \u2022prove misbehaviour in the jury, and the evidence of a juryman given long after the trial, as to his secret intentions at the time of giving his verdict. The former might be seen or heard, and with respect to which complete evidence might be adduced. The latter is concealed from all the world but the juror himself. No other person can know what were the secret workings of his mind. If the juryman in question went upon a mistake, it does not appear that he disclosed it to any person at that time. To permit him now, when impressions have been made upon his mind by one of the parties, to set aside the verdict, would be to establish a most dangerous principle, and such as must prove fatal to the purity of the jury trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">I still insist, that the jury were right in giving interest, since it was the duty of the appellee to make the deed to the person <em>who had possession of the tickets </em>he acted improperly in conveying to <em>Roderick, </em>and by taking upon himself to decide the rights of the parties, he is liable to the appellant for the <em>mesne </em>profits, or for interest in lieu of them.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b118-9\">Fleming J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-_\">In this case, there is a great contrariety of evidence. The arbitrators gave <em>Roderick MiRae </em>half of the ticket, and <em>Philip MiRae </em>avers, that he claimed no more. But the declaration demands the whole, and it is probable that the verdict ivas for the whole, since the amount of the damages very little exceeds the price affixed to the property by the scheme of the lottery. To explain the principles by which the jury were governed, two of that body have been examined, and they differ from each other upon the main point. Objections were made to the examinations of the jurors ; but it is not only usual, but I think proper, to admit such evidence, for the purpose of discovering errors which the jury may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>have committed. In this case, I should not feel an Inclination to be over scrupulous in admitting testimonv, when I reflect, that the appellant .acquiesced for fifteen years without asserting his right to the property in question, until better evidence might be lost. I am well satisfied that <em>Philip M'Rea </em>is entitled only to one-fourth of the ticket, independently of the award and evidence of the juror. He has recovered one-half, if not the whole | and as I can discover no standard by which to decree him what he is really intitled to, there seems to be no way left but the one adopted by the <em>Chancellor </em>to do essential justice to the parties. I am therefore of opinion that the decree is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Lyons^L \u2014 I think this case has come up too early. The <em>Chancellor </em>does not set aside the former verdict, but only directs an issue to be tried to satisfy his conscience. The question tried and decided by the jury was the right of the appellant to the ticket. The possession was considered, and certainly was at Law, <em>primo.\u2019\u25a0 facie </em>evidence of title. But the question is, did the jury give a verdict for the whole of the ticket, or for a part, and for what part ? How was the <em>Chancellor </em>to ascertain this with certainty ? It is admitted that the appellant was not entitled to the whole. No way remained but to direct an issue to try the question for the information of his conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">But before the issue is tried, and before it is known what would be the decree of the Chancellor, the party appeals. Ought the <em>Chancellen' </em>to be restrained from directing issues to inform him whether a fact be one way or the other ? Surely not, and therefore the appeal in this case is certainly premature. The inquiry is merely as to the extent of <em>Philip IPfcMae^s </em>right. It is nothing to the Court of Equity how <em>Philip M\u2018Rae </em>came by the ticket; but it is essential to know to what part he is entitled, and the value of it At present, it is impossible for the Court to ascertain that point. I therefore think the decree right.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The President.- \u2014 As I ara of opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>appellant had no ground to come here at all, I shall not inquire whether he has done it too early not. Amidst the clashing testimony in the cause, it is evident to me, that <em>Philip M'-Rae </em>had not a right to more than a fourth. As soon as the lottery was drawn, the two <em>MiRae&gt;s </em>began to dispute respecting this ticket. My own impressions are, that <em>Philip M'-Rae </em>has no right at all; but I would not for this reason award a new trial, since the verdict, which has been fairly found, is in his favor : But the extent of his right is not ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">If then <em>Philip M'-Rae </em>was entitled to no more than a fourth, the verdict which gives him much more ought to be corrected. We were anxious to do this, if we could, without disturbing the verdict. But we could discover no certain standard by which the Court could make the correction. We looked for it in vain in the value affixed to the property in the scheme of the lottery. We then looked for .it in the sales, with no better success. The next chance was the verdict; but that appears to be for the whole, because the declaration claims the whole. We next referred to the testimony of the jurors ; but they differ upon the subject. The appellant attempted to account for the sum found by the verdict, by supposing, that the jury had allowed interest upon the claim, because they ought to have done so but this is equally unsatisfactory. It is entirely discretionary with a jury, whether they will give interest or not. And whether they meant to give it, is perfectly uncertain. My own- opinion is, that in this case, interest ought not to have been allowed. <em>Woods </em>gave notice to <em>Philip M'-Rae </em>that he would not convey to him ; but having, together with <em>Mullins, </em>(sold their interest to <em>Roderick M\u2018Rae, </em>he made a conveyance to him. In 1771, the land is sold as the property of <em>Roderick ; </em>it is advertised in the neighbourhood of <em>Philip, </em>and the property is passed from hand to hand ; in 1769, <em>Philip </em>having received notice from <em>Woods, </em>seems to have abandoned all intention of recourse against him, and applies to <em>Rode</em>rick,. They agree to a reference, and in 1784, <em>Philip </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>PPMae </em>for the first time shews an intention to resort Co Woods, having no prospect of recovering any thing against <em>Roderick. Woods, </em>In consequence of this unreasonable delay, has now no chance to recover against <em>Roderick, </em>and therefore ought not to pay interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">Another mode was thought of by the Court? and that was, to direct the jury to value a fourth of the ticket 5 but against this a considerable difficulty occurred on the subject of interest, in which we thought we had no right to control the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Upon the whole, I concur with the other Judges In approving the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Decree affirmed.(<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\">(1) <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Depriest, 4 </em>Munf. 469.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
