In this case the <em>Chancellor </em>dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill, which was brought to subject the land to the payment of the money for which it had been sold.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-18\"><em>Stark, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-19\">I consider this question as completely settled by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>die cases of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>1 <em>Vern. </em>267. <em>Pollexfen </em>v. Moore, 3 Atk. 272. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Preswick, </em>, 2 Vez. 622. Cator v. <em>Earl of </em>Pembroke, 1 Bro. Ch. <em>Rep. </em>301. <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Gregson, ib. </em>420. In <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>King\u2019s heirs, </em>in the former Court of Appeals, and in <em>Lidderdell\u2019s heirs </em>v. <em>Pettis\u2019s executor and others </em>in the Federal Court, in all of which, the lands were decreed to be sold for payment of the purchase money.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b191-3\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZN6\">The question which this record presents to the Court is, whether the vendor of land which he has not conveyed, has such a lien upon it, as that he may apply to a Court of Equity for a sale to supply the deficiency of the personal estate in paying the purchase money?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Upon an examination of the cases cited at the bar, the law seems to be settled, that where land is sold, and no security taken, nor money paid, the vendor retains a lien; and the rule must be the same, where a part of the consideration has been paid, as in this case. The authorities appear to be uniform in establishing this doctrine, where no bond is given for payment of the money. In the case of <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Gregson, </em>1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>420, all the former adjudications upon the subject are brought into review before the Court, and the circumstance of a bond being given seems not to have been considered as important. However, I shall give no decision myself upon this point, as there is no bond in the present case. The doctrine seems also settled by the case of <em>Hanson v. King, </em>in the former Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Upon the whole I am of opinion that the land is liable, and the decree consequently erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Fleming J. \u2014 It is clear in this case that there is no personal estate in the hands of the executor to pay the balance of the purchase money remaining due, and I consider the law as settled, that the vendor has a lien upon the land. T concur in opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The President. \u2014 If this aere a new case, I should feel no d\u2019fficulty in making it a precedent. But the doctrine, that a vendor of land, not taking a security, nor making a conveyance, retains a lien upon the property, is so well settled as to be received as a maxim. Even if he hath made a conveyance, yet he may pursue the land in the possession of the vendee, or of a purchaser <em>with notice. </em>But if he hath taken a security, or the vendee hath sold to a third person without notice, the lien is lost. In this case, however, there was no conveyance made, and the land is now in possession of volunteer claimants under the vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">The opinion oe the Court is, \u201cthat the appellant not having conveyed the land, nor taken any security for the balance of his purchase money, hath a lien upon the lands in the hands of the appellees for satisfaction of such balance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
