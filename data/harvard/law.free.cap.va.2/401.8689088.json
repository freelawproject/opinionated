The declaration contained two counts: 1. For goods, wares and merchandizes sold and delivered to the testator in his life-time j 2, <em>Quantum valebant; </em>and in both instances, charged the assumpsit of the testator. Flea, \u201c <em>non assumpsitK </em>At the trial, the plaintiffs exhibited the account, on which the suit was brought, and offered evidence to prove, that when the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>account was presented by the witness to the <em>administra</em>trix, she read it over, and did not object to any iteiq contained in it, and said, that <em>some things </em>in the first part of the account, stated to have been delivered to her husband, (the testator,) <em>she knew nothing of but did not </em>doubt that they were delivered, and that <em>she would pay the balance. </em>To this evidence, (which <em>seems </em>to have been <em>all the evidence </em>adduced, though the bill of exceptions does not <em>expressly </em>say so,) the defendant, by her counsel, objected as improper to go to the Jury, and as insufficient to prove the aforesaid assumpsit of the testator. \u201c But the objection was \u201c overruled by the Court: and as, from the <em>nature of the </em>\u201c items, the defendant probably knew whether most of the \u201c articles had been delivered to the testator, the Jury were \u201c allowed to weigh the said testimony as to the delivery of the items to the testator.\u201d To which opinion an exception was taken; and there having been a verdict and judgment rendered fop the plaintiffs, the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-10\">Randolph, fpr the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARV\">referred to the case of <em>Fisher's Executor v. Duncan and Turnbull,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as settling this question; and did not suppose it could require an argument.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-11\">Cali, for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZh\">contended, that there was a distinction between this case and that of <em>Fisher's Executor </em>v. <em>Duncan and </em>Turnbull, The great question there was, whether the <em>assumpsit of the executor, </em>on an issue upon the <em>assumpsit of the </em>testator, could be given in evidence to countervail the plea of the statute of limitations. But, in this case, the sole question is as to the <em>delivery of the goods. </em>The Court left it to the Jury to weigh the circumstances, connected with the assumpsit of the administratrix, and determine whether they amounted to proof of the delivery of the articles or not. Mr. <em>Call </em>also cited <em>Gilbert's Law of </em>Evidence, 160, (179, <em>old </em>edition,)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Randolph, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asj\">The distinction attempted by Mr. <em>Call, </em>brings the case to the same thing as <em>Fisher\u2019s Executor </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>and <em>Turnbull. </em>If the declarations of the administratrix with the will annexed be allowed to form the basis of an assumpsit to charge the estate of her testator, it comes completely within the reason of that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-4\">But the opinion of the Judge, in this case, from the manner in which it was expressed, had an obvious tendency to influence the minds of the Jury as to the weight of evidence; which was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-10\"><em>Call. </em>There is a difference between ail action to charge an,executor <em>personally, </em>and to charge the <em>estate of his tesr tator. </em>This distinction is founded on the words of the statute of frauds.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Before the making of that statute, all the books agree, that an executor might verbally assume to pay the debt of his testator. Suppose an action be brought against an executor on the bond or assumpsit of his <em>testator; </em>can there be a doubt but that he may confess a judgment, or suffer one to pass by default? If he can bind the estate by coming <em>into Court </em>and acknowledging the plaintiff\u2019s action, can it make any difference that he made the acknowledgment <em>out of Court ? </em>Does it not happen every day, that such judgments are entered up ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-11\">It must be admitted, that an executor may pay an account against his testator, which he knows to be just, or confess a judgment. This point was settled in the case of <em>Bentley </em>and <em>Mayo.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The only question, there, was, whether <em>Bentley </em>had acted fraudulently in preferring some creditors to others. The Court Was divided upon the question, whether the precipitancy of <em>Bentley </em>in paying and confessing judgments in favour of certain creditors of his testator, did not amount to an evidence <em>offraud. </em>But no Judge doubted of his right to <em>confess a judgment.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-12\">As to the opinion of the Judge in this case, there was nothing improper in the manner of expressing it. He ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>mitted the evidence to go to the Jury to be weighed by them; and they had a right to <em>presume </em>an assumpsit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-6\"><em>Rdhdolpln </em>It is not denied but that an executor may go into Court and confess a judgment. But the reason of this is, that he is acting deliberately, after <em>ascertaining </em>the justice of the claim, and situation of the estate of his testator. But is that like the mere conversation of an executor out of Court, without any certain knowledge of the nature of the claim, and without any reference to the ability of his testator\u2019s estate'to pay the debt?</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"><em> </em>1 <em>Hening &amp; Munford, </em>563.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b419-13\"> See <em>Rev.

This evidence was objected to, but admitted by the Court; and verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiff. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">That the proof ought to correspond with the nature of the charge in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration is one of those maxims which have never been controverted. It has, however, been attempted, on the part of the appellees, to shew, that this maxim does not apply to the <em>present </em>case, by identifying the administratrix, with the intestate, and relying on the rule in legal proceedings, that, if an executor or administrator be sued for a debt due from his testator, &amp;c. and does not defend the suit, he admits the debt, and judgment may thereupon be had against the estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>bis testator in his hands. But this rule is, not true to the extent which was contended for. If an executor be sued on a <em>bond </em>of his testator, and does not defend the suit, it is very true that judgment shall be rendered for the whole debt, appearing to be due by the bond. But, if he be sued upon an account, although the executor, by not defending the suit, admits that there is <em>something </em>due, yet the plaintiff must <em>prove </em>his account, or he shall recover but <em>one penny </em>damages, although there be <em>assets: </em>and it is the same if he pleads <em>plene </em>administravit, which admits the <em>debt, </em>but not the umount.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In the present case, the administratrix said there were <em>some </em>of the articles she <em>knew nothing of. </em>If the evidence had been even admissible, how were the Jury, from this evidence, to ascertain tvhat articles she knew <em>something </em>of, and what she. knew <em>nothing </em>of?</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The appellees\u2019 counsel relied also on a case noticed in <em>Gilbert's Law of Evidence, </em>160. (179. <em>old </em>edit) where, in <em>assumpsit </em>by an executor for money due his testator in his life-time, on the plea of the act of limitations, an <em>assumpsit to the testator, </em>eight years before, was proved, and a renewal of the promise <em>to the executor, </em>within six years, was allowed to maintain the issue, though the assumpsit In the declaration was laid to the <em>testator </em>only $ for, it was said, the assumpsit to the executor, the representative of the testator, is an assumpsit to the testator himself. For which <em>Carthew, </em>471. is cited. But the contrary was expressly determined by the whole Court, in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Grane, 2 </em>Ld. <em>Raym. </em>1101.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and that case, I find, was recognized as authority by tbe whole Court of K. B. 3 <em>East, </em>409. The conclusion drawn from the case in <em>Carthew </em>must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>therefore fail. My opinion is, that the judgment <em>be </em>reversed, and the verdict set aside ; and that the cause be remanded to the District Court for a new trial to be had therein, with directions that the evidence excepted to on the former trial be not again admitted.</p>\n<author id=\"b422-8\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae_\">This subject was so fiilly discussed in' the case of <em>Fisher\u2019s Executor </em>v. <em>Duncan and Turnbull,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that I shall say little more than to refer to the decision in, that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The testimony offered and admitted, consists of two parts: 1st. Of the remarks of the administratrix upon the account when it was presented to her, and which, it is contended, amount to an admission that the goods were delivered to the intestate; and 2dly. Of her declaration thereupon that \u201c she would pay the balance.\u201d The admission of this declaration in evidence, amounting to an assumpsit by the <em>administratrix, </em>when the issue was joined upon the assumpsit of the <em>intestate, </em>is justly reprobated in the case of <em>Fisher\u2019s Executor </em>v. <em>Duncan and Turnbull; </em>and, if the other testimony were proper, the opinion of the Court is still erroneous, in not withholding the evidence of this promise from the Jury. But the other part of that testimony, if it amounts to an admission, that <em>any </em>of the goods were delivered to the intestate, is wholly uncertain and incomplete to shew <em>what part; </em>at most, it is only equivalent to the case of a wi\u2019it of inquiry, in which, although the debt is admitted, evidence, must be exhibited to ascertain the <em>tanoiint </em>of the damages. The evidence in this case is, at least,\" not commensurate with the whole claim, and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>fore too uncertain and incomplete to be submitted to the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"A50\">My opinion is, that the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b423-5\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AOjh\">The declaration is on an <em>assumpsit of the testator, </em>for goods, wares and merchandizes sold and delivered to him in his life-time. Plea, that the testa\u00bb <em>tor did not assume </em>in his life-time, and issue thereupon. Had the <em>delivery </em>of the goods been proved, the law would have implied an <em>assumpsit, </em>but the evidence to support the issue is, that, when the account was presented by the wit-, ness to the administratrix, she read the account over, and did not object to any item in the account, and said that <em>some things </em>in, the first part of the account <em>she knetv nothing of </em>but did not doubt that they were delivered, and that she would pay the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">This appears to me to be improper evidence at the trial of an issue on an assumpsit charged against the <em>testator </em>only. In <em>Shelly\u2019s </em>case, I Salkeld, 296. (which was an action upon the case against an executor,) upon <em>plene administravit </em>pleaded, Lord <em>Holt </em>declared, that the plaintiff, must prove his debt, otherwise he shall recover but one penny damages, though there be <em>assets, </em>for the plea only admits the <em>debt, </em>but not the <em>quantity. </em>So, in the present case, admitting that the <em>assumpsit of the administratrix </em>might be given in evidence, when an <em>assumpsit of the testator only </em>is charged, yet it is, at most, a <em>qualified </em>assumpsit, \u201c <em>that she wotdd pay the </em>balance,\u201d and what that baance was, does not appear; which brings it precisely within the reason of <em>Shelly\u2019s </em>case, above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">I am of opinion, therefore, that the judgment be reversed, the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial with an instruction that the evidence stated in. the bill of exceptions is not to go to the Jury, on such trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyon's,) the judgment of the District Court reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\"><em> </em>1 <em>Esp. 142.
