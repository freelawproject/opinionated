The case was as follows: In the year 1756-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Burns </em>obtained a warrant from the proprietor of the <em>Northern Neck, </em>and in 1757, after the expiration of six months from the \u2018date of the warrant, he had a survey made for 214 acres, (part of which is the land in controversy) which.jvas returned to <em>the Proprietor*s </em>office. v</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-3\">In the year 1768, by the direction of lord <em>Fairfax, </em>one of his surveyors .surveyed 140 acres, (part of <em>Burns\u2019s </em>214 acres,) <em>tor. Curry, </em>who was at that time an infant. In <em>September </em>1770, a grant issued to <em>Curry, </em>and in the month of <em>May </em>preceding, <em>Burns </em>offered to pay the composition money to <em>Bryant Martin, </em>the agent of the <em>Proprietor, </em>and demanded a grant; but <em>Martin </em>refused to receive the money, saying that <em>Burns </em>was too late. <em>Burns </em>obtained a patent in 1788, from the Governor of the Commonwealth, and being in possession, <em>Curry </em>brought an ejectment, and recovered a judgment at Law. <em>Burns </em>filed his bill in Equity in the County Court of <em>Berkeley, </em>praying for an injunction, and for a conveyance of <em>Curry\u2019s </em>legal title. The County Court decreed a perpetual injunction and a conveyance, which was affirmed by the High Court of Chancery upon an appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-4\"><em>Lee, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-5\"><em>Burns </em>having failed to comply with the rules of the <em>Proprietor\u2019s </em>office by not executing his warrant within the limited time, forfeited all the right to which the warrant entitled him, and the <em>Proprietor, </em>having taken advantage of the forfeiture, by granting the same land to <em>Curry, </em>the title of the latter is good against all the world. The offer to pay the composition money in 1770, could not excuse the forfeiture which had taken place many years before, since lord <em>Fairfax </em>had, in 1768, authorised a survey for <em>Curry, </em>which was made in that year, and in the grant executed to him, the survey of <em>Burns, </em>and the forfeiture incurred by him, are recited. The <em>Chancellor </em>in this case, as in that of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Buffington, </em>has supposed that the Act of 1786, relates back to the warrant, and revives all those obsolete claims which had not been carried into a grant, so as to defeat posterior rights. The patent to <em>Burns </em>was obtained from the Register\u2019s office in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>year 1788, so that the construction of the Act of 1788, is not a point in this cause.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-9\"><em>Williams, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-10\">If lord Fairfax, from his peculiar situation, was entitled to no exclusive privileges or prerogatives, (which it must be admitted he was not,) he was equally hound with other individuals, by those general rules and principles of law which prevail in cases of contracts for the sale of property. If one man agree to sell land to another, upon condition that payment be made by such a day, though the purchaser should not on that day pay the money, yet if in a reasonable time afterwards he is ready to comply, he may upon application to a Court of Equity compel the seller to make him a conveyance. In this case lord <em>Fairfax </em>agreed to sell the land in question to Burns, and received the office fees which constituted part of the purchase money. His objection to perfecting the contract because certain rules were not complied with, ought not to avail him, any more than a breach of a conditional sale in the case stated, could avail the seller. It is objected, that the survey was not returned within the six months limited by the rules of the office. Let it be remembered that the surveyors in the <em>Northern Neck </em>were appointed by lord <em>Fairfax </em>himself, and consequently that in this part of the business they were his agents and representatives. If the survey was not made and returned in time, it was not the fault of the individual, but of a servant of the <em>Proprietor. </em>Lord <em>Fairfax, </em>after he had received a pai\u2019t of the purchase money, might have prevented any person he pleased from obtaining a grant, by directions given to his surveyors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to delay making the surveys, or by issuing so many warrants that they could not be surveyed and returned . in time. The returning of the survey was no part of the contract, but was merely directory to the officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-3\">But what are those rules of office which are said to be violated ? They (lo not appear in this record, so as for the Court to take' notice of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-4\">In this case <em>Curry </em>appears to be a mere volunteer, and to have obtained the land from lord <em>Fairfax </em>as a <em>gift. </em>Of course he is in no better situation than lord <em>Fairfax </em>would have been. If then the <em>Proprietor </em>ought not to have taken advantage of the forfeiture, (if any such existed,) so as to grant the land again to Curry, the Act of 1786, revives and preserves the right of the appellee..</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-5\">The President. \u2014 In <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Dowdall, </em>the Court determined, that the Act of 1786 did not apply to cases where there had been a grant from the <em>Proprietor.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayp\"><em>Lee, </em>in <em>reply.' </em>\u2014 Curry is said to be a volunteer, but there is no evidence in the recprd to support the assertion. The grant to him is the same in form with all the other grants of the <em>Proprietor; </em>it reserves the usual quit-rents, and contains the same conditions. So that this case is not on that account to be distinguished from the case of <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Dowdall.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\"> See. I. <em>ee </em>Whereas the law authorising the Register of the land office to receive into his office plats and certificates of surveys that have been or shall be made, will expire on the last day of December, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, and it is represented to this General Assembly that many persons through unavoidable accidents have been prevented from returning their plats and certificates aforesaid, to the Register of the land office, whereby their lands may be forfeited: for remedy whereof, Be it enacted by the General Assembly, that the further time of two years, after the passing of this Act shall be allowed for returning the same, within which time the Register of the land office, or his deputy, shall receive all plats and certificates of survey, although not returned within the time heretofore limited by law 5 and such lands sft\u00e1ll not be considered as forfeited, or liable to forfeiture on that account\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b167-7\">Roane J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao64\">The circumstances of this case are less strong against the relief which is asked for, than they were in the case of <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Dotvdall. </em>For, first, the forbearance of <em>Burns </em>in coming forward to complete his title has not been of so long a duration as in that case. Secondly', There is no evidence of an abandonment on the part of <em>Burns </em>of his right to the land. Thirdly, there is no proof here, farther than what is contained in the grant to <em>Curry, </em>that any advertisement had been published by lord <em>Fairfax </em>between the time of <em>Burns's </em>survey, and that made for <em>Curry, </em>requiring all those who had surveys to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>come forward, and complete their title. This is recited in the grant, and the failure of <em>Barns </em>to comply with the terms of that advertisement, is stated as the cause of the forfeiture. Fourthly, it does not appear that at the time <em>Burns </em>required a grant of the land, and offered to pay the composition and other fees of office, (which time 1 fix to be in or about <em>May </em>1770,) <em>Curry </em>had paid his composition money, if indeed any was ever paid by him. The grant to <em>Curry </em>was not executed until the 10th of <em>September </em>following. In' this view of the case therefore <em>Burns </em>may be considered as having stood upon better ground on account of his priority of survey, than <em>Curry </em>did, unless by liis own neglect he has lost his right to demand the legal title. It appears by a memorandum of <em>Richard Rigg, </em>that he surveyed <em>Curry\u2019s </em>land by virtue of lord <em>Fairfax\u2019s </em>instructions, there being, as 1 presume, no warrant for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">This survey was made the 20th of August, 1768, and must be considered as the commencement of <em>Curry\u2019s </em>claim. Between this period and the time of the return of <em>Burns\u2019s </em>survey, (which though not stated, may be presumed to have been shortly after the survey was made, <em>viz. </em>in <em>September </em>1757,) there had been a lapse of near eleven years, during which time <em>Burns </em>had wholly neglected to come forward and complete his title. The question then is, whether after this delay, and the consequent loss of quit-rents to the proprietor, he had not a right to consider the claim of <em>Burns </em>as forfeited, and to grant the land to another? I will not undertake to say what ought to be considered as a reasonable time to indulge the owner of asurvey in completing his title; perhaps every case ought to stand upon its own particular circumstances: but a delay of eleven years, unaccompanied with any exculpatory circumstances on the part of the grantee, is certainly an unreasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">If a grant had been made to Burns, he would have forfeited his land by the non-payment of quit-rents for the space of three years; by this delay he avoids the payment of them altogether. It was in all cases im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>porfani to the <em>Proprietor </em>that grants should be taken out within a reasonable time, it is presumable, that it was understood by applicants that this should be the ease; and certainly the spirit of equity does not dictate that a party by not performing his contract shall be in a much better situation, and the other contracting party consequently in a worse, than if the contract had been duly performed as understood by both parties. I put it upon the ground of an implied contract between the <em>Proprietor </em>and the individual applying for bis lands, that the legal fees should not only be paid, but that a title should be obtained within a reasonable time. On the authority of the case of <em>Picket </em>v\u00bb Doto<em>dall, </em>the survey for <em>Curry </em>is to be considered as an entry on the part of the <em>Proprietor </em>to take advantage of the forfeiture. This extinguished the interest of Burns, and of course the grant to <em>Curry </em>pursuant thereto cannot be impeached. The Court however will judge in every case, whether a forfeiture had taken place, and if not the entry and subsequent proceedings would be deemed invalid. The Act of 1785, not having declared intermediate grants to be void, they must stand unless they should be adjudged to be so on account of the particular circumstances attending them, and as there are none such in the grant to <em>Curry-</em>I am of opinion, that the decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed. -</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">Fleming J. \u2014 'The warrant issued <em>to Burns </em>bears date in 1756, and is surveyed in 1757, but not returned until 1770, at which time, and not before, he tendered the composition, and demanded his grant But a survey had in the mean time, been made for <em>Curry, </em>who in <em>September </em>1770, obtained a grant</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">This case, though it differs in some points from that of <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Dowdall, </em>is fully within the influence of the principles there laid down. <em>Burns </em>has certainly forfeited his right by an unreasonable delay in obtaining his grant, and Curry, having in the mean time obtained a legal title to the land, ought to retain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The President. \u2014 -The principles which decidedly govern this case, were so fully declared in that of <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Dmvdall, </em>that it will be unnecessary to repeat them. It is true, the two cases differ in some points, and that difference, so far as it extends, is in favour of <em>Burns. </em>The <em>laches </em>of <em>Burns </em>in not completing his title, is, in point of time, much less inexcusable than that of <em>Crap. </em>So too the tender of the composition ; differs this case somewhat from that. Yet these points of difference, do not essentially affect: the application of the principles laid down in that case. What \u00a1nay be considered as a leasonable time for the owner of a survey to complete his title, I will not pretend to say ; But I accord in opinion with the other Judges, that eleven j ears, unaccompanied will: circumstances, is too long.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Both decrees reversed, and the bill dismissed.
