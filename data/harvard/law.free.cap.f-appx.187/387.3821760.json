Gilliam, Texas inmate # 1175788, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and 1915A(b). Gilliam contends that the defendants violated his rights in numerous ways during his arrest, subsequent incarceration, criminal trial, and a subsequent probation revocation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">As the district court found, Gilliam has not shown that Tarrant County had a role in the events surrounding his arrest. Gilliam was arrested by Fort Worth police officers, he was incarcerated in a jail run by the City of Mansfield, Texas, and he was prosecuted by a district attorney acting as an agent of the State of Texas. <em>See Esteves v. Brock, </em>106 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.1997) (A \u201cdistrict attorney is an agent of the state, not of the county in which the criminal case happens to be prosecuted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-17\">We conclude that Gilliam\u2019s claims against Officer Grey are without merit. The district court did not err in holding that the state court trial transcript showed that Officer Grey believed that she had reached a deal with Gilliam for sex in exchange for money. However, because he was charged with committing a different offense than the one described by Grey, he was acquitted. Gilliam\u2019s claims against Grey lack an arguable basis in fact or in law under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-18\">We further hold that Gilliam\u2019s claims against Grey are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Although Gilliam was acquitted of the criminal charge stemming from his arrest, we conclude that a judgment in favor of Gilliam on his arrest claims or on his claims of official oppression and harassment would imply the invalidity of his revocation. <em>See Jackson v. Vannoy, </em>49 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>(applying <em>Heck </em>to probation revocations); <em>see also Esteves, </em>106 F.3d at 676 (this court may affirm on any grounds supported by the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Gilliam\u2019s claims against Fort Worth relating to his parole revocation also are barred by <em>Heck. </em>His claims against Fort Worth relating to his incarceration lack an arguable basis in law or fact under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Gilliam has not alleged facts to show a \u201cdirect causal link\u201d between a policy or custom of Fort Worth and the denial of his rights. <em>See Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997). He was incarcerated at a facility run by the City of Mansfield, not Fort Worth, and he can not show a \u201cdirect causal link\u201d between a Fort Worth \u201cpolicy\u201d to deliver its prisoners to the custody of the Mansfield jail and any unconstitutional conditions he suffered there. Finally, as previously noted, Gilliam was prosecuted by the district attorney, who was acting as an agent of the state. <em>See Esteves, </em>106 F.3d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Because this litigation presents no \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gilliam\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, and we deny Gilliam\u2019s renewed motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Finally, Gilliam\u2019s motion for leave to file supplemental briefs also is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Gilliam is warned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). If he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEFS DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
