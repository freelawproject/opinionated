This court lacks jurisdiction to consider the denial of their application for asylum because the BIA denied the application as untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-28\">To obtain withholding of removal, an applicant \u201cmust show that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution\u201d based on his political opinion, race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906-07 (5th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). We review for substantial evidence the determination that an alien is not entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 905-06. To grant a petition for review regarding a CAT claim, the record must compel a finding that the alien has shown that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>turned to his home country. <em>See Bah v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 348, 351-52 (5th Cir.2003). The record does not compel a finding the petitioners have met their burden to show they were entitled to withholding of removal or relied under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
