As explained below, we vacate his sentence and remand this case to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-21\">On September 1, 2004, Ryan entered into an agreement with the Government to plead guilty to conspiracy to distribute or to possess with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tion of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 &amp; 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006) (hereinafter \u201cCount One\u201d) and to using, carrying, or possessing a firearm during, in relation to, and in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(I) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006) (hereinafter \u201cCount Three\u201d). The indictment had alleged, and Ryan agreed to admit, that the conspiracy began \u201cin or about the period beginning in 2000\u201d and continued until \u201cin or about [March 10, 2004].\u201d J.A. at 27, 56. Ryan also agreed to waive his right to appeal \u201cany sentencing guidelines factors or the Court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines factors to the facts of [his] case.\u201d J.A. at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The district court sentenced Ryan on May 5, 2005. On Count One, the court initially calculated an advisory guidelines sentence between 168 and 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. After prior notice to Ryan\u2019s counsel, the Government moved, and the district court agreed, to treat Ryan\u2019s earlier state court conviction for cocaine possession as a prior felony drug offense. In accordance with \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years for this category of repeat drug offenders, the district court set Ryan\u2019s initial advisory guidelines sentence for Count One at 240 months. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (2004) (\u201cWhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d). The district court then granted Ryan a downward departure based upon the Government\u2019s motion setting forth his substantial assistance to the Government, and ultimately sentenced Ryan to 180 months in prison for Count One. On Count Three, the court sentenced Ryan to an additional sixty months to be served consecutively to his Count One sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Ryan now challenges on a number of grounds the district court\u2019s enhancement of his Count One sentence based on his prior drug conviction. We review the sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The Government initially asserted that in his plea agreement Ryan waived his right to challenge his sentence, but in his reply brief Ryan claimed for the first time that his earlier conviction does not qualify as a prior felony drug conviction under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). In a post-briefing motion to this court, the Government withdrew its waiver defense with respect to that issue and now requests that we remand Ryan\u2019s case for re-sentencing in light of this newly raised error.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Section 841(b)(1)(A) establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, but increases that minimum to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment for anyone who violates the statute \u201cafter a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final.\u201d Ryan pleaded guilty to Count One of the indictment, which alleged that he had engaged in a crack cocaine conspiracy that ended on or about March 10, 2004. Ryan\u2019s state conviction for possession of cocaine did not become final until at least April 5, 2004.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This conviction therefore does not qualify as a prior felony drug conviction under Section 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>When a sentence is imposed \u201cas a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines,\u201d we must remand the case for additional proceedings. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(f) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006); <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006) (noting that a sentence falling outside the properly calculated guidelines range because of an \u201cerror in construing or applying the guidelines\u201d is unreasonable). The district court\u2019s error in treating Ryan\u2019s cocaine possession conviction as a prior felony drug conviction led it to fix Ryan\u2019s initial advisory guidelines sentence at 240 months instead of between 168 to 210 months, which in turn affected his ultimate sentence on Count One. Because the district court miscalculated the advisory guidelines sentence applicable to Count One, we vacate Ryan\u2019s sentence on that count and remand his case for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Having concluded that Ryan should be re-sentenced on Count One, we do not reach Ryan\u2019s other challenges to his sentence, nor do we express any opinion on any other aspect of the reasonableness of Ryan\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The sentence of the district court on Count One is</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\"> The records of Ryan\u2019s state drug conviction indicate that the court placed Ryan on probation for the offense, but \"withheld formal adjudication of guilt,\u201d on April 15, 2003. Reply Br. of Appellant App. at 28. Ryan failed to appear as scheduled on April 5, 2004, and the court continued the case until his apprehension.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
