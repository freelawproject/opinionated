He was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to serve 120 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-21\">Dold claims the district court reversibly erred by upwardly departing at sentencing. Because he did not object in district court, we review only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433 (5th Cir.2006). No authority need be cited for the plain-error factors, one of which is \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d error.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-22\">His contention that the decision to depart was based on improper factors lacks merit. The court gave extensive reasons for that decision, including the extreme psychological trauma caused to the victims of the offense and the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Its remarks at sentencing show the departure was based on valid grounds. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.3; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-25\">Dold maintains his sentence is unreasonable because it differs from that given to another defendant fails. A similarly situated defendant\u2019s receiving a different sentence is insufficient to show Dold\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-26\">Dold\u2019s claim that the court did not give an adequate explanation for its choice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>sentence and did not commit this explanation to paper is refuted by the record. <em>See id. </em>at 707; <em>see also United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 416-17 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 663 (2006). And, contrary to Dold\u2019s assertions, the magnitude of the departure was <em>not </em>unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 713, 163 L.Ed.2d 543 (2005); <em>Jones, </em>444 F.3d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Dold has not shown error. Therefore, he obviously fails to show the requisite plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
