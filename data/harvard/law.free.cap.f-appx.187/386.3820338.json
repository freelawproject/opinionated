He argues that his sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because the district court committed reversible error by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory sentencing guidelines regime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Caldwell\u2019s objection pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), was sufficient to preserve this issue for appeal. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 404 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The sentence pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme constitutes <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). The government thus bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the guidelines been advisory only. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464. If the government cannot show that the error was harmless, we ordinarily will vacate and remand for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The government cannot meet its burden. <em>See id. </em>at 464-66. Because the <em>Fanfan </em>error requires remand for resentencing, we need not address Caldwell\u2019s remaining challenge to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we vacate Caldwell\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
