On appeal, Lewis argues that the district court abused its discretion by excluding his testimony and the testimony of other Georgia Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) employees regarding prior discriminatory conduct of the defendants. Lewis argues that such evidence was admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) as evidence of motive and intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-22\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of Lewis and other DOT employees regarding alleged prior instances of discrimination and prior complaints of discrimination because the excluded evidence did not involve the decisionmakers for the promotion, and as Lewis raised neither a retaliation nor a hostile work environment claim, the evidence was likely to confuse the issues for the jury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>unfairly prejudice the defendants. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-17\">. Lewis also argues that the defendants waived their right to challenge the admission of the statements contained in the affidavits by not objecting to the affidavits in their reply brief on summary judgment. It appears that Lewis's brief was part of a draft response to the defendants\u2019 motions in <em>limine </em>in district court, and the arguments were not tailored to take into account what took place at the trial. Lewis\u2019s waiver argument makes no sense on appeal as the district court considered defendants\u2019 objections to the testimony during the trial, and those rulings are the subject of this appeal. Therefore, this argument, as well as any other arguments not tailored to the trial, is not addressed in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
