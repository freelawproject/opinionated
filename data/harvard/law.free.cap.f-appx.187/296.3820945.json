The district court sentenced Washington to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment on counts 1 and 3, and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on count 2, all to be served concurrently, three years of supervised release on each of counts 1, 2, and 3, to be served concurrently, and ordered payment of a $300 statutory assessment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Washington\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Washington\u2019s plea. Washington was given an opportunity to file a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">Washington did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, therefore his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Rule 11 hearing and find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Washington\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Moreover, we find that the district court properly consulted the Guidelines and considered them when sentencing Washington, that it made all the factual findings appropriate for that determination, considered the sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005), and imposed a sentence that was \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). The district court properly sentenced Washington in compliance with the mandates of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and Washington\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Washington\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-11\"> The probation officer calculated a sentencing guideline range applicable to Washington of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment founded on a total offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of VI, as a career offender. After careful consideration of the facts and evidence, the district court determined that one of Washington\u2019s predicate career offender convictions overstated his criminal history, and recalculated his offense level to 27 and his criminal history category to IV, with an attendant adjusted guideline range of 100 to 125 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
