The decision of the IJ is the proper subject of our review. <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003). We will not reverse the IJ\u2019s determination that Van Deventer was ineligible for asylum \u201cunless the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Van Deventer argues that substantial evidence supports a determination both that she suffered past persecution and that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her race. The evidence, however, does not compel a finding that Van Deventer was \u201cpersecuted,\u201d as opposed to merely discriminated against, or that she suffered severe economic hardship as a result of South Africa\u2019s affirmative action policy. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 187 n. 4 (5th Cir.2004); Abdel-Masieh <em>v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 583 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Moreover, neither the conclusional assertion in Van Deventer\u2019s brief nor the IJ\u2019s decision establishes that the IJ failed to consider Van Deventer\u2019s separate incidents of harm in the aggregate when ascertaining whether she had suffered past persecution. Therefore, she has failed to carry her burden of establishing legal error in that respect. <em>See Eduard, </em>379 F.3d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Because Van Deventer failed to establish past persecution, the IJ correctly held that she is not entitled to a presumption of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1) (2006). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Van Deventer did not have an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution on account of her race. The evidence does not compel a finding either that the South African government had the capability and the inclination to punish Van Deventer, <em>see Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 307 (5th Cir.2005), or that her fear of being raped if removed was on account of an enumerated ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
