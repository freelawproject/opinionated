In November 2005, Payman sought leave from the court to file a lawsuit against Shelbourne and others. By order entered November 26, 2005, the court denied Payman\u2019s request. Payman now appeals the court\u2019s denial, but only with respect to Shelbourne.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-23\">We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Payman v. Ahsan, </em>No. CA-05-18-2 (W.D.Va. Nov. 26, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
