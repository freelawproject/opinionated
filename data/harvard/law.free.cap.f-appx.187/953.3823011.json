Sykosky argued that he was entitled to statutory tolling for the time during which a Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850 motion, which the state court ultimately dismissed as untimely, was pending. The district court rejected this contention, citing to <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005) for the premise that an untimely state court motion is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). We granted Sykosky a certificate of appealability on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-15\">Whether the district court erred by finding that the appellant was not entitled to statutory tolling for the time during which his September 18, 2003 Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850 motion was pending in state court, pursuant to <em>Delancy v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>246 F.3d 1328, 1331 (11th Cir.2001)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">For the reasons stated below, we answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b978-18\">In 1996, Sykosky was convicted in Florida state court on two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated child abuse, and his convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>See Sykosky v. State, </em>705 So.2d 903 (Fla. 1st DCA 1998) (per curiam) (table case). Over the next 6 years, he filed a number of motions in state court for postconviction relief, including a June 19, 2003, motion under Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.800 to correct an illegal sentence. On July 31, 2003, the state trial court granted the motion in part, vacating Sykosky\u2019s convictions and sentences on the aggravated child abuse counts because \u201ca defendant may not be convicted and sentenced for both felony murder and the underlying offense of Aggravated Child Abuse.\u201d On September 18, 2003, Sykosky filed a motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>that, given the recent vacatur of his aggravated child abuse convictions and sentences, there was \u201cno legal basis\u201d to support his convictions and sentences for first degree felony murder. Rule 3.850 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-5\">(b) Time Limitations. A motion to vacate a sentence that exceeds the limits provided by law may be filed at any time. No other motion shall be filed or considered pursuant to this rule if filed more than 2 years after the judgment and sentence become final in a noncapital case or more than 1 year after the judgment and sentence become final in a capital case in which a death sentence has been imposed unless it alleges that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFn\">(1) the facts on which the claim is predicated were unknown to the movant or the movant\u2019s attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850(b). Sykosky argued that his Rule 3.850 motion, though made outside the normal time limits, satisfied Rule 3.850(b)(1) because the recent vacatur of his aggravated child abuse convictions and sentences was \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d The state trial court dismissed the Rule 3.850 motion as untimely, finding that Sykosky\u2019s claim that his felony murder convictions and sentences were \u201cinvalid and/or illegal in that no proof of an underlying felony exists is not newly discovered evidence pursuant to [Rule 3.850(b)].\u201d The state appellate court affirmed without opinion in March of 2004, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>See Sykosky v. State, </em>871 So.2d 215 (Fla. 1st DCA 2004) (per curiam) (table case), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 846, 125 S.Ct. 291, 160 L.Ed.2d 75 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">After Sykosky filed his \u00a7 2254 petition in federal district court, the State moved to dismiss the petition as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). The district court, following the recommendation of a magistrate judge, agreed. The court held that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Pace, </em>Sykosky\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of tolling AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), because the motion had been dismissed in state court as untimely. <em>See Pace, </em>544 U.S. at 414, 125 S.Ct. at 1812 (\u201cWhen a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, \u2018that [is] the end of the matter\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d) (quoting <em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 226, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 2141, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">A district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition for writ of habeas corpus is reviewed de novo, but \u201cthe district court\u2019s determination of the relevant facts will be reversed only if clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">The habeas corpus petitions of state prisoners are subject to a one-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This period is tolled at any time during which a <em>\u201cproperly filed </em>application for State post-conviction relief or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (emphasis added). On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Sykosky concedes that his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition is time-barred unless we hold that his Rule 3.850 motion satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), and thereby tolled AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">A. \u201cProperly Filed\u201d and Rule 3.850</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Sykosky contends that, even though his Rule 3.850 motion was held to be untimely in state court, it was nevertheless \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), because its delivery and acceptance were in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings. <em>See Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 364, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). He points to our decision in <em>Delancy v. Florida Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>246 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam), which addressed the meaning of \u201cproperly filed\u201d in the context of Rule 3.800 and 3.850 motions. There we noted that, in <em>Artuz, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the question of whether an application was properly filed was \u201cquite separate\u201d from the question of whether the claims contained in the application were \u201cmeritorious and free of procedural bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330 (quoting <em>Artuz, </em>531 U.S. at 9, 121 S.Ct. at 364). Thus, we held, the district court erred in looking beyond the face of prisoner Delaney\u2019s Rule 3.800 motion when determining whether it was \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of tolling AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>Id. </em>The motion was \u201cproperly filed,\u201d we found, because it met state procedural and filing requirements on its face. <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31. Under the circumstances of the case, however, Delaney\u2019s habeas petition was still untimely unless AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations was also tolled during the pendency of his Rule 3.850 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1331. Delaney filed his Rule 3.850 motion outside the normal two-year statute of limitations, but alleged that it was based on newly discovered evidence. <em>See id. </em>We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-6\">Delaney argues that his motion did allege that newly discovered evidence rendered his conviction unlawful. While the claims raised in his Rule 3.850 motion may have no merit, the question for purposes of this appeal is whether the motion is, within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), \u201ca properly filed motion for state post-conviction\u201d relief under that section. Under <em>Artuz, </em>an application is \u201cproperly filed\u201d when its delivery and acceptance \u201care in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.\u201d Because Rule 3.850 requires only that the motion allege that facts \u201cwere unknown to the movant or the movant\u2019s attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence\u201d we find that if Delaney\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion in fact alleges \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d it was properly filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). We held that Delaney met this requirement, and therefore reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas petition as time-barred. <em>See id. </em>at 1331-32; <em>cf. Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1285 (\u2018We addressed the question of exceptions in <em>Delaney, </em>and held that an untimely Rule 3.850 motion would be deemed properly filed if it alleged facts that would merit an exception from the timely filing requirement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Although Sykosky compares his case to <em>Delaney, </em>the State contends that <em>Delaney </em>is inapplicable, because Sykosky \u201cdid not allege facts to support a newly discovered evidence claim\u201d in his Rule 3.850 motion. According to the State, the then-recent vacatur of Sykosky\u2019s aggravated child abuse convictions and sentences is not a fact that would probably support an acquittal on the charged offenses of first degree felony murder. <em>See Kight v. State, </em>784 So.2d 396, 401 (Fla.2001) (per curiam). This argument, however, ultimately attacks Sykosky\u2019s motion on the merits. <em>Delaney </em>indicates that we should focus on what Sykosky <em>alleges, </em>not whether those allegations ultimately have <em>merit. See De</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number><em>lancy, </em>246 F.3d at 1331; <em>Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1285 (\u201cDrew\u2019s third 3.850 motion would have been properly filed despite its untimeliness if it had <em>alleged </em>facts that would trigger any of the three exceptions set forth in the Florida statute ....\u201d) (emphasis added). Sykosky\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion claims that his convictions and sentences for first degree felony murder are invalid and/or illegal because there is no proof of an underlying felony. In support of this claim he alleges, <em>inter alia, </em>facts about the vacatur of his convictions and sentences for the underlying felony of aggravated child abuse. We need not resolve whether these allegations satisfy <em>Delaney, </em>however, because even if they do the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo </em>leads us to conclude that Sykosky\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">B. <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">In addition to arguing that Sykosky did not really allege facts implicating Rule 3.850(b)(1), the State contends-and the district court agreed-that <em>Pace </em>requires us to consider Sykosky\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion not \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>Pace, </em>which postdates <em>Delaney </em>and <em>Drew, </em>addresses the question the Supreme Court reserved in <em>Artuz: </em>\u201cwhether the existence of certain exceptions to a timely filing requirement can prevent a late application from being considered improperly filed.\u201d <em>Pace, </em>544 U.S. at 413, 125 S.Ct. at 1811 (quoting <em>Artuz, </em>531 U.S. at 8 n. 2, 121 S.Ct. at 364 n. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">In <em>Pace, </em>state prisoner John Pace filed a petition for postconviction relief under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), which had been amended to include a statute of limitations with several exceptions, including one applicable when \u201cnew facts arise that could not have been discovered through due diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 125 S.Ct. at 1810. The state courts determined that Pace\u2019s petition was untimely, because it was filed outside the PCRA statute of limitations and Pace \u201chad neither alleged nor proven\u201d that he fell within any of the listed exceptions. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 125 S.Ct. at 1810-11. When the timeliness of Pace\u2019s subsequent habeas petition in federal district court became an issue, the district court held that the state courts\u2019 rejection of Pace\u2019s PCRA petition as untimely did not prevent it from being \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of tolling AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 411-12, 125 S.Ct. at 1811. The Third Circuit reversed, holding that the PCRA time limitations constituted a \u201ccondition to filing,\u201d and that \u201cwhen a state court deems a petition untimely, it is not \u2018properly filed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 125 S.Ct. at 1811.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">The Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 125 S.Ct. at 1811. Under the common understanding of the phrase \u201cproperly filed,\u201d the Court explained, \u201ca petition filed after a time limit, and which does not fit within any exceptions to that limit, is no more \u2018properly filed\u2019 than a petition filed after a time limit that permits no exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 125 S.Ct. at 1812. Otherwise \u201ca state prisoner could toll [AEDPA\u2019s] statute of limitations at will simply by filing untimely state postconviction petitions,\u201d which would be contrary to the purpose of AEDPA and \u201copen the door to abusive delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen a postconviction petition is untimely under state law,\u201d the Court stated, \u201c \u2018that [is] the end of the matter\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 125 S.Ct. at 1812 (quoting <em>Saffold, </em>536 U.S. at 226, 122 S.Ct. at 2141). The Court concluded: \u201c[W]e hold that time limits, no matter their form, are \u2018filing\u2019 conditions. Because the state court rejected [Pace\u2019s] PCRA petition as untimely, it was not \u2018properly filed,\u2019 and he is not entitled to statutory tolling under \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 125 S.Ct. at 1814.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Sykosky contends <em>Pace </em>merely clarified that the phrase \u201cproperly filed\u201d denotes compliance with procedural filing requirements \u201cthat must be satisfied before a state court will allow a motion to be filed and accorded some level of judicial review.\u201d In <em>Pace </em>itself, however, the Supreme Court rejected this kind of characterization as inconsistent with <em>Artuz, </em>where the Court \u201cexplained that jurisdictional matters and fee payments, both of which often necessitate judicial scrutiny, are \u2018condition[s] to filing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 125 S.Ct. at 1812 (citation omitted). The Court added: \u201cWe fail to see how timeliness is any less a \u2018filing\u2019 requirement than the mechanical rules that are enforceable by clerks, if such rules exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414-15, 125 S.Ct. at 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Sykosky also contends that <em>Pace </em>is distinguishable, because Pace \u201cneither alleged nor prove[d]\u201d that he fell within an exception to the state time limits, whereas Sykosky did allege that he fell within an exception. We find this distinction unavailing because, like the Supreme Court in <em>Pace, </em>we have been presented with a state court determination that the prisoner\u2019s postconviction petition was untimely under state law, and we give deference to such determinations. <em>Webster v. Moore, </em>199 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam). Indeed, in <em>Pace </em>the Supreme Court stated that Pace\u2019s PCRA petition did not entitle him to statutory tolling \u201c[bjecause the <em>state court </em>rejected [the] PCRA petition as untimely,\u201d not because Pace had failed to make allegations about timeliness in the petition. <em>Pace, </em>544 U.S. at 417, 125 S.Ct. at 1814 (emphasis added). Here, the state trial court rejected Sykosky\u2019s claim of newly discovered evidence and dismissed his Rule 3.850 motion \u201cfor the reason that the Motion is <em>untimely </em>filed pursuant to Rule 3.850(b).\u201d (emphasis added). The state appellate court affirmed without opinion. In other words, the state courts determined that Sykosky\u2019s motion was \u201cfiled after a time limit\u201d and \u201c[did] not fit within any exceptions to that limit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 125 S.Ct. at 1812. We therefore defer to the determination of the state courts, and \u201cthat [is] the end of the matter\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 414, 125 S.Ct. at 1812 (internal quotes omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">To the extent that <em>Delaney </em>and <em>Drew </em>can be read to suggest that time limits are not filing conditions, or that a Rule 3.850 motion which has been dismissed as untimely in state court may nevertheless have been \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), they conflict with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pace </em>and must be disregarded. <em>See In re Provenzano, </em>215 F.3d 1233, 1235 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Because Sykosky\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion was untimely, under state law, it was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) and did not toll AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. Accordingly, the district court did not err when it determined that Sykosky was not entitled to statutory tolling for the time during which his Rule 3.850 motion was pending in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-13\"><em>. </em>This was Sykosky's second Rule 3.850 motion. The denial of his first Rule 3.850 motion (made on different grounds) was initially reversed, <em>see Sykosky v. State, </em>770 So.2d 207 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>(Fla. 1st DCA 2000) (per curiam), but the motion was denied again on remand and the state appellate court affirmed. <em>See Sykosky v.

The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\u201d) governs this case because Sykosky filed his \u00a7 2254 petition after AEDPA\u2019s effective date. <em>See Wade v. Battle, </em>379 F.3d 1254, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b982-5\">. \u201c[A] rule governing filings must be 'firmly established and regularly followed' before noncompliance will render a petition improperly filed for purposes of AEDPA's tolling provision.\u201d See <em>Siebert v. Campbell, </em>334 F.3d 1018, 1025 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (citation omitted). Sykosky makes no claim that Rule 3.850 was not ''firmly established and regularly followed\u201d at the time it was applied to his postconviction proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
