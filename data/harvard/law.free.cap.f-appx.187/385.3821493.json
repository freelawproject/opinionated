(The Fairgrounds\u2019 motion to strike a portion of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s brief is GRANTED; his motion to supplement the record on appeal is DENIED.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">O\u2019Rourke was hired by the Fairgrounds in early 2003 to serve as a daytime security officer. On 1 August 2003, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s supervisor spotted him, off-duty but in uniform, standing in line to place a bet. This action violated Fairgrounds\u2019 policy prohibiting security guards from \u201cplac[ing] a bet or cash[ing] in a ticket when they are working or in uniform\u201d. An employee caught violating this policy \u201cwill face immediate suspension or termination\u201d. The supervisor asked O\u2019Rourke to remove his uniform before placing a bet, but he refused, explaining he was off-duty. The supervisor reported this incident, and O\u2019Rourke was given a one-day disciplinary suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-23\">Several months later, in January 2004, O\u2019Rourke resigned from his position, refusing to sign a resignation letter. On 26 March 2004, he filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claiming that \u2014 based on the gambling incident alone \u2014 he was discriminated against as a white male; O\u2019Rourke asserted that two black male employees had also gambled, without consequence, in violation of the Fairgrounds\u2019 policy. It appears this assertion is incorrect, because the Fairgrounds showed one black male was suspended for this behavior; there was no documentation of another individual engaging in similar behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-24\">Subsequently, O\u2019Rourke filed this action, claiming race discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and defamation under Louisiana law. The district court awarded against O\u2019Rourke. For the race-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>discrimination claim, the court concluded O\u2019Rourke failed to state a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination and his employer stated a legitimate non-discriminatory purpose for his suspension. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). It concluded O\u2019Rourke\u2019s defamation claim failed because he did \u201cnot articulate[ ] facts essential to his cause of action under Louisiana law\u201d. (O\u2019Rourke also claimed constructive discharge; summary judgment was also awarded against this claim, which does not appear to be raised in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief to our court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">As noted, O\u2019Rourke appeals <em>pro se. Pro se </em>litigants\u2019 briefs are liberally construed, and we are to apply less stringent standards to <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). Despite this leniency, however, <em>pro se </em>litigants \u201cmust still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28\u201d of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>Id. </em>O\u2019Rourke\u2019s brief fails to articulate properly the issues on appeal. In any event, any contentions he makes lack merit. Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, the summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED; APPELLEE\u2019S MOTION GRANTED; APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
