He argues that the BIA should have reopened his removal proceedings in order to allow him to pursue relief under \u00a7 212(c) and (h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">This court lacks jurisdiction to consider Ortega\u2019s argument that the BIA should have reopened his case pursuant to the BIA\u2019s sua sponte authority. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 250 (5th Cir.2004). Ortega\u2019s contention that this court has the authority to examine sua sponte whether relief under INA \u00a7 212(c) and (h) is available to Ortega lacks merit. Moreover, Ortega has failed to brief any other cognizable issues regarding the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Ortega\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
