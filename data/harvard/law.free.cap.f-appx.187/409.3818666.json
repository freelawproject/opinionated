Oropeza\u2019s brief can be construed as challenging, for the first time on appeal, the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), an argument that has been termed \u201cFanfan error.\u201d <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Fanfan error meets the first two prongs of the plain error analysis. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). Because Oropeza has failed to demonstrate that the error affected the outcome in the district court, his claim of Fanfan error does not warrant relief. <em>See id. </em>at 733-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Oropeza\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Oropeza contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Oropeza concedes that his argument appears to be foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>but he also argues, for the first time on appeal, that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is distinguishable because the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 487-88, 120 S.Ct. 2348, limited its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to cases in which the defendant specifically admitted the predicate felony used to enhance his sentence. He also argues, for the first time on appeal, that he did not admit to the prior felony conviction and that the evidence was insufficient at sentencing to support his enhanced sentence under \u00a7 1326(b). <em>Apprendi </em>did not limit <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s </em>holding to cases in which the defendant admits having committed the predicate felony prior to pleading guilty. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 487-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Oropeza has not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
