Rodriguez\u2019s contention that his prior burglary conviction in Texas does not qualify as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) lacks merit in light of <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006). His contention that this court did not apply the proper categorical analysis of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), is no more than an argument that <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>was wrongly decided. <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>resolved the issue raised in this case, and one panel of this court may not ignore the precedent set by a prior panel. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999). Rodriguez\u2019s conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and provided a basis for the district court\u2019s 16-level enhancement of his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-26\">Rodriguez also contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rodriguez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rodriguez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
