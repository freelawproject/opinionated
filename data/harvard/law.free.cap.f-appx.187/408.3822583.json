Because Amiri overstayed, removal proceedings were instituted. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Amiri\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under Convention Against Torture (CAT) and permitted Amiri to depart voluntarily. On March 24, 2005, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision insofar as it found that Amiri was not credible and had failed to meet his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">Amiri moved the BIA to reconsider and/or reopen the removal proceedings so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>that he could apply for adjustment of status, to which, he contended, he was entitled as a beneficiary of a pending immigrant petition for alien worker filed by a prospective employer that was on appeal after it was denied because of the employer\u2019s inability to pay the proffered wages. The BIA denied the motion. Amiri timely petitioned this court for review of the BIA\u2019s decision denying the motion to reconsider and/or reopen the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Amiri contends that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision denying his application for withholding of removal and for relief under the CAT. Because Amiri did not petition for review of the BIA\u2019s March 24, 2005 decision, and because he identified no factual or legal errors in the IJ\u2019s order in his motion to reconsider and/or reopen, this issue is not properly before the court. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1); <em>Trevino v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 173, 181 n. 3 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">This court reviews the BIA\u2019s \u201cdenial of both a motion to reopen and a motion for reconsideration under a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Citing <em>Subhan v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 591 (7th Cir.2004), Amiri contends that the BIA abused its discretion and violated his right to due process in refusing to reopen the removal proceedings because the BIA\u2019s decision will have the consequence of making him ineligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). The BIA determined that Amiri had failed to make a prima facie showing of eligibility for such relief because he had failed to establish that an immigrant visa was immediately available. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(B). Amiri has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the proceedings to permit him to pursue his application for adjustment of status. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437-438 (5th Cir.2006) (declining to follow <em>Subhan). </em>Because the relief he seeks is discretionary, his due process rights are not implicated. <em>See id. </em>at 440. Amiri\u2019s petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
