Arora seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration of the denial of his motion for production of documents following the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dis-positive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Arora has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. Finding the appeal timely filed, we deny Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss on that basis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"><em> </em>Arora filed the underlying action as a civil complaint against the Defendants. The district court determined that his action was, in effect, a \u00a7 2255 motion because Arora sought to challenge the validity of his convictions and his sentence based on his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
