Romero appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a minor-role reduction and challenges his sentence as unreasonable. We affirm Romero\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-17\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">A. <em>Minor-role reduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-19\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level decrease in a defendant\u2019s offense level if the court finds the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2. In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Furthermore, \u201cthat a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor ... participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The proponent of the reduction bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The district court did not clearly err by refusing to grant Romero a minor-role reduction because the district court held Romero accountable only for the plants with which he worked and not the number of plants attributed to the conspiracy. Romero was responsible for keeping approximately 6,000 marijuana plants alive, which supports the district court\u2019s finding that Romero played an integral role in the success of the conspiracy. Moreover, the large amount of marijuana involved in this offense suggests a minor-role reduction was inappropriate. Finally, we have stated a case may involve a conspiracy in which none of the actors is a minor participant. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in refusing to grant Romero a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">B. <em>Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cBefore deciding whether a sentence is reasonable, we first determine whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the Guidelines to calculate the appropriate advisory Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Then we determine whether the ultimate sentence imposed was reasonable in the context of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">Factors the district court should take into account under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the advisory Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). However, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">The district court correctly calculated Romero\u2019s advisory Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. In looking at the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court specifically acknowledged Romero\u2019s youth and the date he arrived in the United States, but the court found more important that Romero did not commit the crimes because he was suffering from an addiction to drugs and the large amount of marijuana involved in the portion of the conspiracy for which he was accountable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553; <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1328-29. The court found Romero\u2019s actions were integral to the success of the conspiracy and supported a sentence at the high end of the range. We find his 87-month sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
