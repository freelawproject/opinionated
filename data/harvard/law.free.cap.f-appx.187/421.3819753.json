Moreno contends that the Immigration Judge (IJ) erred when he determined that the exception from counting time spent in the United States for minors contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii)(I) was inapplicable to \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C), the subsection governing his case, and that the IJ\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutory sections violated the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-25\">The plain meaning of the language of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii)(I) limits its application to \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). <em>See United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 242, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989). Section 1182(a)(9)(C) has an exceptions provision, and it does not include any exception for minors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(ii). Additionally, <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>\u2014 \u2018the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Thompson v. Goetzmann, </em>337 F.3d 489, 499 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-26\">Moreover, we have distinguished \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B) and \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C), noting that \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C) applies to more culpable conduct than does the other provision. <em>Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 255-56 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 733, 163 L.Ed.2d 569 (2005). Additionally, the Ninth Circuit has determined that, although the phrase \u201cunlawful presence\u201d has the same general meaning in both subsections, it would not \u201cautomatically presume that the waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>provisions are also incorporated, particularly where they are contained in separate provisions and not within the definition itself.\u201d <em>Acosta v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 550, 557 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Finally, the distinction that we noted in <em>Morterctr-Cruz </em>provides a legitimate governmental interest in limiting the exceptions relevant to \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C). Moreno thus has failed to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
