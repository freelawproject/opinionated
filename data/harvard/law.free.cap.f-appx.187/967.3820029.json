Marshall argues that because he provided substantial assistance to the government and the government had no rational reason not to file a Rule 35(b) motion, he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to establish his entitlement to a Rule 35(b) motion for a reduction in sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-24\">Whether the government can be compelled to file a substantial assistance motion is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993). A district court\u2019s decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Winfield, </em>960 F.2d 970, 972 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-25\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(2) provides that, after a sentence has been imposed, upon motion of the government made more than one year after sentencing, a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence based on substantial assistance if the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance involved information not known by the defendant, not useful to the government, or the usefulness of which was not reasonably anticipated by the defendant, until more than one year after sentencing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). The government has \u201ca power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1500 (quoting <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.E.2d 524 (1992) (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance context). We limit our \u201creview of the government\u2019s refusal to file substantial assistance motions to claims of unconstitutional motive.\u201d <em>United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2000). A defendant who merely claims to have provided substantial assistance or who makes only generalized allegations of improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>motive is not entitled to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844. Thus, judicial review is generally appropriate only when \u201cthere is an allegation and a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The record demonstrates that Marshall alleged only bad faith as the motivation for the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion to reduce his sentence. Marshall made neither an allegation nor a substantial showing of a constitutionally impermissible motivation. Therefore, the district court was without authority to review the government\u2019s exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and Marshall was entitled to neither an order to compel nor an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
