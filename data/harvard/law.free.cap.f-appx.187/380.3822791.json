In his complaint, he alleged that the appellees failed to make a complete investigation into his allegations that he was kidnaped and that a micro-transmitter was implanted in his throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-22\">An IFP complaint may be dismissed as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). A dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-23\">Mason did not have a right to have the defendants protect his life, liberty, and property against invasion by private actors. <em>See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 195, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). Also, Mason has not shown that the exceptions to this general rule based on a special relationship or a state-created danger are applicable to this case. <em>See Walton v. Alexander, 44 </em>F.3d 1297, 1299-1304 (5th Cir.1995) (en banc); <em>see also Johnson v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>38 F.3d 198, 200 (5th Cir.1994). Finally, Mason has failed to allege a violation of his equal protection rights because he makes no argument that he is a member of any protected class. <em>See Washington v. Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 247-48, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-24\">Mason\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>missed. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Mason that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
