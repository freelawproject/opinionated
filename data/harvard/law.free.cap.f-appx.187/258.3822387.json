On appeal, Smith alleges that the district court improperly referred the action to the magistrate judge without the consent of the parties. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. The district court properly referred Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment to the magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000), and Smith filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. <em>See Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>687 F.2d 44, 46 (4th Cir.1982) (noting that a district court may refer matters to a magistrate judge without the consent of the parties under \u00a7 636(b)). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-15\"> In the district court, the lead plaintiff was Derrick Smith; he is no longer a party on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
