We will uphold findings that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT Act if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). Under the substantial evidence standard, reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision is improper unless the alien shows that the evidence compels it. <em>Majd v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir.2006) (No. 05-60141).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Our review of the record reveals there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s rulings that: (1) Momin did not suffer past persecution; and (2) he has not shown that it is more likely than not he will suffer persecution or torture if he is returned to India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3); <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 187 n. 4, 188 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, Momin has not shown that the evidence compels a reversal of the decision. Additionally, Momin does not challenge the denial of his request for voluntary departure. Accordingly, this issue is deemed abandoned. <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Momin\u2019s petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
