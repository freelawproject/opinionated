Califor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>nia, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Guerrero has not filed a response to his counsel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Article III, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to actual cases and controversies. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The ease-or-controversy requirement demands that \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction\u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Guerrero already has served the sentence that was imposed upon the revocation of his supervised release. The order revoking Guerrero\u2019s supervised release imposed no further term of supervised release. Accordingly, there is no case or controversy for this court to address, and the appeal is dismissed as moot. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">MOTION DENIED AS UNNECESSARY; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
