Buenrostro argues that: (1) Section 922(g)(1) is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power, both on its face and as applied to his case; (2) there was not sufficient evidence to support his convictions under \u00a7 922(g) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851; and (3) there was not sufficient evidence to support his conviction for methamphetamine distribution</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">The government cross-appeals Buenrostro\u2019s sentence for methamphetamine distribution, arguing that he should have been sentenced to a statutory minimum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii), instead of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(viii), because the district court should have found him responsible for 50 grams or more of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">First, Buenrostro\u2019s constitutional challenges to \u00a7 922(g)(1) must fail. We have consistently upheld the facial constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90. (11th Cir.1996). Furthermore, Buenrostro\u2019s as applied challenge, as well as his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, must fail. An expert testified at trial that, based on their make and serial numbers, the guns found at Buenrostro\u2019s residence were manufactured in California and Florida, could not have been manufactured in Georgia, and had traveled in and affected interstate commerce. Thus the requisite interstate nexus of the firearm was satisfied. <em>See Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1274 (holding that an interstate nexus was demonstrated by the government when an ATF Special Agent testified that the .25 caliber Raven Arms semiautomatic pistol that the defendant had possessed was manufactured in California and had moved in interstate commerce to Georgia, where the defendant was caught with the weapon).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Second, we reject Buenrostro\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence upon which to find him a convicted felon. The record provides sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Buenrostro was a convicted felon because (1) the certified copy of the Texas conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>was properly admitted as non-testimonial, as it was routinely and mechanically kept and prepared long before the alleged offenses, <em>see United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1145-46 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1604, 164 L.Ed.2d 325 (2006) (citation omitted), and (2) the certified conviction was accompanied by Probation Officer Printup\u2019s testimony that Buenrostro was his probationer \u2014 under Printup\u2019s supervision, paying probation fees, and reporting to Printup\u2014 for almost an entire year. Accordingly, the government provided sufficient evidence for the jury to determine that Buenrostro was a convicted felon for purposes of satisfying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Finally, we reject the argument that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for distribution of methamphetamine. First, a number of law enforcement officials testified that they (1) witnessed Buenrostro hand a blue WalMart shopping bag to confidential informant Marco Marquez, the contents of which were later found to be methamphetamine, and (2) recovered from Buenrostro\u2019s residence digital scales and plastic baggies, which were likely used in the distribution of illegal drugs. In fact, one detective specifically testified that he and another detective had searched Marquez\u2019s vehicle before the March 30 meeting between Marquez and Buenrostro, and the drugs in the Wal-Mart shopping bag could not have come from any source other than Buenrostro. The jury was shown the pound of a mixture containing methamphetamine and a stipulation, signed by Buenrostro, that the mixture weighed 443.6 grams, with a 24 percent purity level, containing 106.8 grams of pure methamphetamine, and the box of baggies and the scales recovered from Buenrostro\u2019s residence. Further, Marquez testified that he and Buenrostro agreed on March 3, 2004 that Buenrostro would front (\u201cloan\u201d) him one pound of methamphetamine, and the two met on March 30 to complete the transaction. This testimony was accompanied by a recorded conversation from March 30 between the two men, in which Buenrostro mentioned twice that there were four ounces of a substance. The jury also heard evidence that Marquez stood to gain personally by testifying favorably for the government in Buenrostro\u2019s trial. Despite Buenrostro\u2019s contention to the contrary, Marquez\u2019s testimony \u2014 corroborated by multiple exhibits and the testimony of multiple law enforcement officers \u2014 was not incredible as a matter of law. Thus, there was a sufficient basis for a reasonable trier of fact to determine that Buenrostro knowingly and intentionally distributed methamphetamine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Accordingly, Buenrostro\u2019s challenge to this conviction fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">On cross-appeal, the government argues that the district court clearly erred in failing to enhance Buenrostro\u2019s statutory minimum sentence based on the amount of pure methamphetamine to which he stipulated. The government asserts that the court\u2019s finding that the lack of a jury finding regarding the weight of pure amphetamine precluded the enhancement was in error because Buenrostro admitted, via stipulation, that the offense involved more than 100 grams of pure methamphetamine \u2014 an amount that triggered the statutory minimum enhancement. Further, the government argues that, even after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is still permitted to make findings of fact that increase a statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">The statutory penalties for controlled substance offenses under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) are listed subsection (b) of that statute. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). For a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>defendant with a prior felony drug conviction who committed an offense involving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlX\">50 grams or more of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers or 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers[,] ... [the sentence is] ... a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years and not more than life imprisonment[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). On the other hand, for a defendant with a prior felony drug conviction who committed an offense involving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-5\">5 grams or more of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers or 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers[,] ... [the sentence is] ... a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years and not more than life imprisonment[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(viii). Accordingly, the issue here concerns the calculation of the statutory minimum sentence, not the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime <em>beyond the prescribed statutory maximum </em>must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63 (emphasis added). Then, in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court \u201creaffirmed] [its] holding in <em>Apprendi: </em>Any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support <em>a sentence exceeding the maximum </em>authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 125 S.Ct. at 756 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">We have held that, despite <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding that the Sentencing Guidelines are merely advisory, district courts remain bound by statutory minimum sentences. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005). So long as the district court applies the guidelines as advisory, nothing in <em>Booker </em>prohibits it from making, under a preponderanee-of-the-evidence standard, additional factual findings that go beyond a defendant\u2019s admission. <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">Here, the district court clearly erred by finding that \u201c[t]he issue was still for the jury to find as to what the defendant was responsible for.\u201d Indeed, the district court had the authority to find, by a preponderance-of-the-evidenee standard, the amount of actual methamphetamine for which Buenrostro was responsible. <em>See Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1324. Moreover, as <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Booker </em>do not apply to statutory <em>minimum </em>sentences, and Buenrostro faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment regardless of which drug quantity he was held accountable for, had the district court determined the mandatory minimum sentence based on its own drug quantity finding, there would have been no constitutional error. Accordingly, we vacate and remand to allow the district court to make findings regarding what drug quantity and purity it believes a preponderance of the evidence supports.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
