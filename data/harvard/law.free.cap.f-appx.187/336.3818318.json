He was sentenced to a term of seventy-two months\u2019 imprisonment. Rosado appealed, and subsequently filed a motion to remand requesting that his case be returned to the district court for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-22\">Rosado contends that the appellate waiver set forth in his plea agreement was modified by comments made by the district court during the plea colloquy and sentencing hearing. The United States\u2019 silence in the face of those comments, he asserts, operated to alter the plea agreement and permit him to appeal. We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that this contention is without merit. Next, Rosado argues that the district court sentenced him in violation of <em>Booker </em>by treating the guidelines as mandatory. Our review discloses that any Sixth Amendment error arising from Rosado\u2019s sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>is harmless. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 416 (4th Cir.2006). Holding Rosado accountable for the fifty grams of cocaine base set forth in the indictment to which he pled guilty, the resulting guideline range would still be higher than the seventy-two month sentence imposed. Thus Rosado was not prejudiced by the alleged <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We accordingly grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. We deny Rosado\u2019s motion to remand and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
