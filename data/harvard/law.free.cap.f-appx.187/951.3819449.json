On appeal, Estupinan argues that: (1) the district court clearly erred in finding that he was not entitled to a minor-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b); and (2) the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>imposed by the court was unreasonable. Each issue is discussed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">I. <em>Minor-Role Reduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Estupinan argues that the district court clearly erred in not granting him a minor-role reduction because other individuals involved in the conspiracy played a far superior role than him and he was: (1) not the owner of the boat; (2) did not plan the trip; (3) did not help with navigation; (4) was not the owner of the drugs; (5) was not paid commission for the sale of the drugs; and (6) did not participate in any decision making. Estupinan argues that he was \u201cmerely a courier\u201d and \u201conly a sailor\u201d and that other similarly situated defendants have received mitigating role reductions and lesser sentences. Estupinan argues further that the courts treat similarly situated defendants, like himself, in a disparate manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">\u201c[We have] long and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez Be Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The proponent of the downward adjustment always bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. In determining the defendant\u2019s role, the decision falls within the sound discretion of the district court: \u201ca trial court\u2019s choice between \u2018two permissible views of the evidence\u2019 is the very essence of the clear error standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), a district court must decrease the defendant\u2019s offense level by two \u201cif the defendant was a minor participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Two legal principles should guide the district court in determining the defendant\u2019s role. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934. First, \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against [his] relevant conduct, that is, the conduct for which [he] has been held accountable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining a defendant\u2019s conduct in the offense, the \u201camount of drugs is a relevant factor and ... under some circumstances it may be dispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. Moreover, \u201ca defendant\u2019s status as a drug courier does not alter the principle that the district court must assess the defendant\u2019s role in light of the relevant conduct attributed to [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942. A \u201ccourier status in and of itself is not dispositive of whether a defendant is entitled to or precluded from receiving a downward adjustment for [his] role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, \u201cwhere the record evidence is sufficient, the district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants\u201d in the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to deny Estupinan a minor-role reduction is supported by the record. Under the first prong of the <em>Be Var\u00f3n </em>test, Estupinan\u2019s relevant conduct arose out of his own activities and his criminal agreement to transfer 4,300 kilograms of cocaine by vessel. Under the second prong of the <em>Be Var\u00f3n </em>test, when comparing Estupinan\u2019s role to the role of other participants in the offense, the facts describing the offense show that he is equally culpable to the other participants and that the only defendant who appeared to be more involved than Estupinan and the other defendants was the defendant identified as the master of the vessel. Based on these findings, the district court properly denied Estupinan\u2019s request for a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>II. <em>Reasonableness of Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Estupinan argues that his sentence of 135 months imprisonment is unreasonable because the court should have placed more weight on the fact that Estupinan\u2019s involvement in the offense resulted from his responsibility for several family members that all live in poverty with no government assistance and that he did not board the vessel to carry drugs, but rather to obtain money to support and feed himself and his family. Estupinan argues further that the district court should have adjusted his sentence based on the unwarranted sentence disparities that have resulted from some defendants receiving minor role reductions and others who have not.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>we review a district court\u2019s sentence, imposed after consulting the guidelines and considering the factors set forth at \u00a7 3553(a), for reasonableness. 543 U.S. 220, 264-65, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cUnder <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness.\u201d). In assessing the reasonableness of a sentence, the factors that a district court should consider include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential\u201d and focuses on whether the sentence imposed achieves the purposes of sentencing as stated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cFurther, a laundry list of \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not required because \u2018nothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>435 F.3d at 1353-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">We are persuaded that Estupinan\u2019s sentence was reasonable as reflected by the district court\u2019s consideration of the guideline range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s deliberations reflect consideration of: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public; and (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant. Because the imposition of Estupinan\u2019s sentence was reasoned and reflected consideration of the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a), including the advisory guideline range, we conclude that Estupinan\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Estupinan\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
