Dennis has not established that she raised a challenge to the execution of her sentence, rather than a collateral challenge to her prior habeas proceedings, and her claims are thus not properly raised under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Leal v. Tombone, </em>341 F.3d 427, 429-30 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). The judgment of the district court is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-21\">Dennis also moves for bail pending the resolution of her appeal. In light of her failure to establish a high probability of success on a constitutional claim, the motion is DENIED. <em>See Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
