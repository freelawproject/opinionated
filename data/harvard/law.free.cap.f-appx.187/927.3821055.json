He raises three grounds on appeal. First, he asserts the district court erred in imposing a 5-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the crimes involved distribution of child pornography absent pecuniary gain. Second, he contends the district court abused its discretion by upwardly departing by 8 levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0 and 5K2.8. Third, he claims his sentence is unreasonable pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm Turner\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A-XX\">A. <em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">We have held <em>pre-Booker </em>standards of review concerning the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing Guidelines still apply <em>post-Booker. United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). We review a sentencing court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">Turner\u2019s base offense level is 17, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2-entitled \u201cTrafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Receiving, Transporting, Shipping, or Advertising Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic.\u201d Under \u201cSpecific Offense Characteristics,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) provides as follows: \u201cIf the offense involved distribution, increase by the number of levels from the table in \u00a7 2F1.1 corresponding to the retail value of the material, <em>but in no event by less than 5 levels.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The table in \u00a7 2F1.1 provides for increased offense levels dependent on the loss due to fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">For purposes of \u00a7 2G2.2, \u201c \u2018[distribution\u2019 <em>includes </em>any act related to distribution for pecuniary gain, including production, transportation, and possession with intent to distribute.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment. (n.l) (emphasis added). The general application principles of the Guidelines provides: \u201cThe term \u2018includes\u2019 is not exhaustive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment, (n.2). Thus, we held the term \u201cdistribution\u201d in this respect does not require a showing of pecuniary or other benefit. <em>United States v. Probel, </em>214 F.3d 1285, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2000). Rather, we determined \u201c[t]he reference to the fraud table does not limit the application of the enhancement to individuals who receive a pecuniary benefit from the distribution of child pornography.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1290. \u201cThe threshold five-level enhancement' is appropriate\u201d where \u201c[a]ny distribution of child pornography, gratuitously or for profit, results in the continued exploitation of the victims depicted in the images.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-15\">We are bound to follow our decision in <em>Probel. United States v. Smith, </em>934 F.2d 270, 274 (11th Cir.1991) (noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>\u201ca panel of this court cannot overrule binding precedent issued by a prior panel\u201d). Turner pled guilty to three counts of distribution of child pornography, and did not dispute the facts supporting those charges, including that he posted images of the victim on the internet which he used to blackmail the victim into continuing sexual contact with him. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining no pecuniary gain was required when Turner distributed the child pornography with the intent to force the victim to return to the sexual relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">B. <em>Upward Departure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to depart from the Guidelines for an abuse of discretion, giving the district court\u2019s determination \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir.1999). A district court may depart upward from the Guidelines if it determines \u201c \u2018there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cWhether a case is unusual enough to fall outside the heartland is determined in large part by comparison with other Guidelines cases.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">The extent of a district court\u2019s departure from the Guidelines must be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1322. The reasonableness of the departure is evaluated in light of the factors to be considered in imposing the sentence and the reasons the district court provided for departing. <em>Id. </em>at 1322-23. \u201cAmong the factors a sentencing court must consider are the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Blas, 360 F.8d </em>1268, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.8, entitled \u201cExtreme Conduct,\u201d \u201c[i]f the defendant\u2019s conduct was unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the victim, the court may increase the sentence above the guideline range to reflect the nature of the conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.8. \u201cExamples of extreme conduct include torture of a victim, gratuitous infliction of injury, or prolonging of pain or humiliation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">In <em>Bias, </em>we held the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a 7-level upward departure under \u00a7 5K2.8, on the basis the defendant knowingly exposed his minor victim to HIV through sexual acts. <em>Blas, </em>360 F.3d at 1273-74. We noted \u201cBias\u2019s actions with regard to his young victim were incredibly risky and dangerous, and presented circumstances that clearly were not taken into consideration in formulating the applicable guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">In <em>United States v. Hersh, </em>297 F.3d 1233, 1251 (11th Cir.2002), we held a 10-level upward \u201cprophylactic\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> departure was not an abuse of discretion. The district court based the departure on a finding the appellant had engaged in prolonged sexual exploitation of minors, the victims (children from Third World countries) were \u201cextraordinarily vulnerable,\u201d and the appellant had a 20-year history of committing sexual abuse, which we determined was an adequate basis upon which to find the \u201calternative sentence\u201d was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 1251-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">Here, the district court based its departure upon the determination Turner\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>duct was manipulative, extreme, and heinous. Specifically, it noted the \u201ccrime of sex and violence\u201d took place over a 20-month period, Turner created a \u201catmosphere of fear\u201d in the area, he had a prior conviction for a similar crime, and he began to engage in another similar relationship after the victim in the present case reported the situation to the FBI. The court also determined Turner\u2019s actions of blackmailing the victim to continuing a sexual relationship, including videotaping the victim without his knowledge and posting the images on the internet, constituted extreme conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The facts adopted by the district court and undisputed by Turner include that he solicited sex from the victim, a minor, paid the victim to perform sexual acts and expected the victim to engage in sexual acts as payment for computer equipment. It is similarly undisputed he blackmailed the victim into continuing to engage in sexual contact, in part, by videotaping the acts without the victim\u2019s knowledge and posting them on the internet. In light of these facts, the departure did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Further, the 8-level departure is not unreasonable in light of the grounds set forth by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">C. <em>Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">In light of <em>Booker, </em>we review a final sentence under the advisory Guidelines for reasonableness. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178-79. The district court must first accurately calculate the Guideline range, and then it \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence\u201d after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>Factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guideline range, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We have clarified the district court is not obligated to specifically address and analyze on the record every \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Here, the district court correctly calculated the applicable advisory range under the Guidelines. The court then specified Turner\u2019s case was aggravated by his criminal history, the nature and seriousness of the crime, and the need to promote respect for the law, encourage deterrence, and to protect the public, before imposing a sentence at the high end of the Guidelines range of 360 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We conclude Turner\u2019s ultimate sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">The district court did not err in enhancing Turner\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) or abuse its discretion by upwardly departing 8 levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0 and 5K2.8. Further, Turner\u2019s ultimate sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-12\">. Turner was sentenced under the 1998 version of the Sentencing Guidelines.
