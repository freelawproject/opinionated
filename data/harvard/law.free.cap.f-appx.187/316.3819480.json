Because Crum fails to satisfy the four-factor balancing test established by this court in <em>Blackwelder Furniture Co. of Statesville, Inc. v. Seilig Mfg. Co., </em>550 F.2d 189 (4th Cir.1977), we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the motion for a preliminary injunction. Turning to Crum\u2019s appeal of the order consolidating his two \u00a7 2241 petitions, this court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The consolidation order Crum seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the appeal of the consolidation order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
