Worley\u2019s claim that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) required the Bureau of Prisons to award him 54 days of credit, in advance, for each year of imprisonment that the district court imposed and that he has been denied a total of 68.5 days of good-time credit is foreclosed. <em>See Moreland v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>431 F.3d 180, 186 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1906, 164 L.Ed.2d 583 (2006). Accordingly, Worley\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion for the appointment of counsel is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
