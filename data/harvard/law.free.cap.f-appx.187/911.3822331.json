On appeal, Herskowitz argues that the district court was without jurisdiction to grant the motion to dismiss because the party who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>filed it died during the pendency of the case and no formal suggestion of death was filed, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a)(1). She urges that the reference to Defendant Steven Delibert\u2019s death in a motion filed by attorney Eric Christu, who assumed the representation of Delibert upon his death, is insufficient under Rule 25, and that Christu did not have authority to file the motion since he was neither Delibert\u2019s attorney of record, nor a person authorized by Rule 25 to make such a motion. She also asserts the district court misapplied the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine to dismiss her claim. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">The parties are familiar with the factual background and we only summarize it here. Herskowitz filed this suit against Steven Delibert, Susan Charney, Karen Bezner, and a three-judge panel of Florida\u2019s Third District Court of Appeal (\u201cThird DCA Panel\u201d) alleging claims for (1) violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971); (2) declaratory and injunctive relief; (3) civil conspiracy; (4) conversion; (5) waste, embezzlement and statutory larceny; (6) civil violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(a)-(d); (7) replevin; (8) abuse of process; (9) intentional infliction of emotional and physical distress; and (10) rescission of contract. Herskowitz\u2019s claims were based on the Third DCA Panel\u2019s reversal of a state court judgment in her favor. She sought $10 million in compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The Third DCA Panel moved to dismiss Herskowitz\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Delibert subsequently filed a memorandum in support of dismissal, adopting the arguments made in the Third DCA Panel\u2019s motion to dismiss. The district court granted the motion and entered judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">We review a district court\u2019s determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Dale v. Moore, </em>121 F.3d 624, 626 (11th Cir.1997). According to the Rule 25 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when a party dies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-13\">the court may order substitution of the proper parties. The motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the successors or representatives of the deceased party and, together with the notice of hearing, shall be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and upon persons not parties in the manner provided in Rule 4 for the service of a summons, and may be served in any judicial district. Unless the motion for substitution is made not later than 90 days after the death is suggested upon the record by service of a statement of the fact of the death as provided herein for the service of the motion, the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a)(1). While Rule 25 provides for the filing of a motion for substitution of parties after the death of a proper party, we have recognized, pursuant to the plain language of Rule 12(h)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that a district court may act <em>sua sponte </em>to address</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Howard v. Lemmons, </em>547 F.2d 290, 290 n. 1 (5th Cir.1977) (stating \u201cthere is no doubt that the District Court could dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s action <em>sua sponte </em>for failure of federal jurisdiction pursuant to [Rule] 12(h)(8)\u201d);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>see also Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Norton, </em>324 F.3d 1229, 1240 (11th Cir.2003) (after determining district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over some claims due to lack of a federal agency decision, holding that court improperly entered summary judgment on those claims and that \u201cthe district court should have dismissed appellants\u2019 ... claims, <em>sua sponte </em>if necessary, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3)\u201d); <em>Save the Bay, Inc. v. U.S. Army, </em>639 F.2d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cIt is incumbent upon both trial and appellate federal courts to constantly examine basis of jurisdiction, <em>doing so on its own motion if necessary.\u201d </em>(citing Rule 12(h)(3)) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Because the district court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>may address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time, it did not err in doing so here, even though Delibert had died, there was no proper substitution of a party, and the clerk had entered default against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">We likewise reject Herskowitz\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>analysis. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine jurisdictionally bars \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005), We have enumerated four criteria that must be met in order for the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to apply: (1) the party in federal court is the same as in the state court; (2) the state court ruling was a final judgment on the merits; (3) the plaintiff in federal court had a reasonable opportunity to raise her claims in the state court proceeding; and (4) the issue before the federal court was either adjudicated by the state court or inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>Amos v. Glynn County Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>347 F.3d 1249, 1265-66 n. 11 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Because this is the type of case to which the Supreme Court, in <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>determined the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies and the <em>Amos </em>elements are satisfied, we readily conclude the district court did not err by dismissing Herskowitz\u2019s claims. We are unpersuaded by Herskowitz\u2019s remaining arguments. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-5\">. <em>See D.C.
