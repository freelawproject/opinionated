The sentencing court stated that it would impose the same 127-month sentence in its \u201cunfettered discretion.\u201d Jones asserts on appeal that his sentence was improperly increased based upon a prior conviction that was not contained in the indictment to which he pled guilty and that his sentence was improperly increased based upon drug quantities not alleged in the indictment or found by a jury. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">Jones asserts that the sentencing court violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and its progeny when it increased his sentencing range from five to forty years to ten years to life pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) based upon a prior \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d not alleged in his indictment or admitted by him. The Government filed an Information of Prior Conviction pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 stating Jones was convicted of cocaine trafficking in North Carolina in May 2000 and that the Government therefore sought the increased penalties of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Jones acknowledged the conviction at his sentencing hearing. Because Jones raised this issue in the sentencing court, review is de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">In <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 19-21, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Supreme Court held that Sixth Amendment protections apply to disputed facts <em>about </em>a prior conviction that are not evident from \u201cthe conclusive significance of a prior judicial record.\u201d Unlike the defendant in <em>Shepard, </em>Jones did not contest any facts about the prior conviction the court used to enhance his sentence. While he alleges that the court implicitly made factual findings regarding the nature of his prior conviction to conclude it was a \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d he did not contest the court\u2019s factual findings below or in his appellate brief. Thus, his is a purely legal argument that, in all cases, a court must make factual findings in determining the nature of prior convictions for sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>purposes. However, this court has rejected this argument based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and other similar precedent. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 354 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). Thus, when the facts about the prior convictions were undisputed, there is no Sixth Amendment error in utilizing the prior convictions to enhance a sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 352-53 (finding no Sixth Amendment error in armed career criminal context); <em>see also United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005) (finding that, when nature of prior conviction is undisputed, the court makes no factual findings in determining that conviction was crime of violence or controlled substance offense). For these reasons, this claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Jones next asserts he should be resentenced under <em>Blakely </em>because the district court imposed a sentence that was based on drug quantities that were neither alleged in his indictment nor admitted by him. Because the 120-month mandatory minimum sentence was appropriate, this claim implicates the additional seven months in prison Jones received above the 120-month minimum. The Government acknowledges that the district court erred in increasing Jones\u2019s sentence based upon its own factual finding. The Government continues, however, that such error was harmless because the sentencing court also stated that it would impose the same 127-month sentence in its \u201cunfettered discretion.\u201d (Sealed JA II, 90). Because this issue was raised at sentencing, this court\u2019s review is de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We agree with the Government that any Sixth Amendment error is harmless. The district court made it clear it would impose the same 127-month sentence if the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. The 127-month sentence falls within the statutory range of 120 months to life under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Therefore, the error is harmless under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) because it did not affect Jones\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Shatley, </em>448 F.3d 264, 265-67 (4th Cir.2006). For these reasons, we affirm Jones\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the factual and legal issues are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-12\">.
