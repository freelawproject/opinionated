Relying on <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>514 U.S. 927, 931, 115 S.Ct. 1914, 131 L.Ed.2d 976 (1995), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109, Harvick argued in the district court that the officers did not comply with the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule before entering the apartment where the MDMA was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-23\">On appeal, Harvick challenges only the district court\u2019s factual determination that the officers did not conduct an unannounced entry in violation of the Fourth Amendment. After reviewing the transcript of the suppression hearing, we conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that the entry did not violate the \u201cknock and announce\u201d principle. <em>See United States v. Santiago, </em>310 F.3d 336, 340 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
