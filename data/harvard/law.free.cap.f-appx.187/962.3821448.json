On appeal, Rahman challenges the denial of his motion as erroneous on numerous grounds,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and also ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>gues that, in denying the motion, the BIA violated his due process and equal protection rights. The government responds that, under <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir.1999), we lack jurisdiction to review either the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen or reconsider or Rahman\u2019s constitutional challenges. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">On April 23, 2003, Rahman was issued a notice to appear, charging him with removability under \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), for remaining in the United States for a time longer than permitted. In a motion dated September 11, 2003, Rahman moved to continue his case on the ground that he had a pending 1-140 immigrant petition. On September 25, 2003, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Rahman\u2019s motion for a continuance, finding that he failed to show good cause for the continuance, and that a continuance in the exercise of discretion was not warranted. At a hearing on October 2, 2003, Rahman admitted the allegations in the notice to appear and conceded deportability. Rahman also renewed his motion to continue, which the IJ denied. The IJ ordered Rahman removed to Bangladesh, and Rahman appealed the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance to the BIA. On April 28, 2005, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and the IJ\u2019s denial of Rahman\u2019s motion for a continuance. On September 19, 2005, Rahman filed a motion to reopen and reconsider the BIA\u2019s decision, seeking to reopen the proceedings to allow adjudication of his application for adjustment of status before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">During this period of time, the following developments relevant to Rahman\u2019s application for an adjustment of status occurred. On April 29, 2003, the Department of Labor granted an application for employment certification. An 1-140 petition for an alien worker, dated August 7, 2003, was submitted on Rahman\u2019s behalf. A notification that the 1-140 petition submitted on his behalf had been approved was issued on September 11, 2005. Rah-man applied for adjustment of status on September 19, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">The BIA denied Rahman\u2019s motion to reopen or reconsider. The BIA found that both the motion to reopen and the motion to reconsider were untimely, and that the motion to reopen did not fall within any of the enumerated exceptions to the time limitation. The BIA further found that Rah-man failed to establish exceptional circumstances which warranted its exercise of its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen or reconsider the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, and we are limited to \u201cdetermining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Motions to reconsider are also reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). In ruling on a motion to reopen or reconsider, the BIA cannot ignore its own regulations. <em>See Acosta-Montero v. I.N.S, </em>62 F.3d 1347, 1351 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Cir.1995). Rahman\u2019s claims that the BIA\u2019s actions violated his due process and equal protection rights are reviewed <em>de novo. Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">An alien may file one motion to reconsider and, generally, one motion to reopen removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(6)(A), (7)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2), (c)(2). A motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days after entry of the final administrative order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Aside from certain exceptions that are inapplicable to this case, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the entry of the final administrative order of removal. 8 U-S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2)-(3). The 90-day period for filing a motion to reopen is jurisdictional and mandatory. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, </em>1150 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Id. </em>In addition, at any time, the BIA can reopen or reconsider on its own motion a case in which it has rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Rahman argues that the BIA lacked the authority to consider his motion to reopen and should have remanded it to the IJ for consideration. We disagree. The regulations give the BIA the authority to rule on motions to reopen and reconsider, and grant the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen or reconsider a case, such as this one, in which it rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(a), (i). The BIA\u2019s finding regarding exceptional circumstances was proper because it was made by the BIA to determine whether to exercise its discretionary authority to reopen or reconsider the case. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(a). Thus, the BIA was not violating its regulations because it was not making a factual finding in the course of deciding an appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Rahman\u2019s motion was untimely. Rahman\u2019s motion was filed over four months after the BIA\u2019s April 28, 2005 decision. Because Rahman\u2019s motion to reconsider was filed well after the 30-day filing period, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Rahman\u2019s motion to reconsider was untimely. Because Rah-man\u2019s motion to reopen was filed after the 90-day period, and the 90-day requirement is jurisdictional and mandatory, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Rahman\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">While we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen or reconsider, we hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion. In <em>Anin, </em>we held that 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a) (1999), which is now codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), gave the BIA\u2019s \u201cnon-reviewable discretion\u201d to determine whether to reopen a case on its own motion. <em>Anin, </em>188 F.3d at 1279. Although we used the phrase \u201cnon-reviewable discretion\u201d when referring to our review of the BIA\u2019s exercise of its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen or reconsider, we held that the denial of Anin\u2019s motion to reopen was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>We did not reach our holding based upon a lack of jurisdiction to review the decision. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>discretion, but, under <em>Anin, </em>we find no abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">In light of the foregoing discussion, the government\u2019s reliance on <em>Anin </em>for the proposition that we lack jurisdiction to review Rahman\u2019s constitutional claims is, therefore, misplaced. We next consider the merits of Rahman\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Aliens present in the United States are entitled to due process under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). In order to prevail on due process challenges, an alien must establish that he was deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the alleged errors caused him substantial prejudice. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2003). Aliens are entitled to due process of law in deportation proceedings. <em>Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 1449, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). Due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard in removal proceedings. <em>Sebastian-Soler v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>409 F.3d 1280, 1287 n. 14 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1662, 164 L.Ed.2d 397 (2006). However, \u201caliens do not enjoy a constitutionally protected liberty interest in a purely discretionary form of relief.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1224 (11th Cir.2003). Furthermore, we have found no due process violation in the BIA\u2019s single member summary affirmance procedure. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Because the BIA\u2019s discretion to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen or reconsider is so broad that it is non-reviewable, <em>Anin, </em>188 F.3d at 1279, Rahman had no protected liberty interest in having his untimely motion granted by the BIA. Therefore, Rahman must demonstrate that he was deprived of notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>Sebastian-Soler, </em>409 F.3d at 1287 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Rahman argues that the issuance of a single member opinion violated his due process and equal protection rights. The single member summary affirmance procedure does not violate due process, <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1289, and the denial of his motion by a single member of the BIA is not relevant to whether Rahman had notice and an opportunity to be heard. Because the BIA\u2019s original decision was also issued by a single member, the motion would be disposed of by a single member unless that member determines that the motion should be referred to a three-member panel when warranted under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6). 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(i). Rahman makes no more than a conclusory assertion that disposition by a three-member panel was warranted. Because Rahman cannot show that the BIA erred in issuing a single-member order, he cannot show that the BIA\u2019s actions subjected him to an arbitrary or unreasonable classification in violation of his equal protection rights. <em>See Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cClassifications that distinguish among groups of aliens are subject to rational basis review, and will be found valid if not arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">The failure of the BIA to address why the 90-day filing period could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>tolled or why he did not meet an exception to the 90-day rule did not violate Rah-man\u2019s due process rights. It is not relevant to whether Rahman had notice and an opportunity to be heard. Furthermore, Rahman makes no argument that these failures caused him substantial prejudice, and it is unclear how he would be substantially prejudiced when he failed to raise either of these issues before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">In light of the foregoing, we deny Rah-man\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-21\">. Rahman\u2019s initial brief on appeal challenged the denial of the motion to reopen, but made no argument that the denial of reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>tion was erroneous. Issues not raised in an initial brief are abandoned. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1282 n. 12 (11th Cir.2001). Assuming, arguendo, that the issue is not abandoned, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b988-9\"><em>. </em>We have implied jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s denial of Rahman\u2019s motion to reopen under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). <em>Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 808 n. 2.
