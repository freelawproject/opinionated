After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b958-23\">On June 5, 2000, Brown, a native and citizen of Jamaica, entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain until December 4, 2000. Brown remained in the United States beyond his authorized date. On December 30, 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued a notice to appear charging Brown with overstaying his nonimmigrant visa and removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). The IJ ordered Brown\u2019s removal, and Brown does not contest this issue. Rather, Brown\u2019s appeal involves his 1-485 application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-24\">On December 18, 2000, Brown submitted an 1-485 application to adjust his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence under INA \u00a7 245 based on his marriage to a United States citizen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>On December 13, 2002, the INS denied Brown\u2019s 1-485 application for adjustment of status, pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C), because Brown\u2019s criminal record placed him in the inadmissible class of a controlled substance trafficker. Specifically, in May 1998, Brown was arrested in Georgia for cocaine trafficking when a search of his rental car uncovered a package of cocaine in the air filter compartment under the hood. The case was dismissed after the arresting officer failed to testify. In July 1998, Brown was arrested in North Carolina for possession of crack cocaine, but the charges were dismissed because the prosecutor mistakenly believed Brown was already serving a 360-month sentence in federal prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">After holding several hearings, the IJ affirmed the INS\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s application for adjustment of status. The IJ noted that some of the equities supported Brown\u2019s application, such as his presence in the United States since June 2000, his marriage to a United States citizen, one of his two children receiving lawful permanent residence status and the potential hardship of removal of his family. However, the IJ also noted concerns about Brown\u2019s two arrests, including Brown\u2019s vagueness in discussing the arrests, the way in which the arrests were dismissed, the fact that the arrests were for drug offenses, Brown\u2019s use of false names, birth dates and addresses upon arrest, Brown\u2019s use of fraudulent identification cards and Brown\u2019s failure to disclose the arrests on his adjustment application. The IJ noted \u201csignificantly that the respondent made a serious misrepresentation in the 1-485 application, wherein he failed to disclose in the adjustment application the fact that he had been arrested.\u201d The IJ observed that, given the false representation, the question arose whether Brown\u2019s application should be pretermitted based upon false representations. However, the IJ decided to hear Brown\u2019s application on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">In addition, the IJ expressed concerns about the validity of Brown\u2019s marriage, his lack of employment in the United States, the veracity of his mortgage application, his lack of financial support for his family during his marriage and his working with a false social security number and without employment authorization for a significant period of time. The IJ concluded that the negative factors outweighed the positive factors and denied Brown\u2019s application \u201cas a matter of discretion .... after considering all the testimony and documentary evidence of record....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. Brown timely filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Brown argues that the BIA and the IJ applied the wrong legal standard to determine his eligibility to adjust status under INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, by balancing the equities to decide Brown\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brown contends that the IJ improperly used standards from cancellation of remov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>al found in INA \u00a7 240A, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, which imposes a heightened burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">\u201cThe Attorney General, <em>at Ms discretion, </em>may adjust an applicant\u2019s status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if (1) the alien makes an application for adjustment of status, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible for permanent residence, and (3) a visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.\u201d <em>Nyaga v. Ashcroft, </em>323 F.3d 906, 908 (11th Cir.2003) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). The Attorney General has discretion under INA \u00a7 245 to deny the application \u201ceven where an alien satisfies the statutory requirements of eligibility for an adjustment of status----\u201d <em>Drax v. Reno, </em>338 F.3d 98, 113 (2d Cir.2003) (citing <em>INS v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25-27, 97 S.Ct. 200, 201, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976), which concluded that the INS need not make advisory findings regarding eligibility for adjustment of status where the INS exercises its discretion to deny such relief). In exercising its discretion, the INS considers both significant equities and adverse factors. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Battista, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 484, 486, 1987 WL 108950 (BIA 1987) (explaining that a preconceived intent to remain in the United States is only one factor an IJ should consider in exercising discretion on an adjustment application and noting that the IJ failed to consider \u201csignificant equities\u201d); <em>Matter of Ibrahim, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 55, 57, 1981 WL 158819 (BIA 1981) (noting that immediate relative status is \u201ca special and weighty equity\u201d in considering an application for status adjustment).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">We find no evidence in the record that the IJ applied the wrong standard of eligibility in denying Brown\u2019s application for adjustment of status. The IJ never mentioned nor cited cancellation of removal standards as set forth in INA \u00a7 240A, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, but rather decided to deny the application as \u201ca matter of discretion .... after considering all the testimony and documentary evidence....\u201d Even though adjustment of status requires an alien to satisfy statutory requirements, the INS may still deny an adjustment of status application as a matter of discretion pursuant to INA \u00a7 245. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). In balancing the equities and adverse factors of Brown\u2019s application for lawful permanent residence, the IJ was acting within its discretion as permitted by INA \u00a7 245 to determine if Brown should be granted adjustment of status. <em>See Drax, </em>338 F.3d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">Based on the foregoing, we deny Brown\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-16\">. In addition, Brown's wife filed a Petition for Alien Relative seeking a visa for Brown, which was approved on November 27, 2002. The INS's notice of approval stated that, even though the petition had been approved, that approval gave no assurance that Brown automatically would be eligible for visa issuance, admission to the United States or adjustment to lawful permanent resident status. The INS also remarked on the notice that Brown's I-485 application to adjust his status had been denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b959-6\">. To the extent Brown requests that we review the IJ's and BIA's factual and discretionary determinations denying him adjustment of status, we lack jurisdiction to review such discretionary determinations. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). However, we do have jurisdiction to review Brown\u2019s claim that, as a matter of law, the IJ applied the wrong legal standard to determine his eligibility for status adjustment. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (as amended by the REAL ID Act \u00a7 106(a)) (providing that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims or questions of law); <em>see also Chacon-Botero </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956-57 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Balogun v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1359-60 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1920, 164 L.Ed.2d 665 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b960-7\">. We do not address Brown's alternative argument that there was insufficient evidence to support the INS District Adjudication Officer\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s adjustment of status application based on a \"reason to believe\u201d that Brown is or has been an illicit trafficker or a conspirator in the illicit trafficking of any controlled substance pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C). Neither the IJ nor the BIA denied Brown\u2019s application pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C), but rather denied it on different grounds \"as a matter of discretion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
