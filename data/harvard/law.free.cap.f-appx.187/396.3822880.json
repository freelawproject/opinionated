He appeals the 240-month sentence imposed by the district court, which represents an upward departure from the guideline range of 135-68 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-18\">Salinas first argues that the facts of the case do not support an upward departure. In view of evidence in the presentence report and at the sentencing hearing that Salinas was responsible for a quantity of \u201cIce\u201d methamphetamine that was at least ten times the minimum quantity required for level 38, as well as evidence that Salinas exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization, the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing upwardly. <em>See United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 416 n. 21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 663 (2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1 comment, (n. 16), 3B1.1 comment, (n.2), 5K2.0(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-25\">Salinas challenges the extent of the departure, arguing that the 240-month sentence is unreasonable. He also contends that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable absent consideration of intervening guidelines and ranges. The sentence imposed by the district court was not an abuse of discretion because it advanced the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and was justified by the facts of the case. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). Further, because it is clear that the district court determined that a lesser sentence would not satisfy the sentencing objectives of \u00a7 3553(a), Salinas has not shown error on the part of the district court. <em>See United States v. Ashbum, </em>38 F.3d 803, 809 (5th Cir.1994)(en banc); <em>see also Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-26\">Salinas contends that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by considering facts that were not admitted by him nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Because Salinas was not subjected to a mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>sentencing regime, the district court did not err by considering facts not admitted by Salinas and not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 797-98 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Salinas also argues that the district court erred under <em>Booker </em>by considering sua sponte facts which were not contained in the presentence report nor presented at the sentencing hearing. He refers to a statement by the district court regarding the sentence received by a co-offender named Amaya. The district court\u2019s passing reference to Amaya reflects its concern with avoiding unwarranted sentence disparities, as mandated by \u00a7 3553(a)(6) and <em>Booker, </em>and was not error. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AuB\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
