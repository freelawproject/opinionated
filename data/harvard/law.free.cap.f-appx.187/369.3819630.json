Carrillo argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of cocaine as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Carrillo\u2019s argument is unavailing in light of circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Carrillo argues that this circuit\u2019s precedent is inconsistent with <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943). <em>Jerome, </em>however, preceded <em>Hinojosa-Lopez; </em>this court is bound by the precedent of previous panels absent \u201can intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling that prior precedent.\u201d <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-24\">Carrillo also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Carrillo\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Carrillo argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>jected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Carrillo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
