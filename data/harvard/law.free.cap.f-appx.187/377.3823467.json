Davis argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), effectively amended the United States Sentencing Guidelines and that his life sentence must be modified because it was enhanced based on a judicial finding of a quantity of drugs not alleged in the indictment, proved at trial, or admitted by Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\">A district court has the authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only if the Sentencing Commission has amended a pertinent guideline and has made that amendment retroactively applicable. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), (c). The district court correctly determined that a <em>Booker </em>challenge, based on a Supreme Court decision and not a retroactive guidelines amendment, is not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
