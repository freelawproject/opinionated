We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Perrino v. S. Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>209 F.3d 1309, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Here, it is undisputed that Dahlmeier failed to exhaust the administrative remedy outlined in the Group Claim Denial Review Procedure. \u201cOur law is well-settled that \u2018plaintiffs in ERISA actions must exhaust available remedies before suing in federal court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315 (quoting <em>Counts v. Amer. Gen. Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>111 F.3d 105, 108 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cHowever, a district court has the sound discretion to excuse the exhaustion requirement when resort to administrative remedies would be futile or the remedy inadequate, ... or where a claimant is denied meaningful access to the administrative review scheme in place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe decision of a district court to apply or not apply the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement for ERISA claims is a highly discretionary decision which we review only for a <em>clear </em>abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">After carefidly reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying the exhaustion requirement to Dahlmeier\u2019s claim. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-24\">. Even if we concluded that the district court misapplied the exhaustion requirement, we would still affirm the grant of summary judgment because Fortis Benefits\u2019 decision on Dahlmeier claim for benefits was reasonable and correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
