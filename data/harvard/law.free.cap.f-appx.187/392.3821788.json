[This court] cannot replace the Board or IJ\u2019s determinations concerning witness credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations with its own determinations.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). In order to prevail, Tonge must show that the evidence compels a finding contrary to the one of the IJ. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Tonge does not specifically address all of the inconsistencies cited by the IJ, and she only offers alternative reasons for them. She claims, for example, that her misstatements and her tendency to look away from the IJ during her testimony could have resulted from her lack of education. Tonge has not shown that the evidence presented compels a conclusion regarding her credibility contrary to the one reached by the IJ. Because the IJ had the benefit of observing Tonge\u2019s demeanor and behavior during her testimony, it was reasonable for him to make a credibility determination. In light of these facts, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s finding that Tonge was not a credible witness is supported by the record, and moreover, the contrary conclusion, that Tonge was credible, is not compelled by the record. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we may not reverse the IJ\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">Tonge contends that she has established her eligibility for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention against Torture. In light of the adverse credibility determination, we need not consider whether Tonge has established an entitlement to such relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
