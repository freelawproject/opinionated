The Government seeks to dismiss Sanchez-Herrera\u2019s appeal as barred by the appellate waiver provision in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-21\">Sanchez-Herrera\u2019s conviction was pursuant to a written plea agreement. In the agreement, Sanchez-Herrera waived the right to have facts that the law makes essential to the punishment either charged in the indictment, proven to a jury, or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Sanchez-Herrera also waived the right to appeal his sentence, but reserved the right to appeal a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum sentence. We assume, <em>arguendo </em>only, that the waiver does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-22\">Sanchez-Herrera cannot succeed in this appeal, however, because his constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Sanchez-Herrera contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Sanchez-Herrera properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
