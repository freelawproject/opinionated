Ulloa argues that her sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). She argues that her sentence is too severe and that it fails \u201cto account for the decreasing recidivism of older offenders.\u201d She also argues that the record does not reveal that the sentence is necessary to provide her with educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-23\">Under the discretionary sentencing scheme established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain the duty to consider the Sentencing Guidelines along with the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Ulloa\u2019s sentence is within the guidelines range and is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>sumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). We infer in our reasonableness review that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
