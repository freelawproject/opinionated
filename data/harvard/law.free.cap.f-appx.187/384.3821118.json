Ramirez contends that the BIA erred when it found him removable based on his Texas conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (UUMV). Ramirez also asserts that the BIA erred when it denied his request for a waiver of removal under former Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(c), former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-21\">This court must consider, sua sponte if necessary, whether appellate jurisdiction exists. <em>See Chunn v. Chunn (In re Chunn), </em>106 F.3d 1239, 1241 (5th Cir.1997). Ramirez admits \u201c[t]his court previously held that it did not have jurisdiction to review [his] removal order, presumably finding UUMV is an aggravated felony\u2014 crime of violence.\u201d However, he asks this court to determine whether his Texas conviction for UUMV is a crime of violence in light of <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-22\">This court\u2019s <em>gre-Leocal </em>jurisprudence was consistent with <em>LeocaVs </em>holding related to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>243 F.3d 921, 927 (5th Cir.2001). Therefore, Ramirez\u2019s petition fails to \u201cpresent\u00ed ] grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(2). Accordingly, this court would have jurisdiction over this petition only if \u201cthe remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ramirez fails to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>For these reasons, Ramirez\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
