Plaintiffs complaint included an allegation that the NJSP failed to accommodate plaintiffs physical disability. <em>As </em>to that claim, we address whether plaintiff has an affirmative obligation to prove he suffered an adverse employment action as a result of his employer\u2019s failure to accommodate his disability. Following our review of the law, we answer this question affirmatively, and because the jury was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>requested to separate the damages resulting from this claim, we are constrained to reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Plaintiff Roy Victor began his career as a New Jersey state trooper on April 10, 1986. Generally, troopers are promoted to \u201cTrooper II\u201d after seven years service in the NJSP system and to \u201cTrooper I\u201d after nine and one-half years of service. Plaintiff received each of these promotions. He was assigned to the Totowa NJSP Substation as a Trooper I. When plaintiff\u2019s causes of action accrued, Wagner was the Totowa Station Commander, Estok was the Totowa Squad Sergeant, and Dr. Izzi was NJSP\u2019s director of medical services to whom each troop division doctor reported. Seniority among troopers is determined by the trooper\u2019s badge number: lower badge numbers signify greater seniority. In his squad, plaintiff was the most senior trooper and served as the assistant squad supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">While on duty in 1995, plaintiff injured his back in a car accident. Under the stated policy guidelines, after three days on sick leave, a trooper must be examined by a division doctor and produce medical documentation supporting the claimed injury or illness. Only a division doctor could change a trooper\u2019s duty status. A trooper on off-duty status must see the same division doctor until his or her injury or illness is resolved. Complying with these procedures, plaintiff returned to full-duty status after a six-week absence. In 1996, while on duty, plaintiff suffered another accident that injured his back. He returned to full duty in April 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">On April 11, 1998, plaintiff was transferred to the Somerville NJSP Station located in Bridgewater, which was approximately thirty-five miles from his residence. He filed an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint objecting to this transfer. The record does not disclose the disposition of this complaint. In Somerville, plaintiff served as the acting squad sergeant during periods of the sergeant\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>After one month, plaintiff requested sick-leave due to stress. According to plaintiff, he experienced psychological problems, including stress and depression, related to family issues, his EEO complaint, and the transfer to Somerville. Plaintiff was placed on temporary off-duty status, the equivalent of sick leave. As plaintiff obtained treatment, his status fluctuated between limited duty and off duty, until the fall of 1999, when plaintiff returned to full-duty status as a Trooper I. After a few days, plaintiff experienced recurring back problems. Over the next two years, plaintiff was on extended leave, due to his back problems and stress. In August 2001, plaintiff reported to the Totowa Substation for full duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Initially at Totowa, plaintiff was ranked as the third man in his squad. However, due to a change in squad structure, a road sergeant was added as the third man above the most senior Trooper I. Plaintiff was moved to the fourth position and a trooper with a higher badge number was transferred to the squad as the acting road sergeant. Plaintiff questioned Wagner about his placement as the fourth man. Wagner explained plaintiff missed necessary trainings regarding compliance with new mandatory procedures while he was on medical leave. Plaintiff was told he needed to receive the training and demonstrate his competence working with the new procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Squad openings developed two months later. Plaintiff had completed the required training. Nevertheless, Estok, presumably with Wagner\u2019s assent, advanced white troopers, junior in seniority to plaintiff, who was African American, to fill these positions. Specifically, on two occasions, a more junior white trooper was transferred to fill an opening for the third man spot on plaintiffs squad and on another squad in the barracks, while plaintiff remained the fourth man on his squad. Both of these white troopers, as well as the white trooper who first replaced plaintiff as senior man, ultimately became sergeants.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Around this time, plaintiff alleged Estok, as squad sergeant, demonstrated a condescending attitude toward him and made embarrassing remarks in the squad room regarding his abilities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>For example, Estok asked plaintiff if \u201che could handle\u201d his assignment by himself and plaintiff was told by another trooper that Estok said plaintiff would never be placed in a supervisory position in his squad.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In January 2002, plaintiff suffered from stress and was placed on off duty status. The following month, plaintiff filed a second EEO complaint, alleging a hostile work environment. The complaint was dismissed as unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In April 2003, plaintiff returned to work as a Trooper I, assigned to the Bloomfield Station. As a result of his back problems, he was assigned limited duty work. On December 8, 2003, plaintiff was cleared for full-duty status and expected to perform all physical tasks required of a trooper. He was to report to work on December 11, 2003. When plaintiff reported for duty, he explained he had hurt his back between December 8 and 10, while preparing for the physical fitness test. He also stated wearing a protective vest while on road patrol exacerbated his back injury. Plaintiff sought permission from the assistant station commander, Sergeant O\u2019Rourke, to perform administrative tasks in the station. O\u2019Rourke consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The station commander determined plaintiff had been cleared for full duty and produced no medical documentation regarding the recent back injury. Thus, notwithstanding O\u2019Rourke\u2019s consent to allow plaintiff to perform administrative tasks, he ordered plaintiff to return to patrol duty. Plaintiff complied, but after four hours returned to the station and sought sick time for the remaining hours of his shift. He then requested sick leave for December 12,15 and 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">On December 17, plaintiff filed his third EEO complaint regarding this incident. The complaint was found to be unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Also, on December 17, 2003, plaintiff was examined by a division physician regarding his back and stress complaints. The doctor placed plaintiff on off-duty status. That decision was rescinded by Dr. Izzi because plaintiff did not return to the division physician <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>who last treated his condition, and he did not produce medical documentation substantiating his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">On December 19, plaintiff received a letter from Lieutenant Colonel Lori Hennon-Bell, on behalf of Colonel Fuentes, the NJSP superintendent. The letter informed plaintiff he had been placed on leave-without-pay status until he presented \u201cadequate medical information regarding the medical condition that you claim prevents you from returning to duty.\u201d That status would continue until the documentation was provided and an updated duty status determination was reviewed by Dr. Izzi. Dr. Izzi was not involved in making this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">On December 23, 2003, plaintiff submitted a letter from his psychologist, Dr. Brinkelhof, stating he suffered from an adjustment disorder, a chronic depressed mood, and stress. As a result, Dr. Izzi scheduled plaintiff for an independent psychological evaluation. The psychologist\u2019s report concluded plaintiff could not return to full-duty status. Dr. Izzi placed plaintiff on off-duty status in January 2004, and plaintiff received his back pay. Plaintiff remained on off-duty status until July 2004, when he returned to the Totowa Substation where he continues to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">In March 2005, plaintiff filed an amended four-count complaint, which included allegations that he was treated in a disparate manner from his white counterparts and was subject to a hostile work environment in violation of the LAD. Plaintiff relied on a series of events that he claimed, viewed separately or cumulatively, supported his assertions of disparate treatment, retaliation, failure to accommodate, and other torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Certain claims were dismissed prior to trial. The claims presented at trial included: Wagner and Estok acted maliciously by promoting white troopers junior in rank ahead of plaintiff and created a hostile work environment; the NJSP generally, and Dr. Izzi in particular, retaliated against plaintiff for filing EEO complaints regarding various incidents; the defendants failed to accommodate plaintiffs disability on December 11, 2003; and defendant\u2019s actions intentionally inflicted emotional distress. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>close of evidence, the court dismissed the tort claim against all defendants except Dr. Izzi and limited the hostile work environment claim to defendants Wagner, Dr. Izzi, and the NJSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The jury found Dr. Izzi, Wagner and Estok not liable. The State and the NJSP were found liable for disparate treatment in the terms and conditions of plaintiffs employment, failure to accommodate, and retaliation. The jury awarded plaintiff $65,000 in compensatory damages and no lost wages. The court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s punitive damage claim, and after a brief trial, the jury awarded plaintiff $250,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Defendants filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial, which the court denied. Thereafter, judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff and against the State and the NJSP in the amount of $65,000 in compensatory damages, $250,000 in punitive damages, $8,885 in prejudgment interest, and $46,105 in counsel fees, for a total of $278,390.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Because this appeal arises in the context of the trial court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial, we accept as true all the evidence ' supporting plaintiff\u2019s claim and accord him all legitimate inferences, <em>Zive v. Stanley Roberts, Inc., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>436, 441, 867 A.2d 1133 (2005), bearing in mind that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s \u2018action[s] should not be disturbed unless it clearly and unequivocally appears there was a manifest denial of justice under the law.\u2019\u201d <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 8, 258 A.2d 706 (1969) (quoting <em>Hartpence v. Grouleff, </em>15 <em>N.J </em>545, 549, 105 A.2d 514 (1954)). However, \u201ca trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference,\u201d but are subject to de novo review. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Defendants\u2019 challenge cites error in the proofs necessary for plaintiff to prevail on his claim, arguing that the jury charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>omitted plaintiffs obligation to prove he suffered an adverse employment action as a result of the employer\u2019s alleged failure to accommodate. This LAD violation centers on the supervisor\u2019s refusal to allow plaintiff to work inside on December 11, 2003, when he complained of a back injury and explained the body armor, required to be worn for patrol duty, exacerbated his back condition. Plaintiff maintained defendants, in this instance, failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for his physical disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">During the charge conference, defendants requested a jury charge stating that in order for plaintiff to succeed on his failure-to-accommodate claim, he had to prove he suffered an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d The trial court rejected this request, noting plaintiff</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">says he sustained psychological injury as a result of the treatment of him when he came back on December 11th and they refused to accommodate his handicap by allowing him to stay in the station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">So he\u2019s claiming that he was injured as a result of the ... failure to accommodate his handicap. So that, to me, X mean, I don\u2019t need to get into an adverse employment action. He has to prove his damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Following summations, the trial judge again reviewed the issue and concluded the law did not require plaintiff to demonstrate defendants took adverse employment action against him in order to succeed on his claim. The court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amr\">usually the failure to accommodate comes up in the context of terminations or transfers, demotions and that sort of thing. But as X explained on the record yesterday, the claim here is that he suffered psychological injury by the failure to accommodate him and the stress that was attendant with that day on December [11] and to me that was sufficient under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">In the jury instruction, the trial judge discussed plaintiffs failure-to-accommodate claim, explained the events pertaining to the claim and defined a qualifying physical disability under the statute. The jury was also told that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZB\">when an employee seeks an accommodation for a disability, the employer is required to engage in an interactive process as part of a good faith effort to identify the precise limitations resulting from a disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. A failure-to-accommodate is demonstrated when the employer fails to engage in this interactive process in good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>[W]hen a disabled employee requests an accommodation and the employer contends that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer\u2019s business, the employer has the burden of proving that the requested accommodation would constitute an undue burden on the employer\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The judge concluded stating plaintiff must prove</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5F\">he had a physical disability on December [11], 2003 when he alleges that the failure to accommodate his disability occurred. To answer this question you\u2019ll have to examine the proofs in the ease in light of the definition of disability that I just gave you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">If plaintiff fails to prove by a preponderance of the credible evidence that he had a physical disability within the meaning of the [LAD] on December [11], 2003 when he alleges that the failure to accommodate his disability occurred, you must find for defendants on plaintiffs failure-to-accommodate claim. If, however, plaintiff is able to prove that he was disabled on December [11], 2003, he still must prove by a preponderance of the believable evidence that the [NJSP] knew about plaintiffs alleged disability, that plaintiff requested an accommodation for his alleged disability, that the [NJSP] did not make a good faith effort to assist plaintiff regarding accommodations for his disability and that plaintiff could have been reasonably accommodated but for the lack of good faith on the part of the [NJSP].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">If you find that plaintiff has proven the facts required for his failure-to-accommodate claim by a preponderance of the believable evidence, then you must return a verdict for plaintiff on that claim. If, however, you find that plaintiff has failed to prove any of the facts required for his accommodation claim by a preponderance of the believable evidence, then you must return a verdict for the defendants on this claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The instruction did not include the necessity of a finding that plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">After verdict, defendants moved for a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, again raising the same argument. The trial judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">I believe that the jury charge was correct and it\u2019s consistent with New Jersey law. In my view ... if you prove failure to accommodate, that failure is in and of itself an adverse employment action. I mean the case law doesn\u2019t say that specifically but to me that\u2019s implicit in the failure-to-accommodate charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">If you don\u2019t accommodate someone, that is an adverse action to them if they can prove all the elements of failure to accommodate. And here, although the State argues today and they argued to this jury that there was no effect on Trooper Victor ... when he was told to go out on duty when he had requested to stay inside because of the back spasms he was experiencing, a jury could find that the decision of the employer not to allow him to stay in was a failure to accommodate and that failure to accommodate resulted in Trooper Victor\u2019s going on the road and in his words ... experiencing excruciating pain because he had to put on the vest with the tight winter blouse____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>On appeal, defendants argue the court erred in this determination. Defendants also assert the trial judge erred in denying their request for a directed verdict on the failure-to-accommodate claim and in allowing an award of punitive damages. Defendants seek a new trial on all of plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In his cross-appeal, plaintiff contends the court\u2019s jury instruction wrongfully limited his claim for psychological damages by requiring plaintiff to prove \u201cdefendants\u2019 wrongful conduct was a proximate cause of plaintiffs psychological injury.\u201d He too, seeks a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The LAD prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of a disability. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4.1 to -29.1; <em>Potente v. County of Hudson, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>103, 110, 900 A.2d 787 (2006). New Jersey courts have articulated the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination, identifying the following common factors: (1) plaintiff was handicapped or disabled within the meaning of the statute; (2) plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of the position of employment, with or without accommodation; (3) plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because of the handicap or disability; and (4) the employer sought another to perform the same work after plaintiff had been removed from the position. <em>Leshner v.

Aramark Servs., Inc., </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>669, 675, 760 A.2d 833 (Law Div.2000) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We are at a loss to locate a state court decision addressing whether plaintiff must prove an adverse employment action occurred as a result of a failure to accommodate a claimed disability. Likely, because an adverse employment action was self-evident in that the plaintiff had experienced an alteration of the conditions of employment prior to suit. Here, plaintiff was not passed over for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>promotion, fired, transferred, reassigned, demoted or even docked wages when he was told to resume patrol duty despite his back discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Defendants argue the absence of an adverse employment action entitles them to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiff counters asserting the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions were correct presumably, relying on the court\u2019s conclusion that a failure to accommodate itself is an adverse employment action. Plaintiff, alternatively suggests that any error in the jury instructions on this issue was \u201cnot fatal\u201d because \u201cthe jury was instructed on \u2018adverse employment action\u2019 in [plaintiff\u2019s] other causes of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">We underscore that the LAD \u201cis remedial social legislation, ... deserving of a liberal construction.\u201d <em>Clowes, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 590, 538 A.2d 794. \u201cUnderlying the LAD\u2019s expansive language advocating the elimination of discrimination is also the directive that we compensate victims for economic and noneconomic injuries attributable to an employer\u2019s discriminatory conduct.\u201d <em>Tarr v. Ciasulli, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>70, 80, 853 A.2d 921 (2004) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3). \u201cThe efficient prosecution of claims is essential to the elimination of discrimination from the workplace.\u201d <em>Montells v. Haynes, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>282, 290, 627 A.2d 654 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Finding no New Jersey authority squarely addressing the issue presented, we look to the substantive standards established under federal law for guidance, particularly the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12101 to \u00a7 12213. <em>See Bergen Commer. Bank v. Sisler, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>188, 200, 723 A.2d 944 (1999) (\u201cTo the extent the federal standards are \u2018useful and fair,\u2019 they will be applied in the interest of achieving a degree of uniformity in the discrimination laws.\u201d); <em>Grigoletti v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>89, 97, 570 A.2d 903 (1990) (in interpreting LAD, look to federal anti-discrimination eases as key source of interpretive authority); <em>Jones v. Aluminum Shapes, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 421-22, 772 A.2d 34 (App.Div.2001) (same); <em>Ensslin v. Twp. of N. Bergen, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 364, 646 A.2d 452 (App.Div.1994) (reference made to analogous provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 794, when interpreting LAD); <em>Seiden, supra, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 461, 718 A.2d 1230 (reference to federal precedent addressing handicap discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The ADA defines \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 12111(9). Further, the statute identifies acceptable employer actions that reasonably assist disabled employees, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12111(9)(b), and specifies that an employer discriminates against an individual with a disability when the employer does not make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of the individual unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Additionally, the ADA\u2019s regulations state: \u201cTo determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the [employer] with a disability to initiate an informal, interactive process with the [employee] in need of accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and the potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.\u201d 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1630.2(o)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">This court has adopted this interactive process when analyzing \u201cwhat appropriate accommodation is necessary\u201d in a specific circumstance. <em>Tynan, supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 400, 798 A.2d 648; <em>Jones, supra, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 421, 772 A.2d 34. We have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">This process must identify the potential reasonable accommodations that could be adopted to overcome the employee\u2019s precise limitations resulting from the disability. Once a handicapped employee has requested assistance, it is the employer who must make the reasonable effort to determine the appropriate accommodation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">To show that an employer failed to participate in the interactive process, a disabled employee must demonstrate: (1) the employer knew about the employee\u2019s disability; <em>(2) </em>the employee requested accommodations or assistance for her disability; (3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and (4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer\u2019s lack of good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\"><em>[Tynan, supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 400-01, 798 A.2d 648 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>In its jury instruction, the court limited the plaintiffs necessary proofs to these factors. No reference was made to the prima facie proofs needed to succeed on a discrimination claim. Therefore, by concentrating on the proofs evidencing a failure to participate in the interactive process, the trial judge suggested to the jury that plaintiff need only show the NJSP failed to engage in the process to succeed on his failure-to-accommodate claim. Perhaps this prompted the judge\u2019s post-trial motion comment: \u201cIn my view ... if you prove failure to accommodate, that failure is in and of itself an adverse employment action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We do not agree with this conclusion. Under the LAD, proof of discrimination \u201cremains with the employee at all times.\u201d <em>Zive, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 450, 867 A.2d 1133. A plaintiff first must show the \u201crather modest\u201d three elements of a prima facie discrimination case. <em>Marzano v. Computer Sci. Corp., </em>91 F.3d 497, 507 (3d Cir.1996); <em>Leshner, supra, </em>113 F.Supp.2d at 692. Failure to accommodate is not discrete from discrimination, but an act that may prove discrimination. In other words, a plaintiffs proof of the lack of the employer\u2019s engagement in an interactive process to determine the need and availability of a reasonable accommodation, supplements the requisite presentation of a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In a failure to accommodate case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must first present the prima facie elements required in any LAD disability discrimination claim, that is: (1) plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the statute; (2) plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of the position of employment; and (3) plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because of the disability. Each of these elements must be shown, including proof of some material adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment. <em>Jones v. Sch. Dist., </em>198 F.3d 403, 411 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The additional factors identified in <em>Tynan, supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 401-02, 798 A.2d 648, support the second element that the employee could perform the essential functions of employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>with reasonable accommodation. In that regard, the employee must show the employer was informed of the disability, the employee requested accommodation, the employer made no good faith effort to assist, and the accommodation could have been reasonably achieved. <em>Id. </em>at 404, 798 A.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The proofs necessary to demonstrate an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d must be examined on a case-by-case basis. An adverse employment action is easily satisfied by evidence of a failure to hire or by a firing. At the other end of the spectrum, we have held that \u201cunfavorable evaluations, unaccompanied by a demotion or similar action or a job reassignment with no corresponding reduction in wages or status is insufficient.\u201d <em>El-Sioufi v. St. Peter\u2019s Univ. Hosp., </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 170, 887 A.2d 1170 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We also look for guidance on this issue in determinations pursuant to the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8, which contains the phrase \u201cadverse employment action\u201d in its definition of \u201cretaliatory action.\u201d A \u201cretaliatory action\u201d against an employee for protected conduct under CEPA means \u201cthe discharge, suspension or demotion of an employee, or other adverse employment action taken against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2(e). CEPA, like the LAD, is \u201cremedial\u201d legislation, and \u201cwe discern no ground on which to conclude that the meaning of the prohibited adverse employment actions\u201d between the statutes \u201cis significantly different.\u201d <em>El-Sioufi, supra, </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 170 n. 8, 887 A.2d 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\u201cIn the CEPA context, ... we have held that, in order to be actionable, an allegedly retaliatory act must be \u2018sufficiently severe or pervasive to have altered plaintiffs conditions of employment in an important and material manner.\u2019\u201d <em>El-Sioufi, supra, </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 176, 887 A.2d 1170 (citing <em>Coleus v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 246, 827 A.2d 1098 (App.Div.), <em>certif denied, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>32, 834 A.2d 405 (2003)). This could include \u201ca withdrawal of benefits formerly provided to an employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ee,\u201d <em>Maimone v. City of Atl. City, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>221, 235-36, 903 A.2d 1055 (2006), but does not include actions, which \u201cresult in a bruised ego or injured pride on the part of the employee,\u201d <em>Beasley v. Passaic County, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>585, 607, 873 A.2d 673 (App. Div.2005); temporary reassignment, <em>Klein v. Univ. of Med. and Dentistry of N.J., </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. 28, </em>47, 871 A.2d 681 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>39, 878 A.2d 856 (2005); or a supervisor\u2019s decision to no longer socialize with an employee. <em>Cokus, supra, </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382-83, 827 A.2d 1173. \u201cThe case law also strongly suggests that plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress alone is not a cognizable injury within the CEPA context.\u201d <em>Hancock v. Borough of Oaklyn, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 361, 790 A.2d 186 (App.Div.2002); <em>see Kadetsky v. Egg Harbor Twp. Bd. of Educ., </em>82 F.Supp.2d 327, 340 (D.N.J.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">From this analysis, we do not suggest the adverse employment action under the LAD is the same as a retaliatory action under CEPA. We can conclude that an employer\u2019s adverse employment action must rise above something that makes an employee unhappy, resentful or otherwise cause an incidental workplace dissatisfaction. Clearly, actions that affect wages, benefits, or result in direct economic harm qualify. So too, noneconomic actions that cause a significant, non-temporary adverse change in employment status or the terms and conditions of employment would suffice. We recognize an exhaustive list of qualifying events cannot be compiled and these determinations must turn on the facts and circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">We now focus on defendants\u2019 challenge to the jury charge in this ease. A jury charge in a LAD matter requires the jury be given \u201can explanation of the applicable legal principles and how they are to be applied in light of the parties\u2019 contentions and the evidence produced in the case.\u201d <em>Carmona v. Resorts Int\u2019l Hotel, Inc., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>354, 374, 915 A.2d 518 (2007) (quoting <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>398, 431, 648 A.2d 223 (App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Div.1994) <em>aff'd, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995)). When examining claimed error with respect to a jury charge, we view the charge as a whole to determine whether it was defective. <em>Ryder v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>128 I'd 128, 137 (3d Cir.1997), <em>cert, denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>1116, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>1052, 140 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>115; <em>Vallejo by Morales v. Rahway Police Dep\u2019t, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 342, 678 A.2d 1135 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>262, 686 A.2d 763 (1996). We do not focus on individual errors in isolation. <em>Ryder, supra, </em>128 <em>F. </em>3d at 137. If the jury charge is incorrect, it \u201cconstitutes reversible error only if the jury could have come to a different result had it been correctly instructed.\u201d <em>Viscik, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 800 A.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Here, we reverse because the charge was legally insufficient as it incorrectly stated the applicable law by failing to require a finding that plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action. <em>See Velazquez ex rel. Velazquez v. Portadin, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>677, 688, 751 A.2d 102 (2000); <em>See also Vallejo by Morales, supra, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 342, 678 A.2d 1135. Our decision requires that the jury must determine whether plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action. We disagree with the trial judge that such an action is presumed by the failure to accommodate or that plaintiffs claimed psychological suffering unequivocally qualifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Additionally, we must order a new trial because of the inability to separate from the total jury award, the damages attributable to the failure to accommodate claim. Although plaintiffs claims were individually set forth, the damage award was not segregated; the verdict awarded one sum for all discriminatory actions attributed to the State and the NJSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">We conclude by repeating the trial judge\u2019s comment that the model charges are inadequate to address failure to accommodate claims and the matter should be \u201creferred to the committee on civil jury charges to develop a failure to accommodate charge\u201d for use by trial judges. We agree that such an aid would assist the trial bench when addressing these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\n<em>TV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">As to the remaining issues raised in the appeal and cross-appeal, based on our conclusion that a new trial is warranted, we decline to discuss defendants\u2019 claim that the trial judge erred by denying their motion for a directed verdict on plaintiffs failure to accommodate claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">As to defendants\u2019 challenge to the award of punitive damages, we reject the contention that \u201cpunitive damages were not awardable as a matter of law.\u201d The Supreme Court concluded in <em>Cavuoti v. New Jersey Transit Corp., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>107, 132-33, 735 A.2d 548 (1999), that a public entity may be subject to punitive damages under LAD. <em>See also Green v. Jersey City Bd. of Educ., </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>434, 444, 828 A.2d 883 (2003) (a public entity may be held liable for punitive damages in the event of actual participation by upper management or willful indifference).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Pursuant to the Punitive Damages Act (the PDA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.9 to -17, punitive damages can be awarded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">only if the plaintiff proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the harm suffered was the result of the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions, and such acts or omissions were actuated by actual malice or accompanied by a wanton and willful disregard of persons who foreseeably might be harmed by those acts or omissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.12(a)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Punitive damages are available only in \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d <em>Catalane v.

The nature of a defendant\u2019s conduct and the probability that the defendant caused the plaintiffs injuries are relevant considerations for the award. <em>Ripa v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>373, 394, 660 A.2d 521 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. 518, 665 A.2d 1111 </em>(1995). \u201c[P]unitive damages for employment discrimination are only appropriate if there is proof not only that the offending conduct is especially egregious but also proof of \u2018actual participation in or willful indifference to the wrongful conduct on the part of upper management.\u2019\u201d <em>Lockley v. Turner, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 19-20, 779 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>1092 (App.Div.2001) (quoting <em>Cavuoti, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 113, 735 A.2d 548), <em>aff'd in part, modified in part on other grounds, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>413, 828 A.2d 869 (2003). Thus, under the PDA, a plaintiff must demonstrate either a defendant displayed actual malice or acted in a willful and wanton manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\u201cActual malice\u201d is defined as \u201can intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an evil-minded act,\u201d while \u201c[w]anton and willful disregard\u201d is defined as \u201ca deliberate act or omission with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm to another and reckless indifference to the consequences of such act or omission.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Keeping these principles in mind, in the event a similar situation is presented on retrial of this matter, we briefly comment on the trial judge\u2019s inclusion of Dr. Izzi among the proposed NJSP upper management employees for the purpose of finding actionable conduct warranting an award of punitive damages. Dr. Izzi was exonerated at trial of any actions or omissions found to have aided or abetted the acts of discrimination or to have resulted in the intentional infliction of emotional distress. Thus, we conclude it is incongruous to include him as one who actually participated in or was willfully indifferent to the wrongful conduct on the part of upper management for the purpose of punitive damages. <em>Lockley, supra, </em>344 <em>N.
