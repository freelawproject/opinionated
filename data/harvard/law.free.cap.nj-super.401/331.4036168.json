During the week of August 7, 2005, Investigator Scott Moeller, a Dover Township police officer assigned to the Ocean County Narcotics Strike Force (OCNSF), was contacted by a reliable confidential informant whose assistance \u201cled to the arrest of seven individuals for CDS violations and the seizure of quantities of PCP and marijuana.\u201d The informant told Investigator Moeller that Anthony Gioe of Toms River was \u201cplanning to purchase a large quantity of marijuana from his source of supply in Monmouth County and would be returning to the Ocean County area to distribute same.\u201d The informant described the vehicle defendant would be using as a red Oldsmobile Ciera, and also stated \u201can individual known to him/her only as Frank, a [white male] being approximately 19 years old, 5'9\" tall, weighing 170 pounds with short, dark hair, would be receiving a quantity of this marijuana from Gioe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Based on this information, Moeller and other members of the OCNSF initiated surveillance of defendant\u2019s residence. At approximately 8:00 p.m. on August 11, 2005, Moeller observed defendant exit his residence and drive off in a red Oldsmobile Ciera, which Moeller determined from the Division of Motor Vehicles was registered to Anthony Gioe. Defendant drove to a location in Toms River, where he picked up an individual carrying a white plastic bag, who matched the informant\u2019s description of \u201cFrank,\u201d and then drove back to his residence. Both defendant and Frank entered defendant\u2019s house with the white plastic bag. \u201cMinutes later,\u201d the two exited defendant\u2019s residence and defendant placed the white plastic bag in the trunk of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Moeller followed the vehicle to a residential area in Tinton Falls, and, approximately one-half hour later, observed defendant\u2019s vehicle leaving the area and traveling southbound on the Garden State Parkway. Moeller contacted the Dover Township Police Department (DTPD) and requested a motor vehicle stop, which occurred at approximately 11:05 p.m. Defendant and Frank Caruso, who Moeller knew \u201cthrough prior police contact\u201d as a distributor of controlled dangerous substances (CDS) in the Toms River area, were removed from the vehicle and patted down. During the pat-down of Caruso, police found a \u201cmetal folding knife\u201d in his right front pocket, and he was placed under arrest for unlawful possession of a knife. A search incident to arrest yielded an undisclosed amount of marijuana and $1515 on Caruso\u2019s person. Additionally, a \u201csniff\u2019 test performed by a K-9 detection unit was positive for the presence of CDS in the trunk area of defendant\u2019s ear. Defendant and Caruso were then transported to DTPD headquarters, and defendant\u2019s vehicle was impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">At approximately 1:00 a.m. on August 12, 2005, Moeller completed his affidavit in support of a request for a warrant to search defendant\u2019s vehicle \u201calong with any and all occupants and containers therein, for marijuana and other controlled dangerous substances.\u201d Moeller\u2019s affidavit was \u201creviewed and approved\u201d by an assistant prosecutor at 1:00 a.m. on August 12, 2005, and in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>written memorandum to his supervisor, dated January 24, 2006, Moeller described the proceedings to obtain the search warrant as follows:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">On August 12, 2005, this writer contacted the [municipal court judge or issuing judge] at [ ]his home telephone facility number. This writer informed [the municipal court judge] that this winter was seeking a[c]ourt authorized search warrant for NJ Reg. SFJ-G1H, a 1995 Oldsmobile [Ciera], color red, YIN# 1G3AJ55M5S6310042. At this time the [municipal court judge] instructed this writer to fax the warrant, along with all pages of the [affidavit to his residence. At this time this writer was provided with the fax number for the [municipal court judge] <em>and [was] sworn in over the phone. </em>The [issuing judge] then contacted this writer at OCNSF Headquarters stating that the warrant was approved and provided a signed copy of the warrant and [a]ffidavit to this writer via fax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">[(Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Upon receipt of the signed warrant, issued at 1:40 a.m. on August 12, 2005, the defendant\u2019s vehicle was searched and the police seized approximately thirteen pounds of marijuana, wrapped in thirteen separate plastic bags, from the trunk of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">At the motion to suppress, which was non-testimonial by agreement of the parties, defendant did not challenge the adequacy of the evidence to establish probable cause. Instead, his attorney argued the warrant was defective because it failed to satisfy the requirements of <em>Rule </em>3:5\u20143(a), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">An applicant for a search warrant shall appear personally before the judge, who must take the applicant\u2019s affidavit or testimony before issuing the warrant. The judge may also examine, under oath, any witness the applicant produces, and may require that any person upon whose information the applicant relies appear personally and be examined under oath concerning such information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends, as he did below, that the warrant authorizing the search of defendant\u2019s car is invalid for two reasons: (1) the warrant was issued \u201con an unsworn statement,\u201d and (2) Investigator Moeller did \u201cnot personally appear before the issuing [j]udge.\u201d On the other hand, the State contends \u201cthat a reasoned analysis of the case law and the policy behind the [e]xclusionary [r]ule, leads to the conclusion that <em>R. </em>3:5-7(g) controls and that the Law Division correctly denied the suppression motion.\u201d <em>Rule </em>3:5\u20147(g) provides as follows: \u201cEffect of Irregularity in Warrant. In the absence of bad faith, no search or seizure made with a search warrant shall be deemed unlawful because of technical insufficiencies or irregularities in the warrant or in the papers or <em>proceedings to obtain it, </em>or in its execution.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The Law Division judge\u2019s reasons for denying defendant\u2019s suppression motion included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">[W]hile we have some fine-tuning as to who said what to whom, and when it was sworn, it\u2019s really not in dispute factually. What happened here is that rather than Investigator Moeller taking his affidavit ... to [the municipal court judge] to have him review it ... he called and contacted [the municipal court judge] and said that ... he needed to get a search warrant____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">And [the municipal court judge] ... swore him in and then said, \u201cFax me the affidavit.\u201d He faxed [the affidavit] over, he faxed him the search warrant, and [the municipal court judge] reviewed it and he signed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">Let\u2019s go back. Let\u2019s keep our eye on the ball____To keep our citizens and people safe from unreasonable searches and seizures____no warrant shall issue except upon probable cause sworn before a magistrate or other judge, judicial officer, authorized to issue that warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">I find that there was probable cause and I find that there was a lawful warrant____[T]he constitutional rights of Mr. Gioe____were protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-12\">There is no constitutional violation here. If there is a deviation from the standard normal practice, that deviation is highly technical, and it does not, in fact, impair the validity and the substance of the affidavit and the search warrant. The evidence will not be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>I. <em>The \u201cOath or affirmation\u201d Requirement of the Fourth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We begin our review with an examination of the constitutional principles implicated in this case. The exclusionary rule, adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 <em>U.S. </em>383, 34 <em>S.Ct. </em>341, 58 <em>L.Ed. </em>652 (1914) and extended to the states in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 <em>U.S. </em>643, 655, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 1090 (1961), requires the suppression of evidence obtained during searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution. \u201cThe overarching purpose of the [exclusionary] rule is to deter the police from engaging in constitutional violations by denying the prosecution any profit from illicitly-obtained evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14, 926 A.2d 340 (2007); <em>see also Elkins v. United States, </em>364 <em>U.S. </em>206, 217, 80 <em>S.Ct. </em>1437, 1444, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669, 1677 (1960) (\u201cThe rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way\u2014by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u201d). \u201cSuppressing evidence sends the strongest possible message that constitutional misconduct will not be tolerated and therefore is intended to encourage fidelity to the law.\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 14, 926 A.2d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Nevertheless, the exclusionary rule is not applied indiscriminately.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">Suppression of evidence ... has always been our last resort, not our first impulse. The exclusionary rule generates substantial social costs, which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large. We have therefore been cautious against expanding it, and have repeatedly emphasized that the rule\u2019s costly toll upon truth-seeking and law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those urging its application. We have rejected indiscriminate application of the rule, and have held it to be applicable only where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served \u2014 that is, where its deterrence benefits outweigh its substantial social costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\"><em>[Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>586, 591, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2159, 2163, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>56, 64 (2006) (citations and quotations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Similarly, in refusing to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant that described the location to be searched but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>misidentified the address, the New Jersey Supreme Court noted: \u201cWhen the truth is suppressed and the criminal is set free, the pain of suppression is felt, not by the inanimate State or by some penitent policeman, but by the offender\u2019s next victims for whose protection we hold office.\u201d <em>State v. Bisaccia, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>586, 590, 279 <em>A.2d </em>675 (1971). Likewise, in <em>State v. McCann, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 544, 554-55, 919 A.2d 136 (2007), we held suppression was not the appropriate remedy even though the municipal court judge that issued the search warrant should have recused himself due to his \u201clong-standing attorney-client relationship\u201d with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \u201cno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation.\u201d <em>See also N.J. Const, </em>art. I, \u00b6 7 (\u201c[N]o warrant shall issue except upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation....\u201d). \u201cAlthough it has sometimes been contended that noncompliance with the oath or affirmation requirement is a mere technical irregularity that does not require suppression of the evidence obtained pursuant to the mistakenly issued search warrant, this is not the case.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment </em>\u00a7 4.3(e) at 520-21 (4th ed.2004). We therefore agree with defendant to the extent he contends a search warrant issued in the absence of an oath or affirmation is invalid and requires suppression of evidence obtained pursuant thereto. See <em>State v. Moriarty, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>502, 503, 189 A.2d 210 (1963) (\u201cIt is regrettable that a warrant which would have been justified by the known facts must fall, but the failure to comply with the [oath or affirmation] requirement of the Constitutions permits no other result.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u201c[T]he oath or affirmation ... constitutes a strong reminder that [the affiant] has a special obligation to testify truthfully and that he is subject to punishment should he fabricate.\u201d <em>State v. Caraballo, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>545, 555, 750 A.2d 177 (App.Div. 2000). It is well settled, however, that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit a judge from placing an affiant who is not physically present under oath. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Turner, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>558 F.2d 46, 50 (2d Cir.1977) (\u201cWe cannot accept [defendant\u2019s] argument that for constitutional purposes an oath or affirmation is invalid merely because it is taken over the telephone.\u201d); <em>R. </em>3:5-3(b) (\u201cA Superior Court judge may issue a search warrant upon sworn oral testimony of an applicant who is not physically present.\u201d); LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.3(e) at 519 n. 58 (\u201c[A]n \u2018Oath or affirmation\u2019 for Fourth Amendment purposes does not require a face-to-face confrontation between the magistrate and the affiant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Here, defendant contends the warrant did not issue on sworn testimony because Moeller\u2019s affidavit was unsigned when he faxed it to the issuing judge. However, the affidavit, which is signed by both Moeller and the issuing judge states: \u201cINV. SCOTT MOELLER, of full age, being duly sworn on his oath according to law, deposes and says:----\u201d In addition, the issuing judge\u2019s signature on the affidavit confirms that the affiant\u2014Inv. Scott Moeller \u2014 was \u201cSworn and subscribed\u201d on \u201cthis 12th day of AUGUST 2005.\u201d Based on our review of Moeller\u2019s affidavit, the search warrant that was issued, and Moeller\u2019s subsequent memorandum describing the proceedings to obtain the warrant, we are satisfied the record amply supports the Law Division judge\u2019s determination that Moeller\u2019s affidavit was made with the knowledge that he was under oath and attesting to his statement under penalty of law. Absent evidence to the contrary, where an affidavit \u201ccontains the signature of the affiant and shows on its face that it was sworn to, [there] is sufficient evidence of the swearing.\u201d LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.3(e) at 521 (footnote omitted). <em>See also Turner, supra, </em>558 F.2d at 50 (\u201cAn \u2018Oath or affirmation\u2019 is a formal assertion of, or attestation to, the truth of <em>what has been, or is to be, said.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)). Thus, the Law Division judge correctly concluded that the search warrant was supported by oath or affirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">II. <em>The \u201cShall Appear Personally\u201d Requirement of R. 3:5-3(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Having determined defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated, we next examine whether Investigator Moeller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>failure to personally appear before the issuing judge, in violation of <em>Rule </em>3:5-3(a), requires suppression of the marijuana seized from defendant\u2019s vehicle. As a noted commentator has observed: \u201c[A] completed affidavit ... sent to the judge without a personal appearance by the affiant before the judge is not sufficient to satisfy <em>Rule </em>3:5-3. Whether such deficiency would require the suppression of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant issued without the personal appearance by the affiant is an open question.\u201d 31 Leonard N. Arnold, New Jersey Practice Series: Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3.5, at 124 (2008). In our view, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The purpose of requiring an affiant to \u201cappear personally\u201d before the issuing judge stems from our Court\u2019s recognition that \u201c[testimony in the judge\u2019s presence safeguards the individual\u2019s rights under Fourth Amendment and the State Constitution. The presence of the applicant, along with the testimony or affidavits of any witnesses, leads to a more thorough and deliberate examination of the factual basis for issuing the warrant.\u201d <em>State v. Valencia, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>126, 135, 459 A.2d 1149 (1983). Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n the absence of bad faith, no search or seizure made with a search warrant shall be deemed unlawful because of technical insufficiencies or irregularities in the warrant or in the papers or proceedings to obtain it.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:5-7(g). In analyzing whether a procedural defect constitutes a \u201ctechnical\u201d insufficiency or irregularity, we find <em>Rule </em>41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure instructive. <em>See </em>Max Mehler, <em>Summary And Analysis of New Rule 3:2A Governing Search Warrants, </em>86 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>429, 429 (August 8, 1963) (noting that <em>Rule </em>3:2A, the predecessor to <em>Rule </em>3:5-3, was \u201cpatterned after <em>Rule </em>41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\"><em>Rule </em>41 sets out the federal requirements for the issuance and execution of a search warrant. Under the federal rules, if a \u201cfundamental\u201d violation of <em>Rule </em>41 occurs, then suppression of the evidence seized with the defective search warrant is required. <em>United States v. Vasser, </em>648 F.2d 507, 510 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>denied, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>928, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1385, 67 L.Ed.2d 360 (1981). A violation is only \u201cfundamental,\u201d if it \u201cinvolves a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>641 F.2d 652, 656 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Where the violation is \u201cnon-fundamental\u201d (i.e., non-constitutional), the <em>Johnson </em>court held suppression of evidence would only be required if: \u201c(1) there was \u2018prejudice\u2019 in the sense that the search might not have occurred or would not have been so abrasive if <em>[Rule </em>41] had been followed, or (2) there is evidence of intentional and deliberate disregard of <em>[Rule </em>41].\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Vasser, supra, </em>648 F.2d at 510; <em>United States v. Radlick, </em>581 F.2d 225, 228 (9th Cir.1978)). Thus, in <em>Johnson </em>the Ninth Circuit held that although there were \u201cno less than four technical violations of the ... search warrant procedure,\u201d including an officer not being sworn in until after he submitted his affidavit, suppression of the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant was not required, because \u201cthe spirit of <em>Rule </em>41[was] met with full compliance.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Applying the two-pronged test enunciated in <em>Johnson </em>to the present matter, the marijuana found in defendant\u2019s car should not be suppressed. The first prong of the <em>Johnson </em>test is satisfied because the search of the trunk of defendant\u2019s car would have occurred had the procedural requirements of <em>Rule </em>3:5-3(a) been explicitly followed. Namely, if Investigator Moeller personally appeared before the issuing judge, the same affidavit would have been produced, based upon the same evidence establishing probable cause, and the search warrant would undoubtedly have been issued exactly as it was via facsimile.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Secondly, as conceded by the defendant, there is no evidence of bad faith or deliberate disregard of <em>Rule </em>3:5-8(a) by Moeller. To the contrary, Moeller sought a warrant when, at least arguably, a warrant was not necessary to search defendant\u2019s impounded automobile. <em>See State v. Dickey, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>468, 483-84, 706 A.2d 180 (1998) (\u201cAn inventory search is the search of property lawfully seized and detained, in order to ensure that it is harmless, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>secure valuable items (such as might be kept in a towed car), and to protect against false claims of loss or damage.\u201d); <em>State v. Sugar, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>214, 238, 495 A.2d 90 (1985) (describing the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule). Thus, applying the two-pronged <em>Johnson </em>test, suppression of the marijuana is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In sum, while we do not condone the procedures utilized by the issuing judge and express no opinion as to whether, in different circumstances, the failure of an affiant to personally appear will require suppression of evidence, we are persuaded that neither the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution nor the provisions of Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution mandate suppression of the evidence seized from defendant\u2019s automobile. Obviously, there were procedural irregularities in the proceedings to obtain the search warrant that issued, but the record clearly supports the Law Division\u2019s determination that Investigator Moeller\u2019s affidavit established sufficient probable cause to justify the issuance of the search warrant. It is equally clear the requirements of <em>Rule </em>3:5-3(a) were not intentionally or deliberately disregarded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, Investigator Moeller merely carried out the instructions he received from the issuing judge. Consequently, \u201c[w]e see no threat to Fourth Amendment values,\u201d and we find no legitimate reason to invalidate the warrant. <em>Bisaccia, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 593, 279 A.2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-13\"> We note defendant\u2019s reservation of his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress was unnecessary. <em>See R. </em>3:5-7(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\"> Although <em>State v. Fariello, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>552, 562, 366 A.2d 1313 (1976), stands for the proposition that an affiant cannot \u201crectify any deficiency in his testimony before the issuing judge by post-search repair,\u201d Investigator Moeller's memorandum dated January 24, 2006, did not supplement the record with ex post evidence supporting probable cause, but rather clarified the procedures he followed in applying for the search warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> We recognize our Court has rejected the \"good-faith exception\" to the exclusionary rule. <em>See State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 157-58, 519 A.2d 820 (1987). In this case, under both the Federal and State Constitutions, probable cause was clearly established, and our conclusion that the exclusionary rule does not apply is not premised on any exception thereto. We note the absence of bad faith on Investigator Moeller's part solely in accordance with our Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Rule </em>3:5 \u2014 7(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
