On appeal, Pitts argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on his career-offender status because his offense level, calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, actually was utilized to sentence him, because it was greater than his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender provision. He further contends that, because the district court departed downward for his substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b), his offense level, after applying Amendment 706, would be reduced to 29, and his sentencing range would be lowered to 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any such reduction must be consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements, which similarly provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that a sentencing reduction is not permitted where the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">The district court in this ease erroneously concluded that Pitts was not eligible for a sentencing reduction because he was a career offender. Although Pitts was a career offender, his applicable guideline range was determined by his base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, because his otherwise applicable offense level of 39 was greater than the offense level prescribed by \u00a7 4B1.1. Nonetheless, the district court ultimately reached the correct conclusion that Pitts was ineligible for a sentencing reduction because although Amendment 706 would reduce his total offense level from 39 to 37, it would not affect his sentencing range. An offense level of 37, coupled with a criminal history category of VI, would give Pitts an amended guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment, the same applicable guideline range upon which his original sentence was based. The downward departures that Pitts received, under \u00a7 5K1.1 and Rule 35(b), do not affect this analysis. <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (stating that \u201cthe benefit accruing from a lower sentence range under an amended guideline is <em>independent </em>of any prior substantial-assistance downward departure ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
