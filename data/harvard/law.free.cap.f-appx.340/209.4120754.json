Morales lost 54 days of good conduct time, in addition to other penalties. Morales contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the decision of the DHO.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Morales has not shown that the district court erred by determining that there was \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record to support the DHO\u2019s disciplinary decision where that decision was based on the counselor\u2019s written report stating that Morales blocked her exit from the office, exposed himself to her in a state of arousal, and refused her orders to leave the office. <em>See Hudson v. Johnson, </em>242 F.3d 534, 536-37 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AiE\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
