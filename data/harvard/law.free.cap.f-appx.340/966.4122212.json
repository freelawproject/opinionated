Kotadiya argues that his attorney was ineffective for arguing only the suppression issue and failing to request withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Kotadiya did not raise his claim of ineffective counsel before the BIA. Therefore the issue is unexhausted, and this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 317-19 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). In addition, Kotadiya has abandoned any argument concerning his suppression claim by failing to brief the issue. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AMv\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
