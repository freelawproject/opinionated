Suarez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to certain crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, Suarez argues that he was eligible for a sentence reduction because even though he was sentenced a career offender, the controlling precedent, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied - </em>U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), was wrongly decided. Specifically, he maintains that <em>Moore </em>is wrong because, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny, the guidelines are not mandatory, and the district court has the discretion to consider that the Sentencing Commission has now retroactively lowered by two levels the crack offense guidelines. Suarez also contends that the district court possesses the discretion after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in conjunction with <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), to give him the benefit of the retroactive amendments to the crack offense guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amended the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. However, if a defendant is a career offender, his base offense level is determined under the career offender guideline in \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) and not the drug quantity guideline in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28. Defendants who are sentenced under the career offender guideline are not sentenced under \u00a7 2D1.1, and therefore Amendment 706 has no effect on their applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, we have deemed <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kim-brough </em>inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). We are bound to follow our prior binding precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this [Cjourt <em>en bane </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied </em>(No. 08-8655) (U.S. May 18, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Because Suarez was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, the crack cocaine base offense level played no ultimate role in his sentence, and therefore, the district court correctly determined that he was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">.
