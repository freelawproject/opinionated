Ashcraft, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habe-as petition. We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of whether, in light of <em>Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788 (11th Cir.2005), the district court erred by finding that, because Ashcraft failed to establish prejudice, counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On this narrow issue, we find that the district court clearly erred in so holding and remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Ashcraft in fact requested that his counsel file a notice of appeal on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">A district court\u2019s grant or denial of a habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2254 is reviewed <em>de novo. McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAn ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a mixed question of law and fact subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our review of a state habeas court\u2019s decision is limited by the terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as amended by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1218 (1996). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 402-03, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We may grant habeas as to legal questions decided on the merits by the state habeas court only where the court\u2019s decision \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1). The Supreme Court has explained the requirements in \u00a7 2254(d)(1) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">Under the \u201ccontrary to\u201d clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. Under the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3i\"><em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. CONST, amend. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>VI; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 685-86, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Ashcraft must demonstrate (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d and (2) that he suffered prejudice as a result of that deficient performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A \u201clawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.\u201d <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). This Court has interpreted <em>Flores-Ortega </em>to mean that it is <em>per se </em>unreasonable to fail to follow a client\u2019s explicit request to file an appeal. <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>433 F.3d at 791-92. Even if a client has not made a specific request of his attorney to file an appeal, \u201ccounsel has a constitutionally-imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant would want to appeal ..., or (2) that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.\u201d <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 480, 120 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The denial of counsel on appeal, and more seriously, the denial of an appeal altogether as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, deprives the accused of counsel at a \u201ccritical stage\u201d and therefore carries a presumption of prejudice. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 483, 120 S.Ct. 1029. However, \u201ccounsel\u2019s deficient performance must actually cause the forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029. Thus, to invoke the presumption of prejudice, \u201ca defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would have timely appealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient performance deprives a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken, the defendant has made out a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal.\u201d <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029. Most importantly in this case, a <em>pro se </em>defendant is not required to show that his appeal has any arguably meritorious grounds for appeal; all that is required is for the \u201cdefendant to demonstrate that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient conduct, he would have appealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 120 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Rather than determine as a factual matter whether counsel\u2019s conduct deprived Ashcraft of his appeal, the state habeas court held that \u201ceven assuming counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal on behalf of [Ashcraft], [Ashcraft] has failed to establish prejudice to his case [under Strickland.]\u201d The district court agreed, holding that Ashcraft had failed to establish prejudice because there was no \u201cmeritorious issue to raise on direct appeal\u201d and \u201cany omitted claim would not have had a reasonable probability of success before the appellate court.\u201d As explained, this analysis by the state habeas court was contrary to clearly established federal law under Flores-Ortega,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the district court erred in affirming the state habeas court and in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the content of the communications between Ash-craft and his counsel regarding a possible appeal and whether Ashcraft would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>timely appealed but for his counsel\u2019s deficient performance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the district court determines after an evidentiary hearing that Ashcraft would have timely appealed but for his counsel\u2019s performance, counsel\u2019s conduct would be <em>per se </em>unreasonable, and therefore Ashcraft would be entitled to pursue an out-of-time appeal. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\">. Because it is outside the scope of the COA, we will not consider the government's argument, made for the first time on appeal, that Ashcraft's ineffective assistance of counsel claim is procedurally defaulted for failure to exhaust the claim on direct appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. 2253(c)(3); <em>Murray v. U.S., </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998). The government argues that, although Ashcraft did file a belated appeal under Fla.R.App.P. 9.141(c), the Florida circuit and appellate courts dismissed his appeal on state procedural grounds for failure to comply with various court orders. At the district court, however, the government conceded that Ashcraft had exhausted his state remedies. In its brief to this court, the government asserts that it made a \u201csubstantial error\u201d in so conceding. On remand, the district court may consider the government\u2019s argument (and any response by Ashcraft) regarding exhaustion, including whether the government has waived the argument by its initial concession in the district court that Ashcraft had exhausted his state remedies. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(3); <em>Kelley v. Secretary, Dept. of Corrections, </em>377 F.3d 1317, 1351 n. 33 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-5\">. Because the merits of his appeal are not to be considered for purposes of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it irrelevant that Ashcraft waived his right to appeal by entering a guilty plea. <em>See Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AvW\">. Ashcraft presented the facts surrounding his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness to the state habeas court, which erroneously rejected his claim on prejudice grounds without further eviden-tiary development. Therefore, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2), which limits the district court\u2019s discretion to hold an evidentiary hearing in cases in which the petitioner has failed to develop the factual basis of his claim in state court, does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
