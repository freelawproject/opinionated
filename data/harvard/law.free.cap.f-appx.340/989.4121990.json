He argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and specifically asserts that, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the guideline provision applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326, is flawed in that it is not supported by \u201cempirical data and national experience\u201d and allows previous convictions to be \u201cdouble counted\u201d in the calculation of guidelines ranges. Peralta further asserts that the sentence fails to adequately account for his circumstances and motives and that the Sentencing Guidelines produce unwarranted sentencing disparities because of the random availability of \u201cfast track\u201d programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">We have consistently rejected Peralta\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument, concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not question the presumption of reasonableness and does not require district or appellate courts to independently analyze the empirical grounding behind each individual guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099). Furthermore, we have also rejected the argument that using a prior conviction to increase the offense level and in calculating criminal history is impermissible \u201cdouble counting.\u201d <em>See United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001). Peralta has not rebutted the presumption that the district court sentenced him to a reasonable, properly calculated within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Peralta\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in not considering the circumstances and motives surrounding his offense is equally unavailing. A review of the record reveals that the district court considered Peralta\u2019s argument that his circumstances justified a sentence below the guidelines range but ultimately implicitly rejected this argument by imposing the minimum guidelines sentence. Moreover, when reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines l\u2019ange, we will infer that the district court \u201cconsidered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">As Peralta concedes, the argument that his guidelines range was excessive because it resulted in an unwarranted disparity between defendants to whom the \u201cfast track\u201d program is available and those to whom it is not available is foreclosed by current circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Accordingly, this court need not consider it further. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1011-21\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
