When Wheat was originally sentenced, he was classified as a career offender. On appeal in this case, Wheat argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine the appropriate sentence to impose and did not address whether the sentence was greater than necessary. Further, he asserts that the district court failed to consider his post-conviction rehabilitation, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1368. If the district court sentences the defendant as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and the sentencing range is not affected by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, then the sentence is not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)). When the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D 1.1 play no role in the calculation of the career offender range for the defendant, even though Amendment 706 is retroactive, the district court is not authorized to reduce the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to reduce Wheat\u2019s sentence because it sentenced Wheat as a career offender, and therefore his guideline range was not changed by Amendment 706. Wheat\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider the sentencing factors or his post-sentencing rehabilitation incorrectly assumes that the district court had jurisdiction to reduce his sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Wheat\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
