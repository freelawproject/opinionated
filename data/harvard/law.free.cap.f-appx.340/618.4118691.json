Harden Mfg. Corp., </em>291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is appropriate only when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, presents no genuine issue of any material fact and compels judgment as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In assessing whether there is any genuine issue of fact, we must avoid weighing conflicting evidence or making credibility determinations. <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.1999). Instead, \u201cwe view the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Allmond v. Akal Sec., Inc., </em>558 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Calvo, the facts are these: Calvo worked at Walgreens from 2001 until 2006. In July 2002, she was promoted to assistant manager. A year later, a genetic heart condition caused Calvo to lose consciousness while she was driving. She was severely injured in the resulting crash. Cal-vo needed multiple surgeries on her arms, both of which were fractured in the accident. Although her right arm has partially recovered, her left arm and hand are non-functional and are permanently in a brace.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">During her slow recovery, Calvo took leaves of absence from Walgreens. After returning to work six months after the accident, she was out again from July 2004 until October 2004, from February 2005 until April 2005, and finally from October 2005 until her termination in early 2006. During those absences Calvo had additional surgeries on her arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In January 2006, Calvo wanted to return to work and met with Marie LeCuyer, a regional manager at Walgreens. LeCuyer requested medical documentation that released Calvo to return to work, but the only doctor\u2019s note that Calvo could provide, dated December 16, 2005, did not release Calvo to work. The doctor had written, \u201cWill re-evaluate before i-elease.\u201d LeCuyer therefore asked for further information about Calvo\u2019s medical condition and her job. Eventually Calvo produced a second doctor\u2019s note, dated January 31, 2006, which stated that she could return to work February 6. However, the doctor had not checked the box authorizing return \u201cTo regular occupation,\u201d but instead checked the other box, authorizing return \u201cTo any other occupation.\u201d The note added that \u201cNo lifting, carrying [,] pushing or pulling anything over 5 lbs\u201d was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">After providing that doctor\u2019s note, Calvo expected to return to work but LeCuyer refused to allow it. Calvo met with her local manager, Mario Hernandez, who passed along LeCuyer\u2019s decision by stating that \u201cYou cannot work at Walgreens for your limitations.\u201d Calvo believed that she had been terminated and immediately sought unemployment benefits. Wal-greens asserts that she was simply not yet cleared for work and so remained on medical leave. According to Walgreens, Calvo was terminated later, in June 2006, once her disability benefits had expired and she had not returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">In May 2007, after exhausting administrative remedies, Calvo filed a complaint against Walgreens. She asserted that Walgreens had discriminated against her on the basis of her disability, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), and had retaliated against her by harassing her and refusing to accommodate her by not allowing her to return to work, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Walgreens on both of Calvo\u2019s claims. This is her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Calvo first contends that Walgreens discriminated against her on the basis of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>disability by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation to allow her to perform her duties as an assistant manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">To establish an ADA violation a plaintiff may use circumstantial evidence according to the traditional Title VII burden-shifting analysis. <em>Wascura v. City of South Miami, </em>257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir.2001); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under this burden-shifting analysis, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case. Then the burden shifts to the employer to state a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. If the employer provides a legitimate reason, the burden returns to the plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s reason is a pretext for intentional discrimination. <em>Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must show that: \u201c(1) she has a disability; (2) she is a qualified individual; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability.\u201d <em>Morisky v. Broward County, </em>80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">First, Calvo must show that she has a disability. <em>Id. </em>One way to demonstrate disability is to establish that the plaintiff has \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A) (2008). Major life activities include \u201ccaring for oneself [and] performing manual tasks,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i). The EEOC regulations provide that a \u201csubstantial limitation\u201d occurs when a plaintiff is \u201c[significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which ... [she] can perform [manual tasks or caring for herself] as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(l)(ii). The regulations also instruct us to take into account \u201c(i) The nature and severity of the impairment; (ii) The duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (iii) The permanent or long term impact from the impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1630.2(j)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Despite Walgreens\u2019 vigorous arguments to the contrary, Calvo has demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether she is disabled under the ADA. Since her car accident in 2003, her left arm and hand have been largely useless and are worn in a permanent brace. Calvo\u2019s doctor describes this condition as \u201cunable to use L upper extremity.\u201d Evidently this condition is permanent; as of 2008 her doctor states that there is nothing more he can do. Calvo\u2019s right arm, which was also badly broken in the accident, has required several surgeries including the insertion and removal of metal pins. Calvo has provided an affidavit stating that she is unable to dress or undress herself without help, and she also testified that she is unable to shower and wash herself without help. As for other manual tasks, Calvo\u2019s doctors state that she is unable to push, pull, or lift anything heavier than five pounds, and that she also cannot reach above shoulder level, bend, or stoop.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">Our cases that reject claims of substantial limitation in the major life activities of manual tasks and caring for oneself involve milder conditions than Calvo\u2019s. In <em>Hilburn v. Murata Elec. NA, </em>181 F.3d 1220, 1228 (11th Cir.1999), we held that a plaintiff with coronary heart disease was not substantially limited in the major life activity of manual tasks because she admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that she was able to bathe, dress herself, work around the house, cook, and work. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Chanda v. Engelhard, </em>234 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.2000), we held that a plaintiff with tendonitis was not substantially limited in the major life activity of manual tasks because he was able to \u201cassist his spouse with household activities, to dress and feed himself, and to drive an automobile,\u201d in addition to operating a computer and taking handwritten notes in his classes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Calvo\u2019s case is more analogous to those in which the plaintiff has lost an entire arm or hand (and possibly is even more severe than those, in light of her weakened right arm and the fact that her useless but painful left arm remains attached). <em>See Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., </em>283 F.3d 11, 24 (1st Cir.2002) (holding that a plaintiff born without one hand could make it past summary judgment on the disability question); <em>Fenney v. Dakota, Minnesota &amp; Eastern R. Co., </em>327 F.3d 707, 716 (8th Cir.2003) (holding that a locomotive engineer who had lost his thumb and finger and injured his arm could make it past summary judgment on the disability question based on his limited ability to take care of himself). For purposes of surviving summary judgment, Calvo has shown that she is disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Second, Calvo must show that she is a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d <em>Morisky, </em>80 F.3d at 447. The ADA defines \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d as an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that the individual held. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Accordingly, if Calvo is unable to perform an essential function of her job, even with an accommodation, she is, by definition, not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d covered under the ADA. <em>Davis v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., </em>205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The key issue here is whether lifting and carrying items heavier than five pounds is an \u201cessential function\u201d of the job of an assistant manager at Walgreens. If so, according to her doctor Calvo cannot perform that essential function, even with accommodation, and thus is not a qualified individual. If not, or if a genuine issue of material fact exists about it, then Calvo is a qualified individual for summary judgment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) states that \u201cconsideration shall be given to the employer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and [a pre-written job description] ... shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.\u201d However, the EEOC regulations also provide many other factors that merit consideration, including \u201c[t]he amount of time spent on the job performing the function ...; [t]he consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function ... [t]he work experience of past incumbents in the job.\u201d 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(n)(3). In sum, whether a particular function is \u201cessential\u201d to a job is considered on a case-by-ease basis, <em>Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2007), and although an employer\u2019s view is accorded weight, it cannot be conclusive. <em>Id. </em>at 1258 (observing that allowing an employer free reign to decide what an \u201cessential function\u201d is would allow employers to subvert the congressional mandate of the ADA by redefining at will disabled individuals as unqualified ones).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Walgreens staunchly maintains that lifting, pushing, and pulling items heavier than five pounds is an \u201cessential function\u201d of the assistant manager\u2019s job. Walgreens points to its job description for the assistant manager position, which includes: \u201cReceives, stocks, and prices merchandise; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>maintains stock files and reports.\u201d Wal-greens also cites the deposition testimony of Calvo\u2019s local manager Mario Hernandez, who stated that carrying items was a regular part of the assistant manager\u2019s job. Finally, Walgreens cites Calvo\u2019s own deposition, in which she acknowledged that her position included \u201cthings like cleaning the restrooms and mopping the floors, unloading trucks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">But there is also evidence that lifting and carrying was not an essential function of Calvo\u2019s job. The job description cited by Walgreens contains a list of 23 functions, only one of which clearly involves moving items heavier than five pounds. Most of the rest involve record keeping and customer service. Moreover, in citing to Hernandez\u2019s testimony that carrying things is important to the assistant manager\u2019s job, Walgreens ignores his comments, made just a few moments earlier in the deposition, that after Calvo\u2019s accident in 2003 she \u201ccouldn\u2019t really carry anything that you needed to use two arms with, but she was working f\u00edne.\u201d Hernandez added twice more that Calvo\u2019s performance at her job was \u201cf\u00edne\u201d and commented that other employees would help her carry items, and no one ever complained about it. Although Calvo testified that sometimes after her accident she had engaged in light lifting and carrying at the store, her left arm has been in a brace or cast since 2003. If lifting and carrying were such an essential function of her job, it is surprising that Calvo\u2019s manager believed that she was able to perform the job \u201cfine\u201d for a period of four years (with intermittent medical leaves for surgeries). Finally, according to Calvo, regional manager LeCuyer had ordered assistant managers working the afternoon shift, as Calvo did, to refrain from restocking and focus entirely on customer service.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Calvo, there is enough evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact about whether lifting, carrying, and pushing more than five pounds at a time is an \u201cessential function\u201d of an assistant manager at Wal-greens. <em>Cf. Holly, </em>492 F.3d at 1261 (a genuine issue of material fact as to whether punctuality was essential to Holly\u2019s job meant that it was \u201cerror for the district court to have taken this issue away from the fact-finder and awarded summary judgment to [the employer].\u201d). Therefore, Calvo makes it to the third prong of her prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">At the third prong, Calvo must show that \u201cshe was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability.\u201d <em>Morisky, </em>80 F.3d at 447. It is unlawful discrimination for an employer to fail to provide a reasonable accommodation for a qualified disabled individual. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A); <em>D\u2019Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., </em>422 F.3d 1220, 1225-26 (11th Cir.2005). Reasonable accommodations may include \u201cjob restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, ... and other similar accommodations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(9)(B). \u201c[T]he ADA may require an employer to restructure a particular job by altering or eliminating some of its marginal functions.\u201d <em>Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1260 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Calvo asserts that Walgreens failed to reasonably accommodate her when it refused to allow her to return to work. Wal-greens responds that her requested accommodations are unreasonable because lifting and carrying are essential functions of the job, and because \u201cemployers are not required to transform [a] position ... by eliminating functions that are essential to the nature of the job as it exists.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>257 F.3d at 1260. Thus, Walgreens\u2019 argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ment that any accommodation suited to Calvo would be unreasonable hinges on its assertion that lifting and carrying are essential elements of that job. Because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to that question, the same issue exists with regard to the reasonable accommodation prong. Accordingly, Calvo\u2019s prima facie case of disability discrimination survives summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action. <em>See EEOC v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). Wal-greens asserts that it refused to allow Calvo to return to work because she failed to produce a doctor\u2019s note that cleared her to do so. Generally a doctor\u2019s refusal to release a person to return to work is a legitimate reason for an employer to prevent that person from returning to work. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4) (an employer may ask for medical documentation that is \u201cshown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d and \u201cmay make inquiries into the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions\u201d); <em>Collado v. United Parcel Serv., Co., </em>419 F.3d 1143, 1159 (11th Cir.2005) (citing with approval UPS\u2019 requirement that its diabetic drivers complete a medical program before being allowed to drive trucks); <em>Kincaid v. City of Omaha, </em>378 F.3d 799, 804-05 (8th Cir.2004) (stating that the city\u2019s requirement that a doctor provide a release prior to an injured person\u2019s returning to work was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to allow a non-released person to work); <em>Revels v. Lucent Tech., Inc., </em>60 Fed.Appx. 740, 745-46 (10th Cir.2003) (unpublished) (\u201cThe goal of the release requirement \u2014 to ensure that returning to work does not hamper recovery- \u2014 -is rational and legitimate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">After the employer presents a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action, \u201cthe plaintiff must introduce significantly probative evidence that the asserted reason is merely a pretext for discrimination\u201d in order to avoid summary judgment. <em>Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n of Jefferson County, </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and alteration omitted). A plaintiff may show pretext by pointing to \u201cweaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions\u201d in the employer\u2019s proffered reason, <em>id. </em>at 1163, or by producing other evidence \u201cwhich permits the jury to reasonably disbelieve the employer\u2019s proffered reason.\u201d <em>Steger v. General Elec. Co., </em>318 F.3d 1066, 1079 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cAny believable evidence which demonstrates a genuine issue of fact regarding the truth of the employer\u2019s explanation may sustain the employee\u2019s burden of proof\u201d on this point. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Calvo argues that the note she provided to LeCuyer in February 2006 did allow her to return to work. She concedes that the doctor\u2019s note dated January 31 left unchecked the box next to the statement \u201cTo regular occupation,\u201d and instead checked the box next to the statement \u201cTo any other occupation.\u201d The note also says that the doctor expects \u201cpossible MMI [maximum medical improvement] in the next 6-8 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Calvo focuses, however, on the rest of the note and on the surrounding circumstances. She points out that the doctor also checked \u201cyes\u201d under \u201cHave you advised patient to return to work,\u201d and the note adds that \u201cPatient can work a total of 8 hours per day.\u201d The doctor rated Calvo as able to sit, stand, and walk for 8 hours continuously. The doctor then described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Calvo\u2019s condition as \u201cunable to use L upper extremity,\u201d and accordingly restricted her from \u201clifting, carrying, pushing or pulling anything over 5 lbs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Calvo interprets that note as allowing her to return to work. She argues that Walgreens\u2019 refusal to accept it amounts to the company seeking a formalistic way to justify getting rid of her. Calvo notes that she had worked her job at Walgreens for several years already after her left arm became immobilized and largely useless. Thus, the only reason that the doctor gave for her restrictions \u2014 that she was unable to use her upper left extremity \u2014 was nothing new. She reiterates that the doctor listed her return-to-work date as February 6, 2006, and that Walgreens should have allowed her to return then.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Additionally, Calvo explains that before February 2006 Walgreens had allowed her to return to work despite doctors\u2019 notes that were less enthusiastic than her January 2006 note. In April 2005, Calvo returned to work although a doctor\u2019s note dated April 15 stated that the doctor did not advise her returning to work, described her condition as \u201csevere injury to both arms/hands\u201d and wrote \u201cunknown\u201d after \u201cDo you expect improvement in any area.\u201d A follow-up note dated May 4 provided that Calvo could return to work, but added \u201clight duty has restriction with B upper extremities,\u201d and \u201cunable to use L upper extremity.\u201d That description of Calvo\u2019s condition is substantially similar to the one given by the January 2006 note, yet Walgreens allowed to her to work in April and May 2005, but not in January 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Calvo has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to Walgreens\u2019 asserted reason for refusing to accommodate her. At this stage of the proceedings, Calvo has demonstrated that Walgreens\u2019 reason may prove weak and implausible. After all, it hinges on one check mark missing from a box on a two-page form that includes several specific handwritten statements that seem to fully set out the doctor\u2019s views about the scope of Calvo\u2019s abilities. A jury could interpret the overall note as meaning that the doctor had released Calvo to any job in which her specific restrictions about lifting and carrying were observed. Viewing the doctor\u2019s note and her work history in the light most favorable to Calvo, she has produced evidence which could permit a jury to disbelieve Walgreens\u2019 stated reason for refusing to allow her to work. <em>See Steger, </em>318 F.3d at 1079. Thus, a genuine issue of material fact exists on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Accordingly, the district court erred when it granted summary judgment against Calvo\u2019s claim of disability discrimination under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">Calvo also makes retaliation claims. The law provides that \u201c[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge ... under [the ADA].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">First, Calvo asserts that Walgreens\u2019 failure to accommodate her upon her request amounted to retaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a). That assertion misunderstands the statute. As we observed in <em>Stewart v. Happy Herman\u2019s Cheshire Bridge, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 1278, 1288 (11th Cir.1997), discrimination on the basis of disability is different from retaliation on the basis of opposing unlawful practices or filing a charge against the employer. In Stewart, we refused to address the plaintiffs \u201cretaliation\u201d claims that were based on simple refusals to accommodate her. We stated that \u201c[i]n our view, the acts Stewart describes relate directly to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 discrimination claim, not her retaliation claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288. <em>See also Lucas, </em>257 F.3d at 1261 (rejecting a retaliation claim based on a failure to reasonably accommodate because it \u201cmerely reclothes Lucas\u2019 ADA discrimination claim\u201d). In other words, the gist of Calvo\u2019s <em>discrimination </em>claim is that Wal-greens refused to accommodate her because of her disability. Walgreens did not refuse to accommodate Calvo because she requested accommodation. <em>Cf. CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1951, 1964, 170 L.Ed.2d 864 (2008) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (observing that discrimination is based on status, while retaliation is based on action).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Calvo makes one retaliation claim that merits further analysis. She asserts that LeCuyer harassed her by asking her for medical documentation in January 2006. Calvo argued that LeCuyer had never personally requested medical documents before and that her earlier doctors\u2019 notes, which had been accepted, were simply faxed to Walgreens\u2019 insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">But even assuming, as the district court did, that Calvo can make a prima facie case of retaliation, she has provided no evidence that Walgreens\u2019 proffered reason for LeCuyer\u2019s action is pretextual. Wal-greens explains that LeCuyer asked Calvo for medical documentation as a routine matter, to ensure that she was cleared by a doctor to return to work. This is a perfectly acceptable explanation. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4); <em>Collado, </em>419 F.3d at 1159; <em>Kincaid, </em>378 F.3d at 804-05. Walgreens adds that during Calvo\u2019s earlier leaves of absence, her individual store managers had been able to cover for her. However, during her last absence, from November until February 2006, her assigned store had requested a replacement for Calvo, which meant that LeCuyer needed to re-assign Calvo upon her return. For that reason, LeCuyer became involved in Calvo\u2019s situation and personally requested her doctor\u2019s note. Calvo has presented no evidence that this explanation is pretex-tual.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Walgreens on Calvo\u2019s retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
