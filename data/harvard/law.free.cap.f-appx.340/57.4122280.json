Hartford-Empire Co., </em>322 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Third Circuit LAR 27.4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Wells was sentenced on September 3, 1986 to life imprisonment for murder and five to ten years imprisonment for possession of an instrument of crime and conspiracy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> More than twenty years later, after several unsuccessful attempts to challenge this conviction, Wells filed his <em>Hazel-Atlas </em>motion, and a supplement thereto, in the District Court. Wells argued that the District Court should \u201cnullify his conviction and sentence that was procured via \u2018intentional fraud upon the Court\u2019 via [the state prosecutor]\u201d. <em>Hazel-Atlas </em>motion at 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court was persuaded by several federal court opinions that it lacked authority to review the issue of fraud on a state court under <em>Hazel-Atlas. </em>The Court also held that even if it were to reach the merits of Wells\u2019 motion, it would find that he had \u201cfailed to satisfy the rigorous standard established for independent actions alleging fraud upon the court.\u201d Dist. Ct. Op. at 9. Wells filed a \u201cPetition for Permission to Appeal,\u201d which was construed as a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">On appeal, Wells argues that the District Court\u2019s holding that it could not grant equitable relief under <em>Hazel-Atlas </em>in a matter arising from a state criminal trial is inconsistent with the rights he is guaranteed under the Sixth and Fourteenth amendments. However, Wells does not recognize that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction which possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute. Ko<em>kkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). Federal courts are to presume that a cause lies outside of their jurisdiction, and it is the burden of the party asserting jurisdiction to prove otherwise. <em>Id. </em>Although the Supreme Court has held in <em>Hazel-Atlas </em>and <em>Chambers </em>that a federal court has the <em>inherent </em>power to vacate <em>its own </em>judgments when they have been procured by fraud, those cases were both civil cases. Wells has not pointed to any authority holding that a federal court has <em>inherent </em>power to overturn a state criminal conviction on the basis of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">In fact, we recently held that a federal court does not have inherent power to vacate a <em>federal </em>criminal conviction procured by fraud. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>549 F.3d 905, 917 (3d Cir.2008). We found there was an \u201cabsence of authority suggesting a longstanding inherent power of a district court to vacate a criminal sentence based on fraud\u201d and that any such inherent power was abrogated by Congress pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a), which provide limited circumstances in which a district court may correct a federal criminal sentence. <em>Washington, </em>549 F.3d at 914, 916-17. We are similarly unaware of any power that a federal court has to overturn a <em>state </em>criminal conviction obtained by fraud, outside of power authorized by statute; <em>i.e. </em>through a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-18\">. The Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe inherent power [of a federal court] allows [it] to vacate its own judgment upon proof that a fraud has been perpetrated upon the court.\" <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 44, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (citing <em>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., </em>322 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944)). Thus, a motion alleging fraud on the court is sometimes called a <em>\"Hazel-Atlas\" </em>motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-27\">. The District Court Order and Memorandum Opinion also denied three other motions, two of which the Court found were moot, and one of which the Court found it lacked jurisdiction to address, as the matter addressed in that motion was related to another of Wells' cases that was pending in this Court on appeal. Wells has not contested the denial of these three motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-5\">. The parties are already familiar with the facts of this case. Therefore, we limit our discussion to those facts essential to our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\">. Wells argued that the Assistant District Attorney who prosecuted him did not disclose that a key witness had an immunity agreement with the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b80-11\"><em>.Cf. Gonzalez v. Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1284-85 (11th Cir.2004) (Rule 60(b) relief will not be granted to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>open final judgment denying federal habeas relief where alleged fraud was perpetrated on state court rather than federal court). A movant's allegation that fraud on the state court violated his federal constitutional rights is simply a new federal constitutional claim subject to the successive petition rules of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
