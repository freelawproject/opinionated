The assault injured Gross, and he received medical treatment. Based on that assault and medical treatment, Gross brought 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Florida and some jail officials. He alleged cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and denial of due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also brought a Florida state law medical negligence claim. The district court dismissed Gross\u2019 second amended complaint, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Gross raises two contentions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, he contends that the district court erred by dismissing his claims against the State of Florida, Sheriff Bob White, some unnamed deputy sheriffs, Captain Head, Nurse Carr, Dr. McKay, Lieutenant Hoolan, and Dr. Tracy McKay. Second, he contends that the court failed to give him the required notice that it was converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment by considering materials outside of his second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The district court dismissed Gross\u2019 claims against the State of Florida as barred by sovereign immunity. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling regarding Eleventh Amendment immunity.\u201d <em>Williams v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Edison Cmty. Coll., </em>421 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2005) (alteration and quotation marks omitted). Congress did not abrogate a state\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity for \u00a7 1983 lawsuits seeking damages. <em>See Zatler v. Wainwright, </em>802 F.2d 397, 400</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">(11th Cir.1986). Because Florida has not waived its sovereign immunity, Gross\u2019 claims are barred. <em>Id. </em>(stating that \u201cFlorida\u2019s limited waiver of sovereign immunity was not intended to encompass section 1983 suits for damages\u201d). Gross\u2019 claims against the State of Florida were properly dismissed based on sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The district court dismissed Gross\u2019 claims against Sheriff White and some unnamed deputy sheriffs for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. A district court is required to dismiss a complaint that \u201cfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; or ... [that] seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). We review those decisions <em>de novo, </em>taking the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Boxer X v. Hams, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997) (applying Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) standards to review a judgment dismissing a complaint under \u00a7 1915A).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">We begin with Gross\u2019 claim that Sheriff White in his supervisory capacity violated Gross\u2019 constitutional rights. \u201cSupervisory officials cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for the unconstitutional ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tions of their subordinates based on re-spondeat superior liability.\u201d <em>Gray ex rel. Alexander v. Bostic, </em>458 F.3d 1295, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe standard by which a supervisor is held liable in his individual capacity for the actions of a subordinate is extremely rigorous.\u201d <em>Gottone v. Jenne, </em>326 F.3d 1352,1360 (llth Cir.2003) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). A claim based on supervisory liability must allege that the supervisor: (1) instituted a custom or policy which resulted in a violation of the plaintiffs constitutional rights; (2)directed his subordinates to act unlawfully; or (3) failed to stop his subordinates from acting unlawfully when he knew they would. <em>See Goebert v. Lee County, </em>510 F.3d 1312, 1331 (11th Cir.2007). Gross alleged just the opposite. He stated that the jail\u2019s rules and regulations required \u201cRed Dot,\u201d violence-prone inmates to be separated from the general inmate population. He asserted that unnamed deputies broke those rules by placing him in a cell with a Red Dot inmate who was known to escape from his restraints and to be violent. Gross did not allege that White directed anyone to break the rules or that White knew anyone would do so. Gross\u2019 allegations fail to meet the \u201cextremely rigorous standard\u201d for supervisory liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>Cottone, </em>326 F.3d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Gross further alleged that Sheriff White was grossly negligent and deliberately indifferent because he did not properly train and supervise his subordinates, and that allegation also fails to state a claim. \u201c[Sjupervisors can be held personally liable when either (1) the supervisor personally participates in the alleged constitutional violation, or (2) there is a causal connection between the actions of the supervisor and the alleged constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Gross did not assert that White personally violated his constitutional rights or caused the alleged violation to occur. He did not allege that there was any custom or policy of holding violence-prone, Red Dot inmates in jail cells with other inmates. He merely alleges that the deputies \u201cknew about\u201d rules and regulations requiring these inmates to be kept separate from the general population and that they \u201cignored them\u201d by placing him in' a cell with a Red Dot inmate who later attacked him. An allegation about an isolated occurrence is not enough to state a claim for deliberate indifference against White. <em>See West v. Tillman, </em>496 F.3d 1321, 1329 (llth Cir.2007) (\u201cThe deprivations that constitute widespread abuse sufficient to notify the supervising official must be obvious, flagrant, rampant and of continued duration, rather than isolated occurrences.\u201d). Furthermore, allegations of jail officials\u2019 generalized awareness that someone is \u201ca \u2018problem inmate\u2019 with a well-documented history of prison disobedience and [is] prone to violence\u201d is not enough to show their subjective awareness that the inmate poses a substantial risk of serious harm to his cellmate. <em>Carter v. Galloway, </em>352 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The district court correctly found that Gross had failed to state a \u00a7 1983 claim against White. Because the court properly dismissed all of Gross\u2019 federal claims against White, it did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims against him. <em>See Leib v. Hillsborough County Pub. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>558 F.3d 1301, 1305 n. 2 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cBecause we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Leib\u2019s federal claims, we also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision not to retain jurisdiction over the state law claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"pADf\">The district court found that Gross failed to state a claim that unnamed depu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ties violated his constitutional rights by failing to protect him from a fellow inmate. That claim requires allegations that the deputies were \u201caware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\u201d existed and that they actually drew such an inference. <em>Purcell v. Toombs County, </em>400 F.3d 1313, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cTo be deliberately indifferent a prison official must know of and disregard an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). \u201cWhen enforcing the duty to provide reasonable safety to inmates, such a standard requires due regard for prison officials\u2019 unenviable task of keeping dangerous men in safe custody under humane conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1319 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Gross\u2019 second amended complaint alleged that unnamed deputy sheriffs placed him in \u201cthe \u2018zone of danger\u2019 \u201d with a Red Dot inmate, \u201cwho was known to be \u2018violent\u2019 and able to \u2018escape\u2019 out of restraints.\u201d Gross asserted that the deputies \u201chad knowledge and/or access to knowledge\u201d of that inmate\u2019s tendency to be violent toward staff and fellow prisoners, but they ignored it.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Gross does not allege, however, that he alerted deputies to a threat soon enough to prevent the attack. Instead, he alleges that he called out for help after he was attacked, and when court officers arrived to subdue his attacker, Gross had already been hit several times.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gross\u2019 conclusory allegations about the deputies\u2019 \u201cknowledge and/or access to knowledge\u201d about the danger potentially posed by the inmate who attacked him do not state a claim for deliberate indifference. <em>See Carter, </em>352 F.3d at 1350 (holding that jail officials\u2019 generalized awareness that an inmate was a violence-prone troublemaker was not enough to show they were subjectively aware that he posed a substantial risk of serious harm to the plaintiff). Even if it would have been safer to confine Gross to a separate cell, that is not enough to show deliberate indifference. <em>See Brown v. Hughes, </em>894 F.2d 1533, 1537 (11th Cir.1990) (stating that \u201c[mjerely negligent failure to protect an inmate from attack does not justify liability under section 1983\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The district court dismissed Gross\u2019 state law medical negligence claim against Dr. McKay because Gross did not comply with pre-suit notice and investigation requirements under Florida law. Before a plaintiff files a medical negligence claim against a physician in Florida, he \u201cmust mail to the prospective defendants a notice of intent to initiate litigation and a medical expert affidavit.\u201d <em>Michael v. Med. Staffing Network, Inc., </em>947 So.2d 614, 618 (Fla.3d DCA 2007) (citing Fla. Stat. \u00a7 766.203(2)). Gross does not allege that he mailed those documents. He does not even allege that he has obtained a medical expert affidavit. Therefore, he has not met the procedural requirements necessary to pursue a medical negligence claim under Florida law. <em>Cf. Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir.2008) (applying a similar Georgia law and stating that the prisoner plaintiff \u201cstands in the same shoes as anyone else in Georgia filing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>professional malpractice claim and is subject to no stricter rules than the rest of Georgia\u2019s residents\u201d). Gross\u2019 medical negligence claim against McKay was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The district court dismissed Gross\u2019 claims that Captain Head, Nurse Carr, Dr. McKay, and Lieutenant Hoolan violated his Eighth Amendment rights by being deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs.'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It also dismissed Gross\u2019 retaliation claim against McKay, which asserted that McKay had ordered Gross confined to isolation in retaliation for his filing administrative grievance forms. Finally, the court dismissed Gross\u2019 claim that unnamed deputies subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment during that isolated confinement. We review those decisions <em>de novo. See Mitchell, </em>112 F.3d at 1490.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">We first consider the documents that the district court relied on to reach those decisions because Gross asserts that the court impermissibly considered documents outside of his second amended complaint. The district court relied on \u201cthe documents Plaintiff submitted to the Court with his original civil rights complaint, and with his Reply to Second Amended Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law to the Second Amended Civil Rights Complaint.\u201d Those documents included some grievance forms that were filed with Gross\u2019 opposition to McKay\u2019s motion to dismiss. Some additional grievance forms, a \u201cPre-Trial Brief,\u201d and a \u201cTime Line\u201d were filed with Gross\u2019 original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">The district court correctly stated that in ruling on a motion to dismiss, it may consider not only the complaint but also the exhibits attached to it. <em>See Grossman v. Nationsbank, N.A., </em>225 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cWhen considering a motion to dismiss, all facts set forth in the plaintiffs complaint are to be accepted as true and the court limits its consideration to the pleadings and exhibits attached thereto.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Brooks v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[T]he analysis of a 12(b)(6) motion is limited primarily to the face of the complaint and attachments thereto.\u201d). Furthermore, \u201c[w]here there is a conflict between allegations in a pleading and exhibits thereto, it is well settled that the exhibits control.\u201d <em>Tucker v. National Linen Service Corp., </em>200 F.2d 858, 864 (5th Cir.1953).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Even documents submitted by a defendant with a motion to dismiss, rather than by the plaintiff with the complaint, may be considered by the court if \u201cthe plaintiff refers to [those] documents in the complaint and those documents are central to the plaintiffs claim.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>116 F.3d at 1369. Here, the only documents consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ered by the district court were ones submitted by the plaintiff, Gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Gross filed some grievance forms with his opposition to the motion to dismiss and titled them: \u201cPlaintiffs Exhibits for Second Amended Civil Rights Complaint and Memorandum of Law.\u201d Gross\u2019 second amended complaint specifically referred those grievance forms, which were central to his claims. <em>Brooks, </em>116 F.3d at 1369. Even though the documents were not physically attached to the second amended complaint, they were incorporated by reference into it, and the district court did not err in considering them. <em>See Day v. Taylor, </em>400 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[A] document need not be physically attached to a pleading to be incorporated by reference into it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The district court also relied on documents that Gross filed with his original complaint. Gross contends that the court should not have considered those documents in ruling on the motion to dismiss. Before he filed his second amended complaint, the court ordered Gross to \u201csubmit a second amended complaint identifying the defendants and the claims asserted against them in <em>one </em>document.\u201d R:55 at 5. The court instructed Gross that it would consider only the claims that Gi-oss raised in the second amended complaint. <em>See id. </em>at 6 (\u201cPlaintiff is cautioned that the second amended complaint <em>completely supersedes </em>the original and amended complaints. Once a complaint is amended, the only issues before the Court are the ones raised in the <em>text </em>of the amended document.\u201d). The court\u2019s instruction to Gross simply emphasizes the rule that \u201can amended complaint supersedes the original complaint.\u201d <em>Fritz v. Standard Sec. Life Ins. Co., </em>676 F.2d 1356, 1358 (11th Cir.1982). That means that specific claims made against particular defendants in the original complaint are not preserved unless they are also set forth in the amended complaint. <em>See Dussouy v. Gulf Coast Inv. Corp., </em>660 F.2d 594, 601 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201c[T]he amended complaint continues to state a claim based on tortious interference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The district court did not indicate, however, that the documents Gross had filed with his original complaint would not be considered as part of Gross\u2019 alleged factual basis for his claims. Gross did not assert that those documents should not be considered or that the facts contained in them had changed or were incorrect. A district court ruling on a motion to dismiss is not required to disregard documents that the plaintiff himself filed with his original complaint. <em>See Grossman, </em>225 F.3d at 1231 (stating that a court may consider \u201cthe pleadings and exhibits attached thereto\u201d when ruling on a motion to dismiss). Therefore, we conclude that the district coui\u2019t did not consider any materials \u201coutside\u201d of the pleadings when ruling on the motion to dismiss Gross\u2019 claims for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, retaliation, and cruel and unusual punishment while in isolated confinement. We now turn to the merits of each of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Gross contends that Captain Head, Nurse Carr, Dr. McKay, and Lieutenant Hoolan violated his Eighth Amendment rights by being deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs after Gross was assaulted by a fellow inmate. Gross admits, however, that a nurse was called to treat him. He asserts that the nurse simply gave him a band-aid and some paper towels to wipe the blood off of his head. Gross also acknowledges that x-rays were taken four days after the assault. He was told by the jail\u2019s medical staff that the \u201c \u2018x-rays indicated nothing wrong and no mecli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>cal treatment would be given.\u2019 \u201d R:56 at 8D. He alleges that he filed grievance forms requesting medical attention, but his requests were denied or ignored. He admits, however, that his condition after the assault was evaluated by nurses and by Dr. McKay, and he was given medication for his injuries. He also admits that his request for a second medical opinion was granted, and he was seen by an outside doctor who concluded that \u201cnothing was wrong\u201d \"with Gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u201cTo prove a deliberate indifference claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) a serious medical need; (2) the defendants\u2019 deliberate indifference to that need; and (3) causation between that indifference and the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>540 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir.2008). One \u201cmeasure of whether a medical need is serious enough to satisfy the first element of a deliberate indifference claim is if the need is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1310-11 (quotation marks omitted). Here, Gross was diagnosed by the jail physician and an outside physician as not needing treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Furthermore, although Gross may feel that he received inadequate medical treatment, particularly in light of Dr. McKay\u2019s decision to discontinue Gross\u2019 heart medications, that is not enough to state a claim for deliberate indifference. \u201cMedical treatment violates the [E]ighth [A]mendment only when it is so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as .to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Harris v. Thigpen, </em>941 F.2d 1495, 1505 (11th Cir.1991) (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] a simple difference in medical opinion between the prison\u2019s medical staff and the inmate as to the latter\u2019s diagnosis or course of treatment\u201d is not enough to show deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. Gross admits that his medication was discontinued to determine if it would stop pain in his ear and dizziness. He also states that his blood pressure was monitored, and he was given an EKG after the medicine was discontinued. Therefore, Gross cannot satisfy any element of his deliberate indifference claim against these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"pA9f\">Gross contends that after he filed grievance forms about his medical care, Dr. McKay retaliated against him by ordering Gross confined to isolation for six days in the mental health wing of the jail. \u201cA prisoner can establish retaliation by demonstrating that the prison official\u2019s actions were the result of his having filed a grievance concerning the conditions of his imprisonment.\u201d <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1248 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). To establish a retaliation claim, the prisoner must show that (1) his speech was constitutionally protected; (2) he suffered adverse action such that the jail official\u2019s allegedly retaliatory conduct would likely deter a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in such speech; and (3) there is a causal relationship between the retaliatory action and the protected speech. <em>Smith v. Mosley, </em>532 F.3d 1270, 1276 (11th Cir.2008). Here, Gross was not disciplined by jail officials. Instead, he admits that he was placed in the mental health wing in isolation so that his medical condition could be monitored. He also admits that a nurse came to his cell every day to check on him and to take his blood pressure. Dr. McKay also visited him and told him the specific date on which he would be returned to the general population of the jail. He was in fact returned to the general population on that day. At best Gross presented only conclu-sory allegations that McKay retaliated against him by placing him in isolation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (stating that the pleading standards set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 do \u201cnot unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions\u201d). The district court properly dismissed Gross\u2019 retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Gross contends that unnamed deputies violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment by subjecting him to cruel and unusual punishment while he was confined for six days in isolation. He asserts that the deputies shut off his water supply for the first thirty-six hours that he was in isolation, banged on his cell door, and left the lights on twenty-four hours a day. He also alleges that the communication device in his cell did not work, so he could not call for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Gross\u2019 complaints about the conditions of his confinement do not state a claim for a constitutional violation. We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">[T]he Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons. If prison conditions are merely restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society. Generally speaking, prison conditions rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation only when they involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\"><em>Chandler v. Crosby, </em>379 F.3d 1278, 1289 (11th Cir.2004) (citations and quotation marks omitted). To establish an Eighth Amendment claim based on conditions of confinement, an inmate must show that the conditions were \u201cextreme\u201d and that prison officials were deliberately indifferent in subjecting the inmate to those extreme conditions. <em>See id. </em>Gross has not alleged the kind of extreme deprivations required to establish an Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1298. Furthermore, Gross has not alleged that the unnamed deputies were deliberately indifferent to any substantial risk of serious harm to him. <em>See Bass v. Perrin, </em>170 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir.1999). He admits that while he remained in isolation in the mental health wing, he received meals and nurses checked his blood pressure daily. He spoke with medical staff and deputies. While Gross may have suffered some discomfort during his six days in isolated confinement, his specific allegations do not state a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Finally, Gross alleges that he told an unnamed deputy that he was having a heart attack on February 11, 2005 between 9:00 and 10:30 p.m., and the deputy ignored him. Gross placed a medical request form on his cell door, and the form stated that he was scared and needed to talk to a nurse \u201cfor peace of mind and heart\u201d because he was having pain behind his eyes and his left hand was getting numb. At that time, Gross did not specifically inform any deputy that he believed he was having a heart attack and that he needed immediate medical care for that serious medical condition. At 11:00 p.m. Gross was transported to the hospital where he received medical treatment. Gross\u2019 allegations do not show that any deputies were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs on February 11, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\">. The district court correctly noted that because Gross was a pretrial detainee at the time of the assault and medical treatment, his claims actually invoke the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process rather than the Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See Cottrell v. Caldwell, </em>85 F.3d 1480, 1490 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201cClaims involving the mistreatment of arrestees or pretrial detainees in custody are governed by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause instead of the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, which applies to such claims by convicted prisoners.\"). As the district court also observed, however, the distinction makes no difference in the analysis of Gross' claims. <em>Id. </em>(stating that \u201cthe applicable standard is the same, so decisional law involving prison inmates applies equally to cases involving arrestees or pretrial detainees\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-14\">. Because Gross is <em>pro se, </em>we liberally construe his argument. <em>See Lorisme v.
