He was sentenced to 121 months of imprisonment. He appeals the district court\u2019s grant of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence, which was based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019s base offense levels for crack cocaine. The district court reduced Dalco\u2019s sentence to 120 months, the low end of the amended guidelines range due to the statutory minimum sentence. We review the district court\u2019s determination on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">The district court could not have imposed a guidelines sentence that was lower than the statutorily mandated minimum penalty. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>527 F.3d 396, 411 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 212, 172 L.Ed.2d 157 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>528 F.3d 554, 559 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Accordingly, Dalco has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in granting his motion and reducing his sentence to 120 months. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-18\">Dalco concedes that there is no authority for the district court to have imposed a sentence below the statutory minimum, but he seeks to preserve the issue in the event of a change in the jurisprudence regarding the application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to defendants subject to mandatory minimum sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-19\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
