He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence because the investigatory stop was not justified by reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot, as required by <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Howard also contends that his consent to search the vehicle was not valid because it was tainted by the illegal detention.</p>\n<p id=\"ADW\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the legality of the investigatory stop de novo. <em>See United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 704 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>298 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.2002). Police officers are permitted to stop and briefly detain individuals \u201cif they have reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Goodson v. City of Corpus Christi, </em>202 F.3d 730, 736 (5th Cir.2000). Reasonable suspicion must be based on <em>\u201c </em>\u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Webster, </em>162 F.3d 308, 332 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868).</p>\n<p id=\"A8b\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, we find that the officer\u2019s suspicion that criminal activity was afoot was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Grant, </em>349 F.3d 192, 197 (5th Cir.2003). In the early morning hours when all nearby businesses were closed, Detective Ainsworth observed Howard driving slowly in circuitous routes near a closed theater that had recently been burglarized. Howard appeared as though he was attempting to evade Detective Ainsworth and committed traffic violations in his efforts. Additionally, the events occurred in a narcotics trafficking area. These facts objectively provided reasonable suspicion for the stop. <em>See Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000); <em>Goodson, </em>202 F.3d at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"AzL\">Because the investigatory stop was constitutional, it is unnecessary to address Howard\u2019s challenge to the validity of the consent. His argument is based solely on the alleged unconstitutionality of the detention. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ah1\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
