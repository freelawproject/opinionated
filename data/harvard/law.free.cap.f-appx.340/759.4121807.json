For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">In August 1998, Bryce was sentenced to concurrent terms of 124 months of imprisonment based on federal convictions for conspiracy to distribute, and possession with intent to distribute, cocaine. Bryce appealed, and while his appeal was pending, he was indicted for murdering the prosecution\u2019s confidential informant in his drug case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury found Bryce not guilty of the murder. Thereafter, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \u201creverse[d] Bryce\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute and distribution (Count Two), affirm[ed] the district court\u2019s judgment as to Bryce\u2019s conspiracy conviction (Count One), and remand[ed] for resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bryce, </em>208 F.3d 346, 356 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">A hearing was held pursuant to the remand, after which the district court judge, using a preponderance of the evidence standard, found that Bryce had murdered the confidential informant. The district court judge used that conduct to increase Bryce\u2019s offense level for sentencing purposes, and thereafter increased Bryce\u2019s sentence on the conspiracy conviction from 124 months to 240 months of imprisonment. The Second Circuit affirmed. Bryce then filed an unsuccessful motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. His request to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">Bryce filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition in January 2009, challenging the sentencing enhancement on his conspiracy conviction following the Second Circuit\u2019s remand. The District Court concluded that Bryce \u201chas not demonstrated that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. Bryce appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Having granted Bryce leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we must dismiss his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it is frivolous, i.e., if it has no arguable basis in law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Our review of the District Court\u2019s decision dismissing Bryce\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is plenary. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">For substantially the reasons given by the District Court, we conclude that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over Bryce\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. The presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence is a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002); <em>see also Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). Nothing in the record or the arguments put forth in his notice of appeal suggests that Bryce\u2019s case fits within the narrow class of circumstances where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or ineffective to challenge his conviction or sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On that point, we emphasize that lack of success in a previous \u00a7 2255 motion does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Accordingly, because this appeal presents no arguable legal issue, we will dismiss it pursuant to. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\">. \u201cThe murder case went to trial, with [Bryce] taking the stand ... Bryce admitted his involvement in cocaine trafficking (which he had denied during the drug case trial), but denied killing [the confidential informant'].\u201d <em>United States v. Bryce, </em>287 F.3d 249, 252 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-16\">. In fact, every case cited by Biyce either counters his assertion that he is entitled to use \u00a7 2241 to collaterally attack his sentence, or does not concern the issues relevant to his appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
