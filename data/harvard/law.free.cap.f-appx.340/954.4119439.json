The district court denied Walton leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Walton is challenging that certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into Walton\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Harvard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">Because neither Walton\u2019s IFP motion nor his brief in support of his IFP motion address the reasons for the district court\u2019s certification decision or the basis of the district court\u2019s dismissal, it is the same as if he had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Walton has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Accordingly, Walton\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, his appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-16\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Walton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Walton that once he accumulates three strikes, he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
