This appeal arises from the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of Curtis\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 after Curtis failed to reply to the respondent\u2019s summary judgment motion within 30 days. Curtis argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his petition for want of prosecution because his delay in filing the ordered response was not attributable to either purposeful delay or willful disobedience.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-27\">A district court has the authority to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute or for failure to comply with any court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). The court possesses the inherent authority to dismiss the action <em>sua sponte </em>in the absence of a motion by the defendant. <em>Martinez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 769, 772 (5th Cir.1997). The dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 41(b) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>McCullough v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 1126, 1127 (5th Cir.1988). A dismissal without prejudice generally does not operate as an adjudication on the merits; however, where the applicable statute of limitations probably bars further litigation, the district court\u2019s dismissal should be reviewed as if the dismissal had been with prejudice. <em>Gray v. Fid. Acceptance Corp., </em>634 F.2d 226, 227 (5th Cir.1981); Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 41(b). The parties agree that Curtis\u2019s statute of limitations period expired during the pendency of his habeas proceedings and that the district court\u2019s dismissal should be properly viewed as a dismissal with prejudice. We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">A dismissal with prejudice is an extreme sanction that deprives the petitioner of the opportunity to pursue his claim further. <em>Millan, v. USAA Gen. Indem. Co., </em>546 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Gray, </em>634 F.2d at 227. Consequently, district courts have limited discretion to dismiss a claim with prejudice, and this court will affirm such a dismissal only where the history of the case indicates both (1) a clear record of purposeful delay or contumacious conduct by the petitioner and (2) an express determination that the best interests of justice would not be better served by lesser sanctions. <em>Millan, </em>546 F.3d at 326; <em>Long v. Simmons, </em>77 F.3d 878, 880 (5th Cir.1996). In addition, when affirming dismissals with prejudice, this court has usually found at least one of three aggravating factors which include (1) the extent to which the plaintiff, not his attorney, was personally responsible for the delay, (2) the degree of actual prejudice to the defendant, and (3) whether the delay was caused by intentional conduct. <em>Millan, </em>546 F.3d at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">There is not a clear record of purposeful delay or contumacious conduct by Curtis. This court\u2019s cases have recognized that a delay warranting dismissal with prejudice must be longer than a few months and is characterized by \u201c \u2018significant periods of total inactivity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id,, </em>at 326-27 (citing <em>McNeal v. Papasan, </em>842 F.2d 787, 791 (5th Cir.1988)); <em>John v. Louisiana, </em>828 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir.1987). In fact, dismissals with prejudice have generally been reserved for \u201c \u2018egregious and sometimes outrageous delays.\u2019 \u201d <em>Millan, </em>546 F.3d at 327 (quoting <em>Rogers v. Kroger Co., </em>669 F.2d 317, 321 (5th Cir.1982)). A delay of less than 45 days passed between the filing of the summary judgment motion on March 22, 2007, and the dismissal of the action on May 4, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Moreover, a party\u2019s negligence-regardless of how careless or inconsiderate-does not make conduct contumacious; \u201cinstead it is the stubborn resistance to authority which justifies a dismissal with prejudice.\u201d <em>Millan, </em>546 F.3d at 327. Curtis asserts that his untimely response was attributable to the lockdown of his prison unit, which left him with no legal aid or legal supplies. Although it might have been unreasonable or imprudent for Curtis to assume that the lockdown excused his timely compliance with the district court\u2019s order to file a response to the summary judgment motion, the omission was \u201cmore a matter of negligence than purposeful delay or contumaciousness.\u201d <em>Morris v. Ocean Sys., Inc., </em>730 F.2d 248, 252 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Furthermore, this court has generally held that the district court abuses its discretion when it dismisses a case with prejudice where the petitioner \u201cfail[s] only to comply with a few court orders.\u201d <em>Berry v. CIGNA/RSI-CIGNA, </em>975 F.2d 1188, 1192 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>&amp; n. 6 (5th Cir.1992) (citing cases). The failur\u00e9 to reply to the respondent\u2019s summary judgment motion appears to be the only instance in which Curtis did not comply with the district court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In addition, the record is silent on whether the district court considered lesser sanctions and determined them to be futile. <em>See McNeal, </em>842 F.2d at 793-94. Also, none of the usual aggravating factors appear to be present in this case. <em>See Millan, </em>546 F.3d at 327. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Long, </em>77 F.3d at 880. The district court\u2019s judgment is hereby VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
