After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-26\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Brown\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amends. 706, 713. However, as a career offender, Brown\u2019s offense level was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). This Court concluded in <em>United, States v. Moore </em>that a crack cocaine defendant, like Brown, who was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. 541 F.3d at 1327-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Brown\u2019s argument that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009); <em>United States v.
