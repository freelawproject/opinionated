She argues that the district court erred by sentencing her above the applicable guideline range of 33-41 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). If, as in this case, a defendant does not challenge the procedural correctness of the sentence, this court may proceed to an examination of the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, <em>see United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008), under an abuse-of-discretion standard, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Lopez-Portillo de Cruz seems to concede that, because she did not object to the reasonableness of her sentence in the district court, review should be for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 390-92 (5th Cir.2007), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). Under either standard of review, Lopez-Portillo de Cruz is not entitled to relief. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">The district court imposed a non-guideline sentence above the guideline range. The selection of a non-guideline sentence is within that court\u2019s discretion. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. This court \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA non-Guideline sentence unreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">The district court determined that the sentence imposed was reasonable based on the length and scope of the alien smuggling conspiracy and the fact that Lopez-Portillo de Cruz had abused her husband\u2019s position as a border patrol agent to further the objectives of the conspiracy. These are proper sentencing considerations. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2). Further, the upward variance from the guideline maximum of 41 months to a sentence of 50 months is not unreasonable. This court has upheld considerably greater variances. <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 348-50 (variance from the guideline maximum of 51 months to a sentence of 180 months); <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530-32 (5th Cir.2008) (variance from the guideline maximum of 27 months to a sentence of 60 months); <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708-10 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Lopez-Portillo de Cruz has not shown that the court imposed an unreasonable sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>R. 47.5.4. published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
