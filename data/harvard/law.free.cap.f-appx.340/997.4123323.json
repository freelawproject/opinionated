Aj-pop contends only that the BIA erred in determining that he had not established entitlement to asylum and withholding of removal under the INA. (Restated, Ajpop has failed to brief any issues related to the BIA\u2019s rejection of his CAT claim. Accordingly, those issues are waived. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">A BIA decision that a petitioner is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the INA is upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994). The substantial-evidence standard mandates affirming the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cunless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion\u201d. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">The record reflects that the harm alleged by Ajpop, which may fairly be characterized as insults and threats made by individuals who did not act under official sanction, and whose dispute with Ajpop involved personal matters, is insufficient to establish the requisite past persecution. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 188, 190 (5th Cir.2004); <em>see also Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 792-93 (5th Cir.2004). Additionally, the record lacks \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [Ajpop] will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution\u201d if he is returned to Guatemala. <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Zulbeari v. INS, </em>963 F.2d 999, 1000 (7th Cir.1992)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">In the light of these factors, the BIA\u2019s decision concerning Ajpop\u2019s INA claims is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez, </em>78 F.3d at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
