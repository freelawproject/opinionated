Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-25\">Laor filed a habeas petition in the District Court in April 2008, challenging policies of the Federal Bureau of Prisons regarding pre-release custody, and seeking placement in pre-release custody. The respondents filed an answer in November 2008, and several months later informed the Court that Laor had been released to halfway house placement on March 24, 2009. Laor indicated his opposition to dismissal, but the District Court dismissed the petition as moot in an order entered on April 9, 2009. Laor filed a timely appeal and has submitted argument in support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>his appeal and in opposition to summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">A federal court may decide a case only if it presents an Article III case or controversy. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). A prisoner\u2019s challenge to the validity of his conviction or sentence satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement, because the incarceration is a concrete injury that may be redressed by invalidation of the conviction or sentence. <em>Demis v. Sniezek, </em>558 F.3d 508, 512 (6th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Spencer, </em>523 U.S. at 7, 118 S.Ct. 978). Once a prisoner\u2019s sentence has expired, however, he must demonstrate some concrete and continuing injury in order to maintain the suit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Laor argues that the District Court should have considered his petition on the merits instead of dismissing it as moot. He appears to argue that the District Court should have followed <em>Levine v. Apker, </em>455 F.3d 71 (2d Cir.2006), which found that a habeas petitioner\u2019s release into a community corrections center did not render moot his challenge to the timing of the release, as the sentencing court could, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), modify the length of the petitioner\u2019s term of supervised release as a result of a favorable ruling on the habeas petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Laor recognizes that this Court has rejected the reasoning of <em>Levine </em>in <em>Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 149 (3d Cir.2009), as we found that the likelihood that the sentencing court would grant relief affecting the term of a petitioner\u2019s supervised release was too speculative to constitute a \u201ccontinuing injury.\u201d Laor has not demonstrated any concrete and continuing injury or collateral consequence that remains now that he has been placed in halfway house confinement. We thus find that the District Court properly dismissed Laor\u2019s ha-beas petition as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. Laor notes that he was sentenced by a court within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
